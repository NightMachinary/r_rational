Honestly, I'd probably start with using polymorphic magic of whatever kind, as well as transfiguration (stuff to platinum should get a bit of money, though there are much better ways), to fulfill pretty much every hedonistic desire I have. Shouldn't take too long.

After that, try to nudge policy in a low-conflict direction, basically. Eliminate nuclear weapon stockpiles (not in a widely advertised manner) in the hands of regimes I don't trust (i.e. pretty much every non-western ones). Get Putin to self-destruct, just in case. Possibly create a mass hallucination in two or three ISIS locations to get them to radically alter their religious beliefs towards more peaceful ends.

After that, it's nudging different government to a) get increased funding for AI research and b) pass a few legislations I like.

And once that's done, basically back to hedonism. I can get everything I want with a flick of my finger, life isn't hard.
