hmm... so i have a large pool of dubious magics, undefined by canon. i have magic enough to be tied for most powerful wizard in combat, and i have transfiguration. presumably, i can cast every spell in canon, or very close. If transfiguration is permanant... use that to launder gold and other, more useful, raw materials. sell them, probably on the black market at first, or other places. eventually, upgrade to making them consistently.

If transfiguration can change one chemical into another, at any time i can cause massive devastation with FOOF or other explosive chemicals, in addition to standard combat techniques, for self defence.

I suspect I'll eventually accidentally commit suicide by chemical accident, but until then... I'll make money by turning something into something else.

Imperio has potential as well, as does aparation, but most techniques aren't that useful, at least not in HP canon. Edited in new ones after a good night's sleep: Cheering charms, now that i think about it, could make a reasonably effective depression-retardant, if they don't create a dependency.

While the limitations on portkeys are unknown, these are fanon ones that sound likely- (portkeys are two way- so i could create a portkey to mars, but i'd need to send it there. portkeys can only go to a destination you can visualize accurately- so portkeys don't work unless there's a highly functional map with excessive detail- how convenient that these things might exist.)

take a career making magical paintings, and paint at least four copies of myself. test for sentience, as well as memory retention. if this is the case, see if i can make magical cameras that make fully functional paintings, capable of interacting with the outside world. (photographs are clearly inferior to paintings in harry potter canon, they cannot talk, to start with. they might pass a turing test anyways, but it needs to be checked.) If not, upload my freinds and family anyways, but wait to upload anyone else, save the most useful- i might have more important things to do then add a few centuries to someone's life, and this isn't immortality- only the lifespan of a very well cared for painting.
