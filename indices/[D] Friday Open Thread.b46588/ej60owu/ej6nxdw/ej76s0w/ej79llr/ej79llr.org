When I first saw your form, I assumed you were just looking to collect positive examples, and since I couldn't think of any in my own life, so I didn't fill it out. Even now, I still don't see a clear way to indicate anything like "I can't think of any instance of a dramatic shift in thinking as a result of someone's small number of words."
