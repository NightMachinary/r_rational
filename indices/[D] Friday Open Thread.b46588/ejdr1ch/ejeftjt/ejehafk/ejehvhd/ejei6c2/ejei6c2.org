Just a little bit of info according to our already wealthy-and-disease-ending-crusader Bill Gates our biggest problem with Alzheimers is the following:

"The only problem where I don't yet see a clear path forward yet is how to develop more efficient ways to recruit patients for clinical trials. Without a simple and reliable diagnostic for Alzheimer's, it's hard to find eligible people early enough in the disease's progression who can participate in trials. It can take years to enroll enough patients. If we could find a way to pre-screen participants, we could start new trials more quickly.

But there is so much momentum in other areas---scientific tools, better diagnostics, improved access to data---that as long as we can solve the recruitment problem, I am confident that we will make substantial progress in the next decade or two."
