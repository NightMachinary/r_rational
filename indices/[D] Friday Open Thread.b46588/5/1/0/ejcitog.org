I'd say the pain is occasionally disruptive -- mostly when in the form of headaches that rob me of my ability to concentrate. I'd heard anecdotes of people who found their productivity to improve under cannabinoids, but yah my work generally requires a fair bit of clear headedness and careful thought. If I do end up trying it out, it'd certainly be on a provisional basis. Thank you for the response!
