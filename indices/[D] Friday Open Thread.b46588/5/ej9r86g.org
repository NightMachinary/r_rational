Has anyone here researched the use of cannabinoids for pain relief? I suffer from a bit of chronic pain (old injuries from adventure sports, occasional headaches, muscle strains from lifting, etc.) and have found conventional approaches ineffective (otc NSAIDs, various treatments recommended by physical therapists, neurologists, etc., both prescribed medications and stretches, exercises, icing/POLICE, acupuncture, etc.).

I'm curious about exploring the medicinal applications of e.g. CBD oil, or THC, or both, etc. There's a dispensary a few blocks from where I live (in CA), but I haven't gone in yet, mostly out of concern as to the federal illegality -- I attend a public university, and part of my funding (e.g. an NSF-GRF) comes from federal sources, and I'm concerned if they find out they'll pull it or something. IDK. It might not even be effective -- I tried marijuana a handful of times in ugrad (some friends I'd go e.g. backpacking/climbing/snowboarding/kayaking/etc. with would share theirs) and it did almost nothing for me, psychoactively. But I figure several years later it might be worth trying again?
