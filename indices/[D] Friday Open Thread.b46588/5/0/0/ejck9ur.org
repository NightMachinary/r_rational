Thank you for the thoughtful comment! Yah, I probably didn't partake in the stuff very competently back when (it'd have been in 2010-2011 at universities in Tennessee and New Zealand, so who knows what the quality was like, probably pretty poor?). Definitely tried to follow the instructions of my more experienced friends -- breathing in deeply and holding the smoke in my lungs -- but may have underperformed idk. Also ate a bunch of brownies once and felt a bit sleepy and tunnel-vision-y for a few hours.

Not living in any dorms, thankfully! but in an apartment off campus. So no worries on getting caught there, but we wouldn't want to smoke anything indoors regardless. I think our biggest concern is just getting found out, or something, and being made to pay back some of the free money we've been given (wife's also received, like, $300k+ in fellowships and stuff, which she'd need to pay back if she doesn't finish her program). We tried going into a dispensary once a year-ish back and they wanted to scan our driver's licenses so we ran away lol. The risk seems small, probability-wise, but multiplying by those large $ amounts still gives uncomfortably large expected losses. IDK how the process goes elsewhere -- maybe the local dispensary doesn't need to keep records of our identities?
