LOVE DEATHS + ROBOTS is pretty good, though I definitely wouldn't call it rational (and it objectifies women a little too much for something coming out in 2019).

It's a series of animated shorts, in different universes and graphic styles, going from ultra-stylized 2D to photorealistic 3D, exploring transhumanist concepts, in the most 18+ way possible (eg lots of gore and nudity). The story are fairly mature and some of them are memorable in a beautiful or haunting way.
