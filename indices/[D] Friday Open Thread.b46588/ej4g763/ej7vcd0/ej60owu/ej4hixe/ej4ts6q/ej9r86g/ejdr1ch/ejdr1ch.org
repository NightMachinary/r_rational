This is a bit of munchkinning for real life.

I work with dementia patients every day, and it's really striking home how /awful/ of a set of diseases it is. If I were to dedicate my life to ending dementia/old age, how would I best go about it?

I'm fairly intelligent (Usually in the top 5% of whatever I dedicate myself to, if the metrics are standardized and based around pattern recognition in some fashion) so I could at least contribute if I were to go the route of a scientist. I'm no prodigy or savant though, so I doubt I'd be able to make any historic breakthroughs.

However, I'm not sure that would be the best way to increase my utility. Would a politician whose goal is to end old age be more efficient via increasing funding of education and research?

Perhaps it'd be better to aim to create a utopia in other ways first (political revolution, ending world hunger etc.), and then have humanities goal of beating death simply be a knock on effect of that.

Thoughts?
