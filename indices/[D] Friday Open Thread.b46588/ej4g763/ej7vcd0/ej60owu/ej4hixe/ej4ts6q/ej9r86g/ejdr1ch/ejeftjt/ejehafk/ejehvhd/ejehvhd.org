Probably make money and invest in the right places. As one engineer you would only be able to do so much yourself. Other people want to achieve these goals too. Find them and give them the necessary resources. This is all much easier said than done but when we are comparing it to creating utopias and shaping governments I think making money and investing would be more efficient.
