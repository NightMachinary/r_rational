  Has anyone here researched the use of cannabinoids for pain relief?
#+end_quote

Yes, and from what I've read CBD seems legit for pain management. However, I'd vote for "worth trying whole herb again."

  I tried marijuana a handful of times in ugrad... and it did almost nothing for me, psychoactively.

The first time I smoked, I sincerely believed it wasn't having any real effect on me, in spite of perceptual distortions. I was sitting on a couch in someone's dorm, and the opposite wall seemed to pull in closer and the room seemed to have elongated from side to side in my peripheral vision. Later on when we were in the car, it felt like we were driving at an incredibly high speed. The speedometer disagreed with me, and said we were actually travelling about 5mph below the speed limit. I became convinced that the guy driving the car had secretly switched around the numbers for "miles per hour" and "kilometers per hour" so he could speed without other people in the car knowing it, even though that's completely backwards and even if it weren't backwards it'd still be ridiculous. And yet I was convinced that smoking did almost nothing for me, psychoactively.

Feeling like you don't feel anything the first time you smoke is apparently a fairly common phenomenon. If you tried it a "handful" of times, you could've had a few "first time" experiences if there was enough time between each session. Or you could've been not breathing it down deep into your lungs correctly or not holding it in for at least a full 10 seconds, or it could've been dirt weed (doubtful if we're talking about college in Cali), or any number of things.

If you're specifically looking for pain relief, CBD is worth exploring. The whole herb might be better, but with your history of never having smoked multiple times a day every day for an extended period of time, you might not be able to keep it together in public, not off the potency I expect you'd get from a dispensary in California. Edibles are a good option if you're concerned about the smell getting you caught, but edibles will sneak up on you and thoroughly incapacitate you if you don't know what you're doing, they take a very long time to kick in so some people think they need to eat more because it didn't start working immediately, don't do that, it can take anywhere from 45 minutes to two and a half hours after consumption to begin feeling anything at all, it isn't unheard of for it to take six hours to kick in depending on what you've eaten and when you ate it, and when it /does/ kick in it'll be stronger than smoking an equivalent amount of herb.

Yeah, you might get kicked out if you get caught smoking in the dorms. But half the guys on my floor freshman year all smoked, my roommate wasn't a smoker so I never smoked in /my/ room, but about a third of the guys on my floor all spent a lot of time hanging out in the floor's common room and we'd all go into people's rooms and smoke and play Halo 3 or whatever. You just get a towel and stuff it against the bottom of the door and open the window and stick a fan in the window (hopefully it's obvious that the fan should be pointing /out/) and set the fan on its highest speed and cut some holes in the bottom of a plastic soda bottle and stuff the bottle full of dryer sheets and exhale through that instead of just out into the air, preferably blowing towards the window while near the window so you don't blow dryer sheet chemicals all out into the air you're breathing, even more preferably blowing directly into the fan. I used to keep a callus on my thumb from covering the bowl/pipe so it'd stop burning and releasing smoke into the room. I think most of the other guys did too. Good times.

+I don't recommend doing any of that if you have a nosy goody two-shoes living in the room next door+ Actually, as a disclaimer of liability, officially I don't recommend doing any of that at all regardless of circumstances, and officially I actively recommend against doing it. But if you /were/ to do it, that's how it'd be done. The "bottle full of dryer sheets" thing is called a "sploof" btw.

TLDR: CBD isn't gonna get you kicked out of college. Just run the experiment, try taking it every day for a week and at the end of the week take stock of whether or not you feel better. If you feel like it's helping, then keep taking it, and consider upgrading to CBD oil that also contains THC. If you feel like it's not helping, then consider running the experiment again with CBD oil that also contains THC. Do a little bit of research, don't buy hemp oil.
