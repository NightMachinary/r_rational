  Every woman is a prostitute
#+end_quote

- the woman from "Sonnie's Edge" was a cage fighter,
- from "The Witness", a strip dancer
- from "Suits", tower defenders / mecha operators / generic background\\
- from "Beyond the Aquila Rift", an eldritch alien in disguise (let's count as "n/a")
- from "Good Hunting", a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huli_jing][Chinese mythological creature]] that can entice men.
- from "Helping Hand", an astronaut
- from "Lucky 13", a military pilot
- from "Zima Blue", a journalist
- from "Blind Spot", a truck pirate / hijacker
- from "Ice Age", a girlfriend.

Even if we count the assassin from "Sonnie's Edge", the main character from "The Witness", and the huli jing from "Good Hunting" as positive matches and make an excuse for hyperboles, that's still far from making "every woman is a prostitute" a fair description of these series.

And I feel this is even less accurate: from all the episodes I can remember rapists only in the mentioned background of "Sonnie's Edge", and in the "Good Hunting" --- and that story was more a criticism against [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Hong_Kong][colonial Britain]] than men in general. I couldn't find any sources for judging how accurate this criticism was. I know [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_women]["comfort women"]] were a thing during /Japanese/ occupation, but nothing about abuse perpetrated while it was under British rule.
