Yeah, the gender roles in this series feel like something that was written in early 2000s. Every woman is a prostitute, every man is a rapist; women are supposed to be desired, men are supposed to act on that desire, etc.

I think it would have been more interesting and surprising if the honeypot had been a guy, and the rich aristocrat a lady, for instance.

Some episodes felt like they would have worked a lot better as PG-13, but felt compelled to add some nudity/gore to fit in the series. (especially the yogurt one)
