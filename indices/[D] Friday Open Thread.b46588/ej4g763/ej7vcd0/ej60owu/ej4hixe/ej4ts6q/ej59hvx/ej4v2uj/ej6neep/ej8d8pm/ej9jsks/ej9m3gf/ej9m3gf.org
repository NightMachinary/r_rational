Well, you didn't mention a provision in your previous comment about the episodes being sex-related. Besides that, "aggressor" and "rapist" aren't the same thing either. And even the "features men as aggressors" isn't entirely correct.

In "Sonnie's Edge", from the on-screen characters, only the mafia boss and the cage fighter can be described as aggressors (which is rather congruent with their characters), while her male friend from her team isn't. In "The Witness" both the male and female are unintentional aggressors, as we come to see. In "Sucker of Souls" the only character from the whole bunch that can be described as an aggressor is the centuries-old monster, so the analysis is still grossly inaccurate. I have already discussed "Good Hunting" in my previous comment (though there too, the main character is a male and plays the role of a defender), and "The Dump" only features 3 characters, all of whom male, and only 1 of whom an aggressor. And so on and so forth.

So my earlier comment stands --- your description of the series is inaccurate and is picking and choosing data points to make them comply with your narrative.

  the series is at its best when it's not trying so hard to get its 18+ rating.

Yeah, the 18+ did feel shoehorned in.

#+begin_quote
  objectifying / "women as objects of desire"
#+end_quote

What do you mean by this word, and why do you think it is bad by itself?
