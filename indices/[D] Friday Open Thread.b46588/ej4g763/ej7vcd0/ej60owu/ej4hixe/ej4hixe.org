Devil May Cry 5 is a really really good videogame. It isn't rational or rationalist in pretty much any way, but it's not trying to be - it's all about ridiculously over-the-top stylish action, larger-than-life characters, and an incoherent rule-of-cool setting. But it's a really good game for a series that was desperately in need of a new entry, and the game is just fun as hell. It has two returning characters from earlier entries in the series (Dante and Nero) and a new playable character in V, who is bizzare to control but still quite fun. V walks around being goth as fuck and reads William Blake's poetry constantly - there is an entire 'make V read poetry' /button/ in his controls - while his pet Shadow and Griffin and Nightmare fight controlled by him, and he then teleports around finishing enemies off. Nero in this entry has a robot hand that hot-swaps with different attachments including a rocket arm that flies around punching people and that you can ride on. Dante uses a motorcycle as a weapon. I can't say enough good things about Devil May Cry 5, and overall if you like e.g. Platinum Games style action games (e.g. Bayonetta, Nier Automata, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance) or any of the earlier Devil May Cry games, then this title is worth checking out.
