Given two mostly identical works of fiction, differing only in protagonist's gender and all the effects and subplots arising from this, I'd likely choose one where MC is female. Probably for the same reason that "cute girls doing things" is a popular (mostly-)anime genre. I believe same principle applies when one is a writer.
