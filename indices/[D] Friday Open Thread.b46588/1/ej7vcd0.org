Maybe it has already been mentioned (sorry!!): I just noticed that the top six works at [[https://topwebficiton.com][topwebficiton.com]] have female protagonists:

1. a practical guide to evil by erraticerrata
2. ward by wildbow
3. metaworld chronicles by wutosama
4. the wandering inn by pirateaba
5. forge of destiny by yrsillar
6. worm by wildbow

Admittedly #5 is new, but remaining entries are solid, dominating the top-5 for the past year.

Moreover, there's less stability in the lower 6-20 positions, and I haven't read all, but I'm almost certain they are ~90% male protagonist.

Does it mean anything? Probably not. It is funny though. (for me.)
