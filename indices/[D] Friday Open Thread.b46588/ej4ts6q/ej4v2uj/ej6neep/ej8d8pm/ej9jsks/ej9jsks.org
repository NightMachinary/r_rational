Not all the episodes are remotely related to sex, though. In those where sexuality is mentioned or is the subject of the story, (Sonnie's Edge, The Witness, Sucker of Souls, Aquila Rift, Good Hunting, Shape-Shifters, The Dump, Blind Spot, Alternate History):

- Sonnie's Edge, The Witness, Good Hunting, The Dump, Alternate History features men as aggressors and/or women as objects of desire when it comes to sexuality.

- Sucker of Souls, Shape-Shifters and Blind Spot are mostly neutral, with some dirty military humor that sometimes fits the above pattern, but I'm not counting it.

- I'd count Aquila Rift as borderline, because it revolves around a female-coded character manipulating a male character with sex, but it didn't feel as objectifying as eg Sonnie's Edge (where the only female character that doesn't walk around with her breasts out is the rape survivor).

If you count all the episodes like Suits and Lucky 13 where sex isn't brought up at all, then yeah, the series fares much better. And actually, I'd say the series is at its best when it's not trying so hard to get its 18+ rating.
