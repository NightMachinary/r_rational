I thought it was mostly ok, but kind of a waste. I don't tend to like anthologies, though.

Here's my ranking of the shorts:

Pretty cool: Zima Blue, The Secret War, When the yogurt took over

Pretty okay: Lucky 13, Three Robots, Ice Age

Bad: Suits(awful dialogue), Sucker of Souls(just blergh), Alternate Histories(trite, unfunny), The Witness(bad despite the great visuals)
