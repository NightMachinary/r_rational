  Framing - hell even lying to others - has nothing to do with the concept of “the beautiful lie”.

I know that. The last two sentences in my comment say literally exactly that.

I misread your comment as encouraging accepting that framing yourself, rather than merely using it with others. Calling one thing the wrong lesson to take and then putting forward an alternative thing kind of suggests an endorsement of the alternative as the right lesson to take.
