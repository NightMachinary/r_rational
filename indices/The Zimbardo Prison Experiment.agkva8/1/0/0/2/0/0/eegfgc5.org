  [[/u/lolbifrons]]' post read to me along the same lines as "you can't just tell people that some people are more intelligent than others; saying that everyone is equally likely to succeed academically encourages better habits."

  It may be that 'intelligence' is ultimately a flexible definition, but fundamentally there is an object-level thing that it's talking about and that thing is not equally distributed. The same goes for those features that make up goodness. and refusing to talk about themm isn't just a disagreement about definitions.

Hm. If I had to raise an objection to that analogy, it's that "everyone is equally likely to" is a precise, falsifiable claim. Compare "You don't have to be very intelligent to succeed academically". It's much closer to the original statement, I think, in that it implies two categories of people - "good" versus "bad" people in one case and "very intelligent" versus "less than very intelligent" people in the other - without specifying at all where the line is drawn.

This is abstract, of course, and doesn't necessarily have bearing on the merit of the particular comment we're dissecting. I'm mostly here to make general claims about definitions and falsehoods, so I'll cede any object-level points in that regard.
