In general, image management, spin, framing and rhetoric work on humans. Obviously if you're nothing but spin, you're going to develop a reputation for being sleazy and that's not winning.

But if you don't do these things at all you will be outperformed by people who do them to a calibrated extent.

As a general rule, if you don't exercise control over [x], you can be outperformed with respect to [x].

In this case, [x] is “how you come across to others.”

I'm not saying backstab people. I'm not saying be untrustworthy. I'm saying that being anal about being always strictly correct will limit your ability to fit your social solutions to the shape of the problem.

Unfortunately most people don't become convinced of things with a well formulated cost/benefit analysis. Try running for office with just that and see where it gets you.

This is a case of playing with the hand you have, not the hand you wish you had.
