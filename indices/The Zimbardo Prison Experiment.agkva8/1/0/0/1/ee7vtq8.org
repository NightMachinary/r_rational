> Not every German at the time was a Nazi, and there were certainly no-scarequotes-needed Good Germans of the time, just as the people running the gas chambers were most certainly bad.

​

This might be pedantic but from what I read in Man's Search for Meaning, the nazis actually made other jewish people take care of the gas chambers and such. So more like bad people coercing the bad morally inclined or easily manipulated people into doing evil than anything else.

​

IIRC there was this sort of class system where the 'evil' slave jewish guards were treated better, and the good people suffering on the hands of both the guards and the nazi administration.
