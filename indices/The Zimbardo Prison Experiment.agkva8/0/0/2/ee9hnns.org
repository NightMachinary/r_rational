Although I agree with your point, I'll that this is dependant of your ability to extract these informations. I am for example quite oblivious to many facial and tone cues that might be dead giveaway to someone else (example : I might detect sarcasm based on context but rarely with tone alone) . Also I am on purpose trying to not consider differently sex, age, race etc. This might be wishful thinking but I think this doesn't come to my attention unless directly relevant to the point of the discussion. On the other end, as a developer I tend to more carefully ponder choices of words, sentence complexity and structure, proper use of grammar etc. To me there is no way words convey less than 80% of meaning.
