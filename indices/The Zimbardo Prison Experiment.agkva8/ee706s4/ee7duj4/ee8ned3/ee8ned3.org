The second you say to yourself, "it may not be strictly true, but", and let the beautiful lie inside your mind, you've already lost.

In this case it's not a lie, it's the actual literal truth, provided you define goodness as the tendency to do the right thing when actually correct in your understanding of things. Don't confuse saying the truth eloquently, lying to others, and lying to yourself. They're all very different things.
