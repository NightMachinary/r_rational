“bad people everywhere” is not the best lesson to take from the third reich, because it implies it can't happen to “good” people, and no one thinks they're bad people.

It may not be strictly true, but framing it as “good people can get caught up in bad things if they aren't careful” encourages more vigilance and self-reflection.
