I agree. Most people are perfectly capable of doing horrible things if the social context pressures them into it or straight up normalizes it.

If you have time to read only one book on this topic, I urge you to read Christopher Browning's '[[https://www.amazon.com/Ordinary-Men-Reserve-Battalion-Solution/dp/0060995068][Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland]]'.
