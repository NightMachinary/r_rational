There's a lot of nonverbal information we get during conversation, but there's only a finite amount of information people will glean from your body language. If you converted it all into words, it would likely be a few thousand words, max. So it looks like for short conversations your best information-transfer speed is to talk in person, but there's some point where the speed increase from reading makes it much faster to write down everything and send it in an email.
