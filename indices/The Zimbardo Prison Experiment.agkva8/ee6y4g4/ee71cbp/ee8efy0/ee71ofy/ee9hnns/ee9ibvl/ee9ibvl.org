Oh, yeah. I, too, will fail to extract most of the non-verbal meaning in a face-to-face discussion; and most of said non-text information is, in any case, (a) irrelevant to whichever discussion is at hand and (b) not what the person doing the communicating intended to communicate at that point in time in any case.

But just because I fail to extract it, or it's not immediately relevant, doesn't mean that the information isn't /there/.

If you're looking for the percentage of /intentionally conveyed and understood/ meaning, then I'd put text information at somewhere between 70% and 90% (with most of the rest taken up by things like gesture, tone of voice, and so on).
