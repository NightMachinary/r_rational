Iiiiiii dunno.

Compare speaking to me in person with reading these words. In person, there's a lot you can tell about me - my approximate age, my taste in clothing, my general health, how closely I am paying attention to whatever you're saying in return, certain information about my ancestors encoded in the colour of my skin, shape of my nose, etc., etc. None of this comes over in a pure text-based medium. Even little things like the lengths of the pauses in my speech, whether or not I'm looking you in the eyes, and how often I blink contain information.

Now, overall, that's a lot of information. To say that it's about fourteen times as much information as is contained within my spoken words - well, that stretches credulity, I will admit. But, at the same time, I know that a lot of this information passes me by; yet the fact that I do not recognise it, largely by virtue of not being Sherlock Holmes, does not mean that the information is not sent to me.

And the information on (say) gender, or state of health, despite not (usually) changing over the course of a conversation, is nonetheless being continually transmitted.

Of course, in the general case, the percentage of /intentionally/ conveyed information sent by words is probably more like 70-90% (with most of the remainder consisting of various gestures). And most of the unintentionally conveyed information is irrelevant to the topic under discussion, whatsoever that topic may be.
