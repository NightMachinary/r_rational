Well you could go deep and define information through entropy seeing two people as two systems and the communication as a protocol that helps to synchronize states between these two systems (reducing entropy or uncertainty). Then you could "measure" how much of the different channels of communication help to synchronize the state, e.g. words, tone, gestures...

But no need to go as deep here. Another analogy - people servers, communication - data transfer would work as well. Then the question is how much data gets transfered through different channels.

The easiest intuitive rebuttal of words = 7% of info (let's say on average) would be to imagine that the people communicate only with bla bla bla noises (hence tonality, gestures are there, words are gone). That is according to the theory 93% of information gets through... Well... :-)
