I get what you're saying, but I think you've missed my objection. [[/u/lolbifrons]]' post read to me along the same lines as "you can't just tell people that some people are more intelligent than others; saying that everyone is equally likely to succeed academically encourages better habits."

It may be that 'intelligence' is ultimately a flexible definition, but fundamentally there is an object-level thing that it's talking about and that thing is not equally distributed. The same goes for those features that make up goodness. and refusing to talk about them isn't just a disagreement about definitions.

As to your specific claim, I can well accept that some "people who under under the right circumstances may become Nazis" can be categorized as good, albeit starkly less on average than those who wouldn't, but I would certainly want to put the line somewhere well before "people who /are/ Nazis".
