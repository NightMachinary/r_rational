"Calling a spade a spade" only works when the concept of a spade is well-defined. The question if whether or not something is a spade is largely a question of fact - is it a stick with a flat end used for digging? While there's some definitional overlap with, say, shovels, there's no question of which one is the spade when comparing with a tree or a house.

"Bad person" versus "Good person" is not a question of fact, or if is, nobody can agree on which facts precisely are required. In the vast majority of cases, it's instead a question of /definition/, where we disagree on which categories we should sort things into. Definitions do not (in principle) imply facts about the world, and thus cannot be wrong, per se, only more or less useful. "Is Pluto a planet" doesn't have a truth value beyond what various astronomical conferences have decided, and neither before nor after it lost that status was anyone saying anything false when they (before) said that it was, or when (after) they said it wasn't.

As for this particular question, I would say it's defensible to include "people who under under the right circumstances may become Nazis" in the category "good people", if only because the "good people" category is already distorted in a lot of people to begin with, and absent the ability to solve that, we might as well warp adjacent categories to compensate.

(And if it weren't obvious, this is just a hack-job summary of /How an Algorithm Feels/ and /The Categories were Made for Man/, which make similar points a lot better)
