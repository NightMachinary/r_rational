Rationality has always been about winning over everything else.

It so happens that seeking truth over lying to yourself gives you more control over your own destiny.

But if you get better results out of occasionally misleading or manipulating /others/ than always /telling/ the truth no matter the context, doing the latter thing is not rational, it's just... well it's not even nice because often saying what you believe without a filter is rude.

I believe that part of being a good person is having safeguards against being pressured into doing evil, or defaulting to evil. But you don't get people to implement those safeguards by telling them “you're not a good person, here's how you become one.”

So I don't.
