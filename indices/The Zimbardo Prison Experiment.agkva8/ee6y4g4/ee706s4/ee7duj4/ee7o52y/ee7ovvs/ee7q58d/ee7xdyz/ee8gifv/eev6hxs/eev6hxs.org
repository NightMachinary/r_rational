As long as a person is actively and accurately making the distinction between "true" and "useful", I think they're already in a better position than most of the population. I, like most other self-identifying rationalists, value knowing a truth that will make me unhappy over believing a falsity that will make me happy, but I'm not above using inexact heuristics and useful conceits to accomplish my goals. It's just a matter of not deluding yourself with them and always supervising the situation to make sure they don't get out of control. In this way, conceits can be useful in a context other than "misleading others". (And don't forget that all heuristics are, by definition, conceits. They lead to biases, but they're undeniably useful.)

For example, there's the difference between utilitarianism and, for example, virtue ethics. Utilitarianism is objectively the correct way to make individual decisions most of the time, but virtue ethics is more useful from a collaborative and trust standpoint even if it would lead you to making "wrong" decisions in certain instances.

Many literary villains are cold-hearted utilitarians who feel justified causing misery to the few for the benefit of the many. Many Heroes, who most readers sympathize with, can't abide any intentionally-caused misery happening within their awareness, even if it was a byproduct of a greater good, so they pronounce the cause "Evil". Utilitarianism will often not make you many friends.

So, how do you decide if the cost of making wrong decisions sometimes by acting under virtue ethics or deontology is worth the resulting reputation effect and ability to "get things done" that it leads to by making you a "good person"? Utilitarian calculations, obviously. If they work out one way, act that way. If they work out the other, act the other. So, you could say that utilitarianism is "correct", but virtue ethics is an "often useful" conceit for accomplishing your utilitarian goals if they extend beyond a single instance of a dilemma.

"Good person" is far too loaded a term and, luckily, philosophy has progressed past the point where people constantly tried to define what it means to be one. Remember that words and labels are loose sets drawn around roughly adjacent things in thing-space. There are no necessary or sufficient conditions. That said, the words "good person" and "bad person", while often loaded, are still sometimes useful. It's just that whatever conclusion you draw will never be 100% true, so it's important to keep that in mind and never treat your "useful conceits" as "absolute truth".
