While I agree that this is a good method, the precedents it sets are worrisome. We should try to find a better solution to this problem.

​

It may also have negative effects as we can see in certain groups where people lash out, and get progressively more extreme because they feel the truth is being hidden from them or that they are being lied to, even if they are positive overhaul.

​

Also hiding the problem doesn't often fix it. You can't end racism by making them go underground, you just make them harder to find. Short term it's a good solution, I'm not so sure on the long term though..
