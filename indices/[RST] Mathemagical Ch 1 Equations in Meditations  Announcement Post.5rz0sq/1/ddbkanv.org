I like it so far, and am looking forward to seeing how it develops.

Thoughts so far (mostly about powergaming the ability)

- Further testing, range/mass. Implied to have no such limits. Short-term test, attempt to move Pluto. Long-term test, attempt to move Alpha Centauri, if Sarah is willing to wait 4 years for the results to arrive. Both tests would require
- Further testing, conditional limits. Does Sarah need to have line of sight to the object being moved? Does it need to be known to exist, or can there be more complicated conditions? For example, "Let L be the set of all blue cubes on the other side of the wall. Move all elements of L up 1 meter."
- Further testing, additional effects. First chapter implies that the power may be more general than just moving objects, being a method for applying functions onto reality, but that the operands of these functions must be at a human-level of understanding. Could, for example, the temperature of an object be modified, =f(T) = T+N=? Or affecting the probability of developing cancer, =f(p) = 0*p=?
- Permanency of effects. Kevin levitated a few inches, then fell. This implies that after an effect is applied, the normal physical processes revert.
- Sarah's background will play a role in which of these are most interested. She is mentioned to have quit grad school, but it is not mentioned which subject she is studying. Her commenting of "hacking physics" suggests that it is one of the physical sciences.
- Internal thoughts, morality. The first goal would be establishing limits of the power. The second would be creating appropriate restrictions to keep others from gaining the power. The more abstract the power is, the greater the restrictions necessary, but also the easier it is to establish restrictions. For example, =f(p) = 0*p=, where =p= is the probability of somebody independently discovering the power.
