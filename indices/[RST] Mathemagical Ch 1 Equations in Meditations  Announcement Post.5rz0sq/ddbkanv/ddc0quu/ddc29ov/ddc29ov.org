  You do not want to make it clear to everyone with a telescope that's no worse than yours that magic can move planets.

In the real world, if Pluto were to disappear, my first guess would be that it was gravitationally thrown out by an intruder from the Oort cloud. After all, Pluto hasn't cleared out its orbit of all debris, and it is difficult to track objects that far from the sun.

Now, granted, in-story, the prior for magic being able to move a planet is much greater than it is in real life, since magic has been shown to exist. That said, an increase in affected mass by 20 orders of magnitude (120 kg person to 1.2*10^{22} kg planet) would not be a reasonable first guess.

It is my attempt at using the same terminology as the chapter itself, using =f= as the function being applied onto reality.
