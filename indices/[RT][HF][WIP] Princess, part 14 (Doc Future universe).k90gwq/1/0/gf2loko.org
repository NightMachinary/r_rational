Oh, yes. And the administration that was covering up their abuses 8-). I originally wrote this in much more detail--but it just wasn't something she could safely discuss with Flicker at this point.

An earlier, non-canon version:

  "A more informative title would have been 'How to Blackmail Your Thesis Committee.'  Key elements were making sure they were lazy, incautious about reading things before signing them, and possessed an inability to even consider that someone my age and build might have things to teach them about unarmed combat, knives, pressure points, pain, fear, and how to mimic symptoms of food poisoning for long enough for paperwork to clear.  I did worry a bit about assuring an appropriately isolated room for my thesis offense.  I left out the followup on coercing the university adminstration because the methods section would have been awkward, I never intended to publish, and I already had my PhD.  And mostly it was just a matter of preparing thoroughly in advance and getting the timing right.  Certain types of people react very predictably if they think they can get away with concealing a problem.  No extraordinary means of mind control was needed."
  "Um.  How did the students you talked to feel about what happened?"
  "Well, I told them I didn't know about justice, but I would aim for making sure three particular problems were gone, and I would see if I could manage getting their student debt erased too, and I did quite a bit more in both areas.  It wasn't a situation to be happy about, although there was a certain amount of satisfaction when the provost was fired.  He'd told me I'd never work in academia, and I told him neither would he.  He was gone in a month."
