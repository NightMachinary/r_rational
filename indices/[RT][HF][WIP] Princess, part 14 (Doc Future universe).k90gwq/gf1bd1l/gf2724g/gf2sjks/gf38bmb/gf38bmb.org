I have considered it, and I just replied to the most recent post. There are potential issues, and maintaining chapters in more than one place is an administrative nightmare.

I've found nothing kills my motivation to write faster than having to worry about/struggle with website issues, and many web editors do not easily accomodate formatting I consider essential: Paragraphs start with an indented first line and have no extra lines in between, as in a physical book--otherwise short dialog exchanges take up nearly twice the space and the text is more difficult to read. I've had to use a hack on tumblr since they changed their editor that is not generalizeable, and I really don't want to post anywhere that requires reformatting every paragraph after I copy and paste the text from the original files. Keeping the posting process as painless as possible is a priority for continued creativity, and I am concentrating on that for now.
