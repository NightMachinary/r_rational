Additionally, from an algorithmic standpoint, base 2 makes more sense. Most algorithms split things into two: Binary Search, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, etc.. Sure, it's not directly related to how it's implemented on gate-level, but the point remains. Things in 2 are typically the simplest and thus how things are typically done, unless there's a strong reason otherwise.
