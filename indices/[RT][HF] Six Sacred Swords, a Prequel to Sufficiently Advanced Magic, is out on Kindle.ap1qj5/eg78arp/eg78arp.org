What amazing timing... I just finished reading books 1 and 2 a few days ago, and was looking for something new.

I've really enjoyed the world you've built. Characters are great, and the quippy dialogue works really well. I really enjoy the magic system, even if it's a bit convoluted, and would love to see more about what's happening to the other characters outside of the dungeons (eg, Jin basically didn't exist between the end of book 1 and the test in book 2, which I get is part of his attunement, but seems to happen to other plot elements too.. like what happened to his enchantments teacher teaching him how to use his magic sword?). Overall, pretty hard to put these books down once you start reading.

Now to change some work mana into payment mana and channel it from my left hip into the clicking attunement on my right hand
