Finished. Very nice and engaging and now I'm curious to see how everything continues, especially the arcane Ascension book 3!

It kind of felt too short, though, both because I finished it in barely a day and because it felt like not so much has happened. I'm way too used to million+ words webserials haha

Thank you, and let us know when the next book is released, since Amazon clearly won't!
