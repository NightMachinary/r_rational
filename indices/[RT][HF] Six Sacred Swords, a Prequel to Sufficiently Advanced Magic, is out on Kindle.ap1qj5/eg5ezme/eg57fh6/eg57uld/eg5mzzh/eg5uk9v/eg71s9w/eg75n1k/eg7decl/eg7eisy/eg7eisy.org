Awesome that you have that; authors don't typically have that as much as they should, imo. It's been quite awhile, though, since I read book 1. If we were chatting when book 2 first came out, then fine, but right now? A reread is probably a better idea.

In any case, I'm sure I'll enjoy the reread!
