I'm trying to get this recorded sooner, but it still really comes down to when my publisher can arrange for the narrator to record it. If believe they may already have a recording time booked for this one, but I don't know the exact details. When I get a better idea of the date, I'll try to post something on [[/r/climberscourt]] and/or my blog.
