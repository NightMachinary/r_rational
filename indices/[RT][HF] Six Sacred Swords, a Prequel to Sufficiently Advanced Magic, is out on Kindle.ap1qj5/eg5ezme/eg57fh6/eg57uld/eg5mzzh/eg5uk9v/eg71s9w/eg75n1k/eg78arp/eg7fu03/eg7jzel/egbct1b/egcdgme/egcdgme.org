  Finished. Very nice and engaging and now I'm curious to see how everything continues, especially the arcane Ascension book 3!
#+end_quote

Thanks for reading it! I'm already working on Arcane Ascension 3 a bit, but I have some other stuff I need to finish first, like my third War of Broken Mirrors book.

  It kind of felt too short, though, both because I finished it in barely a day and because it felt like not so much has happened. I'm way too used to million+ words webserials haha

Yeah, this one was more like a prologue/side story. I'm glad you still enjoyed it. The next one may be longer.

#+begin_quote
  Thank you, and let us know when the next book is released, since Amazon clearly won't!

I'll plan to keep doing that in the future, then. =)
