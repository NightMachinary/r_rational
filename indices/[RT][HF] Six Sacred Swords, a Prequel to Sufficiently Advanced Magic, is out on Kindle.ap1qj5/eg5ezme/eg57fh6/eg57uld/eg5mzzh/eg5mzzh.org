You said that it's a prequel to /Arcane Ascension/, so I assumed that it's just the one story set before the main series. But on Amazon the title is followed by (/Weapon and Wielders/ */Book 1/*). How many books are you planning to have in this series and in /Arcane Ascension/?

Also, I'm curious about why you have decided to have your books on Kindle Unlimited?

EDIT: Actually, how many books are planned for /The War of Broken Mirrors/ as well? And are you planning on making any more series set in this world?
