  Don't worry, it's not just you, there is never any notification from any of the authors I'm following and the new releases from them are not shown in the app homepage, just a mountain of "recommended for you" garbage.

Gotcha. Huh. Sounds like they just aren't doing much with that feature, then.

  Thank you! For now it's cool, though the use of "they" for Reika was really weird. Mais bon, English doesn't have gender neutral pronouns so you have to work with what you have.

Interestingly, singular they has been around for a long time. It's been used more or less constantly for centuries for situations where a gender is unknown, ("I couldn't read their writing").

Meriam Webster has some info on that [[https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they][here]], if you're interested.

With Reika, "they" is used until Keras figures out which pronouns are appropriate to use, although I do have some strictly agender and non-binary characters that use "they" pronouns consistently in other books.
