Don't worry, it's not just you, there is never any notification from any of the authors I'm following and the new releases from them are not shown in the app homepage, just a mountain of "recommended for you" garbage.

Thank you! For now it's cool, though the use of "they" for Reika was really weird. Usually most authors use "it" in those situations.
