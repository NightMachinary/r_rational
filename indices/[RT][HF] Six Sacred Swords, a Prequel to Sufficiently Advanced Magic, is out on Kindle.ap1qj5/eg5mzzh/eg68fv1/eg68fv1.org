  You said that it's a prequel to Arcane Ascension, so I assumed that it's just the one story set before the main series. But on Amazon the title is followed by (Weapon and Wielders Book 1). How many books are you planning to have in this series and in Arcane Ascension?
#+end_quote

This will be a series, but I don't have a set number yet. At least one more, possibly several.

Arcane Ascension is planned for six to seven books, but that may change.

  Also, I'm curious about why you have decided to have your books on Kindle Unlimited?
#+end_quote

It's both good for readers and extremely good for me, in my experience. Kindle Unlimited reads account for a huge number of my total "sales".

  EDIT: Actually, how many books are planned for The War of Broken Mirrors as well?
#+end_quote

That one is only three books in the series proper, but it will potentially spin off into other stuff.

#+begin_quote
  And are you planning on making any more series set in this world?
#+end_quote

Yes.
