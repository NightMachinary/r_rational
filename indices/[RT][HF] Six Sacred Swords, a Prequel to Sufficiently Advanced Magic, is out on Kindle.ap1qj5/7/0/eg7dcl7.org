Great timing, then! I hope you end up enjoying this one.

I've absolutely considered writing about what other characters are up to when Corin isn't watching them at some point. There's a lot going on off-screen, some of which is implied, like Corin hearing the tail end of a conversation between Sera and Keras, or Derek going out at night a lot without telling anyone where, or what happened in Sera's judgment, etc. Corin will eventually find out about /some/ of that stuff, but some of it may end up being better explored through other mediums.
