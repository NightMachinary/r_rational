Seeing as this has become a Harry Potter time travel fanfic recommendation thread, I figured I'd offer up /the/ quintessential Peggy Sue fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past.]] Most people are likely to know about this, seeing as it's the most popular Harry Potter fanfic on the site (the only thing more popular than HPMOR), but it's worth mentioning for those who haven't. It's not /completely/ rational, nor is it a crackfic, but it's still a very well-written Harry Potter fanfic.

Due warning: it's unfinished, and hasn't been updated in about a year and a half. The author updated his blog in January to say he's back to working on it, but there are still long gaps between updates, and he's working on another fanfic ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2731239/1/Team-8][Team 8,]] which is also the most popular Naruto fanfic on the site) simultaneously.
