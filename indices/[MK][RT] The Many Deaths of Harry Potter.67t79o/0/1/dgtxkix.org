I remember "Oh God Not Again!" really rubbing me the wrong way. It's fine when it's just being a crackfick, but sometimes it tries to have more serious moments, which at best feel like a pointless diversion from the wacky hi-jinks, and at worst feel like the author unsubtly pausing the narrative to air their grievances with canon.
