If we're going to have a repeating Harry, then here are my modest contributions:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651][Sisyphus]] - Harry gets another chance - and another and another. At some point, they stop feeling like chances at all. This is basically pure depression fuel, just to give a warning. Not nightmare, depression fuel just to be very clear.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/][Oh God Not Again!]] - So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN. Basically the anti-Sisyphus and recommended to be read for anyone who needs help coping with the previous recommendation.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] - The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. An endlessly looping Harry who turns to Voldemort out of desperation to stop the time loops.

- [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=6501][Getting the Hang of Thursdays]] - A good day goes bad and then gets far worse than Severus could ever have imagined. Again and again and again. Where it's Severus and Hermione stuck in a time loop and their relationship subverts fanfiction expectations in a novel way.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]] - At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field.

I have a few other stories about Harry traveling back in time, but I specifically only posted time looping stories.
