[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] is good, with a bit of suspension of disbelief, Sisyphus is just a short, rather good piece and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/][Oh God Not Again!]] is a classic of HP fanfiction - good execution. Still, that being said nowadays I think that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][The Unforgiving Minute]] has the best execution when it comes to the time travelling concept.
