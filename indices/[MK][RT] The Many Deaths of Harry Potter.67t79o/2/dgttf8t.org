My favorite Harry potter time travel fanfic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]]: Harry has been in a time loop for a very long time, trying to defeat a much more powerful Voldemort before he causes the apocalypse, but this time something new happens...

Almost complete departure from canon storyline, featuring great worldbuilding and a journey to Atlantis.
