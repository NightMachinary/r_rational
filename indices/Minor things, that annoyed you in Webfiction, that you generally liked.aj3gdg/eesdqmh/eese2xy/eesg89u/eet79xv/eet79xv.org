So I actually think this has value, as being able to file off those minor annoyances can be relatively low effort improvement to otherwise good works.

I found the same thing with worm, specifically wrt 'headspace.' Lots of unconnected people used it, and it's a pretty niche term in my experience.

There was a trend for differently colored text on SB/SV a while back (particularly in power rings / MTG fiction). It got painful fast. Invisitext also annoys me.

Obviously bad grammar and spelling can quickly put me off a work. I tend to ditch a work if it happens too much though, so hard to remember specific examples.

There have been a few translations where the translator inserts snarky comments. I appreciate the cultural notes and stuff, but I wish they would put them in the footnotes instead of in the text.
