I like [[https://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/16476/the-storm-king][The Storm King]], a slow burning and western take on cultivation.\\
There's lots of others I want to recommend, but a lack of rational-ness or the existance of 'grandpa's in rings' disqualifies them.\\
So I'll talk about my own story, [[https://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic][the Dao of Magic]] for a bit. The main character is thrown onto a medieval dungeon and dragons world after his ascension into a higher realm is blocked. Each artifact - except for a spatial ring containing some food - is built by his own hands and the tennants of science. Lot's of pseudo science, I'm sure, but least I try to reason out all that mystical mumbo jumbo instead of blaming 'endless streams of unfathomable power with an ancient air' without explaining what's really going on.\\
EDIT: No epubs, but I'm working on an endited version, it should come out soonâ„¢-ish.
