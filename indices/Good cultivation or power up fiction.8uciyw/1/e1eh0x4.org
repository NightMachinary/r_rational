The only xianxia story I've ever really liked is the forum quest *[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/forge-of-destiny-xianxia-quest.35583/][Forge of Destiny]]*. Ling Qi definitely does receive a fair amount of good fortune, but it is to a lesser extent than most xianxia, and she works damn hard to climb from the very bottom, supported by a voterbase that does a /lot/ of careful planning and math to ensure optimal resource usage. Very well-written too. Great setting.

Seconding /Worth the Candle/ and /White Collar Cultivator/, they are both good.
