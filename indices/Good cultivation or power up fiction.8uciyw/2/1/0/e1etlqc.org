A reference to the xianxia novel Coiling Dragon, where as a child the protagonist accidentally unlocks a ring that contains the ghost of a very powerful cultivator, who in turn teaches the protagonist. The cultivator calls himself Grandpa Doehring.

I think a few other xianxia novels may have also borrowed this plot point.
