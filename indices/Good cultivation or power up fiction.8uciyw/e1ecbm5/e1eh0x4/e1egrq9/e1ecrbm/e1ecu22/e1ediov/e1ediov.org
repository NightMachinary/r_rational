WCC is a forum quest style story. Protagonist is isekaied into a cultivator world to perform roles as a desk jockey, and tends to poke fun at the genre in general through desconstion habits. Great way of having non-cultivation readers and season readers introduced to cultivation tropes and worlds.

DoM is more a rational protagonist, applying a rational lens to cultivation. Also deconstructive in nature. The author posts them here occasionally. He can probably say something better. [[/u/WeirdWhirl]]
