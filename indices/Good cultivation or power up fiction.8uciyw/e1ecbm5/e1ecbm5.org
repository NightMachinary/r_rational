Assuming you mean Will Wight's Cradle series, while I enjoy it a lot, I would in no way call it rational fiction. There are no clearly defined rules (e.g. basically anything is possible through some special technique, with no clear limits or restrictions), the protagonist manages to skip a ton of the hard work through deus ex style interventions, bad guys frequently carry the idiot ball, and a lot of stuff seemingly only happens because the plot demands it.

All that being said, check out Worth the Candle. It's a SI portal fantasy where the protagonist is dropped into a world based on the tabletop universes he created on earth. He seemingly has a character sheet that he can view and progresses through the story while leveling up and gaining new skills. This is a terrible description but basically it's really well written, has great characters, and includes the kind of power up mechanic you are asking about (although it's more a slow burn and not the constant crazy ratcheting of power levels seen in things like Cradle)
