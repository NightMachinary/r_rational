I think the dot is from when a post is first posted, to obfuscate the early up/downvotes.

Imperio can be resisted with a strong enough opposed will. In canon even 14 year old Harry is basically immune to it after maybe 3 applications. Judging by Quirrel's overwhelming magical superiority to every other person ever shown, and with him knowing this spell in particular, I doubt he is vulnerable to it.

If it's a learned response, then you simply Imperio someone into Imperioing you over and over with very menial orders until you learn to break it. Then you Obliviate the person you forced to help.

Or, if you're Quirrel, likely just Avada Kedavra that person.
