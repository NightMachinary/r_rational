Good chapter, as always.

One question (which I put in a review, but I'll ask again here): As far as imprisoning Quirrel, doesn't Imperio take care of it? My impression of Imperio is that it allows long-term orders which the person will obey.

Separate question: when this story first went up, it had a dot in place of a karma score. Even after I upvoted it, it still had the dot. Now I see a '4' as people have been voting it; what was up with that dot?
