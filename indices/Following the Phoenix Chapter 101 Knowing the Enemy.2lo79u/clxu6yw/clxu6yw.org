But he's got to care about people on some level, otherwise why would he care if the Muggles wiped out the magical world?

He has a horcrux off the planet he has nothing to worry about. He doesn't only care about his own life otherwise he'd just trigger the nuclear war when he knows he personally is safe.

Not really relevant what his methods are if he's going to do them anyway.

Why doesn't Harry just do what he wants then resign from dictatorship in an extremely public way which will stop him ever being able to do it again?

Not "wanting" to conquer the Muggle world is hardly good rational, he wants to stop death, isn't that his ulterior goal? Seems like he's forgetting stuff by being bothered by having to do the day to day of ruling the world

Also I can't possibly agree that he "just gets cynical about it" someone who just sees someone doing wrong and just gets cynical would never have successfully (so far) set up this huge chain of events to checkmate Harry before he's even moved a pawn.
