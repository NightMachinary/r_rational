  I'm not sure how Obliviate interacts with a Horcrux,
#+end_quote

Well, Horcruxes (technically Horcruces, I suppose, but that sounds ridiculous) are all about the soul. Obliviate is about the mind, so I would /think/ that it would work. Only the author knows for sure, though.

  I'm not sure anything can actually get a dozen confundus charms through on Quirrel
#+end_quote

It should only take one Confundus charm, though -- once he's tagged with one, he's helpless and you can zap him as much as you want. Then you put him in prison and set up a squad to take it in turns zapping him every twenty minutes until forever.

As to how to get that first one through...yeah, that's a bit of a sticky wicket. Maybe if Dumbledore can pin him down, then a whole passel of Aurors could blast him. Getting him into a situation where that's possible is, of course, the trick.
