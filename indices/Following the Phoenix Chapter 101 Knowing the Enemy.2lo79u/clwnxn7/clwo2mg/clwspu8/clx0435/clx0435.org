False Memory Charms require as much time on the false memory as the actual memory would have taken to form. Replacing a day has a day cast time. You can't just give him a completely false life to change his personality without spending a literal life casting it.

In the HPMOR fic, this was why they didn't believe Hermoine had been false memory charmed to hate Malfoy after the fake duel, because making that charm would have taken subjective days to cast (unless, as Harry points out, you false memory charmed an image that gave you a reason to hate and then obliviated THAT three days later, making it seem like you had an irrational hatred for those three days).

I tentatively agree with the rest, but I'm not sure how Obliviate interacts with a Horcrux, and I'm not sure anything can actually get a dozen confundus charms through on Quirrel. He's been shown casually overpowering a hundred year old Dark Wizard hunter.
