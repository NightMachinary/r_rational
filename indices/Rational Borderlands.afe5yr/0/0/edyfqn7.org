  rationalizing the inherent zaniness of the setting would either require some absurd hand waving or some explanation of how 99% or Pandora's population ended up as violent sociopaths

That part isn't as hard as it sounds. The [[https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Borderlands#Story][backstory to the Borderlands games]] provides a future-dystopian corporate/libertarian baseline explaining that many of the residents of Pandora were brought there to begin with /because/ they were violent criminals.

Even given that, many of the characters in Borderlands seem uncommonly insane, so perhaps also throw in that the traces of [[https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Eridium][Eridium]] or some other substance in the atmosphere have psychosis-inducing effects on humans.

Now back to broader question of writing rational fiction in the universe, that sounds harder. On the one hand, the extremely gamified elements could be subject to some interesting munchkinning. But I think the more you try to strongman the setting to write rational fiction in it, the farther away you get from its intended craziness. I think the result would either be not very rational, or not very much like Borderlands.
