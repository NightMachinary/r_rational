A couple possible points of departure:

1 - The ability of the new-you stations to accurately re-instance a person depends on some limited resource; the more of this resource it spends, the more accurately the reproduction inherits your values and skills. (The player didn't notice this in-game because their bank account was always in proportion to their level i.e. how delicately tuned their skills were.)

The powerful, but disfigured and crazy, bandits are those who died a bunch when they had no money to their name, then "got better". They are aggressive because those who did not seek out and hoard resources are now beyond resurrection. Civilians cower in slums (mostly out of sight of the course of the story) - density limited by foraging - to avoid that sort of fate. The wildlife isn't actually that nasty; it is just that nearly everyone with combat experience is hung over.

2 - The new-you stations, designed for baseline humans, do fine with organic matter... but the modern adventurer (or street thug) is better described as nanotech in an organic matrix. For such critters the use of a new-you station imposes a steep cost to identity (best avoided by having the forethought to set up a 3rd-party backup) and a minor cost to power (best fixed with careful infusion of the missing species - or by the desperate by pointing at a suitable feedstock and wishing to be "more"...).

The bandits are those who died enough to stop caring about it; they may have made a few ill-advised feedstock choices along the way. They aren't really that common, but their numbers are slowly snowballing - you can't really kill them and they'll eat the bars of any cage you put them in. Civilians stay out of the way because of philosophical problems with re-instancing or just because they don't like the feeling of bullets going through their guts. The wildlife somehow **is** that nasty.
