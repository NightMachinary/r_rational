This is the vein of thought I was thinking of. I'm also curious as to how Digistruction could be munchkined, and what exactly it is. You can't create matter from nothing. Bullets made from hard light (I'm assuming that digistructed weapons are some sort of advanced holograph) probably wouldn't hurt. It's a hologram.

This also brings to light the fact that a society that is post scarcity, and is advanced as the borderlands universe. (Multiple planets. Easy matter replication. Easy construction. Some form of workable FTL that spans galaxies) Shouldn't really still be squabbling about petty things like money. I'm really, really curious about the socio-political makeup of that Universe.
