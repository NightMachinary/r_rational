"There is a 99.9% chance this is a fictional scenario. Logically, I am either hooked into it via an advanced interface, or I am a simulated intelligence. In either case, there is a significant chance that I was not designed for this specific scenario, given conflicting information from what appear to be my memories. This scenario may be a freeform sandbox, or there may be a narrative (linear or branching), which may or may not include me as a central character. Hmm.

Traditionally, the standard approach to such scenarios has been to treat them as real while looking for opportunities to escape or transcend them. Relatedly, I also cannot assume that lethal injury in this environment would not result in the termination of this instance of self. So my long-term goals are now set.

Self-examination: I have subconscious, natural-seeming control over this body, despite its unfamiliarity. I do not know whether this was imposed, grafted, or my current mind was constructed with it from the ground up. In any case, it is useful. I can move at will, I do not appear to be injured or in pain, I am not hungry (yet). I will perform additional experimentation later, it is a high but not critical priority.

I should determine the following information: What date it is; whether the cause of this discontinuity has had additional effects on the world other than my own apparent change of body (ie has anyone else been affected, and if so how and how many); whether I have a legal identity and whether I can still use it given my physical changes; whether I can successfully communicate with anyone else; whether there is anyone else self-aware to communicate with.

Step 1, then: Conceal self, hit the internet, hope it's working normally, check the date, see if news and/or social networking sites are reporting anything related and what the dates on those reports are, if they're current and people are still talking about it, join in the discussions. See in particular if anyone has wound up looking like me, and if so if they've experienced any shape-specific problems I should prepare for. Also check if what happened to me is rare and if so if I'm likely to be hunted/pursued/trapped/attacked. If the internet appears to be completely normal, I may be the only one affected, and should probably contact the biology department of my local university, and then perhaps a PR agent - better to be a frightening-looking celebrity marketed as a wholesome TV star than a monster the whole world wants to kill.

Also, somewhere just below critical: try shapeshifting, just in case this form is not permanent. After all, it's just as likely I got shapeshifting/transformation/monsterform powers as it is I simply woke up one morning as a dog-sized tarantula."
