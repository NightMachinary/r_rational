Go on computer google search to see if a. am i the only one or did this happen to a lot of people b. if no mentions of this online, look at passport\id etc. to make sure that what i think were my life until now are not me being crazy\having fake memories

If I conclude that this either happened to many other people, or that I actually was a different creature then I think I were then just go on with my day as usual, and be adaptive to what is apparently now real, possibly schedule appointment with a psychotherapist to make sure everything is ok with me.

Otherwise stay home for a few days to see if there are any mentions coming up, if they do then proceed as mentioned previously. If nothing comes up after a while(meaning i am the only "monster" on earth) then depending on the nature of my appearance either try to find ways to mask it, or move out to some secluded place and work from home the rest of my life.
