"Hello?"

"Mum?"

"[[/u/Chronophilia]]? Is that you? Your voice sounds different."

"Really? I suppose that makes sense."

"It's been a while since you last called. Are you all right?"

"No, not remotely. Listen, have you read the news today?"

"No. Why, what's wrong?"

"You really should check the news first-"

"If this affects you, I want to hear about it from you."

[pause]

"Okay. Well, for starters, I'm female now."

"... you're serious, aren't you? Well, I don't know what your father will think, but you know I still love you and I respect your life choices-"

"It wasn't a choice. I said "female", not "woman". Sex, not gender."

"[[/u/Chronophilia]], sweetie, I'm really starting to panic now and I'm not in the mood to argue about your terminology. Get to the point."

--------------

Repeat that conversation with slight variations about seven or eight times, to cover family, close friends, anyone else who needs to know about the change, and then proceeding to anyone I know with a background in biology/medicine, neuroscience/philosophy, and science fiction/transformation porn, in that order.

Then, cancel any appointments I have today, on grounds of the universe being completely bonkers. Get on the Internet - assuming it still works - and get some research done. Ignore the people who are just blindly guessing about nanotech, wizards, or aliens - look for those with evidence. If this has happened to enough people, it's possible that someone got caught on camera while transforming. The Event may have been while I was asleep, but that's the middle of the day in another timezone. Come to think of it, did it hit everyone at the same time, or was it spread out over some interval? Is it still ongoing?

Fill out any surveys of transformees I find, and ask for a copy of the results - perhaps there'll be some demographics that got hit harder than others. Also keep an eye out for anybody who predicted this ahead of time, or claims they could have. Anyone who correctly predicted what I thought was flatly impossible must be onto something.
