Having now read the story you're writing on this topic, I think you've already covered a lot of what I'd do with Fae. Particularly collecting everyone's original ages, genders, and miscellaneous personal data. (The only demographic oddity I can see is that there are a lot more English speakers than chance would suggest. And I'm assuming that's just for narrative convenience, so we don't have to spend half the story translating everything to Mandarin and back.)
