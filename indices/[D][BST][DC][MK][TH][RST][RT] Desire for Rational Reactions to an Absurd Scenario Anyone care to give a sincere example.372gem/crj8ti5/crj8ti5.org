[seeing that other people are posting narratives, let's try one that takes things in a completely different direction... something that's definitely a monster-girl but not a typical one]

The first one of me to wake is smarter than a dog, but nowhere near as smart as a human. It... she... rolls onto all fours, shakes, stretches, yawns, and... suddenly realizes that something is terribly wrong. She's surrounded by a number of wolf-like animals. More than she's really capable of counting. Screw it, call them wolves. She's a wolf, too. She's not SUPPOSED to be a wolf.

Panic. Yelling (barking, howling, strange sounds like a dog trying to speak in tongues, kinda scary really). Frantic nuzzling and maybe biting. The other animals are smaller than her, and she feels comfortably safe waking them, but she can't concentrate on more than that. She's in an enclosed space and while it seems familiar and safe she can't figure out how to get out. There's a thing on a part of the wall that's got something to do with getting out, but pawing at it does no good. There's some trick to it, but...

Door. It's a door. I'm conceptualizing. There's two more of me up now, waking up in a panic because wouldn't you be if someone was shouting "num shub wa ba me ne goo" at you and nipping your ear? One of me noses the bathroom door open but there's nowhere to go that way, there's no way we can get through the window. Who said that? Who said what, I was just thinking out loud.

Another one of me wakes, and his awareness pushes me over some kind of threshold. I'm a person, I've got a self, and suddenly it's me standing there on sixteen paws and trying to pull together the threads of my mind, talking to myself and nudging the last two of me awake.

"Hello?".

Good, I can talk in the outside world as well. It's... weird, but wait, that was two of me making sounds at once to make that work, and I knew how to do it. Well, that's no weirder than being able to handle six sets of eyes and paws at once.

"Hey, what are you doing?" One of me was sniffing my ... butt ... that's a bit doggy for me. Wait a second. "Back Off, Buster". But why not, you/I smell so good! Because I don't want puppies and your name's "Buster" now. But I wasn't... Be happy it wasn't "Asshole". But... GO TO SLEEP, BUSTER. Huh, he did. He's going to be a problem. There's a second male in my pack, but he's small and probably not mature yet, I got some time to get my sex drive under control.

Let's see, I'm/we are a pack of wolves, actual wolves, as near as I/we can see (oh, man, and we're probably color-blind, that sucks), not something wolf-like like in /A Fire Upon the Deep/. Female dominant... DEFINITELY not Buster's harem. Not yet, anyway, but if we're anything like a Tine pack I'll have to have puppies some time...

Man, what time is it anyway? Someone's going to come bugging us to walk the dogs pretty soon. I think I can beg off that. Heh. Unless this is a simulation, if that's the case my minds have been pretty heavily reprogrammed and we're really not the same person any more. Well, we're still me, it's just a different me.

Better think of myself as "me" not "us", I think. That's... huh... weird, I actually feel different when I think of "me" and when I think of "us".

"Hello? Computer? Interface? Prikazyvat interface? Arch?"

That last one is unlikely. Whatever was done to us... /me/... is way beyond Federation tech. OK, if it's a simulation it's not an obvious one.

Yeh. You do smell good.

Ack. /I/ smell good, thanks. Who was that... no... it's not "who was that". It's just me.

Well, let's see. No transducer patches. No obvious antennae. Hopefully whatever is coordinating the bits of my mind is biological because there's no way I'm going to be able to provide my puppies with implants. Note to self, get one of us... /me/... cat scanned.

Wonder how long my range is. Which of me looks most dog-like? Send that one out to see what else if going on in the neighborhood.

Hold on. Computer. Internet. Can I use my computer? Yes. Hunt and peck with one claw on each paw and a third paw on the mouse. Anything in the news...
