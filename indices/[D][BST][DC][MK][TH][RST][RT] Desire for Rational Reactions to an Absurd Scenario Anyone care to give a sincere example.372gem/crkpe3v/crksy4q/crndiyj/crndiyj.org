You're welcome. I just took to a bigger and worse place than how some transvestites feel. I mean, imagine being very religious, monotheistic, and then turning into what appears to be a demon.

Also, I saw a lot of other pieces that were: Explore body, explore internet, get on with life. I thought I'd take it to a bleaker place.

Good luck with your story!
