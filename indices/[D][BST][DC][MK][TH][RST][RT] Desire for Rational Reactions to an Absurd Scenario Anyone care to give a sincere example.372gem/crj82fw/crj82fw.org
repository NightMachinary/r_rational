“How do you even know you're a monster girl?” my friend asked. “Couldn't this be something different? This is all new, after all.”

He was giving me a hard time. It's how he deals with reality going insane. I didn't blame him. Yet.

“Well,” I said, picking at the spot on my hip where my torso met my...what, thorax?

See, that's something I had to look up on Wikipedia. I had the vague feeling spiders were different terminology from, say, ants. I didn't think that spiders had a thorax. Or was that ants? I wasn't an expert. I had two parts down there and eight legs, but not a second spider-head...face...thing.

Thankfully I was not in a hurry. People were freaking out, but after news reports about Obama's daughters turning into cat girls in public, along with the children of a couple of senators turning into various other new things, no one was really worried about black ops teams helicoptering around killing the newly mutated people. Calls for calm and national tolerance were fast and frequent, and the first few panicked mobs were put down without any bloodshed. On either side.

Cat girls have sharp claws and reflexes like...yeah.

So at least I felt safe enough to do some more casual exploration of my new condition.

I waved an arm at the general area of the world. “That's what everyone else was turned into, right? Monster girls? Why don't you think that's what I am?”

“Well. Uh.” He looked at my chest, then looked away again, fiddling with his smartphone. He didn't have a phobia. Thankfully. I was just a little hard to look at even to me.

“No breasts,” he said. “A complete and total lack of breasts.”

The people passing on the street were eying me, but that's what you'd expect given recent events. It was the city, though, so they didn't stick around---even though I was technically totally naked. It didn't affect them, and they had places to go. And I was not that interesting to look at, anyway. I didn't have huge, perky monster breasts, after all.

“Right,” I said, as if that were obvious, which it was. “But I think I'm a female spider. That's what I need you to look up. You know. With your human hands. What parts do I look for?”

Because that bit wasn't so clear. I had a lot of new parts. My many, many new feet, the ends of my new spidery legs, were covered in feathery claw-like hair pads. Also, horny claw-like claws. The pads were thick and far larger than I thought they should be, and my legs seemed short. I felt like my lower bits were a little squat.

My feet flexed against the sidewalk, gripping it tight. I resisted the temptation to jump up-and-down on him.

One reason I wasn't afraid to be out was that I was pretty sure I was bullet resistant. The “skin” below my waist was thickly armored, made of something that looked like but wasn't...chitin? Damn, I really needed to get this shit looked up. It was my body, after all.

It looked right but seemed more like some sort of advanced composite---and as it was helping to hold me up and was what my eight legs were made of too, I was pretty sure it wasn't spider standard material. I hadn't done the math, but normal spider-exoskeleton stuff wouldn't hold me up. I was pretty sure.

My body was the size of a horse now, from front legs to back, and covered in a fine layer of hair. Lots of hair, all over. If it seems like I'm harping on the hair, there's a reason. I couldn't feel my skin anymore, but I could feel them. Well, not them, but I could feel everything else now. The slightest movement of air around me. It was like a new super power.

I could also see really great, too. Mostly movement. Anything moving jumped out at me like I'd got some sort of aimbot running, but also distant objects seem sharper. I was higher off the ground and my new visual cortex-equivalent was doing distance calculations like a sniper scope. I always sucked at estimating sizes at a distance, but now---it all seemed to click. I knew how many iPhones wide the car down the block was. Exactly.

But I was having trouble with reading phones up close, my eyes refused to focus, and I couldn't fit in my apartment to use my desktop. Even if I thought I could work the keyboard...

I thought maybe I was a hunting spider, not a web spinner. Something about spiders usually having terrible eyesight tickled the back of my mind, but my eyes were crazy good and I thought that was a hint. Physically, my new eyes were huge and really far apart, so my improved senses seemed logical. There were eight of them. Some large, a couple smaller, and they were placed all around my slightly-flattened head like a crown of black buttons. I could see behind myself, too, though that side was a little blurry. But it was all in color, thank goodness.

As for other senses, my hearing was working okay, even if everything seems a little echoey, and it still seemed to be directional. No sense of taste per se, but I didn't really miss that one. There was something chemical I was detecting with both my head-mouth-things and also my legs (!!) that smelled like I remember smells smelling. It was weird but very sharp.

My front legs lifted almost unconsciously as I thought about this, and they waved around a bit. I thoguht I smelled another spider person, or at least something that smelled a little like I did. I “felt” like they weren't very close. A block away, at least. People---normal human people---were a little fuzzier, but I could smell everyone (human) inside the apartment almost well enough to count them. I could get used to this.

“Look, my point is, spiders don't have or need breasts,” I said. “So...I don't have them. That makes sense to me.”

He frowned at me, more fiddling with his phone. “Nothing about this makes sense. I'm not sure that follows.”

I shrugged with my mostly-human shoulders. My upper body was made of the same matte black material and hairs as the rest of me, in a roughly human-shaped torso. It was a little more bendy than my lower bits, more like human skin, so I still had good freedom of movement.

The less said about the current state of my face, face-adjacent-things, and weird pincer hands the better. Those hands and my eyes were why I couldn't look stuff up myself.

“Those slime girl- err, slime women?” My friend hesitates, looking at me again with a frown.

I shrugged at the possible issues related to the emerging terminology, trying to stay focused on the more concrete bits of what everyone was now laughably calling reality. “You know I don't care what you call me. Never have.”

“Nice. They do.”

“The slime women? Have breasts?” I clarified, refusing to have a Joss Whedon-esque conversation. “Yeah. But, no breasts here---I think that's because it's a mammals thing. The cat and cow forms are mammals, so they get human-like breasts. I guess. And I'm also guessing the more...amorphous forms are formed by their minds. And things like mermaids might have fish parts, but they are also defined as having human-specific bits.

“Maybe that's a part of whatever species they are. I'm not a spider with a human head stapled to it, I'm almost a complete spider with a human-like top half. Totally different thing. Maybe some people who've...changed have fully human tops, but it wouldn't make sense for them to have mixed human and spider parts for the human tops. Centaurs don't have horse heads, after all. Not in the popular myths, at least.”

“Hn,” he grunted. And then he really started thinking. At last. I could have bugged (ha!) him, but he was as smart as me and not currently in the mental place of someone who just woke up as a spider-centaur...thing.

I shook my head and sighed with the weird...slit-thing between my legs. It was like a set of bellows. A high-pitched whistling sound came out that seemed to annoy my friend. I'd been doing it a lot during that conversation.

I also had human lungs, which was how I could speak at all, and it seemed like I needed to keep both sets moving to keep living. Actually, I thought there were two sets down below, but I was trying not to think too hard about that until I had some Wiki-explanations to help ground the horror. Maybe someone would have written something about whatever I was by the time my friend stopped fucking around.

Wondering if the instincts that let me walk included wrapping him up in spider silk until he decided to stop flicking through Tumblr and actually look up spiders for me, I started tapping my feet impatiently.

Sure, your dashboard or whatever is on fire. I'm a spider monster.

Hmm. Did all spiders even have silk? I'd know if I could use a computer. I really needed to get online. I was getting withdraws. Maybe...voice recognition systems? Text to speech? A bigger screen, from further away? Maybe a TV mounted to the side of the apartment?

“Okay,” he suddenly said. “You're a jumping spider. Sort of. The eyes give it away. And...” He looks around and under me. “You're physically female. I think. No fuzzy boxing gloves, and a little...patch thingie. That's where the male spider puts the-”

“Right. I get it. Great. Thanks. Now what?”

My friend taps his fingers against his phone. “Feel like doing jumping distance tests?”

“Oh hell yes.”
