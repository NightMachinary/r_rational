Being special always seemed like it would be amazing. I distinctly remember several times where i wondered if my life would have been better if my parents had pushed me the way that olympic gymnasts parents pushed them. What could I have already accomplished had I been introduced to Computer Science at age 4 and then pushed to immerse myself in it? I was pretty damn good at math when I was a kid, but I ended up majoring in english in college, mostly because it came more naturally to me, and that's really just a fancy way of saying it was the easier path. Sure, I worked hard, and I am enjoy some pretty great successes along the way, but I never really challenged myself, at least I didn't think so, and I was always curious, what would happen if I had a true challenge. Something that breaks people. What if I got cancer or lost a leg? Would I be able to pull myself together, would I overcome? Would I inspire those around me or would I need them to lift me up, turn those who loved me into crutches rather than fans?

I never expected to be so damn afraid.

It wasn't my body anymore. And those words in no way sum up the way it felt. It was paralyzing and I was glad of that, because the way that everything moved, it was new, and it was fucking terrifying.

It was terrifying because I didn't instantly get it. It was terrifying because I didn't know what would hurt and what wouldn't. It was terrifying because I didn't feel like myself. My stomach, my feet, my hands, could I even type at the keyboard anymore? Did I have super strength, who would I kill with my super strength? Could I kill myself, by accident?

It took me 3 hours to also realize I was a woman now, or, more accurately, a girl.

Honestly, it was a much more minor concern. At least it seemed so in comparison to everything else, but then i started crying, and I didn't stop until I fell asleep.

Waking up and reliving the whole thing again might have been the hardest thing that I've ever done, and it wasn't even something I was doing, it was simply happening to me. It didnt even feel like I had stopped crying while asleep.

It was another hour before I started to really put together a plan, and the first thing, which just horrified me all the more was: Could I survive like this? I mean, were the different parts of me actually compatiable or was I going to just devolve into a mess of fucked up parts. Was I right now experiencing organ failure? My eyes looked jaundiced, but I couldn't even be fucking sure of that because it looked like I had fucking cats eyes. I was crying again. My moods seemed fucked up, and AGAIN I couldn't tell, was it because this was the reaction you had to becoming something, something... else? Or was this because my new body parts were creating different hormones? Or god, even worse, what if my mind just didn't operate like it used to? What if these changes weren't just physical, what if I wasn't just looking at organ failure but a whole new personality. And how could I know if I could feel the things I wanted to feel like the way I felt about them?

Theseus's ship* had become Theseus's Kraken overnight, and the problem of it was just now becoming a sort of permanent, urgent reality that it never had been before.

I have no idea what I should be doing first, so I just start doing things. I check every body part, very gently, because I don't know if the horns are for mating rituals involving combat or sensory organs. I don't know if my skin is hard to prevent damage, to keep myself warm, or to keep blood vessels constricted enough that my heart can beat, I don't know if I'm jaundiced because my organs are failing or because at night I can see better or that the radiation being bounced around by the sun is causing an allergic reaction. I have no fucking clue. But what I can know is if anything, right now, hurts, if I need to bandage myself or whatever it may be.

I put my limbs into sunlight, I put them near the AC, I put them under a blanket, I tap against what looks like claws, I rock back and forth, cry briefly, and then I take some scissors, try cutting my hair, which sends me into spasms of such pain that I think I'm going to die, and its going to be because my hair is now something vital to me and cutting it felt like being kicked in the balls (which I assume I dont have anymore) and lightning.

Eventually I make it to the internet. I should have gone there sooner, although I don't have any way to know whats being posted is true. Other people seem to be experiencing similar things.

And then I'm on twitter. And there are a lot of tweets, all under the hashtag "monster". Nearly all of them are suicide notes.
