"9-1-1, what is the nature of your emergency?" recited some fifty-something chainsmoker. It was the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard.

"I am, uh... hallucinating, quite vividly. Never taken any drugs that I know of, and there are no gaps in my memory. Something psychiatric maybe, but I have no history of anything..." My vines trembled and I had to consciously decide not to drop the phone. They responded to directives, not directions. Like octopus arms with independent ganglia. That's what I would have thought, if I humored this whole thing and ignored the obvious explanation.

"Alright ma'am, help is on the way. Your address is 349 Warner?"

"'Ma'am'? Fuck." Fuck fuck fuck. "Uh, yes, 349 Warner, unit 1011. Uh, my name is Brian, I'm a baritone for the university choir. Do I really sound, uh...? I mean... I look at myself, and I see, uh, like a girl... thing..." Specifically, I saw a girl /flower/ thing. I saw it and I heard it and I felt it.

"You're going to be okay. Is anyone else there with you?" No "ma'am", but no "sir" either. He was no longer sure which to use. /He heard me as a girl./

"Uh, no, my roommate is staying with his girlfriend so it's just me." I hesitated. That was weird. Didn't most hallucinations involve stuff /around/ a person? But my little apartment looked the same as always, other than my leaves draped over half my furniture. I could feel the cool handles of my dresser, four meters away.

The dispatcher must have heard something in my voice. "Listen, Brian, take some deep breaths. Help is on the way, they'll be there in just a few minutes. Talk to me. What were you doing before this started?"

"Nothing, I just woke up..." There really wasn't anything interesting there. Had I had a stroke? The dispatcher was nice enough, and he kept me on the line for a few minutes, just as he said, before the knocking came from my door. I slithered over, undid all three locks at once-

And then there was lots of screaming.
