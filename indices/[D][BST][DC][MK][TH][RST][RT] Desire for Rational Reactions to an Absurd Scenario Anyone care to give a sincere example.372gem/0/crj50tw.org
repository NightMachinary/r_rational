"Great. I spend a few years as a furry fan hoping to experience a non-human body, then finally gain an understanding of why I shouldn't anticipate ever experiencing "magic", even if it's called a 'quantum miracle' or whatnot... and now I'm /this/? It'll be a fun dream if it is one, but I don't exactly want to open my bedroom door to show off my new look to my roomies if it's not one.

"If I'm not dreaming - /somebody/ is faffing me about. Transplanting a working conscious mind into a new physical shape - including tweaking the brain's sensory and motor homunculi - isn't the sort of thing that can happen by /natural processes/. Did, say, some Japanese furry-fan accidentally hack the math that underlies reality, and came up with some software to allow that sort of thing? Highly unlikely, even if the universe is a simulation. A lot /more/ likely is that somebody came up with some sort of intelligence augmentation that let them come up with Drexlerian nanotech, and some side effect of their working towards their goals involved expanding humanity's phenotype. After all, I'm only about one-in-ten-million special, so there's probably at least a few hundred other people in similar situations - or maybe a few billion. I should probably narrow down that range of estimates. Anyway, or maybe some aliens are saying 'hello' by instantiating tentacle porn in the real world. But one of the upshots - if one intelligent mind could cause all these changes once, then there's nothing preventing /other/ intelligent minds from doing similar things /again/. And I haven't got any sort of password protection on my brain to keep from being rewritten into a catgirl loveslave in a volcano-lair harem.

"Since I'm nowhere near as smart as I wish I were, or as smart as certain other people I know, this all means that some of the most important things I can do are to hit the internet, find my rationalisty compadres, and start collaborating on figuring out what actually happened, what that implies about physics and engineering, and what we can do to gain control of whatever tech was involved. (And I really hope that the internet's still up, and I don't have to break out my ham radio for any long-distance comms.) And I should figure out what assumptions I'm making about my body that aren't true, on the gross anatomical level as well as the cellular and biochemical ones. Guess I'm going to have to open that bedroom door to get my microscope out of my basement. And I should try making a few quick requests to any moderately friendly Drexlerian nanotech that might be hanging around and relaying such things to whatever entity controlled them... or maybe I should hold off on that, in case it's the sort of tech that does what I ask, instead of what I mean or what I want. But if anyone /else/ is getting wishes granted, then I could get loveslaved at any moment, so I'd better at least ask for something like a password-protect to prevent any further changes to me without my permission. And then maybe call on the hivemind of some gaming people I know to see if they've got any insights about what the implications of someone changing me into /this/ might be. Hm... maybe check my digital library, like my copy of the Transformation Stories Archive and my local mirror of TVTropes, to see if there's a match to any existing fiction?"
