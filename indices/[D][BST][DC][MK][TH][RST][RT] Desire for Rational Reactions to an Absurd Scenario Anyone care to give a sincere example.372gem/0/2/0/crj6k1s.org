  three pieces of fiction

I think I can confidently guess what two of those are - if I might ask, what's the third one that caught your attention?

#+begin_quote
  multi step contingency plan
#+end_quote

In case it helps your narration, my previous comment wasn't a specific contingency plan I already have in place, it was ad-libbing based on having been exposed to similar ideas. (There are reasons I packrat away as much data as I can read...) While I'm working on my current depressive episode, I'm noodling around with a few scenarios that I haven't encountered sufficient stories on and discussion of elsewhere, in the hopes of finding something novel to work on later, from the economic consequences of ems whose main advantage seems to be being able to be run at arbitrarily fast speeds to a ROB scenario in which I'm exposed to the greater Tegmarkian mathematical polyverse and, oh yes, given root authority over my home 3+1-dimensional universe. Then again, I've also just purchased a backup cellphone to take when I go camping, in case my main phone gets dropped in a stream, so having 'multi step contingency plans' is probably as good a description as any, for story-telling purposes. :)
