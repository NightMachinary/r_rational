Not a story explicitly but I remember your original version of the datapacrats from orion's arm and the kind of base assumption that some one will potentially boot up a shard of you into some random body and which I've since seen resurrected in your interesting little contract thing.

I've been personally enjoying my whole exploration of absurdity/deconstruction of various concepts project that this is based on.

Although considering the consistent reaction people have had to my writing in the past It might not be the best reading for some one going through depression.
