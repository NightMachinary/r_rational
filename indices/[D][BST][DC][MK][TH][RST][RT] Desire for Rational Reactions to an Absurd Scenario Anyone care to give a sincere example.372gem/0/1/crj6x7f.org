In case it might help, some of the responses that my younger self might have taken would have included:

- Grab a bug-out-bag (or pack one) and try to get out of the city without being seen, to spend at least a week completely outside of contact with humanity.
- Send a message to the transformation-story-group that existed at the time to ask for advice, in a nice, safe, interactive-fictional format that would have been deniable in case I was hallucinating.
- Take some selfies, post them, ask for critiques of my digital image manipulation skills.
- (censored due to adult content)
- Realize that I'm female and have never had that version of 'The Talk', so take some time to read/view/listen to anything about my new sex that I might need to worry about, regardless of species. Look into whatever prophylactics are appropriate for my anatomy, especially ones which will be functional even with a non-human biochemistry. Look into buying mace, or any similar self-defense stuff, to reduce the worries of involuntary pregnancies.
- Embarrassedly ask whatever female(s) live nearby for more gender-appropriate clothing.
- Grab a wallet and walk (/slither/scuttle/etc) to the nearest store to buy a candy bar and Coke, to gauge the reaction of the shopkeeper and any nearby pedestrians.
- Try concentrating /really hard/, meditating, light some scented candles to focus on, print out some quickie Qabalistic amulets, and otherwise attempt to impose my will on the universe to take control over my physical form.
- Call a lawyer for an emergency meeting to see if some sort of preemptive injunction or whatnot can be created, to ensure that I'm still entitled to the usual legal rights of personhood.
- Prepare to exercise the legal right to self-defense against anyone who thinks I don't enjoy the legal rights to life, liberty, and property.
