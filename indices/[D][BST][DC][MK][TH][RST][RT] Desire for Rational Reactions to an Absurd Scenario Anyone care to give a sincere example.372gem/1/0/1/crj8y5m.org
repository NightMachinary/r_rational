  I like the TOR client load up first and the healthy paranoia.

Oh, definitely. That's later, though... I don't need to anonymize myself to check the news, and I wouldn't need to download it. I don't have a TOR client on my Mac, but I do have one of those onion-router boot-disks and if I can't find it I do know where the CD image is. This is good because my Internet is pretty lousy /and/ there's probably going to be thirty-thousand other people doing the same thing. Now I think of it TOR is probably going to be like trying to watch a video over a 300 baud dialup.
