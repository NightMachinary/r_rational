Lock the door, get on the internet, chide myself for not having TOR, wait a few hours for whether anything comes up on the news. If this just happened to a significant percentage of the population, someone competent in the government is sure to have published information on how to stay on the safe side of things.

If there's nothing to be found on the internet, there was a coverup or I'm relatively alone. My technical knowledge says this kind of coverup is infeasible, so if they're that good, they're about to check my house anyway and my marginal advantage does not lie in running away into the wild, let someone else try that.

As I writing this post ("the player") write this, I am failing to come up with alternative explanations to "This is a story.", so in the case that I ("the character")'m alone, the story must be centered on me. I'm not too familiar with the genre, so I go to TV Tropes to read up. (Get TOR first anyway, there's no downside.) Maybe make a reddit post like OP's.

Since my character doesn't see a quick way to Becomus Goddus within the defined story limits, this doesn't sound to be a fun story to be the protagonist of, so it occurs to me that I might want to do things people wouldn't want to read about, to make it less likely someone would want to write a story about me. (Since my mind is being simulated by the author, Newcomblike Problems are reality!)

/After/ thinking this (the author may be just writing stuff as he goes along, so chronological causality might still be a thing), I check under my bed for a handbook or notes or something indicating that the rules of the story have changed to my liking.
