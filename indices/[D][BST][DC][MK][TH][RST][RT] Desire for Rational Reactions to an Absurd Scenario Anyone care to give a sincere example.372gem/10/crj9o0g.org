After becoming aware that something really really improbable is happening I'll try basic dream control techniques. As a regular lucid dreamer I trained to do telekinesis, time control, etc., in dreams.

A few moments of panic as the techniques fail. I start forced wake up protocol (learned to deal with sleep paralysis). Longer moments of panic as it also doesn't work.

Going back to basics I try to recognize dream signs, object consistency, and level of details. Gradual sense of absolute horror as these tests agree less and less with dreams and look like reality. Probably some screaming at this point.

Assuming I'm alone at home, the next step is studying my anatomy. Hopefully I still have appendages capable of using computers, so I'll look up whatever species is similar to what I'm seeing and figure out if I have poisonous thingies or any other dangerous bits. I try to find out if these species have any instincts that would cause me trouble (e.g. cannibalism, pack behavior).

At this point the initial shock would've ended and I would start crying and/or go catatonic. Things would probably improve after a couple of hours, but by then I would be so different that I can't reliably model my probable reactions anymore.
