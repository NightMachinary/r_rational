Oh, I'm still a furry fan; I'm just not expecting to wake up as a zoomorphic person without currently-nonexistent technologies, just like I'm not expecting to ever be able to flip a lightswitch on the wall by concentrating on pushing force out from my fingers.

Not to mention, the odds are that in this scenario, the 'Monster Girl' species I wake up as isn't going to be related to any of the phenotypes I've previously associated myself with. Imagine having an affinity for, say, goats, to the degree of occasionally fantasizing about life as a goat-person... and waking up as a ferret-woman. That just adds a whole extra level to the "Oh, come /on/!". :)
