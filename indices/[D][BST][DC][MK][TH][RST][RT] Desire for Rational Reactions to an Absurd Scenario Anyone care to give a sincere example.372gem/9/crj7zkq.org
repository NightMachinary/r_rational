After panicking briefly and concluding that this is definitely supernatural, I don't just have some horrible medical condition happening to my body:

Firstly, pinch myself. Literally. It's been a while since I was really into lucid dreaming, but I still remember that I don't feel pain in dreams.

Secondly, hug myself and go "wahoo!" quietly. Magic is real! Excellent! I don't care if it's aliens or time machines or Matrix Lords, or even something more worrying like demons, whatever excuse the universe has for throwing this at me is capable of /so much more/ than the relatively inexploitable physics I know and love.

Thirdly ... argh, I guess I'd better track down someone and find out if they can see this too. But what if it's a superpower I can turn off, and I expose my secret for nothing? Hmm, I could Google it to see what's happening ... hope the NSA isn't secretly hunting for monsters, but what are the odds ... oh, hey, this is widespread! Sweet!

Fourthly: damn, this is widespread. I'm ... stronger, and I move weirdly, but no serious superpowers. No demands or announcements from the Ruinous Powers, yet.

(Fifth, quietly: I don't feel ... dysphoria, in any meaningful way. Does this mean "cis-by-default" really is true? Or was I ... in some sense /always/ this thing, and only now my heritage is expressing itself, like a Werewolf in WoD games...)
