Thanks right back. :) And one thing I forgot about: Being a psychology student, and due to a family history of mental illness, I might conclude that I'm experiencing a psychotic break and contact a friend to ask if they could check up on me and drive me to a hospital. In that case, I'll probably unlock the door and try to sit still in an empty corner until he or she arrives so that I don't accidentally hurt myself.
