First, I wouldn't really know what my psycho-physiological response to such a development would be, but I could guess. I imagine immediate panic as I wake up and feel new body parts on myself (tentacles, tail, whatever), and in no way would I be thinking rationally at that moment. Next, I'll probably notice bewbs and check if my junk is still there while walking to the nearest mirror, as I'm a dude. I could be in shock, so I probably would't react too much at the image in the mirror. I won't go through that whole "am I in a dream" cliche, because honestly, "am I in a dream" has never happened to me, inside or outside a dream. Once I start feeling more sane, I'll decide that I'm definitely not heading out for work/school. I'll probably check Reddit or a news site to see what's going on, and depending on how other people reacted to themselves or someone they live with having turned monstergirl overnight, I might or might not see that other people have turned into monstergirls. From there, my reaction would differ greatly based on what the outside world is doing. But in all paths, I'll probably have a main concern of whether I could go back into my own body, and after that, my focus would be on having some fun. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

I haven't been on this subreddit in a while, hope I offered what you were looking for. Didn't go rationalistic on purpose.
