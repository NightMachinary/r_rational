"Ummm....."

As I stare at the mirror, I continue investigating every single aspect of my body. I am extremely through in checking for if it is a very realistic costume. The sensations in my body is too good for it to be fake, not without decades of advancement in multiple medical fields so that's out.

I consider the hypothesis that I died and put into cryogenic preservation without any memories of my death. If so, then they did a very good job in bringing me back since I expected more brain damage, but brain damage is not always obvious and the ability to put my brain in a different body can also be used for cryogenics. This is the most likely idea since the earlier thought about medical advancement could apply.

I am calmly and logically iterating through all possible hypothesizes in order of likelihood because to do otherwise would mean realizing that I lost my body and the odds of reversal is very likely low. I cannot afford to freak out. Hence the lack of emotions as I try emulating a robot as hard as I can.

Further hypothesizes are being an entity in a stimulation, alien invasion with the aliens having [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality][Blue-Orange morality]], AI intelligence explosion gone /weird/, and some other stuff involving supernatural weirdness. But all of these ideas have a huge complexity penalty and for now I'll go with being an future society with very strange customs. I'll have to check the date and keep a keen eye out for any inconsistencies and be very nosy. Since there's nothing about me that's one in eight billion special, there are probably others like me. Truly unique events are extremely rare. If it happened once, then it probably happened before and probably will happen again.

I turn to face the door and....um......er......on the other hand I should spend some time playing around with my body to be sure I can move quickly and figure out any weird abilities. I should check in advance if I can run away from danger quickly enough.

*Hours later*

I peek outside with my stomach churning in worry/anticipation and a backpack of all the supplies I could scavenge. All of a sudden I discover that..............well I need more details from the GM first!

EDIT: Obviously I would check the internet, but I decided to just leave that out, because I don't know what I would find.
