Update: Until I discovered I wasn't the only victim, I would also have to consider the possibility that all my memories were fictional and imposed (voluntarily or not) on someone who was supposed to look like my new form. It wouldn't change how I acted, I don't think, except tactically ... because fictional or real I'm still the same person.

(I made a similar comment on a 'what would you do if you found yourself in the HPMoR timeline inhabiting rational!Harry's body' thread, so this isn't a new thought)
