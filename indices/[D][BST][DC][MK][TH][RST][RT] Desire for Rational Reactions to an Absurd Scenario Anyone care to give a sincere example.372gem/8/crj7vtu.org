OK, by "monster girl" I assume you mean something like a goo-girl or spider or demon-thing rather than something I'd actually enjoy being turned into.

I suspect I'd still go through a bit of "this must be a dream" denial, for a few seconds, but frankly lucid dreaming for me has never been particularly lucid and once I realize it's a dream my stupid brain kicks me out and /I know that/ even if I try and convince myself it's not a dream: /that never works/. Same for my brain having completely broken, if I'm still rational enough to check for object permanence and consistency. So, then... decide that (a) the most likely thing is that this is a simulation and I'm an uploaded descendant of the mind state I think I am, and (b) it's not useful to act any differently long or even medium term as a result, and (c) short term, talking to the air bargaining with the computer/gamer geek/experimenter is still rational even if its a long-shot that someone going to this effort would be willing to intervene.

So, questions thrown out to the air will include things like "if this is some test to see how long it takes before I realize I'm in a simulation, is ten seconds a record yet?" and "seriously, you can make me look like anything and I have to be something off a Heavy Metal cover?" "can I has something cuter, like even a hyena maybe?" and "how many instances of me are you running concurrently? Will we be allowed to get together and compare notes?".

If "monster girl" means I /am/ a hyena or something else at least reasonably mammalian, there's be less complaining but just as much bargaining for communication and how about some superpowers eh?

Then a quick check on the limitations of my mind. Any words I'm not allowed to say. Any standard magic/holodeck/metaverse words or actions do anything. Probably not, but if I find out six months from now that I could have pulled up a control panel any time by saying "interface" in that twee "talking to the Enterprise computer" tone I'd feel really stupid.

After that fails (if it doesn't, it's either a short story or a completely different kind of story than I expect) I make a quick check outside my room to see what else has transformed. Hoping I don't suddenly get a mad monstrous hunger for live animals or humans, because that would suck. It's possible there's other instances of me around, because that's just the kind of wacky thing ascended Otaku are likely to do. If I run into any other monster-people I ask them if they know one of my online character names as a kind of extended-self recognition protocol.

Nobody? Nothing?No berserker incidents? Shut and LOCK the door.

If nothing interesting has happened by now... we're talking maybe five minutes mind... this is either the same level of reality I grew up in or it's not going to make any immediate difference. So, what's next? Definitely a bit of ahem-personal-exploration-ahem unless I'm something really gross... but defer that for a few minutes until AFTER I check one one more thing.

Get online, look for news reports of monstrous transformations, make a post to social media asking about weird things happening in a generic hypothetical way.

Maybe frame it as a story premise...
