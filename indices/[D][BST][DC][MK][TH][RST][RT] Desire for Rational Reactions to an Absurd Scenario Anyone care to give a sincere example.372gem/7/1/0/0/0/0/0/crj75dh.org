Schizophrenia is a multifaceted thing, very complex and often completely different from how movies portray it. It's quite fascinating, I highly recommend a wikistroll. I think no hallucination could be as vivid and complex as "turning into a monster girl", but along with general symptoms like depression, anxiety, social withdrawal tinfoil hat paranoia, etc, there can also be specific, recurring symptoms, like seeing a wall start melting every once in a while, or having certain words jump out at you. Or you could be talking to someone and to you, they suddenly start telling you to commit suicide. And since it's all happening in your brain, which is basically you, your symptoms are indistinguishable from reality. Nothing fools you better than yourself.

I'm only a student and I could be wrong about stuff, don't take my word as an expert.
