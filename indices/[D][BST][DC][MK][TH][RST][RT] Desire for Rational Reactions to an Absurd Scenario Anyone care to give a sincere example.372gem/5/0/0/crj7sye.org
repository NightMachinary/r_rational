I worry I might not have quite honestly predicted my actions. This is something of a situation where meta-resonance applies. The more I try to make sure I write how I would act, the longer I've thought about what I would do, which takes away from the part where I do it without thinking because it's happening as I think. If that makes sense. But I do know I don't call for help without a plan for what to ask when it comes, and this was so absurd that the plan part never happened.

One time I woke up and opened my eyes and I just knew somehow that my body wouldn't listen to me. I hadn't tried to move yet, but I already knew it wouldn't. And I got kind of scared about it, but it wasn't hurting me, just scary, and then I started finding it interesting to contemplate, because I had time to contemplate it.
