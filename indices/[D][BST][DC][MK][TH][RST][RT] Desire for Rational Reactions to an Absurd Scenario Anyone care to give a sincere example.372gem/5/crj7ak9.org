Something's crawling into my nose. THE FUCK, slap it away, snort, ow, what?

The alarm clock goes off. The alarm clock stops going off. The fuck why?

Waking up in parts. Why am I only partly awake even after several things that should have woken me fully immediately? Some weird sleep paralysis? I'm fucked, I think. I try to lie still and feel to see if anything hurts or feels actively numb, and try to make sense of how I'm feeling so I can call for help clearly.

I'm getting scared now, a bit panicky, because my vision is still groggy from sleep and I'm not liking what I'm seeing. There's multiple UNIDENTIFIED_ANIMAL_APPENDAGE sticking out the bottom of my bed, and my proprioception is fighting a shifting war with a sudden case of xenomelia about them.

Wait fuck, these are MINE? Is this thing fucking ATTACHED to me and trying to... the fuck is this? At this point, I -- one of the UNIDENTIFIED_ANIMAL_APPENDAGEs flips all my bedding off me, and slicks out of it smoothly.

My bed's covered in ink or slime or something. I have eight cephalopod tentacles instead of legs. And I feel sort of sideways, my center of consciousness isn't interested in staying in my head. It moves when I pay attention to something, and sometimes it's... pushed away into another part of my body.

I don't scream. The raw shock and horror has left me stunned to the point where I've mostly acclimated before rational thoughts start happening. But that partial wakefulness feeling is now sharper. I feel like my mind's being pulled different ways to decide what to do or think about, which would normally be distracting except that something's picking up the slack and finishing my thoughts when I get distracted. I can start one train of thought running and it will keep going when I get distracted?

One of my tentacles is rubbing my shoulder. It itches, I should scratch it--

Okay. Now the horror is setting in. I wasn't scared before. I've just realized I'm not the primary agent in control of this body. Something else felt an inch, decided to scratch it, did it, and then I got a memo about it.

I start to wonder how this could be, but my mind wanders to the next issue. I start to worry if I'll ever really be in control of this body, and again my mind wanders. I suspect that this is some kind of really fucked up dream. I realize that I remember hearing something about octopi having neural clusters in their tentacles for distributed intelligence. I feel that the tentacle I slapped still stings a little, which means I'm probably not asleep. I'm still pretty horrified, because it's difficult to control my own train of thought. I am pushed a little, and begin to fiercely ponder the nature of these mental pushes and shoves. I am confused and though I am freaking out, I still haven't screamed. That apparently requires some kind of consensus among my parts and I don't have the force of it right now. But it's coming. I'm learning how this works.

When I do scream, what am I going to SAY? I could call my girlfriend for help, but... then the fuck what happens? What are my priorities? I-- Wait, I can use this now.

I need her to not attack me. First thread, instantiate. I feel myself getting distracted by the second topic, meanwhile-

#+begin_quote
  (1) SECRET_PERSONAL_AFFECTION_GESTURE_1 combined with NICKNAME_2 will convince her you are you, but there will be a knee-jerk reaction associated with appearance...
#+end_quote

Does she like tentacle sex- no fuck, don't devote a whole thread to--

#+begin_quote
  (2) Too late. Now I'm imagining all the things I could do with tentacles, and if semi-autonomous tentacles not fully under my control makes me a rapist. She might let me try if...
#+end_quote

Dammit, I need sense of agency and coherency here.

#+begin_quote
  (3) But I just became this thread instead, didn't I? Okay then, can I subdivide?

    (4) Yes, sort of, but it still counts as a thread, and I only have eight of those, and I need to not distract myself with myself because I could get into some serious tangles if threads call other threads, and...

Fuck. So what does the meat in my head do?

#+begin_quote
  (5) It's where all the end results go when they're done. When I'm on the inside of a thread, I only receive such information after the fact. That's what happened with the itch.
#+end_quote

This is confusing and I want to cry. Can I cry?

I can cry. There's enough consensus on that.

Okay, so I'm the agent. But not always. And what replaces me as the agent is ALSO ME, but during that time I'M NOT? How do I only have 3/8ths of a headache?

In the absurdity of it I still haven't even started to consider the implications--

#+begin_quote
  Okay, I'll do that now, a thing exists which is capable of body transfer, or of chimeric anatomy fuckery on a grand scale, a big angelic power perhaps piloted by someone who uses it to -- insufficient information for meaningful answer, don't speculate further. You just don't fucking know the implications other than it is possible, and now I have to update a shitload of beliefs that strongly predicted against this kind of bullshit...

It only propagates one level? Fuck, why wouldn't I make everything top level then?

#+begin_quote
  Because it's not actually up to my control, wandering attentions are sufficient to spawn threads, and even before this I had a tendency to have diffuse trains of thought.

The fuck? It is the same minute. That's an awful lot of thinking to do in one minute.

    Pass upwards to top level thread, it's faster down here but narrower in scope and further out of date, and anything not explicitly passed up is lost.

Oh. That would be a good reason. Can I even walk li-

I'm sliding along the ground. I can kind of be upright? My tentacles are longer than my legs were, so I can have my original height. Or more. Or less. Also I started moving /before/ I made any decision to try, so I'm in a thread again!

Wait, have I ever had the body move in response to my desires, or have the desires always followed--

Tentacles grabbing my breasts. Shocked, I wonder what they would feel like--

And several threads fill with different instances from Dragon Ball Z Abridged of "God dammit Nappa."

It's only been a minute. If I structure my threads right, I can get a lot of thinking done. How much thi-

Okay, so my own goddamn boredom is an actual limit to my potentially abusable hyperintelligence. I can do math fast, but it doesn't come out any faster for me unless I'm doing something threadable, and... short.

And this is just the changes to my mind I'm dealing with! I still haven't learned much about my bo-

A tentacle finds an internal erogenous zone.

The decision to explore follows, as expected.

Okay. So I can be the top level for cognition, but somehow I never am for actual physical action?

#+begin_quote
  Because the consensus is, and that's eightfold, regardless of which thread you're subjectively in at the time, and it goes to a different place than the part of your brain that thinks about things. You have about two seconds of coherent extrapolated volition being performed on you, and you're lagging behind that.

"How can I talk if -"

... How /can/ I talk if my mouth starts to move several

I start to throw up, but I'm empty.

seconds before I decide what I'm going to say? I feel sick...

I'm done. I can't deal with this right now. I need more sleep. Dream hypothesis is the best one despite feeling pain and despite all the other bullshit because I know dreams are real and my brain will abjectly lie to me in a dream.

My girlfriend says, "Who's in there?!"

I'm hiding under the bed.

Shit. Where can I hide--

There's the scream.
