Hypotheses, in order of probability:

Dreaming, hallucinating, unknown unknowns, post-singularity, simulated (incl. fictional; your qualia may vary), falsified/lost memory, trolling aliens, Boltzmann brain, the scenario being physically real without involving a higher power.

I know how to test dreaming: close your nose and try to breathe, try to stick the thumb of one hand through the palm of the other, etc., then try to levitate using willpower alone.

Assuming negative, hallucination is most likely. Call emergency services; you might not be conscious or sane a minute from now. If that fails, try to contact people you trust. If that fails, physically move yourself to a place people will find you if you fall unconscious.

Assuming the ball is still in your court, try to gather more information: check the internet, turn on a radio or tv if one you have one, ask god/the AI/the author to respond or fix it, formally do not consent to being used/simulated like this.

If the change is common, help to preserve civilisation in the ensuing panic, and secure supplies for yourself if able. Talk with peers (e.g. [[/r/rational]]) on what to do, and how to test the metaphysics. Consent to medical/biological experiments as is useful.
