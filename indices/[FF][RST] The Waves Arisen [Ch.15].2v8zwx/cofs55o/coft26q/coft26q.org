I presume that was covered under "more light-hearted conversation."

Since Jiraiya and Tsunade already know Naruto is a jinchuriki---and Jiraiya has probably fought jinchuriki while they're unleashing controlled amounts of their beasts' power before---/and/ since the three of them aren't particularly bone-weary or missing limbs---it's pretty apparent what had to have happened, without even having to ask.

On the other hand, this is a cruelty of miscommunication by the author, in that the important fact of "it's easier and less dangerous to control the Kyuubi's power than you think, as long as you can practice with someone who can beat you up before you tail up fully" has been left unsaid.
