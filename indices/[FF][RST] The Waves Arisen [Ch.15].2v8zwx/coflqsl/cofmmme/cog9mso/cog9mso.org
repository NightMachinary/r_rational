I had another idea.

  On the other hand, even with shadow clones it would probably take longer than this story to learn

Naruto could come up with the torus idea and try it with say 2 or 3 elements, and then draw it out and show Jiriya that it would work with 7 elements. This is a rational fic, so the main character doesn't have to do everything themselves because plot, he can give the knowledge to someone that can make it work.
