Ooh, do we get points for explaining ways in which a seven-element "whirlpool" might be possible?

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem#Generalizations][Wikipedia]] shows that this could be done with the surface of a torus; simply giving this depth away from the surface would lead to a contact area for every element with every other.

At Jiraya's speed, this would take ~40 person-years to learn. Naruto could do it a lot faster with clones, but probably still not fast enough to matter. On the other hand... the "magic doughnut" would be eight times more powerful than the theoretical maximum - and ~256 times the power of a non-elemental technique.
