Shadow clones+byakugan+sharingan (once Sasuke gives one of his eyes to Naruto in thanks for the sage training). This fic has taken several small jumps in time on the order of months, with a few large time skips another dozen chapters could get us a few years into the future giving Naruto time to figure it out.
