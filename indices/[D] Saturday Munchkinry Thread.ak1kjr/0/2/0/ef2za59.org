  Psychological addiction removal - addicted to something? Store every positive memory of it to truly lose the urge to use it. You can even use this to get through withdrawal, just forget what could stop the withdrawls and you won't have to resist doing it to stop the symptoms.

I wonder if that would work, there is a kind of temptation to forbidden fruits and knowing that you once liked doing it enough to get addicted to it might be sufficient incentive to give it another try.

I suppose you could erase the knowledge of what you were addicted to, but then you run the risk of repeating whatever started the addiction the first time around.
