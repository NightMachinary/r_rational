  The way it's written now makes it look like the vivid recall is the compounding effect 100%, and opening that space up to speculation could be fun.

I agree that the way it's written now can be misleading to someone who hasn't read the books. The reason I still decided to include it is that in order to munchkin something you want it to be as specific as possible and to have all the ins and outs of the power specified.

Speculation and open mysteries are good for a story, but not that great for the kind of munchkinry we do in these threads.

In this particular case I can see the argument for leaving it out, as the compounding effect here doesn't open a whole lot of additional munchkin options, but in general I do think that for this thread it's better to fill in the gaps of what we know about the magic systems with speculation, rather than leaving those gaps open.
