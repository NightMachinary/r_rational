Small note on copper compounding: The author has repeatedly refused to comment on what burning feruchemically charged copper actually does (leading some people to assume that it is going to be important for future books) so that section is 100% speculation on my part.

Next week we start with the enhancement metals. These are a little odd and I feel they have somewhat less munchkin potential than the others (in that some of them don't actually do anything by themselves), so I'm planning on pairing them up and tackling aluminium/chromium and duralumin/nicrosil together.
