Ooh this is cool.

  The main problem is ensuring that the copper feruchemist truthfully stores the memories into the copper given to you.
#+end_quote

That is a problem, yeah, but if you can trust the other person at the moment they give you the memories, this at least ensures that nobody will be able to bride/threaten/torture the secrets out of them later (and this is also at least some incentive for the feruchemist to give you the real memories).

#+begin_quote
  You can hire a bronze allochemist to check whether the copper feruchemist is storing memories, but you wouldn't be able to tell which memory is being stored.
#+end_quote

While using bronze to sense feruchemy is possible, it's also extremely hard and no one on Scadrial has figured out how to do it yet (at least not in Era 1).

I don't believe I mentioned it in part one and two, but metalminds are harder to move with allomancy than regular metal, so you could test that the piece of copper is an actual metalmind by getting a sufficiently sensitive steel or iron allomancer to push/pull on it. That still has the same problem of not telling you what memory was stored in the metalmind though.
