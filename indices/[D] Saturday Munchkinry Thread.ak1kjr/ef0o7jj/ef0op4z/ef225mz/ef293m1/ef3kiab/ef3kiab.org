I wonder if memory storage recursion and lying to yourself would effect "truthfulness" to get around this? You would have to have access to a hidden coppermind to try these in addition to the one they actually want you to put the memory in.

Store it inside a coppermind, asked about it = lying

Store the memory of storing it = you don't know? Will probably show confusion/unsure?

Before removing the storing memory think about how glad you are you honestly stored it, remove the storing memory but not that one = will truthfully think you stored it in the right one? Or will that memory retain an inprint that you were lying to yourself?

Potential munchkin: convince yourself of almost anything? If lying to yourself then storing the truth makes you believe the lie.

100% innocent acting - if accused of a crime, you actually did, store all memories of it so you react to the accusations 100% naturally and can't slip up during questioning.

100% perfect acting - create secondary goals then store the primary ones until you complete them so you act and behave perfectly heartfelt. Example: I want to spy on x, create secondary of "I want to become friends with x, then recall y memory" then store the spying motivating memories until you're friends aka when you can truly act on them. This probably requires someone to assign you the spying task so the motivational memories are small.

Copper feruchemists are also a philosophical/personhood nightmare, chopping off and overwriting their own personalities.
