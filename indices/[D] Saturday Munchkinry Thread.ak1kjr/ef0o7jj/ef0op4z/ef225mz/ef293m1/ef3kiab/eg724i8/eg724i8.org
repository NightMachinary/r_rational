This is actually really interesting and powerful on its own. Traumatized by childhood experiences? Store in a coppermind and they're gone. Need to do something bad but don't want to live with the guilt? You don't have to.

You can basically edit yourself to be what you want. So much of who we are is who we believe we are based on our past behavior. If you have a bad habit, store every memory of it and you no longer have that habit. What could you accomplish if you knew you'd never have to live with regret or embarrassment?
