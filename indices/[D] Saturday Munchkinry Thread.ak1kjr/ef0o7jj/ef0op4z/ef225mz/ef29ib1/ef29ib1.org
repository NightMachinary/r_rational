This series really encourages me to pick the books back up to see how our speculations line up with canon characters.

I have some knowledge of neuron structuring, brain plasticity, and mnemonic techniques and everything I know points towards most munchkin attempts of memory not working but it's a different world so who knows.

Metacoppermind - anything I can think of depends on the ability to keep memories distinctly separate and organized, in trees of memories you've stored. Create and maintain a system to ensure you know what you don't know (stored) and what memories you should tap in what order to relearn skills.

Literally Photographic memory - write anything you need to know onto paper in chunks that you can write in a few seconds. Keep those chunks well organized and you can tap, write the info, store, and then read what you wrote with minimal decay. Use the newly written info to create a new storage when it starts getting weak. Effects: perfect recall and restorage of any flashcard sized info so long as you can rewrite it.

No knowledge decay: store any memories you don't immediately need, ensuring you can perfectly recall them later. You can potentially do this every night with almost all memories depending on how memory reconsolidation and brains work in this world.

Copper shout spreading - with multiple copper feruchemists you can do some crazy memory spreading, and the scaling is crazy. If you can recall and tell multiple copperminds info you can effectively magnify information recall and spreading. A group can effectively study/research different topics all day then condense practical information into short bites they can teach each other at the end of the day so everyone can store important parts and also learn them to help future research.

Actual learning research - find the absolute best way to teach a coppermind by teaching them something, testing, having them store everything taught, and repeating with different techniques. Everyone probably learns a bit differently, but this would still be a huge boon to refine general teaching and especially specific topics.

PTSD/Trauma/Boredom resistance - store harmful memories and never recall them. Anything you can psychologically handle until you get to your coppermind you can handle indefinitely by storing it. You can forget any pain in the past.

Brainwash yourself - store huge amounts to make yourself a blank slate to become a spy, or remove memories that you believe have shaped you for the worse.

Psychological addiction removal - addicted to something? Store every positive memory of it to truly lose the urge to use it. You can even use this to get through withdrawal, just forget what could stop the withdrawls and you won't have to resist doing it to stop the symptoms.

Looking at my list I believe there's a huge potential to munchkin the selective amnesia abilities of this once you get past the perfect temporary recall abilities.
