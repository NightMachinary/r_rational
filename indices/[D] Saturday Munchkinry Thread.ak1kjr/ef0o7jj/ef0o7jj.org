*Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 8: Copper*

Ok, week eight of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries, for general overview of the magic system, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][part one]]. I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting. Parts 2 through 7 can be found here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a23pe3/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eauwn90/][2]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a4be9x/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebcx4eg/][3]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a6ftyl/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebuo08h/][4]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a8lgsu/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ecbqhr8/][5]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/af85cz/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/edw9q7a/][6]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ahmsgc/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eefzs0m/][7]].

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

This weeks metal is copper. As always we're interested in what a copper twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial. This is another metal where the allomantic half doesn't do much if no other allomancers exist, so on earth you'd mostly be stuck with only the feruchemic half (plus compounding).

*Allomancy*

Allomantically, copper does two things. First, it makes the user completely immune to mental allomancy. If another allomancer tries to sooth or riot an allomancer burning bronze the effect simply fails. Notably, the soother/rioter is not informed that their attack has failed, nor is the copper allomancer informed that someone tried to influence them. In universe this is seen by at least one character as a major disadvantage of copper over bronze (which doesn't protect you, but does lets you know someone is trying to influence you).

Coppers second effect is that it makes the allomancer and everyone in an area around them invisible to bronze allomancers. This area is known as a coppercloud. Allomancer using their powers while their centre of mass is inside a coppercloud do not generate the pulses that bronze allomancers can detect. A coppercloud is always spherical and centred on the copper allomancer, but can be shrunk or grown as desired. Copperclouds work through walls and other obstacles and move with the allomancer that is creating it. The maximum area that can be covered by a coppercloud depends on the strenght of the allomancer, but is typically around the size of a small building.

Spoilers: An exceptionally powerfull allomancer can pierce both the effects of a copperclouds and the mental protection that copper affords its user, but the difference in power between attacker and defender before this can happen needs to be so large that this is not a concern for most practical purposes.

*Feruchemy*

Feruchemically, copper stores memories. Storing a memory causes the feruchemist to completely forget that memory. Afterwards, the feruchemist can tap the resulting metalmind to recover the memory.

The primary advantage of this ability is that memories stored in a metalmind do not decay over time, when a memory is recovered it will be as fresh in the feruchemists mind as it was the day it was stored even if years have passed in the mean time. This is a big deal especially in a pre-internet society as copper feruchemists can carry around entire libraries worth of information on their person. Only declarative memories can be stored in a coppermind (no skills or muscle memory).

Repeatedly storing and tapping a memory does slowly degrade it, with this effect being worse the longer the memory spends in your mind, so copper feruchemists typically carry multiple copies of vital information in their metalminds (these can, for instance, be made by having someone repeat the information back to the feruchemist after they stored it).

Like any form of feruchemy, copperminds created by one feruchemist cannot be tapped by another feruchemist. This unfortunately means that you can't really use this ability for communication, but it also means that feruchemically stored information is safe from being read by others even if they did manage to get a hold of your metalminds.

*Compounding*

Burning a feruchemically charged piece of copper lets you vividly relive the memory stored in that piece of copper. This allows you to store more of that memory in a coppermind (simplifying the process of making backups), but it also allows the compounder to review a memory for things that they missed the first time around.
