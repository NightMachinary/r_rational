Copper feruchemists may be very good for jobs that involve confidentiality, such as spies or detectives, or even more peaceful professions like doctors and lawyers. You can hire a copper feruchemist to handle your matters privately, then ask them to store away their memories of you into a piece of copper and give it to you. That way it ensures that they have absolutely no memory of the event and your secrets stay hidden. Then you can throw that piece of copper into a volcano or something to keep it that way.

The main problem is ensuring that the copper feruchemist truthfully stores the memories into the copper given to you. You can hire a bronze allochemist to check whether the copper feruchemist is storing memories, but you wouldn't be able to tell which memory is being stored. You would need some other method of truth detection.
