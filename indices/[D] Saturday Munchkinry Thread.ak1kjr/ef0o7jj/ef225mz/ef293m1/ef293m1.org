A sufficiently skilled tin savant could determine the truth of someone's statements by examining micro expressions, tiny changes in heart rate, hormonal secretions, etc.

Admittedly very few individuals have demonstrated this ability and they were generally outliers in some way.

On an individual level copper could be used to meaningfully play a game of chess or any other turn based game with yourself by having two separate copper minds for each 'player'. Forgetting your plans and strategies for the other side while deciding your move, storing all that away and drawing from your other coppermind.
