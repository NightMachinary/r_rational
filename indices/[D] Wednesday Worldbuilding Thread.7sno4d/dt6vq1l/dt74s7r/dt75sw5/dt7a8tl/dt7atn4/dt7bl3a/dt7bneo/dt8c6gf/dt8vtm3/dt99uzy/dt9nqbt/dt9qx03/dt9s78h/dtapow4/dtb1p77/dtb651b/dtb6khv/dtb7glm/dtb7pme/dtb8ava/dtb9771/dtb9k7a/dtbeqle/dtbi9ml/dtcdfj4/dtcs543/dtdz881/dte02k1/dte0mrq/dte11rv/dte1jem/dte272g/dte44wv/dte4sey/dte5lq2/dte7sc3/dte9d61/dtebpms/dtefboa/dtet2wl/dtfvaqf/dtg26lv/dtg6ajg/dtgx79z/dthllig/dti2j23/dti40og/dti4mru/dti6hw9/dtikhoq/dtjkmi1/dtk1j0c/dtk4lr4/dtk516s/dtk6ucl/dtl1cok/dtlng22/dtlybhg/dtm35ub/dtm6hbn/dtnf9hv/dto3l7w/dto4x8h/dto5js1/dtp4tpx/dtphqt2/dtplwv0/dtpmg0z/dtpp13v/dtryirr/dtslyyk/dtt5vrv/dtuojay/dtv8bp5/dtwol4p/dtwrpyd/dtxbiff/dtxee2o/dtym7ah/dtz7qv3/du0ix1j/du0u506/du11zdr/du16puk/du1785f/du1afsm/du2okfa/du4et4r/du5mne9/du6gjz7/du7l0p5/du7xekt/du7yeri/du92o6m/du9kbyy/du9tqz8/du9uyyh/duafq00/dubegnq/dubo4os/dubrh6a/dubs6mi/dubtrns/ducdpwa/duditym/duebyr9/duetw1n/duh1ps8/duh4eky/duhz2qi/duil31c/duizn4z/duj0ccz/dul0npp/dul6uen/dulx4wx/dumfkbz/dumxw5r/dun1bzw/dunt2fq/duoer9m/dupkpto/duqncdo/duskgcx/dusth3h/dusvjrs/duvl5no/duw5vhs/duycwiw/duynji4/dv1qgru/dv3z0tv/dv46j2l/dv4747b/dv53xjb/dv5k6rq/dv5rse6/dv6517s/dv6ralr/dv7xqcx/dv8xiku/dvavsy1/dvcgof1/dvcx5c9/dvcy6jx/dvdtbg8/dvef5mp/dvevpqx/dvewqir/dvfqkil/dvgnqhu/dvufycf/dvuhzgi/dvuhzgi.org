To be honest - I don't like it. Some feedback I got on the story (about a different issue) was "if a character graphically tortures puppies in the first act, then spends the second act undergoing character growth, and in the third act realises how wrong it is to hurt puppies, it doesn't matter that she learned the error of her ways: people are still going to hate her because she tortured puppies".

Your idea, while very good, interesting, and horrific, makes William hard to redeem, and he's already going to be facing an uphill battle in that department. Besides: I don't think he'd pick a "troublesome" thrall. It's not like thralls are lobotomised; they are just fiercely loyal and generally pathologise the feeling as a deep love (romantic, familial, or platonic). I think, in general, William would pick brother or daughter figures.

At the moment, I've got a roughly acceptable workaround: Paola is a staff member at the vampire hotel, whose job is to do exactly what she does with William: act as an "onsite/backup thrall" who knows the area, has access to local resources, etc. It is a variant of #1, but I feel it's less of an asspull because it stands to reason that a /hotel for vampires/ would have a 'bodyguard' onsite who was trustworthy. I'm going to see if I can put her into the background of an earlier scene so it doesn't seem like as much of an asspull, too.

Thanks for taking the time to reply! I really appreciate the idea, it is really cool to imagine a protestor or suffragette or something getting embroiled in all this. We're just in the unenviable position of having the main love interest be a reforming psychopath.
