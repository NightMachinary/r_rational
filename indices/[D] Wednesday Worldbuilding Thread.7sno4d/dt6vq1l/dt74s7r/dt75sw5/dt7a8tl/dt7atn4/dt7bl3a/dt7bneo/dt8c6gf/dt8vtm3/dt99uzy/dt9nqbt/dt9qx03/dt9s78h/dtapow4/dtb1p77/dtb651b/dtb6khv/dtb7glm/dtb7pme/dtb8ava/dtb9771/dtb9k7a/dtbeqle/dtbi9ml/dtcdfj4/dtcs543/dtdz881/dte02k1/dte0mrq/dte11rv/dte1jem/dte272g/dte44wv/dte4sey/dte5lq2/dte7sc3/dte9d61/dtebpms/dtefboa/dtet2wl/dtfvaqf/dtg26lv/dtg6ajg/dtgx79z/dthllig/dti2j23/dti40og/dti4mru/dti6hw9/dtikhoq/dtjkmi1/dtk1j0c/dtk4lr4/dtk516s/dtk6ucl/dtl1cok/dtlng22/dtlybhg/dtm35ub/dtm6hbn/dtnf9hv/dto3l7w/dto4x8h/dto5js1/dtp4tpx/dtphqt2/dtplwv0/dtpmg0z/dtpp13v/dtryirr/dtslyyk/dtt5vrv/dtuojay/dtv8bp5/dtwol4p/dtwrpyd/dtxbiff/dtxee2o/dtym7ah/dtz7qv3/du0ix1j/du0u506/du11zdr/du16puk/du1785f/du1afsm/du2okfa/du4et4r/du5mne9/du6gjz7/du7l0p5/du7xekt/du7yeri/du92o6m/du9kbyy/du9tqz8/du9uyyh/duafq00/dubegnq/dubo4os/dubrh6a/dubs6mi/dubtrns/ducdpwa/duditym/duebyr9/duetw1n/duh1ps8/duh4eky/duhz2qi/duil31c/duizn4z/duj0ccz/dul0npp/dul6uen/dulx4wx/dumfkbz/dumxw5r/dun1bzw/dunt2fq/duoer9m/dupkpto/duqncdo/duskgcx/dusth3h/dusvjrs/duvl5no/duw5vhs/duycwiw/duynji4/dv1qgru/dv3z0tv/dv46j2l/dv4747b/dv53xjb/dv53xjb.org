  Who wants /humans/ mucking about in their antiques vault? Besides, light tends to make things fade. I mean, sure, a bit of light in the servants' quarters is one thing, but not in the /antiques/ room!

I don't know; I feel like vampires have more pressing matters to worry about than going through their antiques vault and looking over everything. Better to send a human down to fetch what you need, means you can do something else. I mean, the /really valuable stuff/, sure....

  How does this "seeing in the dark" business work, anyhow? Are they just able to see by the merest hint of ambient light, or is there more to it than that?
#+end_quote

Yeah, they wouldn't be able to see in an actual dark room (... a gargoyle probably would though with their 4D eyes...)
