  That's a pretty rare case though, I think usually the overall population increases during colonial events, localised conflicts excepted?

Brief research on Google and Wikipedia tells me that, in the case of Australia, colonisation coincided with about a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Indigenous_Australians#Impact_of_British_colonisation][ninety percent drop in Aboriginal population]] - due to a mix of such things as war, new diseases, and chasing the aboriginals away from all the good natural resources. Even today, total Aboriginal population is sitting at around 650 000, which is a bit of a drop from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Indigenous_Australians#Before_British_arrival][1.25 million]] upper estimate pre-British arrival.

There's more /total/ people in Australia now, yes. But take a look at [[http://chartsbin.com/view/eoo][this page here]], which claims to show the population of Australia over time. Now, given the low humbers in the early parts of the graph, I think it's safe to guess that they're only using the /verified/ population of Australia - i.e. those the various governments at the time recorded as citizens and counted in censuses. I.e. /not/ including the no doubt unregistered aboriginals in those early years.

Looking at that chart, it probably took seventy, maybe eighty years from colonisation for the mixed population to climb back to where it had been. Now, perhaps a vampire won't mind seventy to eighty very lean years, but that does seem like something that would bother them, especially while it was happening...

  Vampires don't need to cross the ocean in a night as a bat: they can tie heavy rocks around their necks and walk along the bottom. They don't need to breathe, after all. (Made me realise that they probably had their own transatlantic telegraph before the humans did...)

Hmmm. A valid point. It would seem rather boring, but it's probably better than hanging out within reach of the Elder Vampire that you accidentally insulted...

The real trick will be keeping track of time well enough that you don't come up on the other end twenty minutes before the local dawn. (Sealife will be a bother, but at least it'll give the vampire some blood if it tries to eat him). The other trick is not to get lost and miss the continent you were aiming for...

  Maybe Australia has a 3% indigenous population instead of a 0.3% indigenous population because of the vampire influence?
#+end_quote

...huh. Fair enough, I guess.

  [what to call a vampire's 'children']

His [[http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/progeny][scions]], perhaps? Though I like 'cub' in that last sentence; I think it helps to emphasise the relative status of Cassius and his child.
