  Yeah, good point. Never really thought of it that way; but it does make the fact that Australia hasn't recovered more even more horrible, since Aboriginals can just use the existing excellent infrastructure we have (which doesn't happen in practise as a lot of Aboriginals live in remote communities without fresh fruit and vegetables, good quality schools, healthcare, etc.... there's a saying that parts of Australia are like a third world country because of this).
#+end_quote

Yeah, infrastructure is /incredibly/ important. Get the right infrastructure and schools in place, and then getting everyone on an equal footing within a generation or two would be /substantially/ easier.

I have a guess about why Australia hasn't done that, but it's really terribly cynical.

  So like - does the average tourist / citizen have to worry about these sorts of things?
#+end_quote

I'm going to give you the worst possible answer. It depends.

As for citizens - people who actually /live/ in the gang-riddled areas have plenty to worry about. And, since no-one would live in a gang-riddled area if they had any choice in the matter, the people who live there are generally people who are /unable/ to move out for one reason or another - often that they can't afford a house anywhere else.

On the other hand, people who live in places like the area I live in, have such worries dramatically reduced.

And then there's also people who live in sort of inbetween areas, where you don't get much violence but you do get a lot of theft - the sort of place where you don't leave your car outside the garage because if you do it won't be there an hour later. That... can be livable, if you're careful. People can get used to it, and you get a few companies that sell tracking devices for cars (basically a mix of a GPS system and a radio that hides in the car so that if your car vanishes, you can call up the company and the company can get the police (or their own people) suddenly turning up wherever your car went to and hopefully ending up with the thieves arrested).

As for tourists - well, again, it depends. I /have/ heard a few horror stories (mostly entirely unsubstantiated) but in general they take on two forms; either the tourist puts their luggage down somewhere public, walks away, and comes back half an hour later to never find said luggage again; or the tourist is lured well out of sight of anyone and everyone before any trouble happens. (Due to historical reasons, we have a /very/ poorly regulated taxi industry and it's far too easy for some random person to pretend to be a taxi long enough to accept a "fare" and drive him off to some dark alley someplace).

So... yeah. In all fairness, such incidents are very, very much not the norm - but such a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Anni_Dewani][horrifying incident]], even when rare, is still not something one wants to risk.

  The "sun" part is strange, especially because a mage who made vampires vulnerable to the sun would surely make it so that a vampire would be awake when the sun was up rather than when it was down and the vampire had freedom of movement....
#+end_quote

Well, of course not. The idea is rather that there would need to have been two or more mages, working at cross-purposes - the first mage enchants Sol, because he wants to stop and/or kill all the vampires. The /second/ mage then adds the sleep-in-daytime enchantment, because he wants to (for whatever reason) /save/ the vampires - perhaps the second mage was even a vampire himself.

  The best I can think of is the algorithm of the nanites has "self-preservation" in there and the behaviour around the /magically charged sun/ is so strong that the nanites cause the vampire to fall asleep?
#+end_quote

That's also a possibility, but then wouldn't a sufficiently dark box allow the vampire to remain awake?

#+begin_quote
  I'd imagine there'd pretty soon be rules kept by certain Kings and Queens that any baby vampires must not be killed, for they make it too easy to hide your secrets. Putting more pressure on thralls again!
#+end_quote

[[/flutterkay][]] They can't complain about baby vampires that they don't know about, right?

Besides, why would they care? /They're/ not at risk...
