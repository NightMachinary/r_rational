And it's on country roads where kangaroos can just come at you from nowhere (self-driving cars tested in Aus are having a lot of trouble detecting roos because they don't move like cows/deer do).

... it never occurred to me that Victorian flower language was a transplant from Vampire flower language but it makes PERFECT sense: some young vampire wrote it down somewhere, and a human found it, thought it was neat, and the trend spread amongst humans thereafter. Maybe it was in the effects of a vampire who died in that plague....

Nah, they carefully choose servants who don't understand the languages they prefer to write in. As you note further, they tend to make their correspondence in ancient languages where possible:

  /Ever since they arrived in Corsica, William had been receiving regular letters; thick wax-sealed sheaves of paper that were covered in meticulously hand-written script, most of it in languages Red couldn't identify, let alone read./

They probably also have a secret code. I want it to be Linear A because I think that would be entertaining (and then a linguist finds some vampire communication in Linear A and there's enough of it for them to decypher it!), but probably it'd just be something like ancient Korean that is perfectly understandable to modern scholars but the vampires just take care not to take any experts in Korean antiquities. And you're kind of just expected to learn ancient Korean once you get turned because otherwise how the hell are you going to talk to anyone?

I'm imagining William talking to Red soon after turning him into a vampire:

"Okay my love, now, let's work on your letter forms..."

"What hte hell babe? Is this chinese?"

"No, it is Korean from the Wang dynasty, circa 500 BCE"

".... why are you teaching me this?"

"you're going to write Elizabeth a letter announcing your intention to visit her"

"she speaks English! I've spoken to her in English!"

" you don't do formal letters in the local language, my dear."

"She speaks French too! I've heard you speaking it to her! I can just write in French, if it's so important. Why do I need to learn Korean?"

(long sigh) "my dear, you have much left to learn"
