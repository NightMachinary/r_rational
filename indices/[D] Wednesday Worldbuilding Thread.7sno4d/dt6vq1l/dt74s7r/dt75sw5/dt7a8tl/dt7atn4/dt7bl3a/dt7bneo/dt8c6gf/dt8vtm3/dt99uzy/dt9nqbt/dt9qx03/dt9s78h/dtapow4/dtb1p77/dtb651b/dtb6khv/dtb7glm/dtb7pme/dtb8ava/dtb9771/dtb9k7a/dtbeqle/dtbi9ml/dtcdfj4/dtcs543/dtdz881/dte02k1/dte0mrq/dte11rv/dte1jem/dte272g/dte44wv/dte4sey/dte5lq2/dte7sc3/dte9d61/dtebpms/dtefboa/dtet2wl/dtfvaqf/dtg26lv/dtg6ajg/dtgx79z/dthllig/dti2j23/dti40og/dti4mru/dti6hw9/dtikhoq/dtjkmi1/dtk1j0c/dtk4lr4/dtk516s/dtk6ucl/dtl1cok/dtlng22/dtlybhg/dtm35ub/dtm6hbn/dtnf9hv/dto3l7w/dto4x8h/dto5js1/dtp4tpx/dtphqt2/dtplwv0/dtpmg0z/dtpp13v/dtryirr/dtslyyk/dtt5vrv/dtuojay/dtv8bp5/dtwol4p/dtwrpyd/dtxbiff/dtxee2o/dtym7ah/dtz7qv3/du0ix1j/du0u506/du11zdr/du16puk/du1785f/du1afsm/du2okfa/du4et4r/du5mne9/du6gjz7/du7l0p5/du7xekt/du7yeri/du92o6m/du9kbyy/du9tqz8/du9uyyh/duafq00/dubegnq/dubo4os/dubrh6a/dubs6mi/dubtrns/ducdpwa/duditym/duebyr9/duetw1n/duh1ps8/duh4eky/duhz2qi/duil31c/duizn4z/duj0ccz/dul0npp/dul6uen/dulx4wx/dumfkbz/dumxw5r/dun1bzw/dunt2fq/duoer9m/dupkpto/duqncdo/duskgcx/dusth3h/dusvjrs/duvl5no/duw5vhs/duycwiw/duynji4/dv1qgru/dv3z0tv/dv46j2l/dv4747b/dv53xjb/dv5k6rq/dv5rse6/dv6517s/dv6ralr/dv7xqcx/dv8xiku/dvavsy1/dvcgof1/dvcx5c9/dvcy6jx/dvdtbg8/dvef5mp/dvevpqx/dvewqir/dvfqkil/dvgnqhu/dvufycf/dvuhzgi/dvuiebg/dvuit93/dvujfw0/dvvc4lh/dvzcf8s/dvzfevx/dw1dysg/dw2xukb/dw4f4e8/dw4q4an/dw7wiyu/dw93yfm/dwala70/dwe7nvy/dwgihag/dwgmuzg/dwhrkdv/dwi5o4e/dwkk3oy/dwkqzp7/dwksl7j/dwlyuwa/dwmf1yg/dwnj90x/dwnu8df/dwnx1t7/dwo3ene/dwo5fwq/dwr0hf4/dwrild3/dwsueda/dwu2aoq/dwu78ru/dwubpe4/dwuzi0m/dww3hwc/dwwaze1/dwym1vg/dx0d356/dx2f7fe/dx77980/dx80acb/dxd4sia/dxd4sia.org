  Or the colonists had an older, stronger vampire and the Tasmanians' vampire lord was giving them pointers on how to take care of it?
#+end_quote

Now that you mention it... that actually does fit better.

#+begin_quote
  modern vampires are aware of the Catastrophe and how much the population fell as a result, and are as such aware that the same thing could happen to humans, so they allow themselves that buffer.
#+end_quote

This was more or less what I was thinking, yes - they police themselves to /deliberately/ allow themselves that buffer.

#+begin_quote
  Looks like we're both right: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy_compensator_(diving)]]
#+end_quote

Huh. Looking over that link... transpacific vampires can't use buoyancy compensators.

Or - let me rephrase that - they can't use buoyancy compensators for /long/. Because the gasses will leak and before they've gone two days' swim, there won't be any left unless they start with an impractically high number of air cylinders...

  (The weights make sense too because in an emergency situation a human diver can just throw the weights to the sea floor and float more easily to the surface - the bends is probably preferable to suffocating due to a faulty piece of equipment, after all)
#+end_quote

The bends are nasty, but not - generally - lethal, it would seem. Interestingly, it looks like vampires could also suffer from the bends - as it's entirely due to pressure differentials and not a germ-based disease - but their regeneration probably masks any and all symptoms, so none of them ever notice.

  Full body wetsuit? Including the head/eyes? That's a bit... hard to imagine, right?
#+end_quote

Fishbowl helmet? Filled with argon so there's no usable air in there?

#+begin_quote
  I'd imagine the more naked you are the faster you can regenerate in a low gas environment?
#+end_quote

That depends - if it's "most skin contact with organic molecules", then the one in the rubber suit might heal faster - until his suit finishes dissolving, of course.

#+begin_quote
  after all if you had a vampire weapon and it destroyed your nice hardwood floor when it regenerated, that's a problem.
#+end_quote

That's true - and, to tie that back into another famous piece of vampire mythology, maybe their creator liked his wooden floors enough that he deliberately coded in an /exception/ for wood, so their bodies expel anything non-organic and use anything organic, except wood, to repair themselves. So wood is then the only thing that, if you stab them with it and leave the weapon in the wound, they stay stabbed...

#+begin_quote
  Why Turn when you can make someone a Thrall? They are at least beholden to you, rather than a Childe who'd be open to negotiating with other vampires to get a better position than you're giving them - in exchange for your death and a nice cut of your territory, of course.
#+end_quote

[[/batshy][]] But a thrall has to be fed, at least once a week. Who wants to continually interrupt their serious research to bother with /that/?

#+begin_quote
  Does it have to be inserted?
#+end_quote

No, it doesn't. Apologies, poor phrasing on my part.

#+begin_quote
  I pictured them in that scene to be standing in the kitchen, since the bosses are in the dining room, and I don't imagine the kitchen as having chairs: it's off on one end of the house, with a long bench and an oven at the very far end and an icebox and some shelves/etc. Nothing like the modern kitchens where you tend to be able to sit and eat breakfast.
#+end_quote

Ah. But then they never pace slightly, lean against a countertop (or a stove), shift their weight, etc...

[[/spikeapproves][]] Good work on the senses! I noticed smell, touch, /and/ sound in there, so well done!

[[/sp][]]

This is actually a good deal /less/ creepy than the previous scene... which implies that a lot of Lucia's creepiness might have been her phrasing things so that the vampires wouldn't mind overhearing her.
