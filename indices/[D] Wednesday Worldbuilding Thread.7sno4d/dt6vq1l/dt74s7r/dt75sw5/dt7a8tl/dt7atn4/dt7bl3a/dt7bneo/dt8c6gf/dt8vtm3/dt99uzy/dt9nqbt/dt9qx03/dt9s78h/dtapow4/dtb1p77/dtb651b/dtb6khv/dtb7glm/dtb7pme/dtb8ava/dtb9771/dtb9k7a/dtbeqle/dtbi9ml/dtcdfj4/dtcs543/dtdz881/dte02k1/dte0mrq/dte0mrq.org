  Yes, they're vulnerable, but they won't like being reminded of that...

I don't know if I was a vampire I'd be constantly aware of the danger of the sun and doing everything I could to mitigate it.

  William presumably makes the fire look like an accident as well - electric systems sparking or something, not the arson it is.

Yeah, absolutely; a very quick skim of some [[http://www.firescientist.com/Documents/The%20Evolution%20of%20Fire%20Investigation,%201977-2011.pdf][relevant papers]] shows that arson investigation science was well and truly in its infancy in the 1970s, and while vampires might have a special interest in arson, they are probably not 50 years ahead of the game.

Plus William probably set, like, a whole street on fire. Collateral damage? Pfft.

There's probably a vampire proverb along those lines: "Keep one eye on your enemies, for they can ruin you. But keep both eyes on your friends, for they are the only ones who have anything to gain by killing you".
