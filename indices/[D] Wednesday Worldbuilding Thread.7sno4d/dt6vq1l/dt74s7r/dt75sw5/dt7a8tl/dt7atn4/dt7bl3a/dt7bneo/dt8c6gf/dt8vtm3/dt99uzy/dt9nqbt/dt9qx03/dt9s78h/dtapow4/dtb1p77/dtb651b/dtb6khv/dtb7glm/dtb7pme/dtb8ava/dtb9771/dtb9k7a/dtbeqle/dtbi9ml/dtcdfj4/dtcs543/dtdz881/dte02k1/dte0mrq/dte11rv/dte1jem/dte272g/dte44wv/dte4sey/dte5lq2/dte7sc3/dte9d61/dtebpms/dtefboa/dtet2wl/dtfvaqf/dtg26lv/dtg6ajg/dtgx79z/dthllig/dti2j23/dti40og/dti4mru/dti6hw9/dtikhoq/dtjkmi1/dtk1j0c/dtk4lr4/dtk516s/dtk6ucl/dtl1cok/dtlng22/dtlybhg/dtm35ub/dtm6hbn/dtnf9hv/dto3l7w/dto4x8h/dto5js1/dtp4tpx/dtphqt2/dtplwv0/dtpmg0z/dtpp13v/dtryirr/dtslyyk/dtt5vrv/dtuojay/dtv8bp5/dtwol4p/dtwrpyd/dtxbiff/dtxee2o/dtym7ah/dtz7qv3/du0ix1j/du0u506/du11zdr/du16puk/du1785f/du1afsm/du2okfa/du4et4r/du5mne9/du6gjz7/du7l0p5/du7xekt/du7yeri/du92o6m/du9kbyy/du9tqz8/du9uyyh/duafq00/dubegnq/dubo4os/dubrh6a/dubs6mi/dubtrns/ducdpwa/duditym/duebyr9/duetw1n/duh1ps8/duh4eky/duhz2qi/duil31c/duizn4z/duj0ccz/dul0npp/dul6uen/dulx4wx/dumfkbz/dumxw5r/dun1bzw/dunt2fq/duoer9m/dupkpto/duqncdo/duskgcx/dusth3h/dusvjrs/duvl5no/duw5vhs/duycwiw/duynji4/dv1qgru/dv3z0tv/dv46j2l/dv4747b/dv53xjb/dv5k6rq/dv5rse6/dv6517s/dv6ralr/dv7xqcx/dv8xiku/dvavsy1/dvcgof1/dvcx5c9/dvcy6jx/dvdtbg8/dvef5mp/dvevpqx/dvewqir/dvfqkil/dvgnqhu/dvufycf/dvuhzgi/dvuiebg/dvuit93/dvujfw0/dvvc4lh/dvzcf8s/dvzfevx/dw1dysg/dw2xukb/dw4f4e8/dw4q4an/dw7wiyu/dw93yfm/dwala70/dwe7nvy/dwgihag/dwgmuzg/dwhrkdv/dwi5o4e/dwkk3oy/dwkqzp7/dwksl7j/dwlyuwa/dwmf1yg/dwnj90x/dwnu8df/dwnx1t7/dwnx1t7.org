  Wasn't that because Cassius was trying to scam William out of a duchy that he forced them together, though?

Hmm, never thought how "long" a game Cassius is playing. If he does want to get a controlling stake in William's kingdom, then it does make sense for him to put a juicy human in William's view (maybe he's been doing this for decades, and Red was the one who stuck).

Probably Cassius is playing a /generic/ long game: he staffs his hotel with humans he thinks his vampire friends would like, and then tries to make sure people with stuff he wants have reason to visit Rome.

  Cassius can make up any false reason he wants - maybe he'll claim he has a contact who makes electrum bullets super cheap or whatever.

Also, probably the reason Paola is one of Cassius's favourite humans is because she does /not/ ask a lot of questions.
