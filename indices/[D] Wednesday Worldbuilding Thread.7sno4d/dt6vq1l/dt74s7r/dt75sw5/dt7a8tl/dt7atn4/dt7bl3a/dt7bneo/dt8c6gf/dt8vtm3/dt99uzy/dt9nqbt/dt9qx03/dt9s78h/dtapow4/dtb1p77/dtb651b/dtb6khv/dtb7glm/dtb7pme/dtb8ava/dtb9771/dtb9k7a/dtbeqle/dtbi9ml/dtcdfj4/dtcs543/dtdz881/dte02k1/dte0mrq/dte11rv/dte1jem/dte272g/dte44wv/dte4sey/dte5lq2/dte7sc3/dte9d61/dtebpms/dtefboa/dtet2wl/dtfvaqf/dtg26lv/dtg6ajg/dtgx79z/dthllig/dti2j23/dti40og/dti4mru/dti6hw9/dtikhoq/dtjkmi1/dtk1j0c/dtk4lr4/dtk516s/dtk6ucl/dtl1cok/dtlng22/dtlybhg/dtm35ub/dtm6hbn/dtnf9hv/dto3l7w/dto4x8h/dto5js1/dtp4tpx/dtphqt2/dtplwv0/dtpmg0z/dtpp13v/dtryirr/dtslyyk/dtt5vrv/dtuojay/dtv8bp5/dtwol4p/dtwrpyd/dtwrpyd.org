Eh, the Atlanteans could have made clockwork horses work. But I see your point.

  No, I'm not! But as the book club co-czar maybe I'll put that on the list. It sounds like a great concept!

It is!

You've got this bunch of completely different aliens all living together in a kind of a federation in approximate peace and more or less harmony. (Well - no-one's currently /actively/ at war with anyone else). There's the Hani, who are more or less what you get if you give lions Human-equivalent intelligence and thumbs. (Only Hani females ever go to space or interact with aliens - Hani males are considered too violent for civilisation). Then there's the Mahendosat, gorilla-like primates who are fiercely individualistic (no matter what your cause, you can find a Mahen willing to back it). The Stsho, herbivores psychologically incapable of violence (but perfectly capable of paying other people to be violent on their behalf) whose personalities fracture under stress and have oron control over the banking sector. The Kif, who hold a specieswide attitude of 'if you can't prove it, it didn't happen' and don't consider murder or torture a crime (or particularly remarkable, for that matter).

And then there's the various methane-breather civilisations, which are just /strange/. The T'ca are the only ones who've cracked the thorny problem of communication with oxygen-breathers (above) and they do so in a matrix that can be read equally well in multiple directions - it does fine for simple concepts, but no-one's ever quite managed to explain the idea of a 'traffic lane' to them (as a result, methane-breather ships get automatically classed Navigation Hazard because you never know /where/ the thing will go). There's the Chi, who may or may not be sentient (some think they're just pets of the /knnn/). And, of course, the /knnn/, who only the T'ca and Chi can communicate with - but they have the best technology in the Compact. And the only way anyone knows this is because their ships regularly do things that are outright impossible for any other species.

The first story starts by pretty much dropping a human into this situation, and suddenly everyone's interested in the opportunities for trade represented by a new species...
