Also, don't worry about not replying or meeting some schedule: I am acutely aware how fortunate I am to have someone like you who is so interested in the worldbuilding, and the radio silence I just took as you saying "thankyou for the chat, I will see you around". (I did mention to callmesalticidae that I was wondering if you were alive, but that was a joke!).

Yeah - to keep going with the analogy, I've got William kicking puppies, but not outright torturing them. We'll find out he tortures them, but never directly see it.

Hell, I probably owe you an excerpt by now? This is not kicking puppies, I guess. This is glaring at puppies? I dunno.

The argument we're working on rewriting is going to have some probably worse stuff in it though. Overall, vampire psycopathy, it's a lot of little things: when readers get a glimpse into his PoV, it's... not pretty, and I try to do it sparingly.

context: Red wants to watch William feed, to "protect" him, because he's worried about William

--------------

The next day, Red was waiting in the sitting room at sun down, nursing a thick mug of coffee. He wore clothing that was more typically Corsican than his usual style and darkly coloured, following William's instructions to appear as ordinary and invisible as possible.

When William entered the room, his expression was far more sombre than usual. He was, as always, overdressed: black pants, a blue shirt, suspenders and his thick black gloves. Apparently it was not necessary that he blend in.

“Are you absolutely sure you wish to come with me, my dear?” He asked, businesslike.

Red got to his feet to squeeze William's gloved hand. “I'm sure.”

William gently pulled his hand away and took a small step away from Red. “You will not find it enjoyable. It does not look as pleasurable as it feels.”

“I'll be fine.”

“Then follow me.” He murmured, choosing a heavy black winter coat from the rack by the door. Red shrugged his own coat on, fastening the buttons. In the cold December air, he wished he'd thought to wear gloves of his own.

They reached the centre of town after a fifteen minute walk; the uneven cobblestone streets made a maze of alleyways. William ducked into the entrance of a particularly cold, dark laneway, and Red followed close behind him.

Red scanned his surroundings, his hands buried in his jacket pockets for warmth. At the end of the alley, a man leaned against the wall, fidgeting. He was advanced in age; probably a grandfather many times over. He wore an old but well-kept heavy grey coat and a black hat with white trim. He kept on moving his hand to his breast pocket where the outline of a pack of cigarettes was visible.

“Is that him?”

William nodded. “Yes, it is.” He stared at Red, waiting to see if he would change his mind now that the reality was before them.

Red waited, not knowing that William was waiting for his approval. He realised with a start, and then gestured with one hand and nodding. He felt uncomfortable, like he was at one of his sister's parties.

William smiled and clasped Red's hand, giving it a firm squeeze. He walked deeper into the alley with deliberate steps, walking loud enough that the old man could hear him. To Red, these movements seemed almost comical on someone who normally walked with so much grace.

Red's amusement was short lived; the old man saw William and gave what looked to Red to be a lecherous grin. It gave Red a sour feeling to his stomach. He tried to ignore it.

William walked right up to the man, standing very close, their chests almost touching. They spoke a few words to one another, quieter than Red could hope to hear. He found he was glad for it.

William grabbed the old man, pushing his head aside and burying his face in the old man's wrinkled neck. The man cried out in shock and gave a low, pained moan. Red knew that he made noises when William fed from him, but he never imagined that they sounded like that. William roughly placed his hand over the old man's mouth, to silence his screams, in a gesture that had seemed tender and loving when he'd done it to Red when they were at the hotel. As the man stood there, moaning into William's glove, Red could see his bright eyes begin to go glassy as he struggled for breath. Finally, able to bear it no longer, Red looked away.

The ordeal lasted another five minutes - easily twice as long as Red had ever been fed from - and then Red heard the dull moan stop as William let the man go and walked away. The man sank to the floor, a grin on his face. The moment William was back at the entrance of the alley, the old man reached into his pocket, pulled out a cigarette, struck a match, and lit it. His movements seemed more fluid, more comfortable.

William took a step forward and hugged Red. After a few minutes, Red pulled away, giving William a small, slightly strained smile.

They began the walk home in silence.

“You need not come again.” William said after a minute and a half.

Red considered this, this time being the one to draw out the silence. “How often do you get hurt? When you go out?”

“As badly as this? Not since before that time.”

“You said you had been stabbed and run over by horses?”

“Those are minor inconveniences.”

“Hm.” Red paused, moving to take William's hand. “I don't know what I would do if anything happened to you.”

“You know where I keep the money and travel papers. You can do as you will with those, if it came to that.”

Red frowned, trying to figure out whether William was making a joke. When he realised that he was serious, Red continued. “The money wouldn't matter to me. I would... miss you.” He said finally, aware how the words weren't quite enough.

“Better you miss me living in comfort than miss me working dangerous jobs for enough bread to get by.” To William, the thought of Red outliving him was fanciful.

“You are maddening, sometimes.” Red smiled, his voice full of affection.

“And you are too sentimental, my dear.” He squeezed Red's hand.
