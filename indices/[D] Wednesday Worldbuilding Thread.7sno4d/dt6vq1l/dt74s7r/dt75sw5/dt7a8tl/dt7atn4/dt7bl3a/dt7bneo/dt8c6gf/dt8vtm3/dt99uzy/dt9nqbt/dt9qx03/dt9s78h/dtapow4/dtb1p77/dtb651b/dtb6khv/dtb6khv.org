Cassius' point of view really paints William as a terrible guy:

- William is one of the other survivors of the Catastrophe who he always kind of knew but was never too close with, but they seemed to forge a decent friendship as long as religion was not discussed
- He gives William a pretty good human slave, even though William is not necessarily going to take good care of him.
- In exchange, he manages to get William to place his child, Junior (name TBC), in a small backwater city in a remote part of Australia. This is good because Junior has annoyed a bunch of more powerful vampires, but Cassius feels a responsibility to the human he turned into a vampire, and thinks that growing up in "his own space" will allow Junior to become a good vampire in time
- He puts William in touch with Elodia, who owns the safest place to hide an American in WW2 Europe (Corsica). Cassius and Elodia aren't on the best of terms and Cassius is hoping that William living near Elodia will help improve relations.
- William then, after training a PERFECTLY GOOD HUMAN improperly, declares war on Elodia rather than letting her just kill that human, worsening diplomatic relations for NO REASON since William is particularly willing to kill humans as vampires go
- After being defeated in the war, William manages to negotiate a way out of killing the human (WHICH HE COULD HAVE DONE IN THE FIRST PLACE), which involves killing Junior instead, because for some reason he'd rather kill one of his close allies' children than some human he met like six months ago - and of course he doesn't admit it, ask for permission, offer some sort of trade (it'd have to be a damn good one) - he just does it secretly and makes it look like an accident so Cassius doesn't realise it happened until 60 years later when he's auditing his psychic breeding programme
- This entire 60 years he is using that human that he only got because Cassius was willing to give to him, after causing all that damn trouble
- Finally, but before Cassius' breeding programme reveals William's deception, Cassius has another child who needs to be kept out of the way in Australia for a few decades and arranges for her to be sent down to Australia for William to keep an eye on
- The vampire hunters that William has left alive FOR NO DISCERNABLE REASON kill his child
- Now William is responsible for two of his children dying, shows no remorse, says that /he/ wasn't responsible because he was no longer the King of New Holland, this random vampire who nobody has ever heard of even though William says she's at least 5,000 years old - older than ANY of them - because she can walk in the sun
- So Cassius challenges this vampire to combat, this vampire turns out to be a FUCKING ANDROID, and she kicks his arse because Cassius doesn't realise she's an android until it's too late, so Cassius dies(? not sure if I want him to die but I think if I don't do that he's gonna kill William and sorry Cassius William is the protag not you)
