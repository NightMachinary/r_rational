  I don't recall that particular excerpt-of-an-excerpt (I do recall the scene you mention later, I suspect that the scene you showed me earlier may have been the discussion William and Cassius had after that excerpt-of-an-excerpt), but yes, that was pretty much precisely the sort of scene I was talking about.

Excellent!!! See, I am one step ahead of you sometimes!

    just like the genre of sci-fi sucks because everything goes FTL
  #+end_quote

  Some of the best sci-fi I know includes FTL travel. Have you ever read the /Chanur/ series?
#+end_quote

Yep, it's this month's book club book and I've been meaning to post a discussion for it but I got the flu (IN AUTUMN!?!??!) so I was severely confined to bed because I was in too much pain to even watch TV (can you imagine???)

I... didn't really like it, I found parts of it interesting but I think it's too 1980s sci-fi for me. (That said... I loved Dragon's Egg...). I get the feeling it's one of those books where if you read 300,000 words you'll see the majesty of it (my husband's girlfriend's partner is a huge fan of Cherryh and leant me his kindle, I feel bad that I'm gonna have to disappoint him).

But my point in what I was saying was more that, "some genres have tropes that make them suck in various ways", and Romance's equivalent of rubber-forehead aliens, FTL, technobabble, and Future Where Everyone Is Just As Racist and Sexist As Today is the idea of a love interest who is actually terrible.

    There's a later scene where William and Cassius negotiate before the war starts, I could see Cassius offering a wager and William refusing, and then being relieved when the human in peril survives.
  #+end_quote

  Could work to show how much William has grown - and since he hasn't taken the bet, he can even step in to help the human without being accused of cheating, if he doesn't mind a snarky comment from Cassius.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I'm trying to think what it could be. I have them meeting outside a church (I tried to pick a landmark that would have been around in the 1940s and this worked), so perhaps they could be watching a beggar and Cassius proposes to bet whether anyone will donate to him and William just rolls his eyes, grabs a few weeks' wages out of his pocket, and tosses it into the beggar's cup and then goes "I don't have time for silly games, let's talk business?"... and slip in an earlier scene where Red puts money into a beggar's cup, explaining that sometikmes when he first moved to Rome that's the only way he got to eat...

    Trying to think of a way to put... like a vampire tidbit in there, or something.

  [[/twiponder][]] Hmmm... foreshadowing of some sort, perhaps? Perhaps Paola's in the kitchen, preparing blood pudding with alarming efficiency and showing off her enhanced reactions?
#+end_quote

I did more "she seems old", but I wrote it in early draft form and have a pretty bad flu right now (well, it's calmed down enough that I'm up to redditing again), so I'd value your input in terms of content - the flow is crap and has some obvious placeholders, and of course no senses yet. I think coauthor will fix it up in that regard in a few hours, but I think it needs a little more... pizzazz somehow.

Red was always nervous speaking to Paola, ever since she first spoke to him. It had been a few months ago [work out timeline: Red fled in January, I think we're in May?], he had been going door-to-door, offering to do cleaning, building, mending in his awful Italian. But she had approached him, said her hotel needed a night porter urgently, and that she wanted to trial him. He'd been grateful for the opportunity, even if it was coming from a woman who looked to be his younger sister's age and thus perhaps not experienced enough to run a reputable hotel. Most of all, he'd been intimidated by her: she'd represented stable employment, and he didn't want to mess things up. He didn't want to mess this up, now. He knew that if things didn't work out with William he'd have to try to get his job back, so he wanted to part on good terms.

“Singora Di Pietro?” Red murmured, knocking on her open door. [the office is small, sparsely decorated. It has a window with no curtains - unusual for this hotel as most have blackout curtains - looking out on the piazza with the pantheon. There's some tall, locked lockers against a wall, and another wall has some crossed ornate swords that Red thinks looks more functional than purely ornate]

“Yes, Mister Rossi?” She spoke to him in English, but, he reflected, their conversations did not feel smooth and comfortable the way his conversations with William did; she gave the subtle impression that he was not worth her time. Not enough to be rude, just an undercurrent of impatience.

Red cleared his throat, and did something with his hands to indicate he was nervous. “I won't be coming in for work tomorrow. Probably not ever again.”

“Why?” She looked up from the letter she was writing.

“One of the guests has asked me to work as his valet, full-time, so I won't be able to stay on.”

Paola nodded. “Ah, yes. I had noticed Mister Ryan had taken a liking to you.”

Red felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up; something made him feel exposed, as though the other staff were talking about him behind his back, gossiping in rapid-fire Italian. He knew that couldn't be the case: moving the furniture, storing the trunk in the cloakroom, those had to have come to her attention.

“I'm sorry,” Red murmured. “It meant a lot, really, an awful lot that you hired me with my Italian being so bad. But he gave me an offer that I can't refuse.”

“Believe it or not, this is not the first time that such a thing has occurred.” Paola turned her attention back to her letter: she wrote with a quill, another bizarre habit of hers.

“He wants me to start tomorrow night.” Red continued. “But if you're short, I can work something out with him so I can cover the desk when you need.”

Paola shook her head. “No, Mister Rossi. You are excused. It is a most high acclaim of the quality of our staff when our most discerning clients take such a liking to them.”

Red nodded. “Thank you, Signora Di Pietro.

i gave her a quill and that's waaaay too much as quills actually sucked and any quill user would LOVE a pen, so i'll go and replace that with a dip-nib pen or even just give her a fountain pen.
