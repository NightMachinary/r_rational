  Simple, immediate solution - it does apply everywhere, but only to her bones; bullets still ruin clothes, smash through skin, and so on.

Then they'd richochet off her hard bones rather than harmlessly pass through them. Ugh. Logic is hard.

  Have you ever heard of a concept called forward error correction?

Yep, was thinking about something along those lines.

oh, right. Ugh. Maybe... they can hear the gun cocking? But that does't need to happen immediately before the shot, so no. They are just always listening for the tell-tale sign of someone squeezing a trigger?

So... still got nothing to explain how vampires can survive headshots from hollow point bullets or large gauge bullets. And these have existed for 100+ years so would be well known by vampire hunters.

I mean at the end of the day it strains credulity that a creature would be able to survive having their head blown up. So maybe they can't. Maybe a lot of vampire hunting consists of shooting them with scary bullets.

At least my "vampire hunters kill vampires" story is set in Australia so won't involve guns much (... I wonder if police officers are allowed to keep guns at home?)
