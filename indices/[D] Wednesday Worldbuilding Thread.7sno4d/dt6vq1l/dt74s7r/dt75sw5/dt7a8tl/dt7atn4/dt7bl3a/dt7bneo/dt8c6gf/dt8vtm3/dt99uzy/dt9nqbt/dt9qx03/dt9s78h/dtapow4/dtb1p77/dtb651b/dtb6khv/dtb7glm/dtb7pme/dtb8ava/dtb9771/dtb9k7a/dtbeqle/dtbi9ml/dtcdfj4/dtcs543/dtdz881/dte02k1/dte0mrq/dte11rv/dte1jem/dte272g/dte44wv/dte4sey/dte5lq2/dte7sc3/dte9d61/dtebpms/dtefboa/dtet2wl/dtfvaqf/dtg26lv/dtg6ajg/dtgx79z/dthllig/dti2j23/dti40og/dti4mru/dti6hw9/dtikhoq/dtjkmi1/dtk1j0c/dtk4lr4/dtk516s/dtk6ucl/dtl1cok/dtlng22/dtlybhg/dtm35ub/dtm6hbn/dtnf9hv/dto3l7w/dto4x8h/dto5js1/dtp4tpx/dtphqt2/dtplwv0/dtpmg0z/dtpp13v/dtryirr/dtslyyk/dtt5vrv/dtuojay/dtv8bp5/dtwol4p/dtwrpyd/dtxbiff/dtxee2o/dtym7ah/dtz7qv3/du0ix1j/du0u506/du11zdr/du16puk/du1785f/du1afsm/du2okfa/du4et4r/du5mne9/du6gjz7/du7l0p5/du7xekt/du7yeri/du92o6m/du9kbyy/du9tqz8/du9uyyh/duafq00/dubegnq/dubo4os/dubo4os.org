  The French system is the same as the German: no rhyme or reason. There's a few rules of thumb:

There's rules of thumb in German, too. The major one there is that if it is actually referring to a person, then the gender usually matches the person (i.e. 'waiter' would be male, 'waitress' would be female, etc.).

I say /usually/ for a reason. The German word for 'little girl' is /neuter/.

    If you are not a fan of coconut, don't worry you can't taste it. This cake is so chocolatey it is covering the coconut flavor.

...I don't even pick up on that as odd phrasing at all, for some reason. Both "it is covering" and "it covers" pass through my parsing routines without so much as a flicker. (Though, looking at it again, I think that "This cake is so chocolatey /that/ it is covering the coconut flavor" might be technically more correct).

Ooooh, that does look like fun. Let's see what I get...

  Our top three guesses for your native (first) language: 1. English 2. Norwegian 3. Dutch

South African, first language English. Nailed it perfectly. (The Dutch in there probably reflects some slight influence from Afrikaans - because Afrikaans is to Dutch more or less what American is to English).

  Good question. I can't think of Esperanto doing that but French does it with negations. It really would depend on what I was trying to communicate.

Going back to Afrikaans, let's consider the sentence "I like to read books." This would translate to "Ek hou om boeke te lees", where the words mean:

- Ek: I
- Hou: Like
- Boeke: Books
- Lees: Read
- Om te: To

So, Afrikaans takes the word 'to' and splits it into different places in the sentence.
