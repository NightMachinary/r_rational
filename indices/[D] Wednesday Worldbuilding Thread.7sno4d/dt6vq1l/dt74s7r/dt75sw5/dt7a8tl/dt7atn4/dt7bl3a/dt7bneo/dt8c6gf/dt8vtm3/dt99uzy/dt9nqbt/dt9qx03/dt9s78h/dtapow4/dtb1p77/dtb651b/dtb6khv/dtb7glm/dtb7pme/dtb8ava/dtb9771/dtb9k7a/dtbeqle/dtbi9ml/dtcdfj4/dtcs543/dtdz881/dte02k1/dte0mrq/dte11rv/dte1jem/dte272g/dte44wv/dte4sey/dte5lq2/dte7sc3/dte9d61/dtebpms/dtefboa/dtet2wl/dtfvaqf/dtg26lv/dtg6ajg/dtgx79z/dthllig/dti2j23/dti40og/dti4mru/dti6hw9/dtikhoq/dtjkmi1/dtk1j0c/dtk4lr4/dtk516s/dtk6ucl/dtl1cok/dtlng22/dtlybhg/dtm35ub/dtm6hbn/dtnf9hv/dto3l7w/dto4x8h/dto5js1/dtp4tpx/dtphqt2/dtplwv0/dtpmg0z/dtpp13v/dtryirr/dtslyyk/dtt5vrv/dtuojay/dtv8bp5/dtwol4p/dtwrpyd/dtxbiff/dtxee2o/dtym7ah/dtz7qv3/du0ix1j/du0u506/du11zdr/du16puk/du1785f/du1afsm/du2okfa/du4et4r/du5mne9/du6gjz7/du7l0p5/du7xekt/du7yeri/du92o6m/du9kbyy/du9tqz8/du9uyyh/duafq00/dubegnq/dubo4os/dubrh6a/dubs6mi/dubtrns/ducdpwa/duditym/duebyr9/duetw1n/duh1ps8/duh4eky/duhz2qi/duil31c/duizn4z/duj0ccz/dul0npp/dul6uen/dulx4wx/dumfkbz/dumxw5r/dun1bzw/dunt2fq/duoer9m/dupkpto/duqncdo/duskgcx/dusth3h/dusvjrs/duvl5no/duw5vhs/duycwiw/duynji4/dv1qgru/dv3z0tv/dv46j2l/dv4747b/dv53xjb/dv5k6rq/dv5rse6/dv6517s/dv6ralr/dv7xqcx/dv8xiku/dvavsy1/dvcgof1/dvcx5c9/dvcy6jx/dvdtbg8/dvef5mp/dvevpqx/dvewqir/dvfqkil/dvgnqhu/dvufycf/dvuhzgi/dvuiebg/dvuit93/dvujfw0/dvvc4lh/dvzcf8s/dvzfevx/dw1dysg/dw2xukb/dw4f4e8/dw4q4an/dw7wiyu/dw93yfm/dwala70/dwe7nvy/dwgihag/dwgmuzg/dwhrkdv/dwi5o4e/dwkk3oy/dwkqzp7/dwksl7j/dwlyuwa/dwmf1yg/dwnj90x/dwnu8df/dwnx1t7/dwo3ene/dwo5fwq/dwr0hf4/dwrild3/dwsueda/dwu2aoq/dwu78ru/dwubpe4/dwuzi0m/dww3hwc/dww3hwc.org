  colonisation coincided with about a ninety percent drop in Aboriginal population
#+end_quote

Over 112 years, it's not like it happened overnight. How that drop was allocated over time is definitely an interesting question.

  - i.e. those the various governments at the time recorded as citizens and counted in censuses. I.e. not including the no doubt unregistered aboriginals in those early years.

  Now, perhaps a vampire won't mind seventy to eighty very lean years, but that does seem like something that would bother them, especially while it was happening...
#+end_quote

Aboriginals were not included in the census until something ridiculous like 1960, so within 70 years the immigrant population equalled the original native population. So I think the overall population probably didn't fall too quickly too soon.

And don't forget, the migrants lived in one small part of the country: Western Australia wasn't colonised until the 1830s, so for 70 years the vampires living in WA were effectively ignorant of the problem (or considered the problem likely to be limited to the East; or started fortifying their local population against the inevitable European invasion; who knows).

Or maybe the vampires would see that the new humans brought intensive farming and saw that after the lean years there'd be a lot more food for humans and thus a lot more food for them?

  The real trick will be keeping track of time well enough that you don't come up on the other end twenty minutes before the local dawn.
#+end_quote

You'd probably be able to tell dawn was coming from the sky and from animal behaviour, and dig yourself a hole quickly enough depending on your strength level.

Or when you noticed the continental shelf moving up, you'd pause, wait for yourself to fall asleep and wake back up, and then make sure you start your assault on the new continent at the beginning of the night... that'd be more logical.

  His scions, perhaps?
#+end_quote

Scion means like an heir, it has a connotation of being someone who is "chosen" to continue a legacy. So I could see a vampire calling their favoured kids scions but not /all/ of them. It's weird we don't have that many words in english for children.

In WoD they call them neonates, but that's a general word for youngsters; they call their children a childe or progeny, brood, or "get".

True Blood uses "Maker" and "Progeny".

Buffy uses Sire but no word for children.

So really I'm tossing up between "progeny" and "children".
