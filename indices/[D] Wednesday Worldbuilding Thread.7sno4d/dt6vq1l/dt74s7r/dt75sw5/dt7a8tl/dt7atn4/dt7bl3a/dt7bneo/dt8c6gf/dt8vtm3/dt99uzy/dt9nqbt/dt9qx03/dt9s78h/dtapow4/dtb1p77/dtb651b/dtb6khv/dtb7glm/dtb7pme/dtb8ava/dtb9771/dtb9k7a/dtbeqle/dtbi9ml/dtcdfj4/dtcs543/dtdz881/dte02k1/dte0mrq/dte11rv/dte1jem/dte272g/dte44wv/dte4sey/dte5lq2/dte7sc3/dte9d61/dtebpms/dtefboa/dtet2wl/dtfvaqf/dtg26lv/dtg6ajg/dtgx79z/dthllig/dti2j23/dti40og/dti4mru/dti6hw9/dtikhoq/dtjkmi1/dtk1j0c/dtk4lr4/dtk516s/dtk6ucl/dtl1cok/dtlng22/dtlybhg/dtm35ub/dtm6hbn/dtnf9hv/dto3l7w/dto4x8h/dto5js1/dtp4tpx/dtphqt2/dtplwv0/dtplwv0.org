  Unless a retired army officer comes through a year or so down the line and starts picking holes in Red's story

And poor Red, never has a time when he can truly relax; always scared an officer is around the next corner. Full of guilt. :(

  Some other solutions for consideration:
#+end_quote

Good ones! I don't want to make it too long (try not to make the interludes more than a page), but they're definitely ones to consider. I'm probably going to write up all the solutions I can think of and then edit the "worst ones" out.

Structurally, do you think it's a good way to present the thought process? Or should I go for something more "organic"? I think I can't do "organic" because the repetiveness of the "solution/objection/conclusion" paradigm is acceptable in the form it's in there, but writing it out would add so much words and space and fluff and make it seem more repetitive.

I'm also not sure what place to end it on. e.g. if I end the interlude on Julias considering - even if rejecting - the "present himself as love object" angle, then people will think a love triangle is happening. (A friend was shocked that Julias did not turn out to be a love triangle guy, even without Julias considering smooching William).

Hmmmm. I'll think on it some more, maybe try a different structure.

  So candidates for 'new romantic object' should start out with 'similar appearance/personality to former romantic object' and work from there.
#+end_quote

Great... now I want to write an interlude of Julias trawling whatever passed for gay clubs in 1940s Europe for men who resembled Red, interviewing them, and then discarding most of them; but then gently guiding William to "just bump into" whichever candidate Julias most preferred. He'd then take note of William's reactions and refine his choices.

Of course he'd be doing it just rarely enough that William didn't notice anything bad by it.
