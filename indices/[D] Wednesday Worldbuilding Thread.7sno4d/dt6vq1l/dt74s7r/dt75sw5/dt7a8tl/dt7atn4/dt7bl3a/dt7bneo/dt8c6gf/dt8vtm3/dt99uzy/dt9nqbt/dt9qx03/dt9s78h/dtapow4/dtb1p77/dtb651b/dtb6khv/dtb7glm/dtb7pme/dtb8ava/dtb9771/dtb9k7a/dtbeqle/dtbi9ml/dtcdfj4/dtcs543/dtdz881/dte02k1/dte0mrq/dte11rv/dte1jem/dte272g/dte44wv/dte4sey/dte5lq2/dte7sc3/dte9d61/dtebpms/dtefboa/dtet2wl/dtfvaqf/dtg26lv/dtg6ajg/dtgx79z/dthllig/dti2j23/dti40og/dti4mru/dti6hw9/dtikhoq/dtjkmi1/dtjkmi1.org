  ...I don't think Red would have the mathematical tools to approach it in that fashion, though. (Unless he has an interest in probability theory that he's been keeping quiet about)

He doesn't, unfortunately. I don't think steel mill workers in 1940s Ohio were known for their mathematical knowledge ;)

Thanks for the compliments on the excerpt! There's a little saying I heard once, if you'll excuse the vulgarity: "Writing's like taking a shit: sometimes it comes out right away with hardly any effort, and sometimes you strain and you strain and you eventually manage to force something out". That's definitely been my experience.

The "William's POV" excerpt basically came out, fully formed, once I started writing it and needed only minimal editing. I feel like when something like that happens it's almost always a really good passage - I guess because the characters are speaking to you, or whatever.

The whole story's getting a lot more balanced now, though the more I write the more I feel I need to add. I haven't even started re-proofreading the last third which I think will end up being expanded into the last half when it's all said and done. I already added another chapter that still isn't entirely finished but, taking into account all the extra little bits and pieces I've added, puts the extra content since I "finished" it in June last year at an additional 10%! It'll probably be 70k-80k words by the time it's done. Madness!~
