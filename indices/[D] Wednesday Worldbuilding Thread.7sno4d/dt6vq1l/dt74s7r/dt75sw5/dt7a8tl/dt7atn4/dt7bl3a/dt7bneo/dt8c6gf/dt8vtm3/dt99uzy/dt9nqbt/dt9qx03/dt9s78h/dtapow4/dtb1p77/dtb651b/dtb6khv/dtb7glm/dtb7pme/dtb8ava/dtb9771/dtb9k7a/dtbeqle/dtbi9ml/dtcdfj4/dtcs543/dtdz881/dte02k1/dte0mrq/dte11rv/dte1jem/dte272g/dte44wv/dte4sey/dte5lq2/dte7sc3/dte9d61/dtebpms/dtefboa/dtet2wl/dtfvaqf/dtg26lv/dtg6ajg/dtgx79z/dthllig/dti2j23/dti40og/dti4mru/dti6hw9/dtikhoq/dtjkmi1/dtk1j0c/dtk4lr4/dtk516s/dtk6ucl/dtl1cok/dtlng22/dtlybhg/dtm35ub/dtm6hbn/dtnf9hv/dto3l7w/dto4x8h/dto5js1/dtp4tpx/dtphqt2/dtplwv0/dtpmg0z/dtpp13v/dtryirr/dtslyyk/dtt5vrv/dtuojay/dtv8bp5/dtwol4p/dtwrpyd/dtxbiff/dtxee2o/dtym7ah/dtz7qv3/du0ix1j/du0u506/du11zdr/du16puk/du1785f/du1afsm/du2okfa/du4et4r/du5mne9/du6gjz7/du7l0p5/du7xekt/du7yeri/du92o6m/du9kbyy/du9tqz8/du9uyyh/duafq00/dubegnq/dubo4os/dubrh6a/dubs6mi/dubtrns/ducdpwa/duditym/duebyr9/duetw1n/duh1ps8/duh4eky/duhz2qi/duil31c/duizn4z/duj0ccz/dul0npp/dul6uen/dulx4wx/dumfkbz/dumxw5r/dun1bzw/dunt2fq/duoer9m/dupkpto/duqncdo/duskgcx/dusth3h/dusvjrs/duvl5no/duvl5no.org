  I don't feel the need for an alarm system, and I can leave my car out in the driveway all day if I want with no negative consequences. So... minimal concern, really.
#+end_quote

Okay, so it seems like the average sufficiently affluent person doesn't constantly live in fear / think a certain level of fear is normal, so that's... good at least. I am less paranoid now.

  I continually hear about trains being delayed because people have stolen the signal cabling in order to sell it for its copper content.

  Alright. Your Aboriginal population is below 4% of everyone. Our "previously disadvantaged" is over 80%. When a political party decides which initiatives they're really going to concentrate on, are they going to pick the ones that keep a majority of the voting public happy, or a minority?
#+end_quote

New Zealand apparently has a specific seat in their parliament for the Maori community: it would probably be good if we got something along those lines (we do have a few Aboriginal parliamentarians, but they are not there for specific Aboriginal issues: they're Aboriginals who got elected into "general" positions)

  [[http://tracker.co.za/][Here's the website of one of the bigger such companies,]] if you want to poke around a little.
#+end_quote

Okay I'm going to the "choose a tracker" wizard... and... some insurers require them? Eek.

From the FAQ:

#+begin_quote
  Where can I find a vehicle tracking device on my car? â€‹Our tracking units can be fitted to a number of different places on your vehicle and we will never alert you to the location. Only the fitment agent will know where it is located. This is for your safety and security.
#+end_quote

... so, reading between the lines, it's saying "if you get kidnapped and the kidnapper wants to remove the tracker, we're making sure you don't know about it so you'll be tracked during the kidnapping" ?

Another one asking if you'll be in trouble if your vehicle is stolen more than once (apparently enough of a pressing issue they they put it in their FAQ)

#+begin_quote
  Hmmmm. That's... oooh, apparently that's about R80 000. I guess, if you're going for meagre... four years? Seven if you're going for /really/ super meagre and not paying any rent. (That's for one person, of course, and assuming that you never need any medical care or education or anything).
#+end_quote

Okay... killing someone for several years worth of living costs I can..... sort of see, a little bit, even though it's disgusting it's not "killing someone to steal their cigarettes" level of excessive.

Does South Africa not have free healthcare? For some reason I assumed it did (I think I just assumed everywhere but the USA has it).

  Although we have a lot of criminals, by and large they're not going into crime because they have some deep-seated need to hurt people.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I suppose the "killers of Junko Furuta" sort of people remain a constant proportion of the population, and more of the "people who would kill for economic reasons if needed" get.... 'activated'.

    Aww, I'm imagining the second mage's daughter was turned into a vampire, and the daughter had... I don't know, Down's Syndrome or something and couldn't understand to stay out of the sun. That's.... kind of sweet.
  #+end_quote

  Something like that, yes.
#+end_quote

That's so wholesome I might headcanon it even though I think the below idea is probably more realistic.

    Or just two mages that don't know what the other did: one puts the sleepy spell on, the other puts the sunshine spell on, and then they both realise they fucked up and should have cast the sleepytime spell differently.
  #+end_quote

  Huh. I hadn't thought of that... but yeah, that works, too.

  #+begin_quote
    A sufficiently deep tunnel of the type we can only build in the last ~100 years? All good.
  #+end_quote

  Just because we couldn't build it before them doesn't mean it didn't exist. What's the world's deepest natural cave formation?
#+end_quote

About 2km.

  Maybe the eternally-awake vampire lives down in there, instead of moving back and forth between the poles all the time.
#+end_quote

Don't see why not. If I think of a reason for it to happen, it might come up.

Aside: on vampire sun paranoia: I can't believe it took more than a year to think of it, but I finally gave my vampire's dedicated safe house solid walls with no windows (and shutters on the outside of the house to appear like there were windows). Why would a vampire want windows when they're full of risks? Also chucked in some "airlock" style doors.
