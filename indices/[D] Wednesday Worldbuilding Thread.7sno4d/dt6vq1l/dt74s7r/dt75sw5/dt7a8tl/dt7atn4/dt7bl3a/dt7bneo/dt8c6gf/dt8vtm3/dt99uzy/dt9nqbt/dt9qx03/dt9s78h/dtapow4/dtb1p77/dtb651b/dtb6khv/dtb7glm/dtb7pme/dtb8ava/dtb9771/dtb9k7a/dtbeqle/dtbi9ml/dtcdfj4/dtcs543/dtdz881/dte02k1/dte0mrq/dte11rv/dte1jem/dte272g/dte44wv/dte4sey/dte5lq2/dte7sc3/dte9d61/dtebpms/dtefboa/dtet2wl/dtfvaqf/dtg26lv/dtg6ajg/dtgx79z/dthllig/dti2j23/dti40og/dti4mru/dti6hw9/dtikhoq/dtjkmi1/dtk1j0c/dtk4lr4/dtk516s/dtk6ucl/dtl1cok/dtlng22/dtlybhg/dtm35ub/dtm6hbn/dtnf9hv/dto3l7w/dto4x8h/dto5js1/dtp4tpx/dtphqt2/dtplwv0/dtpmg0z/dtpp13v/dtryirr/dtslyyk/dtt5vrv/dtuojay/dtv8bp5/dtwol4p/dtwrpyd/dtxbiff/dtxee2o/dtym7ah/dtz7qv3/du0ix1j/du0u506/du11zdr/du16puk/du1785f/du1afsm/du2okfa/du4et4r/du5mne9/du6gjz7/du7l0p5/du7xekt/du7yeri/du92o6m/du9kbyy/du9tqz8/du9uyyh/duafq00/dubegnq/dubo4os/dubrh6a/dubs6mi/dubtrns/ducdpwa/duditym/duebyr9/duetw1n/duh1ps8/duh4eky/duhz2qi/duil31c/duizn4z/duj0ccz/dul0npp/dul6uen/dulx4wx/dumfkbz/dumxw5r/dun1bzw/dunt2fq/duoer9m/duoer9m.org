Thanks for the breakdown of the impacts of apartheid: I really can't think of anything to add, but it was an illuminating read.

#+begin_quote
  Now, it might be possible to point out that this was supposed to have ended twenty-four years ago, so why are there still scars? And that's a common question, but it means that the questioner has not yet considered the sheer /scale/ of the original problem...
#+end_quote

In my personal experience, we did some awful stuff to the Aboriginal people as a society, and although that "stopped" some time ago (or admittedly continues to this day in its own way, but the stuff that continues to this day is not on the same scale as "literally taking children from their families and forcing them to speak English and convert to christianity"). But anyway, yeah... society still hasn't caught up, people are still racist, there's still a horrendous life expectancy gap, imprisonment of Aboriginal youth, etc. Similar sorts of problems with African-Americans even after Jim Crow laws are not allowed since ~1965. I can only imagine how much worse having something as /formal/ and /extreme/ as apartheid in the recent past would be.

  Oooooh, yeah. We do /not/ do good on [the homicides per 100,000] scale.
#+end_quote

Not even a little. :|

Are there gangs or something that account for the high rate? I assume with a rate /that/ high there's got to be pockets with extremely high murder levels...

#+begin_quote
  Hmmm. Could it be psychological? Some type of particularly persistent placebo effect?
#+end_quote

I don't know.... the only other explanation I can think of at the moment is that the nanites have an internal clock, and they sync it based on star/moonlight, and that modulates the sleep time. But.... there's literally no reason a vampire would be designed to work that way, unless their job was to keep a curfew active or something. And then it would be based on Atlantis rather than their home country. And also if you move a vampire but keep him in a box, the nanites will not know when to wake up. So.... throw that in the bin.

#+begin_quote
  Hmmmm. So, if you really need a vampire out at high noon, you make a new one and then send him out? (Maybe kill him once the job's done, so he doesn't take up precious territory).
#+end_quote

Yeah, though if you're one of the Old Ones a new vampire would be weaker than a 6-month-old thrall, so you might want to just create a thrall and wait six months.

A baby vampire doesn't use territory: it stays in its guardian's territory, unless it runs away or something. They don't need much blood and can even eat food.

(I figure the nanites take a long time to reach "critical mass" in the body...)

#+begin_quote
  ...actually, could this be a beauty/rejuvenation treatment for vampires? "Let your skin and muscles fade away naturally and then regrow good as new, with no pain or long-term side effects" kind of thing?
#+end_quote

It'd require way too much trust when you can just cut the part of your face you don't like off and regrow it. Vampires don't age or grow hair unless they choose to, so it would have to be someone who chose to age and then when they wanted to look young again they were too chicken to flay themselves and didn't have any thralls they could trust to flay them in their sleep.

(oh god I'm imagining that now, a vampire who likes ageing and every century or so when she gets too old she has her thrall flay her skin off overday and then it slowly grows back - ugh!)
