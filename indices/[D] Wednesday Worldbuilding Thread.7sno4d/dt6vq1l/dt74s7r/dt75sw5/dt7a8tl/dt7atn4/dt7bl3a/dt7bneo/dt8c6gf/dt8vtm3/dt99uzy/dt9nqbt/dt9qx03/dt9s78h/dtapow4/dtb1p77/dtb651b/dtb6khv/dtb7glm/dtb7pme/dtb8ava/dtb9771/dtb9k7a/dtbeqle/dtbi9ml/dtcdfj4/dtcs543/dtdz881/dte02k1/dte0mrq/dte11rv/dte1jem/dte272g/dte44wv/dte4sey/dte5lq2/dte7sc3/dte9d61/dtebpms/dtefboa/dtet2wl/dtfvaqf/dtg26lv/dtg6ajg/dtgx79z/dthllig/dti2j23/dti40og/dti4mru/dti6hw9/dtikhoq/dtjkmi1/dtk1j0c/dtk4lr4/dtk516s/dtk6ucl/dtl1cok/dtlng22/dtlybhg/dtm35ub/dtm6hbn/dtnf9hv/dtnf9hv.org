Thanks for that. I'm hoping to do some more writing today so I'll try and get some more focus on other senses. I think I'll try and over-do it because it probably won't be overdone.

At the moment I'm tossing up between different ideas for "between chapter interludes" that I've started writing. The interludes provide sort of... bonus information that doesn't really fit elsewhere. I have used one to advance the plot (that christmas scene was an interlude), but that's more the exception than the rule. (Other interludes you've read: the towel folding scene, the scene with Cassius and Yolande, William's inner monologue).

The one I'm struggling with at the moment - because I have so many ideas, all different - is the interlude that goes between two chapters where a six month time skip takes place.

The interlude happens after the obligatory-for-a-romance-novel scene where the lovers break up; and I think that chapter ends perfectly, so I guess that's why I'm having a hard time committing to an interlude.

The next chapter is basically, "Red moved back to Columbus, and this is what it was like for him to live there now". I think it doesn't start very strong, which is another reason I'm probably having a hard time committing to an interlude. Maybe I should rewrite that chapter start and incorporate some elements I am considering relegating into an interlude.

Anyway... here's the interlude ideas I'm tossing up between:

- Julias and Red packing, joking around, Julias asking about Columbus, maybe Red asking about his son, Greece, etc? (pros: mood whiplash, which I personally love; cons: this would take place /before/ the end of the previous chapter and though I don't mind whether the interludes make temporal sense, so far they all do, except for one which is a flashback to years earlier not days earlier)

- Could do Red's mother's funeral or something to double down on the sombre mood and add dramatic irony; but the audience finds out like on the third paragraph of the next chapter.

- Red saying goodbye to someone in Corsica (no townspeople the readers will be invested in enough to care about this)

- Transcript of a letter that Red sends home to announce his return? (this would also allow him to communicate his "you thought I died in the war but I have been secretly living in Corsica all this time" excuse, whatever that is: but it would require actually writing in 1940s style which I think would be more work than it's worth?)

- Red's reunion with his sister (Red meeting her at the station / her coming to meet him in New York - her meeting him in New York could be interesting, she can tell him she's pregnant, it'll be a bit of a bookend for them with NY and pregnancy, since the only other time we've seen her she was a teenager and he was helping her go to NY for an abortion?)

- Something with William: inner monologue, self-deception about how he really doesn't care that Red's gone but he actually cares a hell of a lot

--------------

I think writing this out has given me my answer: I need to rewrite the beginning of the "Red goes home" chapter to include his reunion with his sister in NY, and then do the time skip, then continue with the sort of stuff that's already there. Then the interlude can either be Red's mum's funeral or William's inner monologue. I've already done a William inner monologue some mere two chapters / 11,000 words earlier so it might be too soon for that from a structural point of view. You know, it'll seem repetitive.
