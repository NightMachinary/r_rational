  that's not fair. That shouldn't even be allowed.

[[/flutterwink][]] I believe this is a common reaction to guns, yes...

  So, I guess they've got strong bones, great reflexes, and are always at least a little bit on guard for a bullet. Surround them with hollow points and you might just be able to bag yourself a vampire, but ever since hollow points were invented vampires have avoided putting themselves in situations like that.
#+end_quote

That works! It also implies that you might be able to take down a vampire by (say) dropping a WWII bomb on his house and getting /really/ lucky (but if you don't destroy the head on your first shot then you're in serious trouble because you won't get a second shot).

  [excerpt]

  “Many of us are guilty of the sin of envy, my son.”
#+end_quote

What William has described is not the sin of Envy - Envy is more "I want what he's got", while what William is describing is clearly more along the lines of "I want /him/", which would be Lust. I'm not quite sure what you're going for here.

Especially since the Priest seems quite aware of what's going on later, but still keeps referring to it as 'envy'.

  Have you acted on this desire?”

  “Yes.”

  “And were your affections returned?”

  “Yes
#+end_quote

So, William admits to behaving inappropriately...

#+begin_quote
  “It sounds as though you are behaving appropriately.

Perhaps if William had stressed the maintenance of chastity somewhat in his previous reply, that might make sense...

  “I confessed my secrets to a heretical priest, and I plan to kill him very, very shortly. Do you suppose the Lord would forgive me that, too?”
#+end_quote

William has clearly gone a long, /long/ way away from the Church, and I think this line really highlights just /how/ far away he's gone. It makes a great ending to the excerpt, especially if there's some background mention, later, perhaps as a rumour or a headline, of the mysterious death and/or disappearance of an elderly Priest.
