    Looks like we're both right: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy_compensator_(diving)]]
  #+end_quote

  Huh. Looking over that link... transpacific vampires can't use buoyancy compensators.

  Or - let me rephrase that - they can't use buoyancy compensators for /long/. Because the gasses will leak and before they've gone two days' swim, there won't be any left unless they start with an impractically high number of air cylinders...
#+end_quote

Hm, good point. Depends how fast a vampire can swim, then. Fastest human speed in a short distance is 8.6km/hr.... Even if we assume vampires can swim at 100km/hr (an order of magnitude than it seems a human body is "capable" of), Spain to the USA is like, 3,500km - so it'd take at least a week, assuming vampires can swim 10x faster over a long period than an olympic athlete can swim for 50m. More likely I think a vampire swimming speed would max out at 30km/h, though I guess it also depends on the theoretical properties of the human body, and also the vampires could, like, put flippers on or something to increase their speed.

  Fishbowl helmet? Filled with argon so there's no usable air in there?
#+end_quote

And then the question comes why would a vampire do that? I could see a suitably evil vampire putting his flayed rivals in argon atmospheres until they slowly went insane, or whathaveyou?

    I'd imagine the more naked you are the faster you can regenerate in a low gas environment?
  #+end_quote

  That depends - if it's "most skin contact with organic molecules", then the one in the rubber suit might heal faster - until his suit finishes dissolving, of course.
#+end_quote

I suppose, again, depends on what the vampire nanites are capable of.

#+begin_quote
  That's true - and, to tie that back into another famous piece of vampire mythology, maybe their creator liked his wooden floors enough that he deliberately coded in an /exception/ for wood, so their bodies expel anything non-organic and use anything organic, except wood, to repair themselves. So wood is then the only thing that, if you stab them with it and leave the weapon in the wound, they stay stabbed...
#+end_quote

Maybe a better feature: organic molecules cannot be used by a vampire to heal? I don't know. I could see, say, a copper rod being inserted into a vampire's heart and the vampire can't eat it away to heal because the body doesn't use that much copper.

  But a thrall has to be fed, at least once a week. Who wants to continually interrupt their serious research to bother with /that/?
#+end_quote

Well.... your blood has a shelf life (or does it? I always assumed vampire blood had a near-indefinite shelf-life, but maybe it doesn't) - anyway with a long enough shelf life, you just need to bleed into a vial every few years and have one of your janissaries deliver it to your thrall (or just have your thrall pick it up).

Probably if serious research was your focus, as a vampire, your interests would be better met by becoming the subject of some king or another, who would do all the hard work of managing territories, and then you could take over later on if/when you felt like it.

    I pictured them in that scene to be standing in the kitchen
  #+end_quote

  Ah. But then they never pace slightly, lean against a countertop (or a stove), shift their weight, etc...
#+end_quote

Good point, I'll put some of that sort of thing in.

#+begin_quote
  This is actually a good deal /less/ creepy than the previous scene... which implies that a lot of Lucia's creepiness might have been her phrasing things so that the vampires wouldn't mind overhearing her.
#+end_quote

Lucia's a funny character; she's pragmatically realised that being a thrall is a really good deal as long as she doesn't piss anyone off, and is hoping she'll one day get turned. But she's got a lot of motherly instincts because she realises people don't choose this lifestyle as logically as she did. And she assumes Red is some young drug addict who William picked up shortly before leaving Australia.

We're talking about Elodia having some big problem that William could fix, and Lucia calling in that favour that Red promised her, because William would just relish in the opportunity to grind Elodia into the ground, socially speaking. Might be something to do with William assassinating Junior, I guess: maybe Elodia gets blamed for it, and Lucia knows that William could possibly offer an alibi, or put Elodia in William's territory, or something. Haven't really nailed it down yet. Might just not get picked up.
