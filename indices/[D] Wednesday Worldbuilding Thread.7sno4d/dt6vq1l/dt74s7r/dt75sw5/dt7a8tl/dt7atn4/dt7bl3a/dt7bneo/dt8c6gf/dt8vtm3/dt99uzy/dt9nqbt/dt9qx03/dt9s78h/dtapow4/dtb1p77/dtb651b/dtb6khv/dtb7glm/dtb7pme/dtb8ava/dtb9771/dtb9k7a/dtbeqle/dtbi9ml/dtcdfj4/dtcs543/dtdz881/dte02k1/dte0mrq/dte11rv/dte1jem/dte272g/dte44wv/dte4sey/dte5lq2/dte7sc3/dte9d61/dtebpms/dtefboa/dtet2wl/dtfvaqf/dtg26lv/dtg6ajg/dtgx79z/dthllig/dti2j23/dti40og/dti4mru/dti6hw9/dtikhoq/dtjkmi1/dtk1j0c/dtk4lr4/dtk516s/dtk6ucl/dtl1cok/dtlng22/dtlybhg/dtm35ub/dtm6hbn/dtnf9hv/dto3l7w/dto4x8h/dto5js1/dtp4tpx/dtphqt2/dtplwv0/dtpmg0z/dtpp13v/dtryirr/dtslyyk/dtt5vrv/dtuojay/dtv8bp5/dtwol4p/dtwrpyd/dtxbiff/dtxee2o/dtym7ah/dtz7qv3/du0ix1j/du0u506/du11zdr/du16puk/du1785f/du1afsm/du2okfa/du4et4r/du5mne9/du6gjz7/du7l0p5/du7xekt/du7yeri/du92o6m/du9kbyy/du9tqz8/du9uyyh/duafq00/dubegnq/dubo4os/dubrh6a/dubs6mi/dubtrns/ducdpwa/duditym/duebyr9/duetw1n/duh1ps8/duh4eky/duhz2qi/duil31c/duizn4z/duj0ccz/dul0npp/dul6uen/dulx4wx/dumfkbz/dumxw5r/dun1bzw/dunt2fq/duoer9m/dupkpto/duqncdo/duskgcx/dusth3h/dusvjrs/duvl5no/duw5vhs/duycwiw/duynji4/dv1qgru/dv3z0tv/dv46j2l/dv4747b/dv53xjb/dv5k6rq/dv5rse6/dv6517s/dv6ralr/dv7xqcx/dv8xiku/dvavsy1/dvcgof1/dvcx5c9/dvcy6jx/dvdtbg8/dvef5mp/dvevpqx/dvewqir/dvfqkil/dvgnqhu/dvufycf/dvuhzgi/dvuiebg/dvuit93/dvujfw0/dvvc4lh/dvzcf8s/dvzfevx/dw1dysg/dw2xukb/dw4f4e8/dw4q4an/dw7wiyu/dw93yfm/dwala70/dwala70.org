  I've done this, I think I might have even shown you the excerpt I'm thinking of in particular.
#+end_quote

So you have.

I don't recall that particular excerpt-of-an-excerpt (I do recall the scene you mention later, I suspect that the scene you showed me earlier may have been the discussion William and Cassius had after that excerpt-of-an-excerpt), but yes, that was pretty much precisely the sort of scene I was talking about.

#+begin_quote
  If I didn't and you want to read it I can whip out the whole thing - though if is, of course, rather senseless. /bad-um tush/
#+end_quote

Eh, I'd just yell at you about senses again.

#+begin_quote
  just like the genre of sci-fi sucks because everything goes FTL
#+end_quote

Some of the best sci-fi I know includes FTL travel. Have you ever read the /Chanur/ series?

#+begin_quote
  There's a later scene where William and Cassius negotiate before the war starts, I could see Cassius offering a wager and William refusing, and then being relieved when the human in peril survives.
#+end_quote

Could work to show how much William has grown - and since he hasn't taken the bet, he can even step in to help the human without being accused of cheating, if he doesn't mind a snarky comment from Cassius.

#+begin_quote
  this won't be able to happen for a while, long enough that William might have grown beyond that level of callousness. Still, a good idea.
#+end_quote

Then it can be used as an opportunity to show how much William has grown - he gets partway along the corridor, then stops, looks over the decor, and asks himself how come this didn't bother him nearly so much the /last/ time he was here...

  I need to discuss with the coauthor exactly what any "William shows Red that he's Great and Powerful" scene would look like, and work out how we'd want it to end.
#+end_quote

[[/wasthereeveranydoubt][]] I can no longer see the phrase "Great and Powerful" without thinking of fireworks and ego.

But yeah, that'll probably be worthwhile.

#+begin_quote
  another one I thought of was William leaping and placing the human on the roof, so he's clearly alright but is going to have a hell of a time getting down (... it would seem; of course, being a thrall, he can just jump back down when Red and William are off-screen).
#+end_quote

[[/twibeam][]] Yeah, that works too!

[[/sp][]]

#+begin_quote
  Trying to think of a way to put... like a vampire tidbit in there, or something.
#+end_quote

[[/twiponder][]] Hmmm... foreshadowing of some sort, perhaps? Perhaps Paola's in the kitchen, preparing blood pudding with alarming efficiency and showing off her enhanced reactions?
