  This pattern would seem to fit the case where the settlers had (presumably mostly without knowing it) vampire support while the Tasmanians did not...
#+end_quote

Or the colonists had an older, stronger vampire and the Tasmanians' vampire lord was giving them pointers on how to take care of it?

#+begin_quote
  That's plenty of food security, then. (Enough that I imagine vampires have to police themselves to maintain that approximate ratio.)
#+end_quote

Yeah, I picture it being more a, vampires don't like being around other vampires too much - maybe an instinctive revulsion that was meant to stop them from "forming a union" when they were made as weapons. Or modern vampires are aware of the Catastrophe and how much the population fell as a result, and are as such aware that the same thing could happen to humans, so they allow themselves that buffer.

  I... think scuba divers use a weighted belt?
#+end_quote

Hm I always thought it was something that could be... adjusted so you could float or sink according to your preference.

Looks like we're both right: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy_compensator_(diving)]]

They use lead weights to get about neutral and then the buoyancy compensator adjusts more finely so you can "float" wherever you want. So vampires would probably use the lead weights.

(The weights make sense too because in an emergency situation a human diver can just throw the weights to the sea floor and float more easily to the surface - the bends is probably preferable to suffocating due to a faulty piece of equipment, after all)

#+begin_quote
  Hmmm. Perfectly sensible - which means that the remaining question then is what about a vampire who wears a full-body wetsuit.
#+end_quote

Full body wetsuit? Including the head/eyes? That's a bit... hard to imagine, right? I'd imagine the more naked you are the faster you can regenerate in a low gas environment?

Interesting to think if a regenerating vampire eats through things or just air. The vampires were designed so they might have been designed to regenerate from substances in the air, so the nanites are only capable of making the chemical reactions with the air - after all if you had a vampire weapon and it destroyed your nice hardwood floor when it regenerated, that's a problem. Then /again/, there's probably a hierarchy, and at the very least they'd be able to recruit hydrogen and oxygen from water as it's conceivable that a vampire would be underwater to heal or a bad guy would attempt to drown it.

  One doesn't need to be a successor to manage William's estates. He could always explicitly Turn someone in order to offer long-term employment as a manager and do all the tedious paperwork.
#+end_quote

Why Turn when you can make someone a Thrall? They are at least beholden to you, rather than a Childe who'd be open to negotiating with other vampires to get a better position than you're giving them - in exchange for your death and a nice cut of your territory, of course.

Still, Cassius probably has a lot of kids because he does something like this: Turns humans with appropriate personalities to manage his duchys. After all, you can't guarantee your kids won't turn on you, but you can be pretty sure someone else's kids aren't going to be as loyal as your hand-picked "brainwashed" kids might be.

#+begin_quote
  Ah. So a proper William-explains-to-Red scene would have to be specifically inserted, then. And I don't think it's enough of a plot point to devote an entire scene to the only minor nuances of that definition.
#+end_quote

Does it have to be inserted? The nuances are only very small (the janissaries get the benefits of being fed from out of the deal is basically the only one, and that's implicit), so I think we go OK without it.

#+begin_quote
  A somewhat creepy look into the mind of a thrall, really - not creepy at once, but very creepy once you look deeper into it. Do they never at any point sit down?
#+end_quote

I pictured them in that scene to be standing in the kitchen, since the bosses are in the dining room, and I don't imagine the kitchen as having chairs: it's off on one end of the house, with a long bench and an oven at the very far end and an icebox and some shelves/etc. Nothing like the modern kitchens where you tend to be able to sit and eat breakfast.

Interesting you said it was creepy, the story cuts from the excerpt I just showed you to the very next scene:

--------------

“Now we are far enough from the house we may speak freely.” Lucia told Red. It was the next day; Lucia and Red were at the market together. The four janissaries seemed to have no interest in going into town; they stayed at home, played cards, did embroidery or read books. The warm spring sunshine and the soft breeze made it a pleasant day to be out.

“What?” Red didn't stop from adjusting the fruit in his basket. There was a new hire at the market stall today who apparently wasn't aware that strawberries could bruise; already their rough flesh felt too soft. “What are you talking about?”

“Do you have any idea what you've gotten yourself involved in?”

Red looked at her briefly, trying to think what she was talking about. “Was this about the woman giving me that bottle of wine? Because I know what people say about her, but she's just a generous old lady and I brought her cat back once. That's all.”

Lucia frowned, walking away from the fruit stall, where their conversation would be less easily overheard. “No. I am talking about the master of the house.”

Red frowned back, his mind racing. “What do you mean?” He decided on, finally.

“He and Elodia aren't...” She lowered her voice, for the first time not referring to Elodia as ‘her grace'. “... They aren't normal. And I don't think you understand exactly what that means.”

“I know about the... you know.” He put one hand up to his mouth, tapping his mouth with the tips of his pointer and middle finger; he got the feeling that this strange, new version of Lucia would flinch if he said the ‘v' word.

“I think you don't know the half of it.”

“I don't doubt that.” Red agreed. “Did something happen? You seem... different.”

“They hear everything we say, even if they are talking in another room. Did you know that?”

“Wait, what? I knew the hearing was good, but I didn't...”

“They pay attention to it, too. I once saw Elodia follow two separate conversations at once.”

“That's... unsettling.” He studied her for a moment. “Were you worried about being heard yesterday? Is that why you're talking about this now?”

“Yes. I don't know what William is like,” She said, again not using his title. “But I've seen a lot of young people like you... that don't understand what they're dealing with.”

“What do you mean?”

Lucia frowned. “They think they are going on some grand adventure, trying a wonderful drug, perhaps escaping something even worse. But... I have seen many get killed.”

“Ah.” Red considered that for a few moments. “I thought that might be the case.” He admitted.

“So I try to make sure that people like you... are aware of all that. That they can always, always hear you. That they can give you commands that you are powerless to resist, just by looking you in the eye. And that once you outlive your usefulness, they will kill you and not think twice about it.”

Red thought about this for a long time, carefully composing his response.

“Thank you for telling me.” He said finally. “I'll keep it in mind. I'll be careful.”

“There are advantages too, of course.” She added. “But it's not fair that they have us take these risks without knowing.”

Red furrowed his brow. “But what about you? Are you... alright?” He finished finally, trying to find the words, genuinely concerned.

Lucia laughed. “Carlos, I'm a hundred and forty seven years old and I can carry more than a young buck like you. I live in a luxurious seaside estate in Bonifacio. I want for nothing, let me assure you.”

“Okay.” He nodded, accepting, and patted the rough skin of her arm. “If you need help, you can tell me. Okay?”

“If it pleases you.”

They slowly walked to other stalls; as the sweet smell of fruit gave way to more wholesome, earthy aromas they tried to find the best-looking greens to have with dinner. Red was still instinctively comparing prices; he wondered if money meant anything at all to Lucia, now. Red had so many questions, and she seemed willing to answer. William had always been communicative, but he refused to answer so many questions.

“Is Duchess Elodia... is she really fussy about clothing?” Red asked, allowing himself to raise his voice over the rabble of villagers bargaining nearby.

Lucia laughed again. “Oh, yes, very. She had us sent to her tailor, insisted on choosing the fabrics herself. Made sure I pinned my hair up the way she wanted me to, and adjusted it before we got out of the car.”

“Hm.” Red murmured. “King William was just the same. He re-did my tie and my shoelaces, too.”

“Oh yes. They're all like that. Elodia tried to explain it to me, once. The way the laces cross and the number of holes in the shoes... it's very important.”

“What about the ritual?” Red asked, having built enough courage to question her about it. “King William said you've done one before?”

“Dozens. It's not as bad as you think. You'll be the server, right?”

“Yeah. King William gave me a lot of instructions, things about where to put the cups.”

“As long as you remember everything he taught you, you will be fine. I'm going to be preparing the blood. I'll try and explain it as I go. It will be very helpful if you need to do it in the future. It's a lot of hard work, but they seem to really like it. Well, as much as they seem to like anything. I'm just glad that there's only going to be two of them.”
