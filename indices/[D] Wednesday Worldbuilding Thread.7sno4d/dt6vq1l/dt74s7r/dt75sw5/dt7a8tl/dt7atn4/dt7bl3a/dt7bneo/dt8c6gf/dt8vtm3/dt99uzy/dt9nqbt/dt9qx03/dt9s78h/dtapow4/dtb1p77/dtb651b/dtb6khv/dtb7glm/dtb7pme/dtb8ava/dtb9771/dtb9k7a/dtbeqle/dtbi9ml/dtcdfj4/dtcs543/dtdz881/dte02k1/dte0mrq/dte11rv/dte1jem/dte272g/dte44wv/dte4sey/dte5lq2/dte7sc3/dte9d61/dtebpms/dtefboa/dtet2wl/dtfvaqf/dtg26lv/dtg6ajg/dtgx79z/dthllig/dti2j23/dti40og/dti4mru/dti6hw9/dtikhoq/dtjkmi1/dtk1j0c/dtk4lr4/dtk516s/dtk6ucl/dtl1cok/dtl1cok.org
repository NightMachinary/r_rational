  But mostly it's the education, but some of that is because we're two university-educated millennials trying to write an uneducated 1940s steel worker

'Smart but uneducated' is a difficult writing target. Worse yet is 'smart but uneducated and has read an entire encyclopedia set cover to cover'. (But if you've ever read /The Wee Free Men/, then Tiffany Aching makes a good example of that category, I think).

Smart characters can make leaps of logic and infer correctly, especially in fields with which they are familiar.

Uneducated characters have a lot of bad assumptions about things, especially things about which they know nothing - but, more insidiously, they don't know how to think critically, how to structure their logic, how to ask meaningful questions. Often, an uneducated character will work by heuristic, guesswork, and pseudoscience.

And then, if he's read through an entire encyclopedia, that will fix gaps in his knowledge - to an extent. Which means he'll be able to trot out the occasional piece of completely accurate scientific knowledge - but the odds are he /still/ won't know how to structure thoughts, or ask questions, and he might very well completely fail to understand some basic knowledge (like negative numbers, or fractions). (If you want to get around /that/, then I'd suggest having William spend some parts of the latter 1940s tutoring him off-screen - it's very hard to learn how to think from a book, and much easier in person).

I mean, there's hundreds of ways to write any of those - but that's where I'd start.

  So it's kind of hard to toe that line, having some meaningful romantic scenes but also keeping it tight and snappy.
#+end_quote

You're writing a romance. Romantic scenes are probably expected at some point. Besides, you're establishing important parts of your main characters' personalities.

But if you ever find yourself writing a few thousand words about Cassius playing fetch with /his/ dog, you may need to stop and think about that for a few minutes.

  “Unfortunately, I didn't think to wrap them.”
#+end_quote

Didn't /think/ to wrap them? With the attention to detail that you've written into your vampires, the hundred notes of meaning in every little thing?

I think William's lying here. He probably did think to wrap them, he just decided not to (perhaps due to a wartime lack of wrapping paper) and he's making an excuse to avoid discussing the matter.

As far as descriptions go, something I've noticed in previous excerpts as well - you mention things that can be seen and /only/ things that can be seen. There is no scent of pine near the tree; Red's gift doesn't crinkle with wrapping paper and William doesn't notice the texture of the glaze on the vase nor the pitch of the note it sounds when sharply struck by a fingernail. The lock on his trunk does not click open, the encyclopedias he moves do not thump to the ground.

Humans have five senses - I can't figure out a way to wrangle 'taste' into this passage, but you should at least use something more than 'sight'. (No, having conversation doesn't count for 'hearing'. You need background sounds).
