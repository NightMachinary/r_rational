  but the more I think about it, the more I think that vampires wouldn't include "the bane of janissaries" because it implies that janissaries themselves are important
#+end_quote

Eh, a thing doesn't have to be important for someone to be its bane. (For example, a rabbit might earn the title "Bane of Carrots" - no-one's suggesting that the carrots are in any way important, just that the rabbit chews through them like anything).

...but I do see the point that that would need to be demonstrated to the reader. Hmmm. "Messy Eater"? "Creater of bodies"? "Spiller of blood"? "He Who Wastes Good Food"?

    (if Rome? There has to be a story behind a title like that).
  #+end_quote

  Yes a typo...
#+end_quote

Hmmm. There /has/ to be some way to make a better story than that.

[[/batshy][]] "Oh, well, that goes back to a few centuries or so ago. You see, I was once an even messier eater than William over there - blood /everywhere/, couldn't keep a jannissary more than about two hours. So any village I tried to claim - well, the first time I had lunch, there was a massive great fright among the humans, they all moved out and the village collapsed. It was getting frankly embarrassing - not just for me, but for everyone else as well. So, well, there was this guy I knew back then - Ted, great guy, pity he died back in the 1700s - and he managed to arrange this little village for me, right? Tiny place, just established. But I'd had, you know, second chance, third chance, fourth chance - everyone was kind of sick of me having to find a new place every couple of weeks. This was my /last/ chance. But Ted managed to talk the rest of them into backing off from me one last time. One last village. 'If this place goes,' he told me, 'I won't be able to keep them off your back anymore, Cassius old fellow. But as long as you can keep it going, you'll be fine. You're not the vampire /of/ Rome. You're the vampire /if/ Rome.' ...and the name kindof stuck."

[[/sp][]]

Something like that, maybe. (And with a more roman name than 'Ted').

  ... octopodes apparently are supremely good parents...
#+end_quote

Which is less important than whether or not vampires /know/ that octopodes are great parents. The title doesn't depend on true octopodes, after all, but on the vampire's perception of same. ("The mother bear" would be a reasonable alternative, especially for an overly protective parent).

#+begin_quote
  I've added "lover of men" to Erlis's title because it's particularly appropriate
#+end_quote

Given your chosen genre, you /might/ want to make that "Lover of Humans", because as it is it doesn't look at first glance like a species-specific title.

#+begin_quote
  The big problem is I haven't got scenes where I put the vampire titles in there
#+end_quote

What, is there never a big social event with a footman at the door calling out titles as people arrive?

#+begin_quote
  “So I'll be out two duchies and not even get to keep the human.”
#+end_quote

I can certainly see how William feels a little aggrieved at this point. Even if he didn't care about Red, being manipulated into losing half his duchies is going to sting quite a bit. (And at this point Cassius, who deliberately manipulated William into giving one duchy for the human in the first place, is probably very carefully not grinning triumphantly - it feels almost like William's war with Elodia is more a case of Cassius sneakily, through proxies, taking apart the resources of someone close to being his equal before William can become his social superior, and I have to wonder if Cassius makes a habit of 'dealing with threats before they are threats' in this manner. After all, if that /was/ Cassius' aim, he could hardly do better then taking away half of William's duchies in exchange for nothing).

#+begin_quote
  The above is poorly described I know and I'm not sure where to put them right now they're in a clearing? But maybe a cafe would be better? This is a secret meeting so probably a clearing. They travelled there transformed as bats so I kind of imagine them sitting in a tree, but that's kind of ridiculous....
#+end_quote

Can they talk as bats?

The thing about meeting in a clearing in the middle of nowhere is that (a) as soon as anyone (such as a poacher) sees them, it's /clear/ that this is a clandestine meeting, and if the poacher recognises them then the rumour is everywhere within a day or two, and (b) vampires hiding such a meeting from mere humans sounds a bit like giving up a comfortable chair because you're worried a cow might think worse of you. I imagine vampires having clandestine meetings at private tables in top-class restaurants or conference centres (you know, where they don't have to give up on little luxuries like comfortable chairs) where they speak very quietly in languages virtually unknown to modern man while attended to by highly professional and very deaf serving staff.
