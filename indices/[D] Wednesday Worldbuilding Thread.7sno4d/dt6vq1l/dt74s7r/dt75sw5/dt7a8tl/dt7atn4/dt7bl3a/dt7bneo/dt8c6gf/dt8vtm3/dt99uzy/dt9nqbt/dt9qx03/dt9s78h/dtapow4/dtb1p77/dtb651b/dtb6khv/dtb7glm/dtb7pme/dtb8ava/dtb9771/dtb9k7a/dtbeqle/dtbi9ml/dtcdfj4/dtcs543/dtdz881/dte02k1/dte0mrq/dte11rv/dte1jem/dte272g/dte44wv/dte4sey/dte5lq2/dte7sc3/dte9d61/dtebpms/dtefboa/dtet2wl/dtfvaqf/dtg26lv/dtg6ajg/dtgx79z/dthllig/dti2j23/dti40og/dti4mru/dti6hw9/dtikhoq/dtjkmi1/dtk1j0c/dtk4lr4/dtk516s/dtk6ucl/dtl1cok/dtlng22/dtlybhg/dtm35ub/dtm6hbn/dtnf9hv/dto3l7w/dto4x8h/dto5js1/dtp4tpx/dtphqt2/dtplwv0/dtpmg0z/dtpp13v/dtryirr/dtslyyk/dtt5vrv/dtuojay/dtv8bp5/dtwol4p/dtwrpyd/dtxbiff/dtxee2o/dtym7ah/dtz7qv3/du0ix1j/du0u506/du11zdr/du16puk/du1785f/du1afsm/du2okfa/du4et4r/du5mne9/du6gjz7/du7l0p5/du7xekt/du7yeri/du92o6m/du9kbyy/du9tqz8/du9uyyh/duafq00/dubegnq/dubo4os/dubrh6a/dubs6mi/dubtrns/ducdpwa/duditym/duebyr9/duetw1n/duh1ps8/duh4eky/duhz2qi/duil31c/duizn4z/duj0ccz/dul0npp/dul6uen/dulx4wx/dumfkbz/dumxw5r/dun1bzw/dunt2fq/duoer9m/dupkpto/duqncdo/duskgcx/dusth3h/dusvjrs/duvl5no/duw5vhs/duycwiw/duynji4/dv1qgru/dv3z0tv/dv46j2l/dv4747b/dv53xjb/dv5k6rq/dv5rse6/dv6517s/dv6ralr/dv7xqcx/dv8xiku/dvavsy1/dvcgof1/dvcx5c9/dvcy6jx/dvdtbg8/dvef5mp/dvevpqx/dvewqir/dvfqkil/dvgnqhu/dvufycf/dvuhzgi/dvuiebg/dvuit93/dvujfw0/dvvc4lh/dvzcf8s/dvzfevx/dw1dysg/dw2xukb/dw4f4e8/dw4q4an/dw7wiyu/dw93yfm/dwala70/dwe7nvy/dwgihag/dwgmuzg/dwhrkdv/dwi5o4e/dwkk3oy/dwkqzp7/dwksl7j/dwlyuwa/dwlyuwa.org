  [[/flutterkay][]] What about 'vampire'? (Yes, there are two, at least one of which applies...)

  [[/sp][]]
#+end_quote

Yeah, "I love you, vampire son" happens in volume 3, so expect to read excerpts from it in 5 years time... Vampire-werewolf love triangle: I'm not ruling anything out, but the story doesn't have the archetypical "vampire/werewolf rivalry that burns hot". Werewolves mostly stick to themselves.

Now I've just gone and taken a bunch of "random" romance tropes (by scrolling through the tvtropes list and opening a bunch of them at random), and I'm gonna look at them:

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdrenalineMakeover]] : Red's full arc is /maybe/ like this, but he actually becomes Kinder and Softer overall, as does William. Red starts out more aggressive than William, relative to their station: William knows that discretion is the better part of valor, whereas Red has yet to learn that lesson.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngerBornOfWorry]] : Not really, no.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestHerToBedHer]] : Lol, no

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakHisHeartToSaveHim]] : This is stupid and manipulative and denies people their own agency. Hard pass.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartwrightCurse]] : No :(

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustRomanceCthulhu]] : Um, in Present Day, someone falls in love with Julias and may or may not try to bed him in his Big Scary Demon Form, but that's not quite there.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateDrivesUsTogether]] : Nope. William just /buys/ Red and then goes to visit him. None of it is coincidental.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookedUpAfterwards]] : This will probably happen with a variety of characters, including Julias's aforementioned romance (though... he does go through a breakup in the meantime).

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsJustBeFriends]] : There is of course a Climactic Breakup, but nobody is trying to promise friendship, really. It does kind of happen because William sends Red letters, though. So half point?

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePromposal]] : There is no prom. I don't even know if there'll be a marriage proposal, and if there is it won't be a Big Romantic Gesture. Well, maybe it will. Vampires Are Weird.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCheatingHeart]] : Does not apply.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyMarriageProposal]] : See promposal.

So, looks like vampire and gay tropes apply better, overall, to the story. So that's something.

  But you're right, swords would work better against vampires - unless you have golden bullets, or wooden ones, guns aren't going to do more than annoy them and tell them where you are. But if you behead a vampire, that at least gives you a few minutes in which to run.
#+end_quote

Yeah, and I think Paola would have some golden bullets in her armory, but she's stronger than most young vampires due to Cassius's extreme age (rule of thumb: ghoul is as strong as a vampire 10% the age of their master), so those are really only if one of the older patrons has a problem. She might not even know they're gold specifically: I think the gold thing is probably going to come out to the vampire hunting public sometime in the 70s or 80s or 90s, or maybe start spreading due to the events of volume 2. After all, secrets don't keep forever.

  Also a possibility - right up until someone actually leaves valuables with her, and she locks them in the heavy safe in the basement (or wherever).
#+end_quote

Depends who they are and how valuable they are: I imagine one of the lockers, at least, has the "most valuable" items from their "most important" guests.

  Though its ability to mess with the navigation of incoming planes is apparently somewhat disputed; to the extent that, in a lot of places, it was introduced mainly to keep the population fired up about the war...
#+end_quote

That makes sense. There was a lot of extreme encouragement of patrotism during WW2 (duh), so yeah. Apparently even the coast of the USA did it????
