  I won't have a chance to sketch it out today but I would value your input especially highly on that scene.

[[/twipride][]] I'll look forward to it. Have fun!

  Keep it as-is: i.e. unrealistic
#+end_quote

[[/ajugh][]] "Unrealistic" is enough of a reason to try to avoid this one.

#+begin_quote
  Avoid the problem by having he and his sister living in some other city (e.g. New York) where nobody knows him
#+end_quote

[[/twiponder][]] More plausible. Red and his sister are only one rumour away from Trouble, though, and Sister is risking her entire reputation by supporting him. (Might be a good source of tension).

The people who recognised him would likely make a /point/ of informing those who did not. People can be /very/ vindictive, and deserters would be the target of a lot of that.

The /civilised/ ones would stop at not serving him. The less civilised ones (especially those whose relatives died in the war who are displacing their anger onto Red) wouldn't stop there - they'd make genuine attempts to drive him out of town, and he'd probably need to clean off the walls of his sister's house every day.

  He says he was in a prison camp and just got released: he comes back just as the war ends, so that means something. He refuses to talk about the details, explaining it away as shell shock (or the most appropriate name for PTSD in the 1940s).
#+end_quote

This is my favourite of the various options. With his division having been killed, he is thought dead - notice of his death had been delivered to his family some time ago. He sneaks back home, without the army noticing, and claims to have been a POW (prisoner of war) for the intervening time. Everyone recognises him, but no-one knows he's a deserter, so they're all really happy to see him back (perhaps a local shopkeeper, whose son actually did die in the war, gives Red occasional little items for free because he had spent so long 'fighting the good fight')

#+begin_quote
  Red is in disguise and does it well: he bleaches his hair blonde or something, pretends to speak very little English, etc.
#+end_quote

Possible - he would need to rent a spare room from his sister - but people are going to be suspicious.
