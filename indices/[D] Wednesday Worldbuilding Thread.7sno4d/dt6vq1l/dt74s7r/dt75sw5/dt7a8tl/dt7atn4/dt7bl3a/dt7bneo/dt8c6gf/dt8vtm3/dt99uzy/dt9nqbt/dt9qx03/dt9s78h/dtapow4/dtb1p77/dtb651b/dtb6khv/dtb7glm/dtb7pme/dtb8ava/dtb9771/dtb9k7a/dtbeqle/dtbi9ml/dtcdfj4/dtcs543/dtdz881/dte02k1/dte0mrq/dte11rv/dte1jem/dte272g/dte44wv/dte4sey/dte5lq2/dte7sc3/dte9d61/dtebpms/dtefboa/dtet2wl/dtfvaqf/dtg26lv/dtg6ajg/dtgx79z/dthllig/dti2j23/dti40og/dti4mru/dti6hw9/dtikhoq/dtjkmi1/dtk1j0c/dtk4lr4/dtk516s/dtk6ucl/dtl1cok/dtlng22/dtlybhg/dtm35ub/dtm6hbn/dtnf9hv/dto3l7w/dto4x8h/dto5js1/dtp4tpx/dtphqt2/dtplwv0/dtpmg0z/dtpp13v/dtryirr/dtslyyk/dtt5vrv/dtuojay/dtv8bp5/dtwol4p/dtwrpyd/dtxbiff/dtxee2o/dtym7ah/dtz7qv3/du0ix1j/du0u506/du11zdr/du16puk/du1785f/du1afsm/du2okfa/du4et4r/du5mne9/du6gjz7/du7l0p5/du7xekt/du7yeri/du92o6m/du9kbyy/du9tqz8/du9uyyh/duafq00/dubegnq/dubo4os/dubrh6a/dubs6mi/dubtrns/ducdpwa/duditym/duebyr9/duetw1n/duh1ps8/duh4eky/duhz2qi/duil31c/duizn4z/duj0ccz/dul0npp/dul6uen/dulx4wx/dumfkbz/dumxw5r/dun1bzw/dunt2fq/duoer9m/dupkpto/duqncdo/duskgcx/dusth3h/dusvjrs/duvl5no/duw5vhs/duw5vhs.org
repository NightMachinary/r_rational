  Okay, so it seems like the average sufficiently affluent person doesn't constantly live in fear / think a certain level of fear is normal, so that's... good at least. I am less paranoid now.

An average sufficiently affluent person who pays attention to crime statistics before selecting a residence, yes. (Crime statistics are available, and if you ever do come for a visit, it's probably a good idea to check them first).

It's actually a serious problem. Reputable scrap-metal dealers will no longer buy cabling in any form, as a result.

Unfortunately, there are still /dis/reputable scrap metal dealers, so the issues continue. (Every now and then, one hears of people being arrested on one or other side of that transaction - either cable thieves or the scrap-metal dealers that buy the cable from them).

  New Zealand apparently has a specific seat in their parliament for the Maori community: it would probably be good if we got something along those lines
#+end_quote

That would be an excellent first step, yes. And an even better second step would be if the other parliamentarians didn't just ignore that representative.

If Australia implements those two steps, then you should start seeing that gap closing a lot more quickly in time.

  some insurers require them? Eek.
#+end_quote

Makes sense. If one customer's car gets stolen (and the bigger your insurance, the higher the odds that one of their customers' cars will get caught), then the thieves are caught and jailed, it makes the rest of their customers' cars safer and allows them to charge lower premiums.

  ... so, reading between the lines, it's saying "if you get kidnapped and the kidnapper wants to remove the tracker, we're making sure you don't know about it so you'll be tracked during the kidnapping" ?
#+end_quote

Also, "we're making sure everyone knows that you won't know where it is so that people can't try to threaten you to make you tell".

  Does South Africa not have free healthcare? For some reason I assumed it did (I think I just assumed everywhere but the USA has it).
#+end_quote

Not free, no, but at the same time not "ten years' debt for one hospital visit" like I've heard of from the USA. There is a public healthcare system (somewhat underfunded and under-resourced, and you will find yourself in a long queue) and a private healthcare system (more expensive, but nowhere near USA levels, and the queues are shorter and equipment better).

  Yeah, I suppose the "killers of Junko Furuta" sort of people remain a constant proportion of the population, and more of the "people who would kill for economic reasons if needed" get.... 'activated'.
#+end_quote

I get the impression that most of it isn't even 'people who would kill for economic reasons'. Rather, I get the impression that a lot of it is 'people who would threaten other people with a loaded gun for economic reasons' and sometimes the guy with the gun panics or it goes off accidentally - either way, the thief is still guilty of murder, of course.

  That's so wholesome I might headcanon it even though I think the below idea is probably more realistic.

  Aside: on vampire sun paranoia: I can't believe it took more than a year to think of it, but I finally gave my vampire's dedicated safe house solid walls with no windows (and shutters on the outside of the house to appear like there were windows). Why would a vampire want windows when they're full of risks? Also chucked in some "airlock" style doors.
#+end_quote

As an aside to the aside, I recently heard of an incident in England in - I can't recall, the 16th century or something? There was a King who needed to raise more money, so he put a tax on windows. And a lot of people who didn't want to pay the tax got their own windows bricked up. (It seems that that's where the phrase 'Daylight Robbery' comes from).

As a result, there are apparently a number of houses in England to this day which have their windows bricked up, for reasons that don't make the neighbours suspect vampires. I have no doubt you can make good use of this piece of trivia.
