Probably wasn't explicit enough: J1 died on ~blank's~ watch, in ~blank's~ territory (Sardinia). This is distinct from Elodia's (Corsica) and William's (New Holland/Australia). Blank may have been killed for it; who knows. J1 was hated by Elodia and presumably liked by Blank, though, so if anything Elodia is taking the fall - but for her ironclad alibi. Then again... all else being equal, the circumstances being as they are would put William in the crosshairs but there's no way to prove it. Hm.
