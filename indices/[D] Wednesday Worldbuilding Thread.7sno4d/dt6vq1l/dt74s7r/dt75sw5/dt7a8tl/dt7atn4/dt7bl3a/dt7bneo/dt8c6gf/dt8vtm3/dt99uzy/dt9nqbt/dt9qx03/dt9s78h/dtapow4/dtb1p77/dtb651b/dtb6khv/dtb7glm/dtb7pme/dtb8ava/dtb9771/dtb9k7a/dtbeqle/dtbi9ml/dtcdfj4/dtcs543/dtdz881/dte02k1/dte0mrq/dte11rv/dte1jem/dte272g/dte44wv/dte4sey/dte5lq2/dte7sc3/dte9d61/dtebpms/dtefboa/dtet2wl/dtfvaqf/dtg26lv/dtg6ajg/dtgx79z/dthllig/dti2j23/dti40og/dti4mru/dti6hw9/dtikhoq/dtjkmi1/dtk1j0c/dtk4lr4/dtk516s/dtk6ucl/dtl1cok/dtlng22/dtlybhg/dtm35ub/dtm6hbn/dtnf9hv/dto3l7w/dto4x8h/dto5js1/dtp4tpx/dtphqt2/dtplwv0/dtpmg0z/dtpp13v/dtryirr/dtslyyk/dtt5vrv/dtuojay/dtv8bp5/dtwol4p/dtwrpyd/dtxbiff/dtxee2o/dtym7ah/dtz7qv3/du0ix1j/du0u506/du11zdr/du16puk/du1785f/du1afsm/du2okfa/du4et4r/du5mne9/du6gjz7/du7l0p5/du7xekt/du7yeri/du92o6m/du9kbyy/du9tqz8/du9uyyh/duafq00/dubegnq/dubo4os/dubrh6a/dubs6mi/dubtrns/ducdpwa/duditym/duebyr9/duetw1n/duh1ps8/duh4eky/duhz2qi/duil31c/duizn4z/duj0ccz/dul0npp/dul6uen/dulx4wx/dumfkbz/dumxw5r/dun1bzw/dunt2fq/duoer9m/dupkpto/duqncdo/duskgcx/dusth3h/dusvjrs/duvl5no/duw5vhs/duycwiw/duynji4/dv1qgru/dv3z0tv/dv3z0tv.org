  The iron infusion was purely a result of losing 1L of blood, and contained one gram of iron. 1kg of raisins has 21mg of iron... So you'd have to eat 50kg of raisins... which is about 2.5 months worth of calories if you ate nothing but raisins. I think the hospital said it was on the order of 150 steaks.

Okay, yeah. Raisins would not have been enough, not on their own.

  100R for a doctor consultation is super cheap to me!

It is pretty cheap. We don't have /free/ medical facilities, but they don't break the bank, either.

  you and i both know vampires would be all over that shit! oil lamps cause /fires/
#+end_quote

Only if you actually /light/ them. You're free to admire the artistry of an antique oil lamp all you want without causing fires, as long as it remains unlit.
