  ...better to use dynamite, preferably during the day.

William kills another vampire in the story (though it's left ~artistically vague~: a whole chapter that's like 9 words long; it's also in present tense at the advice of my husband who said it was really cool to have a stylistic departure like that but i should make it even /more/ departing by moving it to present tense, so go ~artisticness~), and he does it by fighting them hand to hand (and creaming them because he's old) and then setting the house on fire. I think that's probably the easiest way to do it.

  I thought the 'scandal' he was worried about was the scandal of being actually attached to his decorative human, and that the opera at the beginning had been the start of the trend.

I don't really understand this sentence, can you clarify? What do you mean by "actually attached"? Oh, wait, I think I got it - as it stands now, if another vampire sees him with a devoted human lover, they think, "oh, William is really good at pretending to care about humans! He must be smart, patient, and spend his time well because humans require so much of it", the same way I'm impressed with people who have very well-trained dogs? And upon finding out that William /actually is in love with Red/, the reaction might be the same as if someone told me they were actually in love with their well-trained dog? As in, firstly, could you have a meaningful relationship with an animal; and secondly, /eew/?

The vampire-human trend is something William's predicting; as written, I have William going into scandal when he saves Red's life because the trend hasn't happened yet. I could re-cast that scene so the scandal is because he's actually in love with Red, rather than because he had a human lover, but I don't think a vampire trend catches on within a year; more like 5 years.

  On the subject of obscure words, have you ever come across a board game called 'Balderdash'?
#+end_quote

Yes I have! It's good fun. I've played a varient called the dictionary game (I think) where you get one of those big unabridged dictionaries and look up words and people have to make up definitions (so it's the same as that one sub-game of balderdash).
