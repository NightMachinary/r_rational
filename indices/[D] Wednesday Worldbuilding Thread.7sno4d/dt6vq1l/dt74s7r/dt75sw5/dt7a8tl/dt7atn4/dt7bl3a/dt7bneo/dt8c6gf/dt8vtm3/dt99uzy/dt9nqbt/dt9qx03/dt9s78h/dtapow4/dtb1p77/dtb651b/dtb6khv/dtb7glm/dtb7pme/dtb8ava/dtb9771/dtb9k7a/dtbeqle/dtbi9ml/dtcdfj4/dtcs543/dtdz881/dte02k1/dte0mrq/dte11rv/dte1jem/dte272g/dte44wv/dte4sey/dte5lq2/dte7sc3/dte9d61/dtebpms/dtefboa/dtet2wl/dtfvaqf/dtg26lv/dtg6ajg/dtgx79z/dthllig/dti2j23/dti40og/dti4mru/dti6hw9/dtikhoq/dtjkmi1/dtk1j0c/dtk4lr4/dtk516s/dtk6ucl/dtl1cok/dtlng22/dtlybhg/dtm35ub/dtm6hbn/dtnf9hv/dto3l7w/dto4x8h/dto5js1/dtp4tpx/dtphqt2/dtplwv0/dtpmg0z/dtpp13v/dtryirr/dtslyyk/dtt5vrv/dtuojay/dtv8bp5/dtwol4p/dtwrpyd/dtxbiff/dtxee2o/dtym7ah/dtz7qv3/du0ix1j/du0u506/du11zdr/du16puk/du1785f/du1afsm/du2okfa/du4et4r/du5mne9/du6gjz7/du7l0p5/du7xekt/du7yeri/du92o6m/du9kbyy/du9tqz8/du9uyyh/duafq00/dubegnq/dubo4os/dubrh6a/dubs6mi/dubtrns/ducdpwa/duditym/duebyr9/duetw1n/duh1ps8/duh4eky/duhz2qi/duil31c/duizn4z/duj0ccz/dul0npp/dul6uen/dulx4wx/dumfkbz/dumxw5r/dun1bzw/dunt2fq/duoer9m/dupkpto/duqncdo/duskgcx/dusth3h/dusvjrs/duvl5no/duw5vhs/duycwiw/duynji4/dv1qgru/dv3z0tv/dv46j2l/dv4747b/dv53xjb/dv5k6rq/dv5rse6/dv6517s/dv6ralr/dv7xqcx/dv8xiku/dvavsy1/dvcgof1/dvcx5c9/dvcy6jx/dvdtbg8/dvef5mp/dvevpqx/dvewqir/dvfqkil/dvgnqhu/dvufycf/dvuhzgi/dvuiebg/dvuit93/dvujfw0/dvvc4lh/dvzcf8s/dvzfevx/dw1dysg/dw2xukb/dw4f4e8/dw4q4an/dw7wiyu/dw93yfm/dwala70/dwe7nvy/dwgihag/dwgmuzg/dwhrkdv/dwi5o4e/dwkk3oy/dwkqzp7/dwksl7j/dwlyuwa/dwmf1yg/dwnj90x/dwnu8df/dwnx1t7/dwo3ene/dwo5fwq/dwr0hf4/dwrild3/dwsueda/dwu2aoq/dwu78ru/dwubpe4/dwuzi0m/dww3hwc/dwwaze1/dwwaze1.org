  Over 112 years, it's not like it happened overnight. How that drop was allocated over time is definitely an interesting question.
#+end_quote

And after that length of time, it's likely that none (or at least /exceptionally/ few) of the people alive at the start were alive at the end...

But yeah, that information is going to be rather difficult to estimate.

#+begin_quote
  Aboriginals were not included in the census until something ridiculous like 1960
#+end_quote

By which point, on that population graph, they don't even add a notable bump.

#+begin_quote
  And don't forget, the migrants lived in one small part of the country
#+end_quote

That actually might make things a good deal worse. Sure, perhaps the Eastern Australian vampires are fine... but the new diseases that are killing 90% of the native people aren't going to politely limit themselves to the new colony's borders. So the Western Australian vampires get all of the losses but none of the gains.

There would almost certainly have been /some/ disagreements as a result. Especially if the Eastern Australian vampires didn't share.

#+begin_quote
  Or maybe the vampires would see that the new humans brought intensive farming and saw that after the lean years there'd be a lot more food for humans and thus a lot more food for them?
#+end_quote

I can see /a/ vampire thinking like that, yes. And then taking over his neighbours' food supplies so he can be sure to last through said lean years. (And then said neighbours object...)

#+begin_quote
  Or when you noticed the continental shelf moving up, you'd pause, wait for yourself to fall asleep and wake back up, and then make sure you start your assault on the new continent at the beginning of the night... that'd be more logical.
#+end_quote

Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Then you just have to make sure not to get lost and end up wandering along the length of the Marianas Trench...

Actually... what happens if a vampire is in water deep enough to crush a human? Sure, if you bring him /out/ of there, he'll heal, but while he's stuck in there...

#+begin_quote
  Scion means like an heir, it has a connotation of being someone who is "chosen" to continue a legacy.
#+end_quote

Which fits. A vampire gets scions by /choosing/ humans to convert, after all.

#+begin_quote
  So I could see a vampire calling their favoured kids scions but not /all/ of them.
#+end_quote

Are you suggesting that he would choose - gasp - /unworthy/ humans?

#+begin_quote
  So really I'm tossing up between "progeny" and "children".
#+end_quote

Hmmm... I suppose they could invent their own words. "Progs" (short for "progeny") seems to strike the right disrespectful note while still having an easily guessed derivation.
