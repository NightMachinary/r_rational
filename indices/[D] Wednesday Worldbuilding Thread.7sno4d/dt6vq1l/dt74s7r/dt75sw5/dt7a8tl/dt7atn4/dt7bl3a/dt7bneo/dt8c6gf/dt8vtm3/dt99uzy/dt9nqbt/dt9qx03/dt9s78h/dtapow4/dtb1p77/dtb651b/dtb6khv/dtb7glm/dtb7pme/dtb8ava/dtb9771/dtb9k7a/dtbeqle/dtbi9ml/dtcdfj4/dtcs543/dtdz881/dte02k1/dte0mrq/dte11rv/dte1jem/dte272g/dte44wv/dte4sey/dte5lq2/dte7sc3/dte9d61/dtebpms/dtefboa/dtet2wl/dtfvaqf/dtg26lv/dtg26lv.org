Hmmmm. Elodia... she might have vampire tradition on her side, but she did escalate things quite deliberately. It looks like she either:

- Has some grudge against William
- Has some grudge against Red
- Is confident that she can win in a war against William (and better her position in the process) and thus intends to push him into declaring one

I also note that the moment Lucia actually raised her weapon to Red's throat, William pretty much instantly removed her - it seems likely that he was ready to take advantage of his vampiric speed to leap forward and stop her at any point, should she try to kill Red quite suddenly.
