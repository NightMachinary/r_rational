Red is kind of like a transhumanist before transhumanism was a thing: deserted the army because he was terrified he'd die, and ultimately begs to be made into a vampire when his own death is imminent. (Before that, William had asked to turn him, but Red refused; he reneged when he was mortally wounded, though... but that's volume 3)
