  So it's basically deep-fried potato slices in batter? I don't recall ever having come across that before
#+end_quote

I guess a lot of the terms are Australian cultural things because otherwise international influence would change our stuff too much? (Then why are canteens not called cafeterias and bathers swimsuits? We can never know)

  Tap - any little device that you turn or push or twiddle in some way and drinkable water (or other liquids, as in the case of say a tap attached to a wine barrel or an oil tanker, but /generally/ drinkable water) comes out. "Faucet" isn't used here - I always thought that it was an Americanisation of the word 'tap'. Why, does it mean something different to this definition?
#+end_quote

Yeah, we don't use faucet either, but I wanted to use an unambiguous term.

The term referenced in the article is talking about these things: [[http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTY1WDg1MA==/z/VRwAAOSwLqFV8Vfr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F]] - I call them water fountains but some places in Aus call them 'bubblers'...

  Cafe - "Deli" generally isn't used here, and what you describe sounds more like a restaurant.
#+end_quote

Restaurant is different from a cafe: a restaurant would be open at night (usually) and a cafe in the daytime. Cafe is more casual - you would order and pay at the counter rather than getting a bill at the end of your meal. Cafes sell takeaway coffee, restaurants don't. Cafes might not sell food apart from cakes, or might not sell anything more substantial than a pre-made sandwich. A cafe would have seating though: the same sort of thing without much seating and aimed at a more blue collar clientele is called a "lunch bar", and I worked at one for a couple of years during uni.

  Lollipop/sucker - Can also be used for the room temperature sort (and in fact is generally used for that in any case).
#+end_quote

Huh. Interesting!

  which has some strict quality requirements (90% meat, no more than 30% fat, and spiced, often with coriander or similar) before it can carry that name.
#+end_quote

Huh, we have something like that for ANZAC biscuits (a traditional type of "cookie" sent to Australian soldiers fighting in WW1). There's a law that says what is and isn't allowed to be called an ANZAC biscuit and what ingredients are allowed. (You can never say ANZAC cookie due to "non-Australian overtones"...)

  Never heard of a name for putting the wors on sandwich bread, though.
#+end_quote

Another delightful cultural innovation! Sausage sizzles are generally done to raise money for charity or local school / sporting clubs. See: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Sausage]]

  This does /not/ explain why it's listed on your Australian vocabulary page as a possible name for a frozen, water-based sweet treat, though...
#+end_quote

No comment.... Was it in Queensland? They're not real Australians...

#+begin_quote
  I see what you mean... you're still doing a lot of telling (which is fine in moderation in order to set the scene in the introduction - all that about the history of trends in vampire society, for example) and what showing you are doing is exclusively in terms of the sense of sight.
#+end_quote

After discussions with you and callme-whatever-we-call-him-now I've decided I'm going to give each chapter a sense-oriented readthrough prior to posting, so hopefully I'll catch on that.

#+begin_quote
  What you have here is /good/, and the fact that it is not /perfect/ should not prevent you from ever moving on and getting it out.
#+end_quote

Yeah, that's my logic / what the podcast got me thinking, and I can always edit it later: I am planning on putting this on Amazon for $2 eventually so promising people a "better experience" might be good.

#+begin_quote
  Though that scene at the end, when William meets the night porter for the second time (I'm guessing that's Red) - that might (depending on how things flow in the beginning) work better relegated to the start of the first chapter after the introduction, and properly Shown. (At the moment, it's kind of half-Told still, sort of on the fence between Telling and Showing; and since it's done in the present tense at the time of the first chapter, it's the sort of thing that can easily be Shown once the scene is established).
#+end_quote

Good point, I'll think on that! Thanks.
