  you don't really owe me excerpts either
#+end_quote

Excerpts to a story you said you aren't interested in reading? That you give me notes on? You do know /editing/ is a profession, right?

#+begin_quote
  Where's the snap and crackle that makes the world /live/?
#+end_quote

It's in the editing bay, which this excerpt has unfortunately not made its way into yet!

#+begin_quote
  why has William not arranged for his thralls to visit him on a strict schedule
#+end_quote

That's his preferred way of doing it, but he knows it would make Red uneasy (c.f. the excerpt), so he visits them instead in Corsica. He arranged for the alleyway meeting so that way Red would be extra horrified because alleyways are not known for looking safe, wholesome, and classy. The reason he wants to horrify Red is because Red is trying to get stronger and stuff to become William's bodyguard or something; William is just laughing because he knows that Red couldn't possibly guard him, and wants him to lose that notion ASAP.

  so he doesn't have to go out into the cold?
#+end_quote

What does a vampire care for the cold?

--------------

To give you an idea about Red's attitude towards janissaries c. 2015, here's an excerpt for you. It's super, duper rough: no senses, no flow, repetition, things appearing and disappearing, issues with tense, injokes, etc. So please don't bother with feedback on that sort of thing. It'd be heavily edited if it ever ends up being usable.

Context: Jack is a janissary, and she recently attacked William to force him to feed on her when he didn't want to. Otis is a dog.

--------------

Red's startled out of his stupor by a harsh knock on the main door. He gets to his feet immediately. “Stay here. Otis.”

Otis obediently gets to his feet, little crumpled face and big brown eyes tense.

Red takes a few deep breaths before opening the door, sharply and quickly.

Jack's at the door, her crossbow hanging from her belt, and her almost permanent scowl prominent on her face. “You're not going to try anything, are you?” She says, sounding wary that there might be some fallout from her little staking incident, rather than aggressive.

“That entirely depends on you, doesn't it?” He asks, his voice quite low and trying to look intimidating despite being so much shorter than her. He begrudgingly steps back from the door and sarcastically waves her in. Otis stands on the other side of the door, ears back and teeth bared. He lets out a very quiet growl as Jack walks past him.

The hair on the back of her neck is standing on end; she can smell the death in this place. She can smell the odd smells that come from a corpse that has an active sex life in a poorly-ventilated space. Everything in her body is screaming that maybe she should go, run away, be safe. She feels like a fly that can see the deadly spines of the venus flytrap, but is drawn ever closer by the sweet smell of something rotting.

“Let's get this over with.” She murmurs, as Red leads her into William's specially designed feeding chamber.

It's a small room that was built in the 1880s along with the church itself. It's windowless and lacks the strips of LEDs that have been tastefully put into the other sections. This room's source of light is a scraggly candle behind a glass cover that has an open top for ventilation.

The room's featureless except for a device in the centre of the room that looks like some sort of medieval torture rack; it's got manacles for the hands and feet of the feeding subject. In one corner, more manacles hang from the ceiling, with a corresponding set on the floor. A mask like the one Hannibal wears is hanging from the wall, too.

Jack tenses up even more. Everything's screaming that this is a bad idea, that she's going to be killed. But, in some odd way, she has a sense of trust in this vampire - though not in his former ghoul.

William is sitting in a corner on a wooden chair. He stands up and gives Red a quick kiss, before turning to Jack.

“Now, I'm sure you're not surprised that we're hosting you here, rather than at your car again.”

“I'm not.” Jack mutters.

“Could you search her for weapons, please, darling?” William smiles. Red can tell from his inflections that William is not opposed to him being rougher than strictly necessary.

“With pleasure.” He snatches the crossbow off Jack before she can fight him back and chucks it unceremoniously onto a wooden table. “Hands on the wall. I'm guessing you know the drill.”

Jack scowls a little more, but stands with her hands against the wall, and legs splayed. She's wearing blue jeans with a utility belt and a purple form-fitting t-shirt. She's got knives (and also a taser) in her belt and one strapped to her calf.

“Jesus Christ, you're just visiting our place, not occupyin' it.” Red mutters as he pulls the last knife from her calf, accidentally-on-purpose nicking the skin a little too close to tendon for comfort. He throws it into a pile with the taser and other knives. “She's clean.” He says finally.

She cringes in pain, biting her bottom lip.

“Thankyou.” William smiles appreciatively. “Restrain her.”

“Wait, no -”

“When one's trust is betrayed, one must be forever cautious.” He replies dryly, and Jack very reluctantly allows herself to be hooked up to the thing.

Red shoves her wrists a little more forcefully than necessary into the manacles. His face looks tense, like he is holding back a string of quite terrible things he can't quite articulate properly. He steps back and folds his arms, his old military jacket straining a little at the arms.

Jack's standing there, confined, her back to William. She can feel her rapidly beating heart in her throat as she waits for the inevitable pleasure, as well as the nervousness from potentially being, well, torn asunder in an act of revenge.

She is not disappointed; William comes up behind her and bites her wrist - not wanting to go for the slightly more tasty and significantly more erotic neck in front of his honey - and she screams in pleasure. He only feeds for a few moments before letting go.

“Release her and then come with me to the bedchamber.” William says in almost a monotone as he exits the room.

“Yessir.” Red says quickly, in agreement and trying not to show any feeling - a mixture of arousal and annoyance. He quickly unshackles Jack in near record time, and grabs her by the uninjured arm to lead her outside.

“Are you going to faint?” Red asks. He knows, objectively, William wouldn't take enough for that, but it is still a subtle jealousy thing.

Jack is on cloud nine; Red is used to this from other addicts he's seen William feed on in the past, though.

“I don't think so. I feel great.” She says slowly.

“Fantastic.” Red says darkly. He wrenches open the door, and unceremoniously throws her outside, slamming the door shut behind her before heading to William's room.
