  there was long, complicated story involving corrupt politicians and a group of businessmen from Dubai who excelled in bribery
#+end_quote

That's horrible. I want to say more because I feel that how horrible I think this is cannot be overstated but I can't put it into words.

  cutting off power to entire neighbourhoods for an hour at a time (all scheduled, there was a roster and everything) just to bring the load down.
#+end_quote

... holy crap. We have something like that but it's for [[https://www.watercorporation.com.au/save-water/watering-days][which days you have your automatic sprinklers on]], to save water... (we have a lot of droughts)

(if you want to use the form, use the post code 6000 and a random street number)

#+begin_quote
  I can go into more detail if you really want. But it's a whole long story with plenty of extraneous detail.
#+end_quote

I mean, if you want to go into the detail, feel free, but I think it would just depress me more. I work for a government that has very little problem with corruption and I blow a fuse about how horrible things are here, so hearing about corruption having a very real effect on peoples' day-to-day lives (and I'm just throwing out a wild guess - were poor communities disproportionately affected by the outages?)... it's awful.

For comparison, the biggest scandal we've had in a while in my state is that [[http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/lisa-scaffidi-to-learn-her-immediate-fate-at-sat-hearing-20170508-gw0jw5.html][a mayor didn't properly declare gifts and free flights/accomodation she received]]; right now there's a national scandal that a conservative polititian (who was against gay marriage for ruining the sanctity of marriage) has just announced he is [[http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/barnaby-joyce-expecting-fifth-child-with-new-partner-20180206-p4yzjm.html][leaving his wife because he got one of his staff members pregnant]], but that's a pretty big one as these things go, and again, is really a personal (if hypocritical) matter rather than, you know, actual corruption.

We also had a scandal where a bunch of politicians turned out to technically have dual citizenship with New Zealand that they hadn't appropriately renounced, and our politicians must only hold one nationality, so a bunch of them had to resign (the first one to do so did it voluntarily and he was a very "cool", social-media savvy member of a very left-wing party; then one of the conservative pollies who gave him shit about it turned out to be a dual NZ citizen too and had to resign...)

#+begin_quote
  Yeah... that looks similar.
#+end_quote

At Mugg and Bean, do you pay when you order your food or are there waitstaff who take your order, bring you your food, and then bring you a bill at the end? I feel that paying when you order is a defining feature of a cafe (but not universal), so I'm curious about how things work over there.

#+begin_quote
  There's generally a few stands set up by the various parties to encourage people to vote for them. I'm not sure why I've never seen a boerewors roll stand, though... it would make sense...
#+end_quote

The sausage sizzles are the raise money for the schools to get new sports equipment or something, they're not organised by the political parties. (It's illegal for political parties to do anything that would be construed as bribing people to vote for them on election day.)

#+begin_quote
  (could perhaps do with a smidge more background noises here and there, like the sounds of the traffic outside in the second scene worsening Red's headache)
#+end_quote

Ooooh, that's a good one! Cheers.

#+begin_quote
  No taste, but then again no-one was eating anything on-screen either, so that's fine.
#+end_quote

Could probably talk about how hungover!Red's rank breath stuck to his teeth or something though.
