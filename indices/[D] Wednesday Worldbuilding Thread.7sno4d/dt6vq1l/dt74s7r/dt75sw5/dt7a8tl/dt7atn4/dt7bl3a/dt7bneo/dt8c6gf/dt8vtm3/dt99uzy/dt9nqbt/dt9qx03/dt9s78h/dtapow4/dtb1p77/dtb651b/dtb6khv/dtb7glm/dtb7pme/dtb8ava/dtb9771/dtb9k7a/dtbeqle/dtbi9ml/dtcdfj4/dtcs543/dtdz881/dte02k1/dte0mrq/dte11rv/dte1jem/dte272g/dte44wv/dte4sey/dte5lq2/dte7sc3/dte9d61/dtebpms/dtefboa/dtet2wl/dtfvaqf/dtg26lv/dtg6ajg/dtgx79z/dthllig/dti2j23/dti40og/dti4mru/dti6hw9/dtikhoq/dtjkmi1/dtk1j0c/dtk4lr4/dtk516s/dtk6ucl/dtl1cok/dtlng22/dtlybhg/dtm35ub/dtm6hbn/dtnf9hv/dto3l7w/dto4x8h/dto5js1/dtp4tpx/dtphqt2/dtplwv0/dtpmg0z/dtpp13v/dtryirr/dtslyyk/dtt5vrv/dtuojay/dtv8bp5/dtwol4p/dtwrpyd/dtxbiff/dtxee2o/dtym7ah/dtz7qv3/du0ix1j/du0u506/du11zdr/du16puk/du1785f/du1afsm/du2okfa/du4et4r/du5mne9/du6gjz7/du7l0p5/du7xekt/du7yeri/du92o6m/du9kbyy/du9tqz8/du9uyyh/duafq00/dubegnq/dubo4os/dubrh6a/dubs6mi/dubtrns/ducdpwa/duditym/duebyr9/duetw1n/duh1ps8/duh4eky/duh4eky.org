  They count as a restaurant here, though from your description I don't think [Mugg & Bean] would in Australia.

(looks up the website) - okay, first of all, when I search for locations you can select "generator" as an option??? Are power outages that common that a restaurant having a generator is a feature? Wow.

Anyway, yeah, looking at the menu, they look like a cafe to me. They remind me of the Coffee Club [[http://www.coffeeclub.com.au/]]

  Not so iconic on election days
#+end_quote

Yeah, we have compulsory voting so it gives us some election-related cultural touchstones (you walk to the local primary school, vote, have a sausage sizzle and buy a cake...).

  senses in writing
#+end_quote

also i'm pretty proud i wrote two passages with lots of senses yesterday!!!! And the senses were SO helpful in making the thing work... and the entire riffing off each other only happened because I started putting effort into senses and started wondering how a sleeping vampire would feel....

(so here they are - they kind of go together)

William had told Red to expect letters and packages from friends of his, but it still came as a surprise when the first one arrived in the midday post. An ordinary-looking, though large, beige envelope with William's name and their address in Corsica written on it in clear cursive. It was as thick as a newspaper and the rich, solid paper smelled faintly of cinnamon. Red placed the envelope on a table in the sitting room, not thinking much of it.

When the sun started to set, Red climbed into the bed beside the insensible vampire, waiting for him to wake up. He reflected how his undead state was most obvious when William slept: he didn't breathe and his body would grow cold as the day wore on, only warming completely half an hour after he woke. The cold he could have gotten used to, given time. But he wasn't sure he'd ever get used to the way William's whole body gradually grew stiff as a log before freezing in place several hours after sunrise. It remained so until William woke up.

Red snuggled close to William's naked body and pulled the heavy covers over the pair of them, trying in vain to bring some warmth to the rigid corpse. He let himself lay there for a few minutes, as he always did, enjoying the feeling of the soft bed supporting his side and the warmth from the blanket. Gingerly, he stroked William's hair: it felt dry and lifeless. He was pretty sure that's how it always felt, regardless of whether he was awake or asleep - but at that moment it felt more like one the hair of his sister's dolls, after it had been taken by the dog and buried in the garden. Dull and stringy and lifeless. Red took his hand away. He was sure he'd get used to it.

Mercifully, he felt the muscles in William's right shoulder relax. The somnolent curse was lifting. Red eagerly rubbed the shoulder, the only animate part of William's body. The softening spread to the whole right arm, which Red pulled around his back, encouraging it to hold him tightly. Finally, the eyes fluttered open, the mouth contorting into the barest imitation of a smile as more and more facial muscles became engaged in the task and the smile grew softer and genuine.

“Hi.” Red smiled, moving his hand back up to the hair, the hair that now felt soft and smooth and animate as the minute twitches in William's face made it make the tiniest lively movements.

“Hello.” William moved his right hand from Red's waist to his face, cupping Red's jaw, pulling Red closer to kiss him. Red enjoyed the moment of closeness: the coldness of William's lips at the beginning of the evening was growing familiar, now, rather than shocking. “I trust you had a good day?”

Red nodded. “Yes, I spoke to the headmaster of the school. He said I could help with the grounds, since they don't have a groundskeeper anymore.”

“Ah, the war?”

“Yeah.” Red tried not to dwell on it: it would put him in a mood. “So I spent a bit of time cutting some trees. It was good. Hard, but good.” He paused. “A letter came for you, by the way.”

“Really?” William pulled away from Red, throwing the heavy blanket aside. “Do you know who it's from?”

“Um, Cassius something.”

“Excellent. I have been expecting to hear from him.” William climbed out of bed. Red sighed; he had hoped the letter could wait a few minutes.

“Well, I think he had a lot to say.” Red muttered, climbing out of bed and putting his slippers on. He watched as William got dressed, moving with speed beyond human capabilities. William carefully selected a pair of heavy black trousers, a long-sleeved pale red shirt, a navy blue striped tie, and a pair of black suspenders.

William smiled. “Yes, Cassius is rather talkative.” He pulled on a pair of white socks, along with some shiny black shoes. After this flurry of sartorial activity, the room smelled faintly of laundry soap. “Can you bring me the letter?”

Red nodded. “Sure, I'll go get it.” He went into the sitting room - opening the two doors out of the bedroom to do so - picked up the envelope, and brought it to the bedroom. William was looking intently at the mirror, having combed his hair neatly in the short time Red was gone. He made some minute adjustments to his hair, and turned to look at Red. As Red held out the envelope, William frowned.

“Ah, I should have mentioned. When my friends send me letters, there will be two envelopes. The outer envelope gets dirty, so I would like for you to remove it and present me only with the inner one.”

Red nodded. “Sure, I can do that.” William seemed obsessed with cleanliness, insisting his clothes were laundered after each time they were worn, wearing gloves whenever he left the house, and outright refusing to touch many things. It stood to reason that an envelope with even the barest smudge would be unacceptable to him.

So Red gently tore at the envelope; William cringed. “Next time, use a letter opener. I will provide you with one.”

Red nodded. “Oh, right. Sorry.” He kept tearing, breaking the wax seal, revealing a second envelope, identical to the first though smaller. It, too, was sealed with wax, though the symbol was larger and more detailed than the one stamped into the outer envelope. The back of the envelope was written in what looked like Italian, though Red only understood a few words. He turned the letter over and examined the front of the envelope; it was covered in symbols he didn't recognise: arrows, wavy lines, a backwards ‘R', and even one that looked like a pair of closed eyes. He was glad he knew William was a vampire, because otherwise all of this foreign script would have convinced him that William was a spy.

William must have seen the expression on Red's face, because he grinned. “My friends and I write in code and foreign languages.” He said, by way of explanation.

“Of course.” Red murmured, staring at the back of the envelope. “What does it say?”

William took the envelope from Red, examining the back. “It is Cassius' name, written in full.”

“In full?”

“We give each other titles, and claim them for ourselves. Let me show you.” He paused, reading from the back of the envelope. “It says here... God-king Cassius of the Eternal City, respected advisor of Magnus, long-awaited child of Tibillus, he who listens with a patient ear...” William paused for a moment, to think of the right word. “The pranker of the third council, the wolf, the one with the iron toe, theif of dignity, keeper of the text.”

“Wow.” Red murmured. “There's... a lot.”

“Cassius is old and proud.” William paused. “I am afraid I must take some time to read this. Will you be able to prepare your own dinner?”

Here's the second one, it takes place in Columbus after the obligatory breakup that must happen in all romance novels to make you worried they may never find true love together:

Red woke up to a horrendous wheezing noise. His head throbbed behind his eyes, his throat was dry. He'd had his fair share of hangovers, but this might be the worst yet. He yawned, trying to remember what had happened the previous night. He realised with a start that he wasn't in his bedroom; a pale pink bedspread, patterned with yellow roses. Pale blue walls.

He felt something moving in the bed beside him; he had to stop himself from crying out in surprise. It was coming back to him now. The alcohol, the way the woman - what was her name? - the way she smiled and laughed at him, he remembered her freckles and her straight black hair. He'd liked her, liked being around her, in a way he hadn't liked anyone in a very, very long time. He'd like her even before the whiskey came out, though it had helped. Helped both of them, no doubt.

But now, the next morning, he regretted it. The heat her body gave off was unbearable, and her body was so sticky, slick with what he knew was only the barest hint of sweat, but to his hands it felt like slime. And the way her body was soft - he gently placed a hand to her shoulder and felt her flesh slide around beneath his touch like treacle. It was unnatural. And the way she moved, just a little, leaning into his touch and making a small noise.

Red felt he was going to be sick. It wasn't just the warm, stinky, toad-like creature beside him; the stench of the room - sweat, perfume - and the whiskey all came to him. He climbed out of the bed, keeping his eyes half-closed, each movement reverberating through his aching skull. He pulled on his underwear, his slacks and a shirt and carefully made his way down the stairs, out of the house.

Mercifully, he didn't encounter anyone; no hypocritical brothers lying in wait, ready to beat him up for besmirching their sister's honour.

It had been too soon. For whiskey, for girls, for anything. One day, maybe in a few years, it would be time.

He wondered if he would ever get used to the sticky flesh, to the grunting noises in the morning, to the looming threat of making conversation over breakfast.

He staggered out into the light of day, went around a corner, and threw up.
