  To be fair, [the dog thing] is an excellent parallel...

I know, but we honestly didn't think of it. We're going to lean into it a bit, of course.

  Have you ever heard of something called "Magnum Opus Dissonance"?

Oh, sure have.

okay i should probably find you an excerpt. Let's do a scene I just got some feedback from and am struggling with a bit: the "btw sweetheart i'm a vampire" scene, which apparently sounds manipulative in a bad way especially in that he bites Red without consent. Which I'm not altogether /against/, but I don't want people to dislike it. And then I realised that maybe having him be like "i'm a vampire btw sweetie" and /then/ bite him would subvert the usual parts of the trope where it's all mysterious and "the vampire doesn't say the word vampire".

I figure you're going to have a good perspective on how this is written mechanically and the believability of the reactions in context, and I think that'll be really valuable to work out how and what to fiddle with, so thanks in advance!

[the Americans are going to take Rome and Red is scared of being caught and wants to flee]

“I'm sorry, William. This isn't your problem. I shouldn't....I shouldn't have said anything.”

"You have nothing to fear," he responded calmly.

“Yes, I do.” Red looked at him blankly. “An American in occupied territory? I'd be lucky if they don't think I'm a Nazi spy!” He pulled his hands away from William's. “I'm sorry. I would have loved to stay with you, but I have to go. I have to run before they -”

“You will do no such thing.”

“Are you going to hand me in?” Red's heart started thudding, harder than when it was addled by the cocktail of lust, fear and passion. This was pure fear, a fear that began to seep out of him, almost choking in its strength.

“I would never hand you to the Americans for execution.”

“Oh thank god.” The tension in his shoulders relaxed, before he stood a bit straighter, remembering his honour. “But I can't drag you into this. You've shown me a lot of kindness, and if you're caught with me they could imprison you on something else.”

“Come.” He smiled, pulling Red into a tight embrace. “Reginald, you will be quite safe with me, I assure you.”

Red looked like he was going to argue, but relaxed into the hug, clinging to William. “Everyone... everyone back home calls me Red. You can, if you like.”

He kissed Red's temple. “I promise you shall be safe with me. I am more powerful than you think.”

“More powerful than the American army?” Red asked, though his voice did not betray the slightest bit of disbelief. He believed in William, a lot more than he ever believed in anything else.

“Powerful enough, Red.”

“Are we going to stay in Italy?” he asked, trusting. “Or do we run?”

“I was planning on travelling Europe for a time.”

“But how are we going to leave Italy? The Americans are coming, and the Germans are so cautious about their borders...”

“I have my ways,” he said, with a calm completely at odds with the way Red was feeling. “But first, there is something I should show you.”

“Oh?”

“Remember when I told you that all men have their secrets?”

“...Yes?” Red wasn't quite sure what to expect. Was he a spy after all?

William paused for a moment, gently placing his right hand on Red's left temple and tilting it to the side. He placed his face against Red's neck, inhaling deeply through his nose, feeling the warmth of Red's skin.

“You smell excellent.”

Red's fingers encircled William's left wrist, hesitant, but not fighting back. “What are you doing?”

“Be calm, my dear,” he murmured, running his tongue along the underside of his teeth. Red caught the briefest glimpse of William's canines---were they always that long?---before he plunged them into his neck.

The feeling was immediate and intense. It was a rush like nothing he'd ever experienced. It felt as though every part of his brain was exploding with pleasure. His extremities tingled, and then went numb. He could feel the shadows of William's mind upon him: lust and intoxication, confidence, strength, and a shocking intelligence. He could almost feel his very life-force leaving him, and joining into William's empty body along with his warm, wet blood.

After what seemed like only a moment, far too short a moment, William's mouth left Red's neck. William firmly placed the fingers of his right hand on the small puncture wounds. They began clotting almost immediately.

Red stepped back, out of William's reach, his arms. Red's fingers moved to his neck to feel the drying scabs that had formed there. He had expected to feel blood trickling down his neck, or... he wasn't exactly sure what should be there. He took his still-tingling fingers off his neck and examined them; they were smeared with his warm blood, but not nearly as much as he would have expected. It was more like he'd given himself a particularly nasty cut shaving than anything else.

“What... what was that? What did you do?” Red asked, finally.

William had been studying Red; this wasn't his first time biting a human, but the extra layer of intimacy was a new challenge for him. He didn't want to make a mistake, here, not after spending so long growing to understand Red, and building his trust. And Red had been getting more interesting by the day.

“Did you enjoy it?” He settled on replying, finally; not answering either of Red's questions.

Red hesitated. He pushed down on the wound again, instinctively, still not sure what he should expect to have found there. “I did.”

“I'm glad to hear that.” William nodded, as though he hadn't expected any other response. He had, though; usually, they asked for him to continue feeding; sometimes, they even begged. But Red wasn't like the others; he hadn't come to William, looking for the thrill he had heard about in the whispers of the clientele of disreputable establishments. No, he was here because he liked William; and William found that he liked that. William leaned slightly forward, almost imperceptibly, to monitor Red's reaction.

Red stepped back, just a little. It was a completely unconscious movement. “Did you bite me? Did you really just bite me?” he demanded, more incredulous than scared.

“Yes.” William took a small step backwards.

“Why isn't it bleeding?” Red murmured, touching the scab again. “I feel like it should still be bleeding.”

William smiled. “You will find there are many other benefits.”

Red stared, not having any idea how to respond. William's first instinct was to dismiss Red, to accept he wouldn't come back; there were some that didn't come back, after all, and it made sense not to worry about them. But he knew Red would return, that he was interested in William regardless of the boons.

“I will need to make arrangements for our departure,” William said finally.

Red considered it a few moments, processing. “Right. What do you need me to do?” He took his hand from his neck, holding his hands in front of his stomach, self-conscious about where he held them.

“Nothing, for now. Just make sure you are prepared to leave at a moment's notice.”

“I can do that.” Red studied his hands, looking at the rough, sun-damaged skin around his knuckles. “If you do think of anything... I feel good. I feel like I could do anything right now.”

William took a step towards Red, reaching to hold his hands. “Excellent. You will need that strength for the journey.”
