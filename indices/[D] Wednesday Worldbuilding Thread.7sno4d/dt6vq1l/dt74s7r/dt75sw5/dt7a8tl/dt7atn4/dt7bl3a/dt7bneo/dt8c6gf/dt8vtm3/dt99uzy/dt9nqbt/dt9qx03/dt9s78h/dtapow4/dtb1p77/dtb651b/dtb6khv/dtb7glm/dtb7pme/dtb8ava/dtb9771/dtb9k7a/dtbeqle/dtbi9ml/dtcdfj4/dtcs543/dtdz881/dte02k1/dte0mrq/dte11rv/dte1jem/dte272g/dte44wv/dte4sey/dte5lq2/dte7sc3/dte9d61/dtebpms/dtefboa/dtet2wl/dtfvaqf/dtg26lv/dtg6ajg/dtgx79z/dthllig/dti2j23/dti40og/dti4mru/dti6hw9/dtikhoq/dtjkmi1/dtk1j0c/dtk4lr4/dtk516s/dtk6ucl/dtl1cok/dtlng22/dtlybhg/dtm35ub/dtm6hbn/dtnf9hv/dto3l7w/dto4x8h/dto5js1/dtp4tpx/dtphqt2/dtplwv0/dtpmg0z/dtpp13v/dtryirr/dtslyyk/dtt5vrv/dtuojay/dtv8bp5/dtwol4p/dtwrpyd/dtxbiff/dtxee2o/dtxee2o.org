Adding 'Bane of Janissaries' or something to represent his well-known habit of damaging any humans assigned to his care might be appropriate.

(/if/ Rome? There has to be a story behind a title like that).

I think a prankster would take care to accumulate a bunch of titles that refer to particularly spectacular pranks. "Greaser of Pigs", for example, might refer to the time he got hold of fifteen pigs, covered them in grease, numbered them from 1 to 16 (deliberately skipping 5) and released them in the middle of someone's mansion. Even once all fifteen pigs had been captured, people would waste hours searching for number five... (I imagine the 'iron toe' title also fits vaguely in this category).

"He of the Long Memory" is also vaguely worrying in a known prankster (especially combined with the 'patient ear' title). You never know /when/ he's going to bring up some vague indiscretion that you thought you'd left behind you a dozen decades ago (and the fact that he occasionally does this after someone refuses him a request means that a lot of other vampires find it very difficult not to allow him just a little more slack than they normally would, /especially/ if he's grinning during the negotiations... because ninety-nine times out of a hundred if you say 'no' nothing happens, but one time out of a hundred you say 'no' and six months later everyone's talking about this thing you did a century ago that you have no idea /how/ Cassius ever even found out about it and your reputation's taken a massive dive and you /really/ wish you hadn't said 'no'...)

"Thief of Dignity" is also a good title for a prankster-type character.

Ursula's titles seem quite fitting to her relative power - especially since /she/ gets to choose who counts as 'merciful' or 'foolish' (and it's clear that if you don't fit in with "loved by all she visits" then your name goes on the 'foolish' list) and she can easily get rid of titles she doesn't like.

Erlis and Elodia might have one or more titles that are just plain humiliating to reinforce their place at the bottom of the totem pole - titles that Ursula finds amusing, so the titles stay. Elodia, for example, might be "Footstool of [more powerful vampire]", while Erlis might even be demoted as far as "Bootlicker of X"
