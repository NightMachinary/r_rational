  like they really should just make the human into a vampire if they want to be all touchy-feely about it.
#+end_quote

Perhaps even suggesting that poor Erlis' vampireness is leaking out, and leading to people making jokes that he'll end up human himself if he doesn't watch out...

Some people are sure to hint at him Turning the ones he cares about and ignoring the rest - after all, in a half a century they'll all be dead, and who bothers making friends who can't even sustain a friendship for a decent few centuries?

#+begin_quote
  I imagine he's also slowly getting a network of "bleeding hearts" together, and hoping that in a few centuries they'll be able to "come out of the closet" and treating humans with respect will be the norm.
#+end_quote

Ooooh, worse, he's probably getting a network of /jannissaries/ together. Not a single one of them would ever betray their own vampire master, of course, but he can probably get a lot of info by asking any of them to betray his or her master's /enemies/... which allows him to develop quite a spy network right under the noses of the other vampires.

Which he then promptly never uses for his own betterment, leaving those higher-ranked vampires who have worked out the spy network to wonder what exactly it is that he intends to /do/ with all these rumours. Could it possibly be that he /genuinely/ cares about these humans? Surely not, he's just putting on an act to get the jannissaries to talk!

#+begin_quote
  Of course, he gets really lucky that William, who isn't /too/ weak himself, has interests in Erlis's duchy for personal reasons so William can be brought into the fold
#+end_quote

Personal reasons and maybe he decides he should be listening in to all these rumours that pass Erlis' ears as well. The jannissary spy network could well be a tempting part of the aforementioned thin end of the wedge; between that, modern technology, and the occasional mage, vampires are certainly going to have reason to take humans pretty seriously.

#+begin_quote
  William would use his influence in both vampire and human worlds to ensure that human laws interact with vampire society in a way that privileges /him/ (naturally).
#+end_quote

Naturally.

  Then c.2600 he and Red are rival starship captains and we have VAMPIRES IN SPACE offbrand sequel!
#+end_quote

They'll have to be careful. The sun never sets in space... hmmm, and I seem to remember that they can't look directly even at sufficiently detailed images of it, so there's one direction out of the ship that the captain can never, ever look in, thus one must be very careful about attackers flying in from the direction of the Sun (non-vampire crew would have to look at the viewscreen and handle weapons themselves, and they just don't have the perfect aim of vampires...)

#+begin_quote
  Now I'm imagining them openly meeting in her courtyard, with her servants waiting on them, as she stands in the doorway and tries to understand a snippet of Chinese c. 800 CE...

The general King/Duchess dynamic is generally one wherein the King can do this and the Duchess can do practically nothing to stop him; but a lot of kings refrained on the basis that it would be rude to rub the Duchess' nose in just how much lower on the social totem pole she is. (Other, less popular kings would have done this sort of thing all the time, of course. Rude or not, it's good to be in charge).
