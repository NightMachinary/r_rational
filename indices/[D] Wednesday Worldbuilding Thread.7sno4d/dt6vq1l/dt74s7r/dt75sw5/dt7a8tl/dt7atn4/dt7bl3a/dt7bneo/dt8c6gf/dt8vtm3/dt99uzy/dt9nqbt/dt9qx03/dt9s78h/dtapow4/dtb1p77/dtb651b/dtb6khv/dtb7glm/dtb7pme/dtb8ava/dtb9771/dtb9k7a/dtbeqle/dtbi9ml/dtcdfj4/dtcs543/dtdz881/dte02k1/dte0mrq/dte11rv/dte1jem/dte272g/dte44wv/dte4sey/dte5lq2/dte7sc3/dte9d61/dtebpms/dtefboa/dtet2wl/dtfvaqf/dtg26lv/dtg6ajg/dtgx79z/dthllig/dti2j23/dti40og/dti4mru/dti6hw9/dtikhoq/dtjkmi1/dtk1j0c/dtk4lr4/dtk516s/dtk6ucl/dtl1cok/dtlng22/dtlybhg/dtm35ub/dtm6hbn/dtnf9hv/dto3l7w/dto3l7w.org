  I think I'll try and over-do it because it probably won't be overdone.

It is /possible/ to overdo it - but I agree with you. It probably won't be overdone.

Mixing and matching a few of the ideas you've suggested I think I can suggest a few more (I have no idea whether or not the first of these is in any way practical given the timeline):

- Red's farewell to Julias - after Julias turns up unexpectedly at the station with a small bag (containing, perhaps, Red's toothbrush or some similar small items and a small portrait (because you can't photograph vampires) of William for Red to either keep or dramatically throw out of the train window, depending on scene requirements). Julias might make some mention of how he's been deliberately avoiding William ever since the fight specifically so he couldn't be ordered /not/ to say goodbye.

- Julias' inner monologue - which, to highlight the somewhat alien way he thinks, is a highly structured series of IF-THEN statements (and other pseudocode) which constantly reference William's projected happiness and try to increase it. Strongly contrasts with William's inner monologue, and helps to drive home that Julias is not and never was human.

  Transcript of a letter that Red sends home to announce his return? (this would also allow him to communicate his "you thought I died in the war but I have been secretly living in Corsica all this time" excuse, whatever that is: but it would require actually writing in 1940s style which I think would be more work than it's worth?)

Keep in mind that deserters were pretty reviled during the war. Short of claiming that he lost his memory due to a war injury to the head and only got it back recently, he's going to be in /trouble/ when he goes home. (And even with the memory excuse, people are going to want to see his scar).
