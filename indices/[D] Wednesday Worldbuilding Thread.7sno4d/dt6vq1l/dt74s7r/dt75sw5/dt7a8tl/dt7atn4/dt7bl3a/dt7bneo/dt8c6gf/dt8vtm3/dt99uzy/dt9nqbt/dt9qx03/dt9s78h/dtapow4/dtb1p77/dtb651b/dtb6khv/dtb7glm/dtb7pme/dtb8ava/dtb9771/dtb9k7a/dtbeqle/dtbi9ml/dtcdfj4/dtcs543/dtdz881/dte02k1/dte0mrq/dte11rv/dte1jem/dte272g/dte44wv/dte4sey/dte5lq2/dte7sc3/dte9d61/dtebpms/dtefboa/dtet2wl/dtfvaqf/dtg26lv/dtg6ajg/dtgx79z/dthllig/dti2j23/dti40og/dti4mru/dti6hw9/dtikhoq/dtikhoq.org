  That's a tricky question: I mean, the second you get diagnosed with terminal cancer or something is probably a pretty good time. But you could get hit by a bus tomorrow, so you know... (or be driving at high speed while that friend of mine is texting in the next lane...)

It is possible to treat the question mathematically. It comes down to how much you value being alive a few hundred years from now in comparison with how much you value being alive the day after tomorrow.

...I don't think Red would have the mathematical tools to approach it in that fashion, though. (Unless he has an interest in probability theory that he's been keeping quiet about).

Interesting. Nothing really to nitpick at in here, though Red's promotion over the course of the thoughts from 'boy' to 'man' was done quite well. William's casual psychopathy comes out really well here (though he's right, leaving another vampire an opening like that /was/ careless on his part - presumably force of habit not to care about what a mere human might be risking, though).
