  And poor Red, never has a time when he can truly relax; always scared an officer is around the next corner. Full of guilt. :(

[[/twipride][]] That sounds about right, yes. And extra guilt every time someone gives him a free strawberry to thank him for his loyal service, and he tries to politely refuse it, and then they think he's just being modest and he ends up with even /more/ free strawberries...

  Structurally, do you think it's a good way to present the thought process? Or should I go for something more "organic"?
#+end_quote

Hmmm. I don't think it's a /bad/ way to present the thought process.

One idea that occurs to me is to format it in the shape of 'solutions' and 'subsolutions'. For example, the solution 'repair relationship between Master and Romantic Object' might have subsolutions like 'By faking a letter from Master to Romantic Object' or 'By persuading Master to write letter to Romantic Object' or 'By imitating Master's voice on telephone to Romantic Object' and so on.

  Great... now I want to write an interlude of Julias trawling whatever passed for gay clubs in 1940s Europe for men who resembled Red, interviewing them, and then discarding most of them; but then gently guiding William to "just bump into" whichever candidate Julias most preferred. He'd then take note of William's reactions and refine his choices.

And then, of course, the immediate reaction is that William is reminded of Red and ends up less happy, at least for the rest of the day. And then Julias notes down "somewhat /less/ similar to previous Romantic Object" and continues... also observing William's reaction to the people he genuinely /does/ accidentally bump into, in the hope of better understanding Master's preferences...
