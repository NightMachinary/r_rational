  I think that, in order to qualify for this trope, Red has to at some point take off his glasses while letting his hair down. And make permanent changes to his wardrobe.

Well, because Red's going to be living for another 60+ years, his wardrobe will be changing out of necessity if nothing else.

    FateDrivesUsTogether : Nope. William just buys Red and then goes to visit him. None of it is coincidental.

  This might count as a thoroughly Defied Trope, then?

Maybe not: fate drove them together because they both were involved in the hotel (that I just now realised is called, appropriately, "hotel of the sun" in Italian, which was completely not intentional, I was just trying to find an old hotel in Rome).

Then /again/, the characters have to meet somehow, so I guess by definition you need a bit of fate.

  Make the bullets electrum - that's a naturally-occurring silver/gold alloy. This way they work as required, yet at the same time Cassius can tell her it's due to the silver in the alloy, and voila, secret maintained.

That's true: why electrum over pure silver, though? Is it cheaper? Easier to get? Maybe vampires have a fake superstition about dealing with pure silver....
