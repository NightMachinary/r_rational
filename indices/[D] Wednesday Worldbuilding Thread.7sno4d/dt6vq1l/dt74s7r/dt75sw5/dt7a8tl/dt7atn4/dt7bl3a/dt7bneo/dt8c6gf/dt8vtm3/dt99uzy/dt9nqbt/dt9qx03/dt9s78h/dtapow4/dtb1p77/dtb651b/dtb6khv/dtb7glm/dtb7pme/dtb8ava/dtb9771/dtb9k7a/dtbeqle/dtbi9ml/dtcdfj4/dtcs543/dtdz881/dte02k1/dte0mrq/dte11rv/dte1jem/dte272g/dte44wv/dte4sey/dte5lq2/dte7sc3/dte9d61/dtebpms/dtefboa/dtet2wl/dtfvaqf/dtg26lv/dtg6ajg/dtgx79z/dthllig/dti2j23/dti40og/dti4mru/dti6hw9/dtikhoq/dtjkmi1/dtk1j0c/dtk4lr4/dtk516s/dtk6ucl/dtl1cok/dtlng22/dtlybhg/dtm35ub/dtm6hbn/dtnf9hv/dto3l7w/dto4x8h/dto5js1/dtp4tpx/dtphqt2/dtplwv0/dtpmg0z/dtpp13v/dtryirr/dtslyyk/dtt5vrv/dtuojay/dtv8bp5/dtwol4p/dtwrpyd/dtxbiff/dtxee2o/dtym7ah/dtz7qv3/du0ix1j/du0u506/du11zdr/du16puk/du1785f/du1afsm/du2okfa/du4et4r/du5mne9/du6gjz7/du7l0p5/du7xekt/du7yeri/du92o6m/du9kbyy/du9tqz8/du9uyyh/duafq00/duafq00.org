  Honestly, I think until relatively recently, vampires didn't really bother with what their humans heard them saying. They live a short time and can't read or write so who are they going to tell?
#+end_quote

...that makes sense.

#+begin_quote
  In Italian, yes, because the nouns end in -a or -o and the gender corresponds almost universally.
#+end_quote

That is /way/ better than the German system (which as far as I can tell is generally arbitrary).

But those rare exceptions will still trip up most new speakers.

  So Red might accidentally say /una granda scatola/ not knowing the adjectives
#+end_quote

Worse, if he forgets the word for 'big' it's not impossible that he might say /una... una grossa scatola/ - knowing that it's not quite correct, but also that it communicates the right idea.

  I can generally pick up on people writing in English who speak French as a first language (or maybe not - toupee fallacy and all). There's word choices that are slightly /off/ and little grammatical things here and there that I can't think of off the top of my head.
#+end_quote

Yeah... different languages have different sort of signature errors. Someone who grew up with Afrikaans and is just learning English might easily say "I'll throw you with a pie!" instead of "I'll hit you with a pie!" or "I'll throw a pie at you!"

Similarly, when I was at university I once proofread a document written by someone who'd grown up with Mandarin, and there were singular/plural verb/noun disagreements /everywhere/ (something like "there is three cows in the field" or "one of them are a bull") and a near-complete lack of the word 'the'.

So I can readily believe that if one really studies the matter, one can probably predict the first language of a second-language English speaker by a study of their grammatical errors with strong confidence.

#+begin_quote
  (infinitives are in square brackets because English doesn't have infinitives as one word; below I am also putting esperanto words that come out to multiple words in English in square brackets)
#+end_quote

That's a good way to do it. (How would you handle the case when a language splits a word that's one word in English into two words and then puts those two words at different places in the sentence?)

  [Yoda quotes]
#+end_quote

Hmmm. Interesting.

#+begin_quote
  Like I said before, esperanto tends to be SVO so altering the order, even if it's still /grammatical/, would have a similar effect.
#+end_quote

Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks!
