  Worse yet is 'smart but uneducated and has read an entire encyclopedia set cover to cover'
#+end_quote

Nah, I imagine him looking through the encyclopaedia like I look through wikipedia: reading an interesting article and then bouncing around to another interesting article and so on. When things come up (e.g. the age of Belgium) he scurries off to look them up.

  I'd suggest having William spend some parts of the latter 1940s tutoring him off-screen
#+end_quote

William's already helping him learn French so general "logic" can easily be part of these lessons. (Now I'm wondering: do the readers want to see a tutoring session? Probably not)

  But if you ever find yourself writing a few thousand words about Cassius playing fetch with his dog, you may need to stop and think about that for a few minutes.
#+end_quote

Any such scenes (like Cassius talking to Yolande, that I shared earlier) would be relegated to one-page interludes and have at least /some/ sort of purpose, don't worry.

  Didn't think to wrap them? ... I think William's lying here
#+end_quote

Good catch!

I'm of two minds why the presents weren't wrapped:

- William didn't think he and Red would exchange gifts so had to panic and come up with the encyclopaedia thing at the last minute: but gift-giving has been part of winter solstice/christian traditions for a very long time, since before William was born, so that doesn't seem to pass muster as a "he wasn't aware of it" thing. But it might be a status thing: exchanging gifts obviously has a special meaning in vampire society, and perhaps he didn't want to "do Red that honour" because they "weren't that serious", but then Red's gift touched him so much he changed his mind

- William thought that because when Red described the "christmas custom", he didn't mention gift-giving as being an important component ("Family lunch, usually. My mother and her brother take turns hosting. Mom does a dinner Christmas Eve, too, just for Dorothy and me.")

I'm leaning towards the first, with the "status" explanation as to why William didn't plan on it. Not that it matters as the reader will likely never find out.

#+begin_quote
  you mention things that can be seen and only things that can be seen
#+end_quote

Yeah, you've pointed that out before and it had a big impact on my writing - I even found a coffee taste wheel that coffee tasters (like wine tasters) use, to try and describe the taste of coffee. But it's left by the wayside a bit. It's hard because I think very visually! I definitely have done it before, but it's so hard to describe smells, to use something that I can ctrl+F. A bunch of out of context excerpts below, I feel like they're super repetitive, that I'm just saying "the basil smelled like basil" or using a generic adjective ("acrid" or "heavy" or "sweet"). I wish we spoke that Malaysian language that has words that describe smells as well as English describes colours.

  After one hard day, Red was sitting on the couch while William kneeled on the stone floor. William had a small jar of scented oil, bowl of water, and some clean towels on the ground beside him. William rubbing Red's feet had been a normal enough part of their routine, but not the half hour every night that William had insisted on lately.

  “Your feet are getting worse. You should rest for a few days.” William had nearly finished the massage; he was firmly kneading on Red's calf muscles. The warm, earthy smell of the oil hung in the air.

  This morning Red felt the early morning air falling crisp and fresh upon his senses in a way never had before. He could smell the noxious scent of garbage, the fresh dew, the faint scent of orange blossoms. He heard the distant sound of automobiles being driven by those who could spare the gasoline. Everything felt sharper, crisper. He could feel the cobblestones under his feet through the thick soles of his shoes.

  William woke with Red lying next to him. Red lay on his own arm, eyes closed, gently stroking William's hair. He smelled of coffee and congealed blood and strong soap and Chestnut.

  Back at the house, William cooked while Red rinsed the sea water from himself and Chestnut. It was Red's last meal before the sun rose; before it was time for bed. The rich smell of basil filled the air. It was routine. It was pleasant.

  It felt as though William had some sort of rash. With the sharpened senses that were nature's payment for allowing a vampire to feed from him, Red could smell something was off: a faint, burned smell. He brought his right hand to his nose and he could smell it, stronger. The smell of a campfire; burning pine. And the rank smell of cooked flesh.

  When it was next time for William to feed, Red held him for an unreasonably long time before he would let him leave. When he returned, if the thick smell of coffee and the countless books strewn about the place were anything to go by, Red had spent the entire time sitting in the lounge room anxiously awaiting his return.

  “I didn't do anything.” Red grumbled, his voice harsher than usual. He picked up the bottle in his right hand and took another swig. He didn't flinch at the taste, even though the acrid smell of the whiskey filled the room as he spoke. “It was an accident.”

  “Don't worry. You'll do great. I'm just warming the blood up now. Come on, have a look.” She beckoned him over. He moved to stand beside her. The blood was thick and dark and he could feel its fetid copper odour sticking to the roof of his mouth. He wondered if he would ever get used to it. He thought of Lucia: no doubt, after a hundred years, he would.

  “Wow. I've never seen blood like that before.” Red tried not to pay attention to the images of his landing in Italy that came to mind at the sight and smell of this warm blood.

  “Thank you.” Red murmured automatically, taking another sip of his wine; heavy, soft, and smokey. “You want some of this? It's pretty good. I think. I don't really get wine.”

  “I'll try some if you want.” He said, smiling.

  “Do you want spaghetti for dinner? I've never actually seen you eat, so I wasn't sure if I should make you some or not.” He handed Julias his glass.

  “I live on sunlight.” He replied, moving the glass in a small circle beneath his nose as he took in the ashy smell of the drink. “But I'm happy to join you for dinner if you want.”

  “Oh, don't eat on my account.” Red waved it off as Julias took a sip of the wine; it was metallic and earthy. “Is it like with William, where if you eat it you have to throw it up again?”
