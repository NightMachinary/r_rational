  The janissary network sounds hard to trust, on some level: you know the information is good, or at least has a kernel of truth - but you don't know whether the vampire in question wanted that information or not.

In other words, it's just like any other rumour network...

I imagine most jannissaries have some level of loyalty to their current vampire - at the very least, they're happy with their current arrangement and are (on average) reluctant to move to an unknown vampire; though that's not to say you don't get the occasional exception.

  Human professors of antiquities - the more obscure the civilisation the better - have noticed this strange phenomenon where an intelligent, well-spoken student presents themselves to them.

[[/twibeam][]] Nice. I like it! (Of course, a lot of them are interested in studying the pronounciation, where anything is known about this, as well, and they are surprisingly uninterested in having their names attached to new papers in the field...).

  I remembered that etiquette used to require that you have two envelopes - one inside the other.

Huh. That's surprisingly practical. And that practicality is in turn why the vampires would no doubt choose this method.

  Now I want to write a scene where William teaches Red how to prepare his mail (i.e. opening the outer envelope), and Red just has his eyes bug out at the title thing: except he wouldn't because vampires wouldn't do stuff like that in languages the servants spoke, and anyone William corresponded with would know William made his home in an English-speaking country so could be assume to have English-speaking servants.

So, Red opens the outer envelops and sees that the inner one is written in - oh - Chinese or Arabic or Linear A or something. Why wouldn't his eyes bug out at this? And then he asks William what it is and William reads it out, translating as he reads the entire title (which only makes Red's eyes bug out further, especially as he'd only meant to ask what language it was in...) - and then the scene progresses from there.

Incidentally, /can/ you speak in more than one language?
