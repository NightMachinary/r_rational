  So... it's damp, small, poorly lit, the rustle and scurry of rats, smell of garbage that people have left out.....
#+end_quote

[[/twibeam][]] Yes! Exactly! Now remember to put those in when you write the scene!

  Ugh, there's the trouble of writing a /romance novel/ - William can't do anything too heinous on screen (ESPECIALLY not in front of Red), or people will hate him too much, or think the romance is unrealistic/etc.
#+end_quote

Um. Correct me if I'm wrong here, but - is it really important for the audience to like William?

I mean, at this stage of the story, William /is/ an unrepentant multiple murderer. (I can see him trying to clean up his act in front of Red, for one reason or another, but - at least at first - when Red steps out of the picture, William should probably show the occasional hint of being entirely cavalier about the lives of /other/ humans).

On top of that, the idea that you can't have a romance novel that involves murder on the part of the major players... consider, briefly, this scene:

- DAMSEL comes on-stage, (stage left) pursued.
- Pursuers follow. There are six of them, all BRIGANDS.
- BRIGANDS catch DAMSEL, and proceed to beat and rob her.
- BRIGANDS begin to discuss doing a lot worse to DAMSEL, while she is helpless.
- Fortunately, KNIGHT arrives, stage right.
- KNIGHT proceeds to beat up and decapitate BRIGANDS.
- KNIGHT rescues DAMSEL, places her atop his horse, and rides off into the sunset.

Is this scene not the famous "knight in shining armour", one of the major tropes of romance? And did Knight not just brutally murder half a dozen people?

Now, I can believe that you (or any other single person) would not want to date KNIGHT after those casual murders. But I do not believe that /no-one/ would.

And, again, at this early stage William /is/ a murderer. I think that this either needs to be shown in some way, or William's backstory may need to change to fit his portrayal.

  Like... if a guy I liked did that, threw someone onto a roof, and they died,
#+end_quote

Oh, I wasn't trying to suggest that the guy on the roof had /died/. Just stopped moving because when some guy casually tosses you up four storeys, you /do not attract his attention again/ if you can possibly help it. (And then he slunk sheepishly down the fire escape an hour or so later).

#+begin_quote
  Then again, thinking about William's reaction to Red training, it's two-fold
#+end_quote

Huh. I didn't even think that William might have reason to /want/ Red training.

#+begin_quote
  He's glad Red has something to do during the day, because it means he's not depressed and mopey, and that's good for him on two levels
#+end_quote

...okay, that's actually a pretty good reason, all told.

#+begin_quote
  He's worried about Red getting injured
#+end_quote

...this isn't. If William is rationally weighing these two factors, then Factor 1 should win out completely. But if his reasoning is drowned out by emotion, then Factor 2 could be unreasonably heavily weighted.

...Factor 2 can be severely mitigated by having his current thrall (Paola, perhaps?) look after Red during the day.
