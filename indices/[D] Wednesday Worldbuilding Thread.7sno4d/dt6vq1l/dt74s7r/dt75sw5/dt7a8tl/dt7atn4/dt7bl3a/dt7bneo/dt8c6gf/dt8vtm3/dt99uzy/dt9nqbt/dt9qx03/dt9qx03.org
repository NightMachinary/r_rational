Yay for Cassius!

Some comments seem appropriate, though.

  William narrowed his eyes slightly.

The two of them have just been communicating through the creases in a towel, and the twitches of William's fingers as he adjusts his tie. How is a facial motion like this /not/ an entire sentence of its own? (Probably Vampire for /I will kill you in your sleep/, too).

  “I think you are being rude, your majesty. I am asking you a simple question.”
#+end_quote

I've noticed this trend in your writing before - this is /not/ an inferior talking to a superior. This is two near-social-equals having a chat, and about something which William expects to be truly inconsequential to Cassius at that.

Which means you're getting the 'friendly terms' thing down well, at least.

  Hee laughed again, and retrieved the towel. /I don't believe you. You are aware of your reputation./ The way he picked it up spelled out the retort. Left hand, picked up from the centre. He elaborated with some careful folds. /You don't remember. They are impossible./

There's a really impressive amount of information being exchanged here, in a few simple actions. Not impossible - especially if things like Cassius' facial expression while he's moving, or his precise finger motions, play into the gesture in important ways - but it's probably important to bear in mind that it's going to be very hard for any gesture, no matter how elaborate, to transmit information faster than the spoken word.

Consider the towel retort, for example. Ten words. A bit of poking around on Google suggests that ordinary English has an entropy which can be rounded off to about ten bits a word; so, that phrase is maybe a hundred bits of information.

Left vs. right hand is /one/ bit. Picking it up from the centre - let's assume the towel can be picked up from anywhere in a sixteen-by-sixteen grid. That's 256 locations - another eight bits. Let's say another ten bits per hand in finger positions, and... hmmm. Another ten bits each for facial expression and stance. (I'm trying to err on the side of generosity here) This comes up to about forty-nine bits... out of a hundred.

This can be enhanced, to some degree, by having towel-related actions already have their own implication (as opposed to, say, rose-related actions); adding more bits of meaning. But it's definitely starting to look as if Cassius is going to need to readjust his finger positions several times to get enough information for a phrase like that into his gesture.

I mean - a secondary language based entirely on minor gestures is a pretty cool thing to have, and I can see plenty of good reasons to include it. But what you have presented here comes across as implausibly high-bandwidth communication.
