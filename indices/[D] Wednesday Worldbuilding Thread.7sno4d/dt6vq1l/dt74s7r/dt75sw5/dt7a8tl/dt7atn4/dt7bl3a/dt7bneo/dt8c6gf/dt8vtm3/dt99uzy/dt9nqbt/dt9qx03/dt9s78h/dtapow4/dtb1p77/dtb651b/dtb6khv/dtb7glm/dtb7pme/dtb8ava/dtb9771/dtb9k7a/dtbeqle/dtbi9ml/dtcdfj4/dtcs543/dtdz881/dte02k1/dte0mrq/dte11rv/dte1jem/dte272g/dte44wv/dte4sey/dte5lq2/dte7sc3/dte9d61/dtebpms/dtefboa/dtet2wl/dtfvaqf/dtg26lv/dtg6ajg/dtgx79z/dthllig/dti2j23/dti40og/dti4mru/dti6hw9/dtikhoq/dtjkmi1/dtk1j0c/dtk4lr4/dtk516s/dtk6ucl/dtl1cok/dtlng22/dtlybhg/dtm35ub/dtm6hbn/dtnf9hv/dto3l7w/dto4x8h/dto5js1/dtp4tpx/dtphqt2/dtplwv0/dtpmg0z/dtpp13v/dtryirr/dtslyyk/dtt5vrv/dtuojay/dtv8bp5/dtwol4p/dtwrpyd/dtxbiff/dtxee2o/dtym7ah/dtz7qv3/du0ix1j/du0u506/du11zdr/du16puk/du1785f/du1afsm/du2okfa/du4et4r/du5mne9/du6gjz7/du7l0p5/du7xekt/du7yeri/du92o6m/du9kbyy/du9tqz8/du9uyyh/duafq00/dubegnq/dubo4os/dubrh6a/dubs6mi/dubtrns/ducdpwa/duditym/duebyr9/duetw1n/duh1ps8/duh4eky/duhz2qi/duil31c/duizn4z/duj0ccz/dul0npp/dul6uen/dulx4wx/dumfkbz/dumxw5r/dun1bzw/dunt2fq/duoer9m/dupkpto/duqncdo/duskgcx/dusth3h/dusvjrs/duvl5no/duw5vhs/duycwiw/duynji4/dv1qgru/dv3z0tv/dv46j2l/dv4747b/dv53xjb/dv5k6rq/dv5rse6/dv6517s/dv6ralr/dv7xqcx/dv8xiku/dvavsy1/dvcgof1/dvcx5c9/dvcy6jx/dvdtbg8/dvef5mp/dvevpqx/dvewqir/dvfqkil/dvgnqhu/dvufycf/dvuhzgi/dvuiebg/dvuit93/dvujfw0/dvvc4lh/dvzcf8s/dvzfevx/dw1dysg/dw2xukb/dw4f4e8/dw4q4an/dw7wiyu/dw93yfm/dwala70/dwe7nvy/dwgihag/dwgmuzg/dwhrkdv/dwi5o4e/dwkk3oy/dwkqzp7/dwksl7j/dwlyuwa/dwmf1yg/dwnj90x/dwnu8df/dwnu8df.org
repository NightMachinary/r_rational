  Maybe not: fate drove them together because they both were involved in the hotel

[[/hmmm][]] Wasn't that because Cassius was trying to scam William out of a duchy that he forced them together, though? So, not even fate on /that/ level.

  That's true: why electrum over pure silver, though? Is it cheaper? Easier to get? Maybe vampires have a fake superstition about dealing with pure silver....
#+end_quote

[[/twishrug][]] Well, we both know what the /real/ reason is. Cassius can make up any false reason he wants - maybe he'll claim he has a contact who makes electrum bullets super cheap or whatever. (He probably /does/ have such a contact, but doesn't mention that he helped the contact decide to set up the business).
