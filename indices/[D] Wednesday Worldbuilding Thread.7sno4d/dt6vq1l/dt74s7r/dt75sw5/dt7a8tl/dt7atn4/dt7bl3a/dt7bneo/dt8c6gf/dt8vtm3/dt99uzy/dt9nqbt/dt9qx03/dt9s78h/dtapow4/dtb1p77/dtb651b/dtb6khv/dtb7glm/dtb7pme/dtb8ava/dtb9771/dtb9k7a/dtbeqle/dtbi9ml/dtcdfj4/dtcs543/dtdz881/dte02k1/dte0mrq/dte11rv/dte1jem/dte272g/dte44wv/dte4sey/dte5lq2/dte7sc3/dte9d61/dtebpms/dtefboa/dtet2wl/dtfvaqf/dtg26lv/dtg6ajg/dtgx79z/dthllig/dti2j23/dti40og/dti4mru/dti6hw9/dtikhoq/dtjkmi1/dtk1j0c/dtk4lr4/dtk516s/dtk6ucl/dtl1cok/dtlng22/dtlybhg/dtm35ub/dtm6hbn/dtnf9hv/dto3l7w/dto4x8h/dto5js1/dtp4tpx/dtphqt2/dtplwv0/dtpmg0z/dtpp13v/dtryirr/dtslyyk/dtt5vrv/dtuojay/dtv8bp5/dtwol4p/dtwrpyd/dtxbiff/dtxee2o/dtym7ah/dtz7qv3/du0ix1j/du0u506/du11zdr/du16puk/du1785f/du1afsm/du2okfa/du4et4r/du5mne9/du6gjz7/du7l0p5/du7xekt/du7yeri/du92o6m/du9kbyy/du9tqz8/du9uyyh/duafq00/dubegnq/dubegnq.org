The French system is the same as the German: no rhyme or reason. There's a few rules of thumb: -e is generally feminine, -ion is generally feminine, etc. There's some more that I've forgotten but they're meant to in concert be correct 80% of the time. When I write in French I just do what "feels" right and accept that I might sound like an idiot sometimes because I get a gender wrong.

  different languages have different sort of signature errors.

And it so happened that I was reading a recipe written by a native french speaker this morning and I found one of the signature French-speaker English "quirks":

  If you are not a fan of coconut, don't worry you can't taste it. This cake is so chocolatey it is covering the coconut flavor.
#+end_quote

"it is [gerund]" is a weird affectation that seems common in French natives, since an English native would say "the cake is so chocolatey it covers the coconut flavour" - which is weird because after studying a fr-en dictionary and doing some exploration with the /very scientific/ google translate the French use the verb cover in the same sort of way, and the French don't have a particular love for the gerund.

  So I can readily believe that if one really studies the matter, one can probably predict the first language of a second-language English speaker by a study of their grammatical errors with strong confidence.

There's a program that guesses your English dialect: [[http://archive.gameswithwords.org/WhichEnglish/]]

Here's what I get:

Our top three guesses for your English dialect: 1. New Zealandish 2. Australian 3. Welsh (UK)

Our top three guesses for your native (first) language: 1. English 2. Norwegian 3. Dutch

South African English is apparently one of the things it guesses, so you can see how well it does for you...

  How would you handle the case when a language splits a word that's one word in English into two words and then puts those two words at different places in the sentence?
#+end_quote

Good question. I can't think of Esperanto doing that but French does it with negations. It really would depend on what I was trying to communicate.
