  If they strike dead-on, they'll knock the bone back (it's unbreakable, not immovable) and lose most of their energy to either that motion or the bullet deforming.

Oh, good point. Hits the femur, all of a sudden the vampire's femur sticks out her perfectly tailored pants. She frowns, pushes it back into position, and goes for revenge....

  possibly they can feel the bullet breaking their skin, and their nerves are fast enough to trigger a reflexive, involuntary 'get-out-the-way' muscle twitch?

Ohh, make the bones harder (nanites packing the calcium more efficiently or some bull) and use this and a combination of bullet time / "plucking the bullet out of the air". Presumably the bullet has a shockwave in the air that reaches the vampire marginally before the bullet does. At its most extreme I see a vampire sitting, reading, and a sniper keeps on firing shots and the vampire flicks them out of the way like a fly.

Also, thick medieval style metal helmets will probably get a lot of use when vampires fear guns as they'll slow/stop a bullet enough.

  But that allows a sufficiently well-prepared hunter to force a vampire to move like he wants, with the right pattern of shots

That'd have to be a hell of a well-prepared hunter, but I'm going to allow this.
