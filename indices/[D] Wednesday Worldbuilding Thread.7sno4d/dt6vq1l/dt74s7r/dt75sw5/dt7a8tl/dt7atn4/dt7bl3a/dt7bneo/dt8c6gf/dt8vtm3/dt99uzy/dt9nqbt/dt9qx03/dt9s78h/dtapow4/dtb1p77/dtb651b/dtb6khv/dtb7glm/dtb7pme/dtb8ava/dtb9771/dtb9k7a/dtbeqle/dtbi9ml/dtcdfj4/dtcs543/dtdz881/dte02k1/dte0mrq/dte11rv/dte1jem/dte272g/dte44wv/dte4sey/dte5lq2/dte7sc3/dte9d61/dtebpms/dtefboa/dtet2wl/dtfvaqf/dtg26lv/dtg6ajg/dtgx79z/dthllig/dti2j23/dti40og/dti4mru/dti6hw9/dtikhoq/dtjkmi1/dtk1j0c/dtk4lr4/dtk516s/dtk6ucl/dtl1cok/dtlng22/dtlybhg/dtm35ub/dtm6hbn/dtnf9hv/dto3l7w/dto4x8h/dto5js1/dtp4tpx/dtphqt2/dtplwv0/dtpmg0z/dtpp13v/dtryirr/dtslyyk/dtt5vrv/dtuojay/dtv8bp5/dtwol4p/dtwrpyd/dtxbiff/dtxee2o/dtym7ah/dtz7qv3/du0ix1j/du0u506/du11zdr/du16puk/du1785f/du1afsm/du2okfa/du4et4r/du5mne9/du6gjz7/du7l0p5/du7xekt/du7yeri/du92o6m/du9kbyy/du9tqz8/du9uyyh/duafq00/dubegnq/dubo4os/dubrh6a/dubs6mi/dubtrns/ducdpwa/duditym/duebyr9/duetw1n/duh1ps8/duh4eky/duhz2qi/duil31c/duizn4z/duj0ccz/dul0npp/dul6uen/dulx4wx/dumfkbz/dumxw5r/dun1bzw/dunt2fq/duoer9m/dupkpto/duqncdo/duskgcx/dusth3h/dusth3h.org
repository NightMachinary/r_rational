  Yeah, infrastructure is /incredibly/ important. Get the right infrastructure and schools in place, and then getting everyone on an equal footing within a generation or two would be /substantially/ easier.

We've got a "closing the gap" initiative. 7 targets, of which three are being met: [[https://closingthegap.pmc.gov.au/executive-summary]] - the last time that we met as many as three was 2011, so omg... And the one's we're achieving are the "easiest" ones: child mortality, kindergarten enrolment, and high school completion (though oddly enough not... school attendance or reading/numeracy).

  I have a guess about why Australia hasn't done that, but it's really terribly cynical.
#+end_quote

Oh come on hit me with it!!!

  On the other hand, people who live in places like the area I live in, have such worries dramatically reduced.
#+end_quote

Without going into too many details, how affluent is your area and how much of a concern is crime? We bought a house about 5 years ago and the "rougher" suburbs talked about houses having alarm systems and whatnot, so much so that it seems like it's a requirement for living there, whereas the area I'm in, alarm systems are not terribly common.

And if you're one of Pistorious's neighbours then that tells a different story than if your family environment is more like the median, if you get me. (Then again, a median in a place where 80% of the population is "formerly disadvantaged" is maybe not a useful thing to talk about?).

  the sort of place where you don't leave your car outside the garage because if you do it won't be there an hour later.
#+end_quote

Ah, I can't think of any places like that. Even the most dodgy areas I can think of, you wouldn't want to leave any coins in your car or they might be stolen, but the car itself is going to be expected to be fine.

#+begin_quote
  companies that sell tracking devices for cars
#+end_quote

Nope, never heard of such a thing here. So... obviously different demos!

#+begin_quote
  So... yeah. In all fairness, such incidents are very, very much not the norm - but such a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Anni_Dewani][horrifying incident]], even when rare, is still not something one wants to risk.
#+end_quote

I'm a bit of a true crime buff so when you said "horrifying incident" I was expecting a lot worse than it seems like the poor woman got. And over AU$9,000??????????? How long could you live off that in South Africa? Here you'd live off that much money for... maybe six months, and it'd be a really meagre lifestyle.

  The /second/ mage then adds the sleep-in-daytime enchantment, because he wants to (for whatever reason) /save/ the vampires - perhaps the second mage was even a vampire himself.
#+end_quote

Aww, I'm imagining the second mage's daughter was turned into a vampire, and the daughter had... I don't know, Down's Syndrome or something and couldn't understand to stay out of the sun. That's.... kind of sweet.

Or just two mages that don't know what the other did: one puts the sleepy spell on, the other puts the sunshine spell on, and then they both realise they fucked up and should have cast the sleepytime spell differently.

#+begin_quote
  That's also a possibility, but then wouldn't a sufficiently dark box allow the vampire to remain awake?
#+end_quote

Depending on how dark sufficiently dark is, I am OK with this. Like, if they have to be inside a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-Kamiokande][neutrino detector]] (1km underground, surrounded by 50,000 tons of water), then I'm OK with that. A sufficiently deep tunnel of the type we can only build in the last ~100 years? All good. I'd probably even be happy with ~100m of cover though that runs into problems of being around mountains/etc, so maybe O~1km is the best way to go about it. If it comes up, which it might not ever.
