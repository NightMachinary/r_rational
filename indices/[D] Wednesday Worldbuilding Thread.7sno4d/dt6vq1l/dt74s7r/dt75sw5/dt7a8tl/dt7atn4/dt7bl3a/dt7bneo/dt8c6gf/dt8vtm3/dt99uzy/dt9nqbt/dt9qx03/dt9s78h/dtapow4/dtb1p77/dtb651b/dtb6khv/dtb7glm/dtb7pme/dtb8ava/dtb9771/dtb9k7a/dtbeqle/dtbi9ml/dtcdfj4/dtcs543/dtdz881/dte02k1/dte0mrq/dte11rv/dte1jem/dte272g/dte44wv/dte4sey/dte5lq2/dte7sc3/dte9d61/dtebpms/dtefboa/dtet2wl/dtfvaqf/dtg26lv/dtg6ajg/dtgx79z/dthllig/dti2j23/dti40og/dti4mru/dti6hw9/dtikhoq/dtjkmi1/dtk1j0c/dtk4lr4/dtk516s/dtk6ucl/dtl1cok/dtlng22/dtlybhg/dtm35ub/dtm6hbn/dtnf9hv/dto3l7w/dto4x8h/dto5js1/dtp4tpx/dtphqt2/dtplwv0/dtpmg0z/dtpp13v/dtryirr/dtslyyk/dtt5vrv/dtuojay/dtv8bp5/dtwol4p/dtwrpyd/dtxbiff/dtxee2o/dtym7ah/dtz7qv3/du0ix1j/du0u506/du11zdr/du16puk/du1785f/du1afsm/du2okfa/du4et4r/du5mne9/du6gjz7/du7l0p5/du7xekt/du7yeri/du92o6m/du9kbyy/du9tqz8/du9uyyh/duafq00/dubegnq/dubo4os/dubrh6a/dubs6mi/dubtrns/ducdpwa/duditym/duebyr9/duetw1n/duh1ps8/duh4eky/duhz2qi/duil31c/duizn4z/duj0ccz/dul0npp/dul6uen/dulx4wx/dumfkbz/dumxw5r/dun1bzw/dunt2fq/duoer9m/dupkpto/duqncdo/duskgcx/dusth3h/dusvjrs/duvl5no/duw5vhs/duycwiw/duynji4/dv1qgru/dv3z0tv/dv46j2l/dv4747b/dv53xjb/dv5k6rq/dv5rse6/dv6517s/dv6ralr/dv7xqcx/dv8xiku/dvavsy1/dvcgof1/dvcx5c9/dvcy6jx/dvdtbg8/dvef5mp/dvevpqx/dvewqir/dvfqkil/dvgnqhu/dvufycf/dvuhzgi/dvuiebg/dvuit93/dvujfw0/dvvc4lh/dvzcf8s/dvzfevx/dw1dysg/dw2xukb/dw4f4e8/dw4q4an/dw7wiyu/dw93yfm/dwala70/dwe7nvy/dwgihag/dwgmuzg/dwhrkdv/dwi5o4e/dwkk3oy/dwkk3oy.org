  Still sick, but yeah, improved from yesterday. I'm going through pain medicine like crazy (ibuprofen/paracetemol), and by like crazy I mean "in exactly the quantities my doctor recommended and no more because i don't want to damage my liver i'm not some sort of damn idiot".

[[/spikeapproves][]] Sounds good, then!

  Great - now I want to find a list of romance tropes to subvert - okay here's one and it's long maybe not [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTropes]] - I know, I'll just search for gay and see how I'm doing, trope-wise
#+end_quote

[[/pinkiepout][]] Soooooo.... the central, defining feature of your character's romance is the homosexuality?

[[/sp][]]

  Nope... how about from now on you just assume that anything terrible I write is an obvious placeholder, thus making me a ~perfect writer~!

[[/flutterkay][]] So, if an entire excerpt is made entirely of placeholders, then...

  describing Paola's room really gets you into her head and sets up her next appearance.
#+end_quote

[[/huhhuh][]] Another excellent reason to describe it, yes!

But let's see what else it's possible to get from that room.

[[/sp][]]

[[/alloysword][]] Swords are an elegant weapon, not as clumsy and random as a blaster. Clearly, Paola used to be an officer in the Roman army (I think officers around the time of the World Wars would still traditionally wear swords? Not sure.)

[[/sp][]]

[[/discordbox][]] Those locked boxes could contain /anything/. War memorabilia? Old letters? Military secrets?

[[/sp][]]

[[/ninjapie][]] And then, of course, there's that giant window without even an attempt to create fake blackout curtains. Wasn't it the law in Rome during war that all windows had to have blackout curtains, so as not to provide a target for passing bombers? If she doesn't even /pretend/ to be following that law, then she clearly /must/ have highly-placed contacts in the legal system, willing to turn a blind eye.
