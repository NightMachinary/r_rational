More like that's /some/ TV show. It's a great... dystopian near future sci-fi in the style of The Twilight Zone/Outer Limits. It's on netflix, and it's very, very good. If the first episode isn't your cup of tea, pause it and go watch the second instead. The first episode is... disturbing for some people.

Ok, here's a question I was meaning to ask you:

So, William doesn't have a thrall set up at the beginning of the novel (there's actually... no good explanation for that, other than he might have left the thrall at home while was travelling; more likely, he drained the thrall dry by accident or "by accident" shortly before leaving). And when they have to flee Rome in the third chapter, it became painfully obvious to me that William really should have a thrall for exactly this sort of event: he can't possibly trust Red to look after him when he's comatose, so I have inserted a thrall for him (Paola is her name for now). I figured, if he has no thrall, and he can easily maintain 3 or so, then there's no harm in him making a temporary thrall for his holiday in Rome and then abandoning her when he's done with her. That way, should he need a loyal and strong servant, she's there at a moment's notice. And he uses her.

But now I have a character who shows up for a couple of scenes with no explanation and disappears just as suddenly, which isn't ideal. So I've been thinking about the whole thing, and I've come on a few options:

1. Paola is Cassius's thrall, and William trusts Cassius well enough to have one of his thralls look after him while he's asleep

2. Paola is a temporary thrall who William picks up in Rome and discards when they get to Corsica

3. Paola is actually an Australian thrall who came with William from Australia; William doesn't want to put her up in his hotel because he doesn't want other vampires to know who his onsite thrall is or just because the hotel is fully booked for vampires only during the opera and their thralls stay at a nearby dorm.

Problem with #1: Why would William trust Paola!1 over Paola!2? It seems 2 is better than 1 in every way (other than P!1 would be stronger than P!2)

Problem with #2: Aforementioned: P!2 appears and then vanishes, seems like a deus ex machina

Problem with #3: P3 means that William is living a whole double live with Paola, behind Red's back. Even though there's nothing untoward going on there, it seems... dishonest. Also, when William is travelling through Europe, Paola would reappear and do some stuff (which is fine - I can write her in easily enough). Then, when William is travelling through the US later on, Paola would be there. Unless William decides to discard Paola in Europe for some reason - but why would he? (Unless... character development, and Paola is originally from Italy and William decides to leave her with her family? But I don't think his character has expanded that far...)

Ultimately, Red is going to become William's thrall - but that is not going to happen for 5 years, and I don't want William to be keeping two thralls at once, I don't think it will add anything to the story.

I think you can sidestep the dishonesty part of #3 by having William openly working with Paola on things (or, at least, telling Red he's going to see her) - but then I feel - hmmm... wait... HMMM...

Idea #4: Paola is one of /Elodia's/ thralls, either Lucia (the one Red befriends) or one of the minor ones (Odette I think is the name of one). This conserves the number of characters and makes it seem like less of an asspull. It does, however, still have the same big problem as #1 - i.e. why would William not have given himself a standby thrall and instead rely on thralls of someone he /trusts even less than Cassius/.

Thoughts?
