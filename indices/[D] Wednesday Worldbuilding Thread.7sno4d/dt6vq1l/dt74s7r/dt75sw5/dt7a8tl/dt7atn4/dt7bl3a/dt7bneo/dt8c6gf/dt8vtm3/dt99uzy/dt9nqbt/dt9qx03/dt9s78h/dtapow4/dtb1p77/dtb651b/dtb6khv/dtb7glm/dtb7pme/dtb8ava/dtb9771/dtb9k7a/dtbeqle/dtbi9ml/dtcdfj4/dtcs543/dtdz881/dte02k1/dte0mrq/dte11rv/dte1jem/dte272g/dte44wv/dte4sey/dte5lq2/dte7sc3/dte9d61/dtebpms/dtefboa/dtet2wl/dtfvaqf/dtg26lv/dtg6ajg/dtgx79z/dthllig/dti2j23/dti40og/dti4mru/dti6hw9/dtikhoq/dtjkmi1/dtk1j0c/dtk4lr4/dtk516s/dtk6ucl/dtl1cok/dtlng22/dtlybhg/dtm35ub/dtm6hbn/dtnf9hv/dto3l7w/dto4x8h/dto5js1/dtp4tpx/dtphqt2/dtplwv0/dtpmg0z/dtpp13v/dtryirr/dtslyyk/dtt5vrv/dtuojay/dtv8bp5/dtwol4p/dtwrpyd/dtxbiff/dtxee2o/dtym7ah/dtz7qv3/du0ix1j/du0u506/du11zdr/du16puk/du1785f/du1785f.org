  Especially when we consider that these are /vampires/ we're talking about, and so blood has extra connotations to them. The bleeding heart isn't just overly compassionate - the connotation suggests an image of a vampire /giving blood/ */back/* /to humans/
#+end_quote

When you remember that My Vampires are born by having a human's chest ripped open to reveal the heart, the appropriate valve being severed, and the vampire "donor" vomiting gross sludge into the heart, the bleeding heart metaphor sounds even /worse/ - like they really should just make the human into a vampire if they want to be all touchy-feely about it.

  other vampires give poor Erlis a very wide berth, to the point where he's practically forced to talk to the jannissaries because it's often choice between them or the coat rack
#+end_quote

Yeah, and Erlis really respects janissaries, so he doesn't mind. I imagine he's also slowly getting a network of "bleeding hearts" together, and hoping that in a few centuries they'll be able to "come out of the closet" and treating humans with respect will be the norm.

Of course, he gets really lucky that William, who isn't /too/ weak himself, has interests in Erlis's duchy for personal reasons so William can be brought into the fold, and Erlis manages to do so - or at least get the thin end of the wedge in. William influences others to be more humane (not as extreme as he or Erlis is though) and in the early 2010s he gets a mage to work for him. The allegiance with the mage and William /probably/ taking credit for Cassius's death will be enough to get Ursula over the line and then vampires come out of the coffin c.2030 and William would use his influence in both vampire and human worlds to ensure that human laws interact with vampire society in a way that privileges /him/ (naturally).

Then c.2600 he and Red are rival starship captains and we have VAMPIRES IN SPACE offbrand sequel!

  Perhaps they address letters by smell, with delicate scents and perfumes that not one human nose in a thousand can tell apart... and then have the full title written on the top of the paper inside, in scripts unknown to modern archaeology.

Now I'm imagining the parfumerie that each vampire would have to have at her disposal in order to acheive such a thing...

  So, even if she did know exactly what they were doing, why would she bother to start a rumour?
#+end_quote

Now I'm imagining them openly meeting in her courtyard, with her servants waiting on them, as she stands in the doorway and tries to understand a snippet of Chinese c. 800 CE...
