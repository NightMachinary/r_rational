  perhaps a local shopkeeper, whose son actually did die in the war, gives Red occasional little items for free because he had spent so long 'fighting the good fight'

Ahhh shit, I have the perfect character to put that onto too!

I'm glad you like the POW idea: it does seem to work the best. I'm not sure how quickly after the surrender that POWs actually ended up home, though. Red leaves Corsica basically one week after the official surrender.... okay I just looked it up, it seems like POWs were making their way home within 6 months, so Red getting there soon after is not going to be too unbelievable. It does seem as though some POWs were able to send letters home and whatnot, but I'm sure that not all of them got the opportunity.

I think the most believable cover story, for the timeline and everything, is that Red escaped his POW camp, bummed around Europe for a while, and then returned to America once the war was over and he was safe from the Germans. It looks like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prisoner-of-war_escapes][escapes from POW camps]] were rare but not unheard of, and there were even some mass escapes.

I wonder whether, if Red was like, "look, I escaped about six months ago, but I don't want to talk about how I did it or where I was.", whether townspeople would pressure him to, you know, announce it and get a purple heart or whatever or whether they'd be understanding of his request for privacy?

It's probably much of a muchness: I'm not doing any deep conversations with Red and townspeople about his time in the "POW camp", so the details can be left vague as Red probably left them. I'm guessing, realistically speaking, people who eagerly asked Red for details of what the POW camp was like, when met with grunts and "I don't want to talk about it - battle fatigue(1940s!PTSD)", wouldn't go any further and there might be rumours about him escaping "because he got back a lot earlier than Jim Johnson, who was in one of the nazi camps, don't you know"/"and I got a look at his identification card and it had some French name on it, I think he escaped/is trying to hide from the nazis"/"he says he learned French from other prisoners, but I think he was hiding in Belgium for a while. Who can blame him: little Reginald was always so jumpy, he probably had no idea how to contact the Americans"; but non substantiated.

  [if he just disguised himself as a French immigrant] he would need to rent a spare room from his sister - but people are going to be suspicious.

Yeah... of a French guy who looks like a blonde version of her brother moving in to her house even though she never had a room up for rent and anyway her husband has a good job as a clerk do they really need a boarder??

Anyway... here's my first pass at the Julias-POV interlude. It doesn't sit quite right with me, I'm not sure about the structure, and I'll need to have someone read it along with the stuff around it to work out how it flows "artistically", but hey... here we are, as promised!

I originally had their names instead of 'master' and 'romantic object' but I love how impersonal it is like this; but maybe that'd be hard for readers to understand?
