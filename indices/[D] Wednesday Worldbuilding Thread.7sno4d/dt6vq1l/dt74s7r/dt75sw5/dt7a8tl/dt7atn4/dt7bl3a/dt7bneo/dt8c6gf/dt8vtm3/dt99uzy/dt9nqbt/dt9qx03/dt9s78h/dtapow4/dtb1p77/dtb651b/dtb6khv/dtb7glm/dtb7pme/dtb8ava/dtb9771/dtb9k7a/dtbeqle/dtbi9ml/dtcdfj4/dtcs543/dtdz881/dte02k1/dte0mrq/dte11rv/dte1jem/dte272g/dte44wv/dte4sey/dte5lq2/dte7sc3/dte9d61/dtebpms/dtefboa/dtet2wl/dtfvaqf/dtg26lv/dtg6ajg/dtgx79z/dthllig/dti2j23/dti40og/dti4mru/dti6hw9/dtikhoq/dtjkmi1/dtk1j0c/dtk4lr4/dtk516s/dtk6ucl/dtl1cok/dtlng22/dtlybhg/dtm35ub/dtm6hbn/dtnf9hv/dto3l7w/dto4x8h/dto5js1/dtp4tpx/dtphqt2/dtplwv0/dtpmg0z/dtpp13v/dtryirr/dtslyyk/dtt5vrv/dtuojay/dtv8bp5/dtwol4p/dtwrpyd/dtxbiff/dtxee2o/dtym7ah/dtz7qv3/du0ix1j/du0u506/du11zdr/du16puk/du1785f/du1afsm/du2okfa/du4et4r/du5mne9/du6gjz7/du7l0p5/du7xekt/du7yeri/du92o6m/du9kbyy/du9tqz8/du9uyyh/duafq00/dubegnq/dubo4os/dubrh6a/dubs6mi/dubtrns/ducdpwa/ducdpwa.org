  /grumble grumble/ I don't know it just doesn't feel right TO ME

[[/twishrug][]] Fair enough, I guess...

  (For the record: potato scallop/hash brown; bathers; drinking fountain; sausage sizzle; blood nose; canteen; pants when I speak normally but aunts if I'm speaking formally; deli; icy pole; most of them though pashing was popular when I was in high school c. 2004 and hook up a few years later; haha; awesome)
#+end_quote

Hmmm.

For me: Why would you want to batter the potatoes when you can make slap chips from them instead?, Cossie, Tap, Boerewors roll, Nosebleed, Tuck shop, Aunts, Cafe (or corner cafe), lollipop or sucker, kiss ('hook up' is for dating), Bwahaha (with or without laughing Pinkie ponymote), I personally like to be a bit more specific but 'cool' is popular here.

You have some strange language. Where does that 'by jingo' come from?

#+begin_quote
  Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if the more bizarre ones make sense in certain places... it's amazing what language is common
#+end_quote

Yeah, I can imagine that the most bizarre ones make sense somewhere - their test phrases (if there are any) probably look pretty innocuous.

#+begin_quote
  Probably Afrikaans did worse then because I find American articles smoothly readable with no effort; a missing -u every now and again doesn't alter anything for me.
#+end_quote

One of the most visible things Afrikaans did was replace ij with y in a lot of words. Maybe it's just because I'm not used to it, but all those ij's when I was expecting y's really threw me off.

  #+begin_quote
    Ek het my geld na die dief gegee
  #+end_quote

  So I get... I, give, my, money, to, the, "dief gegee" - I guess that's a compound word meaning robber?
#+end_quote

Er... no.

- Ek: I
- het: did
- my: my (the spelling is the same but not the pronounciation)
- geld: money
- na: to
- die: the
- dief: thief
- gegee: give (past tense)

Bear in mind, word order in Afrikaans is almost always different.

[Excerpt]

Dramatic improvement. In the header, I know when and where we are, and in the first paragraph, the shadow of War already hangs over the scene.

Then we have our main character being introduced, and we know he's a vampire and returning to polite society after a period of seclusion. There's hints that there are entire social structures to support vampires (the hotel's special rooms, and no-feeding-on-guests rule).

It's an introduction, so a small amount of telling is not completely out of place in order to set the scene; however, now that the scene is set, I expect that there will be a lot more showing in future scenes.

All in all, yes, dramatic improvement. Well done!
