  The one with the greatest interest in them all going well is likely their Youngest Common Ancestor - that is, the vampire whose nanites first developed an immunity (however that was done). One has to wonder whether or not he survived the anger of his children.

I imagine this vampire living some 20,000 BCE, and being long-dead. The living vampires know they come from, say, half a dozen bloodlines because they can't trace everything back quite that far.

The problem is - when I use the average vampire growth rate I calculated for 800 vamps in 1700 to become 20,000 vamps in 1900, one vampire takes only 415 years to become 800 vampires. So there's no way that a single bloodline could leave only 800 vampires alive, unless the growth rate was much lower in antiquity (it probably was: doing some quick maffs, the vampire population/human population goes from 1.2e-6 in 1700 to 1.2e-5 in 1900 to 1.6e-5 in 2000 - this sort of growth in % is unsustainable).

So... let me estimate the vampire population in 600, when William was turned (using 2e-5 as the ratio): about 4,000 vampires. 1 AD has 3,400 vampires. Same ratios give 1700 pre-Catastrophe numbers at 12,000; this means that, with 800 survivors, we're looking at about 95% of vampires being killed. It seems like a Big Scary Catastrophe, but with a high /enough/ proportion of survivors that most vampires are going to have a couple of friends living (if 95% of your friends died, you'd probably have one or (if very lucky) two good friends left and maybe 2-3 people you liked well enough to become good friends with when all other options are dead). So that actually works out quite well.

Great, now I'm sanity checking my growth rate for vampires: the vampire growth rate is equivalent to the massive growth rate of the world population in the 1940s-present day, which basically makes the /average/ vampire make two children a century. Plugging in the pre-industrial human growth rate makes there be only 4,000 vampires in the present day, so the 800 survivors would be a huge demographic chunk (by comparison the "baby boom" growth rate gives 20,000 vampires in 1900 and 100,000 in 2000, which makes the Old Ones a lot more special!).

So ANYWAY, back to what I was trying to do originally: the 800 vampires are 5% of the vampires living in 1700. So that requires 20 vampires-that-left-descendents to be alive whenever Nanite Eve was alive, on average. The thought of Eve being one of 20 "successful progenitors" say 10,000 BCE is not a huge reach in terms of their prominence. I think norms around vampire reproduction probably changed after the Catastrophe too - I have one character with the title "Progenitor of the Wang line" because I imagine that some vampires would have created "lines" of children afterwards in an attempt to rally the troops, so to speak.

So yeah... you probably don't need much of a war for all these numbers to work out, is what I'm concluding!
