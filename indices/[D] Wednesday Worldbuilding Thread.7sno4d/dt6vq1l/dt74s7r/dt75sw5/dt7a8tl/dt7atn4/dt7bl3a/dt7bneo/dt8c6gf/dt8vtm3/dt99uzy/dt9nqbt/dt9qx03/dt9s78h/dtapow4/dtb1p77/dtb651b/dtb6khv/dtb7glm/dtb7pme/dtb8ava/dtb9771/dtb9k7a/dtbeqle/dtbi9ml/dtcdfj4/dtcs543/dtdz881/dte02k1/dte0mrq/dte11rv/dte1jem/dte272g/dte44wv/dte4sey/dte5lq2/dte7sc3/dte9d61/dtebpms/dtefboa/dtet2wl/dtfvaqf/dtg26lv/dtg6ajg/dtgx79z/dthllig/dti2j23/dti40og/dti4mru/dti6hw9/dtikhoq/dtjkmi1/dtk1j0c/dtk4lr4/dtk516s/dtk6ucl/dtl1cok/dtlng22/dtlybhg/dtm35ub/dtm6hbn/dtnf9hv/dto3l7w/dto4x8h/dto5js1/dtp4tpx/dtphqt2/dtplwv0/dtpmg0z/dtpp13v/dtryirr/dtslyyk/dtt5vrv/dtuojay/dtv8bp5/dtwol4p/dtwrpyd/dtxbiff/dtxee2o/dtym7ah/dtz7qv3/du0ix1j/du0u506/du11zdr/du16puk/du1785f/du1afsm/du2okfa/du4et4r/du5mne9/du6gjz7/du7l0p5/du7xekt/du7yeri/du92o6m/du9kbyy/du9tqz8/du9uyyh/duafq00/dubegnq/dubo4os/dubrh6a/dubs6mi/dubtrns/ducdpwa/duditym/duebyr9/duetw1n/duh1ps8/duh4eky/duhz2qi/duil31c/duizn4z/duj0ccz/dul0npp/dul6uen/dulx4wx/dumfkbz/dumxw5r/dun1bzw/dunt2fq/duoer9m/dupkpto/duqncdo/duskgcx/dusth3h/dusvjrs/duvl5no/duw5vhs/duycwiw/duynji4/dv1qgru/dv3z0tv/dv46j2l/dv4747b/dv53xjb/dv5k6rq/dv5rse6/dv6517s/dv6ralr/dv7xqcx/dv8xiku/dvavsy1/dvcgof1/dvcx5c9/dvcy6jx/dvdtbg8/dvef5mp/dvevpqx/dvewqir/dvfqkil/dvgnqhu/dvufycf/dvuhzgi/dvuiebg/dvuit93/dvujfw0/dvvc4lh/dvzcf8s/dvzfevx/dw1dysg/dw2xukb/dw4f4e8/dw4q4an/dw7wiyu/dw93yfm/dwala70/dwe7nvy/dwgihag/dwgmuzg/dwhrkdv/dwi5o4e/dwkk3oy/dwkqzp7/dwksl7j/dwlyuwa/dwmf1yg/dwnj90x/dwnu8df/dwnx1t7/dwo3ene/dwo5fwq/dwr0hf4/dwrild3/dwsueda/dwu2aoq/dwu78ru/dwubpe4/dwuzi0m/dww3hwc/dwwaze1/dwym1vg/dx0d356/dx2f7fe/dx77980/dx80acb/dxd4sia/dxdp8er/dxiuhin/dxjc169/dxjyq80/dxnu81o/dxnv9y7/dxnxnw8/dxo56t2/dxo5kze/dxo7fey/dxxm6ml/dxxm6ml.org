  the bullet outruns its own shockwave

Oh FFS, that's not fair. That shouldn't even be allowed.

So, I guess they've got strong bones, great reflexes, and are always at least a little bit on guard for a bullet. Surround them with hollow points and you might just be able to bag yourself a vampire, but ever since hollow points were invented vampires have avoided putting themselves in situations like that.

So, I think the bullet thing is covered as much as it's ever going to be, which means - new excerpt / brainstorming time if you're still keen to indulge me on these things!

An upcoming interlude has William confessing his sins to a priest - of course, he doesn't believe the priest is anything more than a heretic, since the One True Faith has been bastardised so heavily over the 1500 years since he practised it, but it's better than nothing / it's a ritual he enjoys participating in.

I've got William telling the priest he feels bad for seducing an employee, but what he /actually/ feels bad about / wants to get off his chest is that he /likes/ Red too much, he was expecting to just seduce him to do something popular, cost of doing business, etc, but he's finding himself charmed by Red's personality/etc. I just reworked it now, trying to work out if it's phrased right or needs to be rephrased or something. Because it's an interlude I'm trying to be ~artistic~ and having it dialogue-only, which I think works fine, but explains why there's no senses ;).

“Bless me father, for I have sinned. It has been eight years since my last confession.”

“I am glad that you have come back to the Lord after such a long time.”

“I accuse myself of a great many sins. But there is one sin in particular that is on my conscience, and led me to return after so long. I have become interested in one of my employees to an inappropriate degree, more than is proper of a gentleman.”

“Many of us are guilty of the sin of envy, my son.”

“I fear my... envy... will cause a scandal. It could ruin me.”

“Think not what effect your sins will have on you in this world, but in the kingdom of heaven.”

“My soul may be unsalvageable at this point.”

“Nobody who seeks penance is beyond heaven, least of all for the sin of envy. Have you acted on this desire?”

“Yes.”

“And were your affections returned?”

“Yes, though I worry that my infatuation is excessive, even given the circumstances.”

“It sounds as though you are behaving appropriately. As envy is the enemy of charity, remember to give alms to the poor, especially in these troubling times. Pray for guidance, make an effort to attend service and confession more often, and above all, continue live in chastity until you have been joined in the sacrament of marriage.”

“I will.”

“Now, say the act of contrition, if you know it.”

“O God, my God, I repent of all my sins with all my heart. I am heartily sorry not because of Thy just punishments, but above all because they offend Thee. I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace, to confess my sins, to do penance and to amend. Amen.”

“Our Lord Jesus Christ absolve you; and I, by His authority I absolve you from every incurred excommunication and interdict, so as much as I can, and your needs require. I absolve you from your sins in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.”

“Amen.”

“You remember the act of contrition well, after so many years.”

“I appreciate the opportunity to confess the sin for which I am so ashamed. Though there was one thing I forgot to mention.”

“Please tell it.”

“I confessed my secrets to a heretical priest, and I plan to kill him very, very shortly. Do you suppose the Lord would forgive me that, too?”
