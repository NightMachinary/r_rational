  (And the real top secret stuff, you speak on the phone - NEW EXCERPT TIME!)

On the phone? But such new technology hasn't had the time to be considered formal yet, and besides, phones can be tapped. No. face to face for the /real/ top secret stuff is the only way to go.

  ... now i'm imagining a human slave understanding, say, Hungarian but their vampire master having no idea and then hijinks ensue. Probably you'd ask a human what languages they speak and test them periodically.

[[/batshy][]] Oh, please. These mortals never last more than a century at most. Seriously, blink and you miss them. Who's got time to interrogate all your servants every century just to find out what they /don't/ speak?

It's /so/ much easier just to kill them if they find out too much.

Red seems to have a healthy sense of self-preservation. That's good.

I think let Red's assumption go here. Maybe adjust the phrasing slightly - "in what sounded like Italian" instead of "in Italian" - to reflect that Red doesn't actually understand it; but this is all done from Red's point of view, so Red's impression counts for a lot.
