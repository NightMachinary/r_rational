  or else Cassius will join Elodia's side in the war (mainly to improve relations with Elodia via the use of a common enemy).
#+end_quote

This may have happened: I don't explicitly state it but William wants to fight Elodia with a sword fight and Elodia wants to do competitive poetry writing or something. Cassius could well have been used as an intermediary to pick a "fair" battle: and of course he picks something William might lose at. Elodia is a lot less important than William though, but William lives far away and Elodia lives very close by.

  William sounds like he's been working on repairing the split between [him and Cassius]
#+end_quote

I think until Cassius finds out that Junior I was killed by William, he has no reason not to like William beyond trying to get on Elodia's good side: I imagine vampire attitudes / alleigances have a fair amount of "frenemies" time in them. I can be friends with two people who can't stand one another (..... okay, my friends can be friends with me and my ex who I can't stand, but can we tell the story that makes /me/ sound like a good person?), so I'm sure Cassius can, too.

  Yeah, at this point I think Cassius' options are either 'die' or 'come back in the sequel, swearing revenge'.
#+end_quote

I think "come back in the sequel" would really be "come back the next day where William sleeps and kill him in a rage", unfortunately. :( So Cassius, you must die even though you are a villain who seems to do everything right except fail to anticipate androids are a thing.

  At some point during their battle, though, Cassius probably needs to successfully stake her through the heart - and then get quite upset when that doesn't work as expected.
#+end_quote

The original battle as sketched has Cassius /tearing her head off/ and then having no idea what to do afterwards because vampire hand-to-hand combat training ends at the "tear head off" stage because that's all you need to do to kill a vampire. I'm picturing it like pure wrestlers in MMA who can get people to the ground but don't have much skill once they're down there, because wrestling doesn't use submissions like BJJ does. A stake might be a great option, though, to add to it.
