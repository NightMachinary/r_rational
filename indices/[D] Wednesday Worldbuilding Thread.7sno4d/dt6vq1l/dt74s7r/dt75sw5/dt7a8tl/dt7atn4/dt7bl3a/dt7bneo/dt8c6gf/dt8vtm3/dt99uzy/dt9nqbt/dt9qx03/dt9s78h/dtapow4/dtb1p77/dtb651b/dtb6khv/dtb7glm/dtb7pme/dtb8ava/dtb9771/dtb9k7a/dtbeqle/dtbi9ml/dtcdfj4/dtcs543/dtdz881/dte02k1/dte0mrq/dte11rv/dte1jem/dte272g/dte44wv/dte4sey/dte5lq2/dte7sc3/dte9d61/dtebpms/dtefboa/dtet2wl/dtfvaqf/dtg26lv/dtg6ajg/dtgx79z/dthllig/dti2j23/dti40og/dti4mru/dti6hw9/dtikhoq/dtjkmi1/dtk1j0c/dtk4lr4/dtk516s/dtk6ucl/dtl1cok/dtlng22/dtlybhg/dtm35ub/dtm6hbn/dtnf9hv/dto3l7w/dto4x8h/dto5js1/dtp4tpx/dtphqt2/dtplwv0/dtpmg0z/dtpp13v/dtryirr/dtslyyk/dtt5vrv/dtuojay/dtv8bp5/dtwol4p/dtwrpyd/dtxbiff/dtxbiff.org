That sounds fantastic! I have emailed the co-czar so it should be announced for next month. Except I haven't done the blurb part. I should get on that.

Kind of irrelevant aside: I've decided all my vampires have self-appointed "formal" titles, and I have got a draft one for Cassius. I thought you might enjoy adding some accolades to it? I have him as the King of Rome in "basic" title, but his full title should be more fancy.

I'm not sure if we've discussed titles but here's the ones I have for other characters in the story. I partially take the title a character chooses to be indicative of their personality, though I'm sure some monikers are assigned to them.

Duchess Elodia of Genoa = Doge Elodia De Ferrari, the reclaimer of Corsica, the scourge of the three rivers, the destroyer of Norina, she who binds her enemies

King William of New Holland = King William, most high and most excellent King by the grace of God, conqueror of New Holland, uniter of the five lands, soother of warring clans

Queen Ursula of (Atlanta?) = Divine Queen Ursula, defender of the homeland, vanguard of the new world, known for her tactical expertise, praised by Chan Xiao Tsu, disciple of the three temples, she who succeeds, merciful to the worthy, the butcher of Ollaiyur, protector of the small, a blight on the foolish, loved by all who she visits, progenitor of the Wang line

Duke Erlis of Columbus = The Honorable Erlis, Governor of Columbus

King Cassius if Rome = God-king Cassius of the Eternal City, respected advisor of Magnus, long-awaited child of Tibillus, he who listens with a patient ear, the pranker of the third council, the one with the iron toe, keeper of the text

Feel free to expand Cassius' title as you see fit. I want to keep the line about him being a prankster in there because I think it's hilarious though.

In case it matters, the relative ranks of the vampires concerned are:

Ursula >> Cassius > William [giant void] Elodia > Erlis
