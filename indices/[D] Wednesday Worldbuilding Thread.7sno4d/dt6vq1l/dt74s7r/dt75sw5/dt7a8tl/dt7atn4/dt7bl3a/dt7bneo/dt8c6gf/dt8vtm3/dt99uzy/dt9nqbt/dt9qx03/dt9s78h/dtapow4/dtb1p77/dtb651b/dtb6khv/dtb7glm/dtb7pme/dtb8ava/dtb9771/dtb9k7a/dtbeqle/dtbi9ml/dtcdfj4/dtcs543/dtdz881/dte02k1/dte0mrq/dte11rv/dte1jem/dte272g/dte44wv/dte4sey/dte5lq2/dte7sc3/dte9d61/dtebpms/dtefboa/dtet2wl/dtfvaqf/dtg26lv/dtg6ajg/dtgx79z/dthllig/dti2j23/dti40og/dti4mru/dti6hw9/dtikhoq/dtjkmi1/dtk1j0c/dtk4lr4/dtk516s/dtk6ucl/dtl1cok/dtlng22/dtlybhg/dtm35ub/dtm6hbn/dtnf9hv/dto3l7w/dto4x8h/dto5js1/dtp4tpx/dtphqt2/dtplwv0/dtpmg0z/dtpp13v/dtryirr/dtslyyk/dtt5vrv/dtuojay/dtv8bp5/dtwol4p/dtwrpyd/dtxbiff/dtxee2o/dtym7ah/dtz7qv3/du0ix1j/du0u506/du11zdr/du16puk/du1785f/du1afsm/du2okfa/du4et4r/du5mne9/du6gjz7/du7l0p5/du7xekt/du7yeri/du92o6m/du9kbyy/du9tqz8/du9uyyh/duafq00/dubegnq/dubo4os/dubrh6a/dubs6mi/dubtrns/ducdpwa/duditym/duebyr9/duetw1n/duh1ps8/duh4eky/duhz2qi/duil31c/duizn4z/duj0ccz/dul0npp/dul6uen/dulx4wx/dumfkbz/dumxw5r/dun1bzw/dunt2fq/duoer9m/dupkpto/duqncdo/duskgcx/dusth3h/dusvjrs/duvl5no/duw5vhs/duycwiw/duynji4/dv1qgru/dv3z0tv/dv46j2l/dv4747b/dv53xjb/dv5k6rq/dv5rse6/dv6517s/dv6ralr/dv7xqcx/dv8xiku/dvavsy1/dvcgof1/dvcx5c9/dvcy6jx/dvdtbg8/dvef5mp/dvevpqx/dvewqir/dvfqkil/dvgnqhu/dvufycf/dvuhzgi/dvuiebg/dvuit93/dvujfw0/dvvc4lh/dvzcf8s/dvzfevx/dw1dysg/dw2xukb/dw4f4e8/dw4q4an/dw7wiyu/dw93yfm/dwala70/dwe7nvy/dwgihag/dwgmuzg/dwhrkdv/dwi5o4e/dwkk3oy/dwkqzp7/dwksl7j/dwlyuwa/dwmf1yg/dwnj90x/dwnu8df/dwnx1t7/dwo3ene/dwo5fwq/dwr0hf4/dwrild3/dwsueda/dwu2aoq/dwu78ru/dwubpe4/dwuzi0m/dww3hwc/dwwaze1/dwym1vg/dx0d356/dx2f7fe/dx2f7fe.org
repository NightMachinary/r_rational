  Now, it would make sense that the casualties were heavier - possibly even eventually 100% - where the colonists landed.
#+end_quote

That did happen in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Tasmanians][Tasmania]] - the last full-blooded Tasmanian died in 1905. Very sad.

Makes me wonder what the vampire in the area did, felt, etc. There was a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_War][war]] that happened at about the right time - maybe the local vampire/s happened to be caught in the crossfire (dying in a fire or similar?). Or the vampire/s just didn't care enough to intervene, like probably most mainland vampires didn't.

#+begin_quote
  And if that tribe of 100 gets hit by something that kills 90% of them, then the vampire is in trouble.
#+end_quote

Oh yeah - I have 1:300,000 in cities / 1:100,000 in the country as my "canonical" vampire carrying capacity. So that gives a vampire, what, four orders of magnitude safety margin? A 90% reduction in population brings forth a few lean decades, but isn't going to make you fear for your life.

#+begin_quote
  So, navigating becomes important - or, failing, that, very carefully picking your choice of rock.
#+end_quote

So there's probably a vampire scientist who sells appropriately-calibrated rocks to other vampires. Love it. (Or... you know, just whatever it is scuba divers use, I think they have some sort of device that helps).

#+begin_quote
  Here's another question - previously, we'd established that vampires can regrow limbs be absorbing the requisite carbon/oxygen/hydrogen/nitrogen from the surrounding air. Does this still work at all underwater?
#+end_quote

If they can absorb these elements from the surrounding air, then it stands to reason they can absorb them from gases dissolved in the water, or potentially from the water itself - since it requires some chemistry to happen in the vampire's skin or whathaveyou. So they probably can, with the old "not committing to it one way or the other in case needed for plot" caveat.

#+begin_quote
  Ah - that makes sense. William turns Red because he thinks that Red is worthy to be turned - but this is /different/ from thinking that Red is worthy to manage William's estates.
#+end_quote

Well, yeah, and William thinks nobody is worthy to manage his estates. Vampires view wills as... pessimistic, I guess you could say. They don't intend to die any time soon, so why bother coming up with a succession plan? If you name a successor it only encourages them to kill you, after all.

So the concept of "scion" is probably completely divorced from something a vampire would ever need - they don't need successors as they don't envision anyone ever succeeding them. I'm coming back around to it... but I wonder if I should stick with the more universal "progeny" as I hate making up a word for no reason.

#+begin_quote
  ...I think you handled that fairly well in the excerpt, though testing it on someone who doesn't know what the term means is a good idea.
#+end_quote

Testing has been done...

Test 1: (definition of janissary:) A person a vampire keeps that they can feed from? / (did it feel clear?) it seemed clear to me when I read it

Test 2: I wasn't lost, I felt like I got the gist of it in context (hopefully). I got the sense it meant a kind of servant, or more likely slave, kept by vampires to feed off. I was a bit confused mostly because janissaries are a gun-wielding Turkish unit from Age of Empires 2, but from googling it I can see why other definitions of the word make it fit.

So, looks like it's gone as well as can be expected for a term that has extra connotations that were not addressed in the passage. So that and your comments make me relieved. Phew!

#+begin_quote
  No, the place for those nitty-gritty little details is when Red hears the term and asks William what it means - or perhaps he hears the term, guesses incorrectly what it means (it wouldn't be hard for him to end up thinking 'concubine') and confronts William.
#+end_quote

tee-hee. oh, i wonder when Red would hear the word janissary for the first time... I think it's a good deal later.

[[/readingismagic][]]

[[/sp][]]

*examines document* yeah, it's when Red is talking to Lucia, and that's like, a year later, after which William has probably explained to Red what a janissary is. They do go over the definition again but don't actually hit the extra little connotations, so I might rework the scene a little bit (excerpt time!~)

#+begin_quote
  Your potential replacement opening paragraph, on the other hand, /is/ too heavy-handed
#+end_quote

Thanks for reassuring me. It was an example of "the narrator talking down to the reader" that I dislike.

#+begin_quote
  I'm going to assume that you're properly engaging the rest of the senses elsewhere in the chapter
#+end_quote

Thanks to your... constant badgering [[/bflutterwink-in][]]... I'm getting better at adding senses. They're not automatic but I am finding it easier to identify locations and to think of passable things. Of course, you've made me realise the upcoming Big Kissy Scene has very little senses in it so now I'm regretting everything about my life.

EXCERPT

--------------

“Could we have a cup of tea somewhere whilst his majesty and her grace meet? I'm not quite tired yet.”

“Of course. Is the kitchen okay?” Red asked, leading her downstairs. “I'm still... learning some of these things. I don't want to be rude.”

She nodded. “That sounds fine.”

When they reached the kitchen, Red automatically went for the jar of coffee before remembering that William had advised him to follow her lead. “I only have black tea, is that alright?” He asked, fetching the sugar and going to open the refrigerator. “And, well, sweet tea, but William said that no one drinks that outside of the United States, but you can try it if you like.” He said, recalling the look of ever so slight disapproval when he had suggested to William that he ought to provide a pitcher of sweet tea as well.

“A local specialty? I would love to try some.”

“Well, not local here. It's a big thing back home, though.” Red smiled, put the sugar away, and poured two tall glasses of sweet tea.

“So, I take it you're new to all of this?” Lucia asked, smiling as she sipped on her tea.

“Apparently, yes.” He said, pausing to take a sip of his own beverage; it was so sweet it hurt his teeth. Just the way he liked it. “And you? I assume you're not.”

“I suppose not.” She laughed. “I've been working with her grace for nearly a century, now.”

Red coughed on his tea, the sugary liquid burning into his nose. “A century?”

“How new are you?” Lucia gave him a suspicious look; could the rumours be true? Was this man only as old as William's tenure on Corsica?

“I've been with him...” He thought for a moment, but quickly realised she was not interested in a precise date. “Ten months?”

“Wow.”

“You would have been new, too, what, ninety nine years ago” He offered, with a small, forced smile. “Wow. A century.” He repeated, still not quite believing it. “How old are you then, and how are you....” He paused. “Sorry. That was rude. My mom raised me not to ask a lady her age. Sorry.”

“Has King William really given you nothing?”

“No, he gives me things. He got me this suit last week. Spent a lot of time on it, too.” He said fondly, absentmindedly rubbing at the lapel with his thumb. He knew he was missing some important detail, but was desperately trying not to make it obvious. He thought of William and how badly he didn't want to embarrass him. It seemed more impossible by the second.

She gave him another chuckle. “My, it has been a long time since I've spoken with an ordinary person. You're just a janissary, aren't you?”

“What's a janissary again? Wait, are they, the, um...” He snapped his fingers, trying to remember the word. “They're the ones that they... drink from regularly, right?”

“Yes. But you work much more closely with King William than I would have expected for a janissary. He must trust you a lot more than anyone in their right mind should, or he's too selfish to give you anything more than this.”

Red frowned, a bit taken aback by the accusations. “He's not... what do you mean, give me more? He looks out for me plenty as it is, I wouldn't ask any more of him.”

“I suppose he has time; you're still rather young. Maybe he'll be ready to promote you in a year or two. Then you can experience the many joys of co-ordinating janissaries, shopping for rare books, and the daily chore of waiting for sunset.” She said, grinning despite herself.

“What do you mean, promote?” Red asked, furrowing his brow. “I hadn't really thought... It's all been pretty hand to mouth since we left Rome.”

“It's not really my place to...” She said obliquely, still grinning; she clearly had decided to tell him anyway. “One day, he will ask you to drink some of his blood.”

Red wrinkled his nose. “Oh.”

“That's the promotion. You see, he feeds from you, right?”

“Yes, but... he's a vampire. It makes sense for him to drink blood, but I don't...ugh.” He took another sip of tea, trying to imagine what his blood must taste like. He wished he hadn't.

She shook her head. “No, that's not what I meant. You know how after he feeds, everything's... clearer? You don't really need to sleep?”

“Well. Yes?”

“If you get that just from him biting you, imagine what you'd get from drinking his blood...”

“I hadn't really thought...” Red murmured.

“That's the real magic. It's what's kept me alive all these years. I'm surprised a king who is as old as her grace says his majesty is does not have two or three thralls.”

“Thralls?”

She laughed. “Blood-fed-people. We have a lot of names. Serfs. Vassals. Ghouls. The more modern ones call us thralls, and I prefer it. Sounds more civilised.”

“But what do they do with them?” Red asked, not trying to hide how confused he was anymore. “What's its use? I mean, from their end?”

“They benefit very well from doing this to us.” She paused. “We can serve them better. I saw how difficult it was for you to lift that basket.”

“I guess so.” He said, finally, still not understanding. “Are you happy? With her, I mean?”

“Of course. She asks very little in return for what she gives me.”
