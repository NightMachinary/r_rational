  I should say that context means a lot here: William is temporarily in town, Cassius owns a hotel William is staying at, Cassius had Red (the love interest) hired because of his random "communicates in vampire language" quirk, and Cassius probably knows that William would see a lot of Red due to the timing of Red's shifts.
#+end_quote

Hmmm. It would make a lot of sense, in that situation, for a question about the local prey/servants to be easily asked in vampire gesture/language. But perhaps it would flow better as a query about local servants without specifically requesting Americans - which seems a high-bit word to me, as it can take nothing from context.

  (Truthfully, Cassius probably hired Red and put him at work as the night porter because some vampire guest would be interested in him sometime and would then owe him a favour for poaching his territory: so this situation worked out well for him)

Now, that is an excellent devious-vampire move - setting up a situation where someone owes him a favour, at little or no cost to himself.

  Really, this is communicated by the "he laughed again" part, before he even picks up the towel.
#+end_quote

...valid point. But it may need a smidge of a tweak to the phrasing.

Still, there seems to be very little difference between Vampire Gesture Language and the various variants on sign language (which can be done by mere finger-wriggling). I'm not sure how intentional that is.

  William folded a striped towel. Do you have information about nearby Americans? Asked the angles of the creases and the minor movements of his fingertips.
#+end_quote

That's a good deal better, yes. 'Minor movements of his fingertips' include an entire potential lexicon of sign language. He could be requesting information with the towel and the creases, and signing 'American' with his fingertips - and now the channel has enough bits to easily accomodate the message.
