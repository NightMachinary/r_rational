[[/twistare][]] Where's the other, non-sight senses? Where's the touch and texture of the world? Where's the nip of cold in the wind, the smell of smoke in the air, the sound of dried leaves crunching underfoot (or boots against cobblestones, whatever)? Where's the snap and crackle that makes the world /live/?

...and on a completely separate issue, why has William not arranged for his thralls to visit him on a strict schedule, so he doesn't have to go out into the cold? It's convenient (like having pizza delivered) and it's not like they wouldn't do it...
