    I mean, don't get me wrong, he's not going to /continue growing/ while Red's gone, and he might take some steps back, but he's not like the trope of someone becoming vegetarian because their partner's vegetarian and after a big breakup they go to McDonald's and get a double cheeseburger to stick to them.
  #+end_quote

  Ah - I think there may have been a slight misunderstanding here.

  I meant it as in during the first few chapters, /before/ William has had his character growth, when Red steps temporarily out of the scene (to go get some beer or buy a trunk or whatever), /then/ William should show some signs of not caring for the lives of other humans
#+end_quote

I've done this, I think I might have even shown you the excerpt I'm thinking of in particular. Here's the start of it (... an excerpt of an excerpt? what a delightful extravagance!)

--------------

Having had its fill, the vampire tossed the middle-aged woman to the side. She stumbled, falling to the garden path without a noise. She lay there, with the calm of someone who had been through this hundreds of times.

“Don't stop for politeness' sake. I am sure that one has at least a pint of blood left in her.” Cassius quipped, sitting at a table. He gave gestured orders at the servants digging up flowers in the garden.

“It has been a long time since I've killed someone else's janissary, your majesty.” William muttered, the inch-long fangs shrinking back into his dentition. He watched as the woman staggered to her feet, gave a small bow, and walked away.

--------------

Like I said, pretty sure I showed you this scene last month - William and Cassius discuss how William is liking Red, Cassius asks for a duchy in exchange, William relents. If I didn't and you want to read it I can whip out the whole thing - though if is, of course, rather senseless. *bad-um tush*

  Fair enough - that's not the story you want to write. But you can't blame [wanting a non-evil Love Interest] on your genre; it's a matter of personal preference.
#+end_quote

The /genre/ sucks in many ways, just like the genre of sci-fi sucks because everything goes FTL and the genre of fantasy sucks because people don't use their magic to the fullest potential. Unloveable Love Interests are a regrettable aspect of the pulp romance novel and easily avoidable by not, you know, having a protagonist commit senseless murder.

#+begin_quote

  - William and another vampire notice an ordinary human in mortal peril of some or other sort - not certain death, but something he could perhaps escape. Either of them could easily save him. Instead of doing so, they idly take bets on whether or not he will survive.
#+end_quote

I like this. I'm going to have to think of a way to shoe-horn it in. There's a later scene where William and Cassius negotiate before the war starts, I could see Cassius offering a wager and William refusing, and then being relieved when the human in peril survives.

#+begin_quote

  - William visits another vampire, who has a bad habit of keeping grisly souvenirs of his various kills - William walks right past dozens of jars of preserved heads without batting an eye (if asked about this, perhaps by a horrified Red, he only comments on the tastelessness of the display)
#+end_quote

Damnit, this won't be able to happen for a while, long enough that William might have grown beyond that level of callousness. Still, a good idea.

#+begin_quote

  - William, driving a coach-and-horses, liberally uses his horsewhip on passing foot traffic if it looks like they're going to get in the way of his horses.
#+end_quote

1940's, so he's got a car and driver. Very... graphic image though.

#+begin_quote
  That sort of thing. Not deliberate murder necessarily, just - casual disdain for the lives of humans.
#+end_quote

I'll think about William's reactions with general humanity.

#+begin_quote
  Another option, of course, once the guy is on the roof, is to have him get up again and run for it, leaping rooftop to rooftop into the distance until he can get down someplace where William is not waiting around at ground level. Of course, this cannot be done quietly, so Red would hear him fleeing.
#+end_quote

I need to discuss with the coauthor exactly what any "William shows Red that he's Great and Powerful" scene would look like, and work out how we'd want it to end. That's a good option; another one I thought of was William leaping and placing the human on the roof, so he's clearly alright but is going to have a hell of a time getting down (... it would seem; of course, being a thrall, he can just jump back down when Red and William are off-screen).

  Of course, the real solution is for William to hire Red a private trainer - a good trainer will know how to minimize the chances of injury, and at least if he is training then Red is staying out of other trouble

You're a genius, you know that? I wonder what 1940s Corsica would have had in the way of... gyms.

Also, we're going to write a scene with Paola, to put her into chapter 2 so she doesn't appear suddenly in chapter 3, but I'm struggling with any way to make it interesting. So we've got two options: 1) try and think of a new and interesting tidbit to drop, or 2) make it short and efficient, or I guess 3), put Paola on the front desk sometimes even though she's the "hotel manager" (actually bodyguard).

At the moment the sketch I have for the scene is:

[William tells Red he will start working for him full time now and Red should resign from the hotel]

[Red enters Paola's office]

Red: Hi. I'm just going to let you know I'm quitting.

Paola: Why?

Red: William has asked me to work for him full time.

Paola: [knowing nod] Ah, yes, we saw he had taken a liking to you.

Red: I'm sorry, it meant a lot that you took a chance on hiring me with my Italian being so bad, but he gave me an offer I can't refuse.

Paola: That's fine. Believe it or not, it happens all the time. When do you want to start?

Red: Well, I told him I'd be there tomorrow night, but I can still see if I can work out a way to man the front desk in between, if you're short.

Paola: I can do the job if it comes to it. Congratulations, you should be proud of the new job.

Red: Thanks.

--------------

Trying to think of a way to put... like a vampire tidbit in there, or something. Paola was told by Cassius to hire Red, because Cassius noticed Red's talent (likely: one of Cassius's children noticed Red's talent and reported it to Cassius). Paola is a thrall who is "the muscle" during the day for the hotel. She's probably pretty damn old.
