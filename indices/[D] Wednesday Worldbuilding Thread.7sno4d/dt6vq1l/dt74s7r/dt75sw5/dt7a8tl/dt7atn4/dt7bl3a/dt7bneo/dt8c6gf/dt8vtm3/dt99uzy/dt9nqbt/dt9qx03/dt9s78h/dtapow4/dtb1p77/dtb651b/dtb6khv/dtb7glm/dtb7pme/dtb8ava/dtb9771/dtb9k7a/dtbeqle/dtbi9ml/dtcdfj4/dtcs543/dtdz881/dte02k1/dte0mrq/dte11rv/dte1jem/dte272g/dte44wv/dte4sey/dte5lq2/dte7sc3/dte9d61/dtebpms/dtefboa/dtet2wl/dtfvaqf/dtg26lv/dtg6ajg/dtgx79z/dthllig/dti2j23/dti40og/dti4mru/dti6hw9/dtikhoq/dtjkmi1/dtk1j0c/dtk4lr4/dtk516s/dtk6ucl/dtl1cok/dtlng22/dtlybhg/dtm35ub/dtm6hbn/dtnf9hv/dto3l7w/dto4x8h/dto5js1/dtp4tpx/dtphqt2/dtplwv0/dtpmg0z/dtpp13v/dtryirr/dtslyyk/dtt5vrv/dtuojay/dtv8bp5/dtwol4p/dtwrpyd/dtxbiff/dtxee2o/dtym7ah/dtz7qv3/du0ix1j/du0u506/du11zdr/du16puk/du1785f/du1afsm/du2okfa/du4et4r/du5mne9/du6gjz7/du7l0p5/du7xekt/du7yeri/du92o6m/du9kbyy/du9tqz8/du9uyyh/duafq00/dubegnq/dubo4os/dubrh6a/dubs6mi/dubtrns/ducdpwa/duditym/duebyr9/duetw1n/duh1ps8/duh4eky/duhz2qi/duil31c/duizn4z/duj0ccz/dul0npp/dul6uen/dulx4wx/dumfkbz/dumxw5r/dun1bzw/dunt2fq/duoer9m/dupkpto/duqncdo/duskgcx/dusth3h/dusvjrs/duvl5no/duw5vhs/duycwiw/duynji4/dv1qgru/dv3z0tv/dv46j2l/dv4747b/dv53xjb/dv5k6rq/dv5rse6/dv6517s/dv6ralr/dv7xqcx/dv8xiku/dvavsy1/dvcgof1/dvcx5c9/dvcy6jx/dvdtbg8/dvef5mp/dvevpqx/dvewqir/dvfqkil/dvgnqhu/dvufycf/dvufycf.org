Ack. Apologies for the long delay.

Your problems with #1 are insurmountable - the character would not trust Cassius' thrall(s) when he can just make his own. It doesn't make sense.

The problems with #3 also exist - what hotel would separate a vampire from their thrall? What vampire would stay in such a hotel?

#2, on the other hand, is different. The problems with #2 are merely a matter of presentation.

You say that P!2 "appears and then vanishes", seeming like a deus ex machina. Here's how I'd suggest approaching it:

- First, we have pre-thrall Paola appearing in a scene, and Red notices her. She doesn't have to do /much/, but she needs to show a strongly assertive personality - perhaps she's protesting something, trying to shame any young men who aren't at the Front with goose feathers? Something that has her holding a large sign or handcuffing herself to public monuments yelling that she will not be silenced. (Preferably something to do with the war, to help solidify the time setting).

- It's possible that there appears a scene in which Paolo first meets William. Perhaps she's been arrested for her protesting, and William "arranges" to have her bought from her cell and to him, where he will ensure that she "makes no more trouble" - which reinforces how much the vampires are in control, behind the scenes. Or perhaps she goes home through a dark alley at night, there's a sound of footsteps behind her, she turns to see a face and there's William. (This scene is optional, depending how much of Paola you want on-screen)

- Next time we see her, she's William's thrall. Her eyes are slightly unfocused, she's polite, servile, apologetic, and obeys William's every command without hesitation. Red notices her again, and recognises her - and is struck by the change in her demeanour. But he doesn't /ask/ about it, because William is his social superior, and you just don't /ask/ a social superior that sort of question. (He might ask Paola, and/or arrange to give her a way out - which she does not take). Red considers various explanations, and ends up coming to the wrong conclusion (this /must/ be someone who just /looks like/ the person he saw earlier, they act so differently, it's all just a coincidence...)

- Later, when it's time for Paola to be discarded, Red walks in on William feeding from her. Surprised, William continues feeding for too long, and drains her completely. (Whether William tells Red that he's just killed her, or pretends that "she just fainted", depends on their relations at that time. Either way, Red never sees her again, and never hears of her unexplained death, either). After all, William has a reputation for destroying thralls - it will help if we see him doing so on-stage at least once.

How does that sound?
