  if he's sending Junior II to William, that implies that his relations with William are better than his relations with Elodia at the time
#+end_quote

Not necessarily: maybe J2 has made enemies with someone other than Elodia; William is uniquely positioned to have a large swathe of territory that problem children can be exiled to, without it looking too much like being exiled ("Junior! I've found you a wonderful place you can stay! A whole town for you to rule, all to yourself! At your age, it's a rare feat! Now let's ignore the fact it's a remote part of Australia...")

Good point! I'll think about it.
