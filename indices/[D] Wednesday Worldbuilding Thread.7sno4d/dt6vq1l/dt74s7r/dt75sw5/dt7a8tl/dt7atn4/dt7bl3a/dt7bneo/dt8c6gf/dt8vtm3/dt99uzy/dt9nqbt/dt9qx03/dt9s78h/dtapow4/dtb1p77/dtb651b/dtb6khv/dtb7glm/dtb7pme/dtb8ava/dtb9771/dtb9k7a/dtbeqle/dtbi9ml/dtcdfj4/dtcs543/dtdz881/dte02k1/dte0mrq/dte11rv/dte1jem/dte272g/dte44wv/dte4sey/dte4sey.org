  The average human is an idiot.

And it's worth bearing in mind, when you consider the average human, that half of humanity is /less smart than that/.

(I think your high-speed texting friend is in that half. Wilful ignorance is one thing, but...).

  The part about the marigolds I am really reconsidering after what we discussed in the towel scene; probably too many bits are being transferred.
#+end_quote

I don't know - marigolds (or any other flower, really) meaning danger and 'not growing' meaning confusion seems well within the capabilities of a vampire flower language to me. (People like Yolande picking up a few of these meanings and using them to figure out the 'language of the flowers' might actually be the in-universe origin thereof).

Instead, I'm going to pick on that envelope. Do vampires have some sort of secret alphabet, or did Cassius just write his notes in plaintext, ready to be stumbled across by a servant at the wrong moment? Such a secret alphabet could even have turned up over time - Cassius could be writing in cuneiform or something which modern people would barely recognise but a fellow vampire would know well.
