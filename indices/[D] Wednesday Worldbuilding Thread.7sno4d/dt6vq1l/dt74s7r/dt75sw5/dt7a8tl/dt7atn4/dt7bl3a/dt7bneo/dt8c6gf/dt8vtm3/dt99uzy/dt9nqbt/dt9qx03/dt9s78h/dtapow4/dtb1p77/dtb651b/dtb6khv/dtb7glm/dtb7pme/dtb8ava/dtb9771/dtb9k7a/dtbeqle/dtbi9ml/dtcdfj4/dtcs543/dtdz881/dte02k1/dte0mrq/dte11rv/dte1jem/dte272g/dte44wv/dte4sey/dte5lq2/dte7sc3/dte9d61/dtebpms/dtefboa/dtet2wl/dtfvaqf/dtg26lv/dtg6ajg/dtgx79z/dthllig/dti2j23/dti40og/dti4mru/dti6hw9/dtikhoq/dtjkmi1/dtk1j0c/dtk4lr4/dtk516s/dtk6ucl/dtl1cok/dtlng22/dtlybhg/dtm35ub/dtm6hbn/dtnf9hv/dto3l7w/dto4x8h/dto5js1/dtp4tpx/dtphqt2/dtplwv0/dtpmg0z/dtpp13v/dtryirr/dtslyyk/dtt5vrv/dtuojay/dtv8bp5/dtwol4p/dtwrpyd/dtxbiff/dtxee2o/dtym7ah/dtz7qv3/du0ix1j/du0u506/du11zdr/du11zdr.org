  "The Orphan". (If he had a hand in his sire's demise, and this is known, then it's "The self-made orphan"). Or perhaps "The feral child". Or "The foundling". Or add a bit to it - "The orphan/feral child/foundling of wherever".
#+end_quote

The foundling. Excellent. I knew there was another word for orphan that I missed! I also realised that cuckoo means "crazy" and is not the connotation I wanted to go for....

  Hmmmm. TvTropes tells me that the male alternative to the "Mama Bear" trope is called "Papa Wolf", so wolves are probably also a good option. (Wolves also have some mythological links to vampires, so there's an extra thematic link there).

Another excellent observation! Cheers.

  I recommend "lover of man/kind/", for exactly the same reasons.
#+end_quote

It sounds too.... "nice". Manlover... nah manlover sounds like a gay euphemism too.

OK here we go, bleeding heart could work:

/The Honorable Erlis, Governor of Columbus, the one who kneels before Black Fang, the bleeding heart/

  I recommend having Red announce Elodia by title (which he had to painstakingly practise and memorise) as she enters and Lucia announce William by title (flawlessly) in response.
#+end_quote

[[/queencheer][]] YES. Perfect!!

  the only place I can think of that might work to introduce titles is a scene where William is teaching Red the titles of several major characters (and Red asks about the backstories behind one or two of them because he's curious).
#+end_quote

That's a good thought: but Erlis wouldn't come up in time for that. I was thinking it might be something they put on their envelopes, but they wouldn't put them in human-readable format. Still, I could do something like:

/William carefully addressed the letter to Cassius, spelling his name out formally: "God-king Cassius of the Eternal City, respected advisor of Magnus, long-awaited child of Tibillus, he who listens with a patient ear, the pranker of the third council, the wolf, the one with the iron toe, theif of dignity, keeper of the text" - he wanted to make sure that he was taken seriously.../

  Two powerful vampire kings are letting the opinion of a mere /duchess/ prevent them from doing what they want? Clearly Elodia has a lot more power than I'd expected...
#+end_quote

Anyone can start a rumour: but I get your point. They needn't be so paranoid.
