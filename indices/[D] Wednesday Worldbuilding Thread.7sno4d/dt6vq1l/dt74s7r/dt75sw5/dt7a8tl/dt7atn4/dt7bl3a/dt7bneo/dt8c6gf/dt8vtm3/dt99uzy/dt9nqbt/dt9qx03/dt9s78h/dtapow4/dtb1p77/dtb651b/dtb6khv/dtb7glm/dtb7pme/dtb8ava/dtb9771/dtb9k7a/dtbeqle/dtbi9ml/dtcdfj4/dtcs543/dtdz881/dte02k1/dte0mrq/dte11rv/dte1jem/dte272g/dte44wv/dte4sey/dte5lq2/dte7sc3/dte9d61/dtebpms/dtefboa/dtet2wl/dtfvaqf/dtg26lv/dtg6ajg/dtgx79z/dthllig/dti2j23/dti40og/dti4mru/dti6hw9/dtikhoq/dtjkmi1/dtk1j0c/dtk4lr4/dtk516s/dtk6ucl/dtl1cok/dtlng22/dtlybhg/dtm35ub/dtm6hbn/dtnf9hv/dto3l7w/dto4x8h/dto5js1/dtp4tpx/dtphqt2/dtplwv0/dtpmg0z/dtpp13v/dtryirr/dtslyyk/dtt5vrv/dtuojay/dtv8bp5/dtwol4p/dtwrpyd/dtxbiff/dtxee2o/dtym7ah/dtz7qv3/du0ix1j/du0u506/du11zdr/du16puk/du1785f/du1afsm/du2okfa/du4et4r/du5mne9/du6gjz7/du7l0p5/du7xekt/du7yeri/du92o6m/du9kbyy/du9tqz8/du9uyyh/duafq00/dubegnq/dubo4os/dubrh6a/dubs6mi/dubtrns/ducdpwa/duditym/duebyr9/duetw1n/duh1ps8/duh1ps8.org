  I guess a lot of the terms are Australian cultural things because otherwise international influence would change our stuff too much?
#+end_quote

Makes sense.

  The term referenced in the article is talking about these things: [[http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTY1WDg1MA==/z/VRwAAOSwLqFV8Vfr/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F]] - I call them water fountains but some places in Aus call them 'bubblers'...
#+end_quote

I'd still say 'tap', though 'drinking fountain' or 'water fountain' would be understood around here. 'Bubbler' would get you polite incomprehension.

  Restaurant is different from a cafe: a restaurant would be open at night (usually)
#+end_quote

What, in case of a sudden urge for midnight snacks?

There's a franchise around here called Mugg & Bean - they specialise in coffee (one of the items on the menu is a Bottomless Cup Of Coffee, which basically means all the free refills you want) but will also sell food to go with it. They have tables at which to sit and are generally open during the day.

They count as a restaurant here, though from your description I don't think they would in Australia.

  Huh, we have something like that for ANZAC biscuits (a traditional type of "cookie" sent to Australian soldiers fighting in WW1).
#+end_quote

Hmmm. Interesting...

  Sausage sizzles are generally done to raise money for charity or local school / sporting clubs.
#+end_quote

We use boerewors rolls in similar circumstances. Not so iconic on election days, but certainly well-known as a fundraiser.

  No comment.... Was it in Queensland? They're not real Australians...
#+end_quote

I don't know where it was, I just saw it on the legend on the side of the map.

And is that a classic "No True Scotsman" fallacy I see there?

  After discussions with you and callme-whatever-we-call-him-now I've decided I'm going to give each chapter a sense-oriented readthrough prior to posting, so hopefully I'll catch on that.

Excellent!
