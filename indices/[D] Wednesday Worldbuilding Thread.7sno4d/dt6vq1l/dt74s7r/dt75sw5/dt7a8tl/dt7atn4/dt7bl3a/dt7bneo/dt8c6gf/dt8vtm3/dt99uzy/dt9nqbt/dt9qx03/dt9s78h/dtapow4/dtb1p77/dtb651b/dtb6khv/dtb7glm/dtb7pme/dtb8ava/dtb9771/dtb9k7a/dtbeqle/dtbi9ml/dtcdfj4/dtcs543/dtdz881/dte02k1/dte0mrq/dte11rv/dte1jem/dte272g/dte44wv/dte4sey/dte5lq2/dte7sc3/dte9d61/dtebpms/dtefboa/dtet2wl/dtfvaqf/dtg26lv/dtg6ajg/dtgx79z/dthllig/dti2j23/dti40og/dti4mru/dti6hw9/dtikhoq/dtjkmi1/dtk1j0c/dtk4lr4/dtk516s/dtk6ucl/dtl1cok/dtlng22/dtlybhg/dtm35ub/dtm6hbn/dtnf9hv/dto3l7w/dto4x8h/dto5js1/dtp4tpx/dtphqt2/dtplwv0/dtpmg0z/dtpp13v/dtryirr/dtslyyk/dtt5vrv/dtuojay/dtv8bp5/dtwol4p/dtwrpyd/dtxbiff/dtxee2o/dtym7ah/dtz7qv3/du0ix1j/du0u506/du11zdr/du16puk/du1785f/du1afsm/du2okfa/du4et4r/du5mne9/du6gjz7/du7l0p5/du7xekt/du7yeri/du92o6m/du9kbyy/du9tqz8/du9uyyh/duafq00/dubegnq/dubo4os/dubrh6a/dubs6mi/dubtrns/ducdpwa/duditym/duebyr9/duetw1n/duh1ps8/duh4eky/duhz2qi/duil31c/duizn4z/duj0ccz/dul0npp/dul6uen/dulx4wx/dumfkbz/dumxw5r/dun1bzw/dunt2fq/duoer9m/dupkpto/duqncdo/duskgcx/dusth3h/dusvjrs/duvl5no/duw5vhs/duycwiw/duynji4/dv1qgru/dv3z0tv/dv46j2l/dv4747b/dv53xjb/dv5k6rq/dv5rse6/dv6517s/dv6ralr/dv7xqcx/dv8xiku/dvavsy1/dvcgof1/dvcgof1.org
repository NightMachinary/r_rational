Well, she's probably got a pretty good indication: when she gets close enough to the surface that the neutrinos or whatever are hitting her, she'll fall asleep. So she can only reach the surface during the evening.

  Hmmm... it would make sense for there to be signs. "This way", "Down here" (a knotted rope having been helpfully tied to make the descent easier) and, finally, "Wait here".

The problem is, you have to maintain that over centuries as the language your folk speak changes - assuming you've even allowed them to learn to read and write. I get your point though; it'd be pretty easy to have a "universal wait here" symbol, like an alter or something. And besides, the vampire probably locks her door.
