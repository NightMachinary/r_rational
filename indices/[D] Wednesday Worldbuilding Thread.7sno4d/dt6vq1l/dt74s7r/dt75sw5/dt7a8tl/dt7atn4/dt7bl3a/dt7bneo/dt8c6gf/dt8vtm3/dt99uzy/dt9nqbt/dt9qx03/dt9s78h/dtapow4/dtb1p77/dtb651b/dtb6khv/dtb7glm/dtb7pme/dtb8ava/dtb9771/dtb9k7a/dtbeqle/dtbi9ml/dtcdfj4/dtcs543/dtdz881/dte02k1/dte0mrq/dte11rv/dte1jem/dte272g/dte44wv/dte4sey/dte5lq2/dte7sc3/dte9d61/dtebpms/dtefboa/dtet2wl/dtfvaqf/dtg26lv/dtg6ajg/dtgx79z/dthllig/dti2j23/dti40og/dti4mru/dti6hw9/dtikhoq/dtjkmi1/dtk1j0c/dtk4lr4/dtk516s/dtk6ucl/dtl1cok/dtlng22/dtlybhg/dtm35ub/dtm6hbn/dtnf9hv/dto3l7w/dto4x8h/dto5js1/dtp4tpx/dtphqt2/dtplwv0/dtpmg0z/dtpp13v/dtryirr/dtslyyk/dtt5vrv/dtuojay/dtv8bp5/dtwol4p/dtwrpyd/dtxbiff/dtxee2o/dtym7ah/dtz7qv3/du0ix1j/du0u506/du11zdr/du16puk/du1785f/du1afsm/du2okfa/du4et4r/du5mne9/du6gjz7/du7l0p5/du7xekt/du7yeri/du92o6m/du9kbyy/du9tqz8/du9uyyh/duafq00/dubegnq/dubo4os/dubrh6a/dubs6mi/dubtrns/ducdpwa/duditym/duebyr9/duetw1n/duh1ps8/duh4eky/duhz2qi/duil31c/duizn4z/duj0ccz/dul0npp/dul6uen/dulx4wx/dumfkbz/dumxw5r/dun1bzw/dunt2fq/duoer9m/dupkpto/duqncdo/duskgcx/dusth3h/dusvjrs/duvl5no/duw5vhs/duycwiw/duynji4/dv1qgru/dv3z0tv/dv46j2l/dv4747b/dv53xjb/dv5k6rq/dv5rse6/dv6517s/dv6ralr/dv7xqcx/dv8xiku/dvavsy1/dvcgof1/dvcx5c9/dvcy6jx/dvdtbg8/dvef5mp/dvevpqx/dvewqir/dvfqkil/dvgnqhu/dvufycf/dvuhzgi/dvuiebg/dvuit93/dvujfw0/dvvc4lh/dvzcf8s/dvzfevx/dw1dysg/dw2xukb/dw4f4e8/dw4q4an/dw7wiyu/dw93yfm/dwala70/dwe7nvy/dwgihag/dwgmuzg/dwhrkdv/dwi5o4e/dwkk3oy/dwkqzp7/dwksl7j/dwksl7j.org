  Certainly isn't, but it was the thing I could search for on tvtropes that would be guaranteed to be relevant (except only half the gay tropes were relevant IIRC... so maybe I should have done my other idea of "randomly" opening 5-10 tabs)

[[/flutterkay][]] What about 'vampire'? (Yes, there are two, at least one of which applies...)

  The blasters that are clearly littering the countryside in 1944?

[[/angelbloom][]] Oh, don't mind me, I was just slipping in a Star Wars reference.

But you're right, swords would work better against vampires - unless you have golden bullets, or wooden ones, guns aren't going to do more than annoy them and tell them where you are. But if you behead a vampire, that at least gives you a few minutes in which to run.

  [[/spoiledshock][]] A /woman/? Who looks scarcely nineteen at that? No, it must be her /father/ who was in the army.

[[/flutterooh][]] Oooh! You're right. Maybe an uncle instead of a father, but yes, she must surely have inherited this room from /someone/.

  [[/ksilverbeam][]] Or just the /valuables/ left in storage by hotel guests.

Also a possibility - right up until someone actually leaves valuables with her, and she locks them in the heavy safe in the basement (or wherever).

  I wonder if blackout curtains were a thing in Rome: if it was an open city, you wouldn't expect the Allies to bomb it.

[[/twilistread][]] I went and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackout_(wartime)][looked it up]] - apparently it was a big thing in England. Less so in the rest of the world, but it was applied in some other places (and apparently /should/ have been applied in certain coastal cities earlier than it was, because ships show up to submarines like anything if there are city lights behind the ship). Though its ability to mess with the navigation of incoming planes is apparently somewhat disputed; to the extent that, in a lot of places, it was introduced mainly to keep the population fired up about the war...
