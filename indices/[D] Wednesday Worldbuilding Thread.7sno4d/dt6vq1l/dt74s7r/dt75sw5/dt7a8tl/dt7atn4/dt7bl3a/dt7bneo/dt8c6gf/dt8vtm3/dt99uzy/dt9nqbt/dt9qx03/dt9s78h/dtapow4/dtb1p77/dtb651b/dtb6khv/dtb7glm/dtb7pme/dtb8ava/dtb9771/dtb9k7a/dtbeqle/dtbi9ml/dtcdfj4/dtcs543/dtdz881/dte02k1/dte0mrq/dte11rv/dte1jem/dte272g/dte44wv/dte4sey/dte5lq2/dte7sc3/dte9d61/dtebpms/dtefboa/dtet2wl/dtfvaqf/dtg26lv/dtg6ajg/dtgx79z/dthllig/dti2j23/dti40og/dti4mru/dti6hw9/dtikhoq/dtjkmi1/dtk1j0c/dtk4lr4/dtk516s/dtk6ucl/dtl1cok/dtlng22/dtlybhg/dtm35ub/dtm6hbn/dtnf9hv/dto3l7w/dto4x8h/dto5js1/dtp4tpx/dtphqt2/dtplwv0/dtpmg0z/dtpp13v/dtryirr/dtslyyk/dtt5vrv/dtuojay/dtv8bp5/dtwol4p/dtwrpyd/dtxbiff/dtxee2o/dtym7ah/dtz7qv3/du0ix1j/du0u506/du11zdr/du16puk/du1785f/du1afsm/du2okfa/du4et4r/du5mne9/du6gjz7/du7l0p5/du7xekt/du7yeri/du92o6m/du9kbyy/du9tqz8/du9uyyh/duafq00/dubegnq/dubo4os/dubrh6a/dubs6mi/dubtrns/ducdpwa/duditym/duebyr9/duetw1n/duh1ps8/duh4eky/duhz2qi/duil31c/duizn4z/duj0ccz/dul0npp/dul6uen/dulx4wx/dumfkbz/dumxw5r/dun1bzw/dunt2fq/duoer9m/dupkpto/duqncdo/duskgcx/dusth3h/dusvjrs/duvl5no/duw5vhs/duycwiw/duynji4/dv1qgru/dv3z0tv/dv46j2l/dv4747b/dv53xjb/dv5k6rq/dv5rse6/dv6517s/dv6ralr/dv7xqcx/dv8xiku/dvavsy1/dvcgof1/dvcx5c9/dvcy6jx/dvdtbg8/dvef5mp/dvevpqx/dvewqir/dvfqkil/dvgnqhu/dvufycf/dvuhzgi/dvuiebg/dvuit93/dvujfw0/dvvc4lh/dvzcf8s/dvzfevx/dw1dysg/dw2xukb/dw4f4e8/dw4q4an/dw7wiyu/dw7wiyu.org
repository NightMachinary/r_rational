  In my opinion, it's not necessarily important that the audience /like/ William as much as it's important that they /don't hate/ William.
#+end_quote

Okay, that's reasonable. Then William needs to be a character that your readers would not hate.

#+begin_quote
  I mean, don't get me wrong, he's not going to /continue growing/ while Red's gone, and he might take some steps back, but he's not like the trope of someone becoming vegetarian because their partner's vegetarian and after a big breakup they go to McDonald's and get a double cheeseburger to stick to them.
#+end_quote

Ah - I think there may have been a slight misunderstanding here. When I said that William should show the occasional hint of not much caring about the lives of other humans "when Red steps out of the picture", I didn't mean after Red leaves William in a long-term sense (after William's had some character growth). I meant it as in during the first few chapters, /before/ William has had his character growth, when Red steps temporarily out of the scene (to go get some beer or buy a trunk or whatever), /then/ William should show some signs of not caring for the lives of other humans, on the basis that:

- He doesn't care for them at this point in the story.
- With Red out of sight, William has no reason to /pretend/ to care for the lives of mere humans.

Yes, later in the story, once William has had his character growth, he should retain that growth even when he's alone. But earlier in the story, before that character growth - well, you should probably show a fairly accurate "Before" picture of William's personality, so the audience can see just how much he has grown, later on in the story.

  Yes and yes; and that is what I want my story /not/ to do, because any damsel in her right mind would not want to be with the knight at that scene. Add in some more scenes of the knight going "oh damsel, won't you love me?" and her going "not until you learn your manners" and a /Beauty and the Beast/ montage or five later and then I would be OK with it.
#+end_quote

Fair enough - that's not the story you want to write. But you can't blame that on your genre; it's a matter of personal preference.

#+begin_quote
  I'm not /showing/ murder, he probably kills a human every two years or so. It is not like he murders three humans before breakfast each morning, you know?
#+end_quote

Yeah, he doesn't go around on a killing spree every morning. But, at the same time, he does not /care/ about the lives of average humans, and I do think that that needs to be shown - not necessarily via direct murder, there are a variety of other ways to do it. Some examples:

- William and another vampire notice an ordinary human in mortal peril of some or other sort - not certain death, but something he could perhaps escape. Either of them could easily save him. Instead of doing so, they idly take bets on whether or not he will survive.

- William visits another vampire, who has a bad habit of keeping grisly souvenirs of his various kills - William walks right past dozens of jars of preserved heads without batting an eye (if asked about this, perhaps by a horrified Red, he only comments on the tastelessness of the display)

- William, driving a coach-and-horses, liberally uses his horsewhip on passing foot traffic if it looks like they're going to get in the way of his horses.

That sort of thing. Not deliberate murder necessarily, just - casual disdain for the lives of humans.

#+begin_quote
  Wouldn't that be awkward to show on-screen, though? It's a nice thought, and I did think, "well obviously he wouldn't be ACTUALLY dead, he'd just look dead" - but if Red thought he was dead, then it's almost as bad as William actually doing the murdering because Red should still be shocked/disgusted by the whole thing since he, y'know, thinks it's real.
#+end_quote

Hmmm. Good point.

Another option, of course, once the guy is on the roof, is to have him get up again and run for it, leaping rooftop to rooftop into the distance until he can get down someplace where William is not waiting around at ground level. Of course, this cannot be done quietly, so Red would hear him fleeing.

...having reiterated that /very important/ point, I do think that the dialogue in this piece strikes a nice tone - by this point, they're clearly comfortable enough in each other's presence for a little light banter, even when talking serious topics. (Of course, the real solution is for William to hire Red a private trainer - a good trainer will know how to minimize the chances of injury, and at least if he is training then Red is staying out of other trouble).
