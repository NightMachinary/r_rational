If you have a competent rival, the ghoul will pretend he doesn't speak any other languages in any case. (And probably turn out to have an eidetic memory, too). So the test isn't going to stop that.

No, if you want to stop /that/ then you have to either be sneakier, or develop a reputation for brutally killing any vampire who tries pulling that nonsense on you.
