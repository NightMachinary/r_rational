  This is what's probably happening; plus, there are plenty of vampires who romance humans to various extents /anyway/, and it serves as a good marker of someone who doesn't have their priorities in order if it remains untrendy.
#+end_quote

That opera in the prologue, actually, is probably a specific move by a vampire who wants it to be trendy - perhaps even in a deliberate attempt to distract everyone /else/ while he deliberately bucks the trend himself.

  I swear there's a big word in the chapter that i'm hoping to release in 48 hours... can I find it... Oh, I think it's "stiletto", used to mean the knife.
#+end_quote

[[/facewing][]] ...I don't know whether to bemoan general educational standards in general or not. /Stiletto/. Is that /really/ something that most people are going to have to look up?

(It's a serious question. I read a lot, so I /know/ I have a bigger vocabulary than most people, but I thought that was mostly in the /really/ rare words, like doyenne, or drupe, or exsanguinate. Is 'stiletto' /really/ something that most people will have to look up?)

  For a second there I thought you were saying nobody would think about the story at all (which is patently untrue as I've got some lovely thoughtful comments on the chapter threads!), but then I realised you meant any one way and I felt a lot better :).
#+end_quote

Eeyup. I mean, consider your next paragraph:

#+begin_quote
  I mean, if I do my job right, most people are going to like Red, many people will root for the relationship, many people will be intrigued by the William/Cassius dynamic, etc.
#+end_quote

You will get people who like Red, for reason A. Others who like him for reason B, and a third group who like him because C. And then you'll get those who really don't care much about Red one way or another (but perhaps like William, or Cassius, or your scene descriptions, or your worldbuilding, or any number of other things). And then there will be those who really /don't/ like Red for one reason or another, but perhaps they like something else. And you will inevitably get some people who like a thing that you did not even realise you were putting in the book in the first place (but you go and look, and voila, there it is, somehow).

So, yeah, anyone who reads anything you write will clearly think /something/ about it - at the very least, reconstructing the scene in their own heads. Just not in exactly the same way as anyone else.

  I follow Survivor very closely and the fans of that show do tend to propose the same theories/ideas/etc a lot.
#+end_quote

Funny thing - people in the same group tend to take the same fanon for granted, after long enough. But two completely disparate groups of fans of some work, without any contact, will evolve entirely separate fanons based on entirely different unspoken assumptions... and will thus develop entirely different branches of theories.
