  Wait - but what will /they/ eat?

Oh come on, they're clearly going to be a quasi-pagan cult with human sacrifice. Every couple of weeks, a member of their cult makes their way down the abyss to commune with the great Deep spirit. Most don't come back - after all, the Deep spirit is their god and the bottom of the cave is their heaven.

Sometimes, the Deep spirit sends a person back to prosthelytize, telling stories of the bliss that is the communal with the Deep spirit, and brings with them a giant container - impossibly clear, impossibly smooth glass that shows it came from the heavens - and the container is full of the manna from heaven, a thick red liquid that the town's ageless shaman drinks each day during their rituals. For the particularly pious among them, the manna can be used to heal wounds.

The cult believes that if the body dies above ground, the spirit of the Deep can never reach them, and they will rot into dust. That doesn't stop hopeful family members having the weekly sacrifice bring their relative's corpse with them, in the hopes that the Deep spirit can still take them in. And so the most infirm or most ill members of society tend to volunteer themselves for the one-way journey.

.... okay that came away from me for a bit there, so anyway, that's 1000% canon.
