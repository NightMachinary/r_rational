  So William's thinking the human thing will be hot; turns out it's a dud.

Ah. So, it's not /as/ obvious as I thought it was supposed to be from the intro - and the reason why the other elder vampires aren't already working towards this trend is simply that it isn't going to /be/ a trend. (Perhaps some Elder Vampires are subtly pushing for it to become a trend, but they are being outpushed by the Elder Vampires who just don't want to have to waste their time dealing with stupid smelly /humans/.)

  Very true! The only word that's like that in the story is janissary, and that passes through pretty quietly.
#+end_quote

A vampire story is the /perfect/ place to slip in the word "exsanguinate".

  I don't think anyone's going to reach for a dictionary with the reference to "adultery"; they just might be confused about the lack of wives in the picture.

  And in the reader's mind it'll take the form of something like, "oh, William's moved Red to his house in Australia, he has a wife there doesn't he? I remember it was mentioned somewhere that William had a wife" - they won't remember the word adultery got them there.

  Again, doesn't matter anyway.

Valid points. Bear in mind that no two readers are the same; probably less than a tenth of your readers will think that way, because probably less than a tenth of your readers will think /any/ particular way. (It's not particularly important in this case, but it's worth bearing in mind in other situations).
