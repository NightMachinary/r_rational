  some young vampire wrote it down somewhere, and a human found it, thought it was neat, and the trend spread amongst humans thereafter. Maybe it was in the effects of a vampire who died in that plague....

That does make sense.

  I want it to be Linear A because I think that would be entertaining (and then a linguist finds some vampire communication in Linear A and there's enough of it for them to decypher it!), but probably it'd just be something like ancient Korean that is perfectly understandable to modern scholars but the vampires just take care not to take any experts in Korean antiquities.

Actually, Linear A makes a lot of sense.

(1) The actual script used will bear a strong resemblance to an ancient writing system - Linear A strongly resembles Linear B

(2) Despite this resemblance, it will be largely unintelligible because the vampires are writing in code

(3) It will be related to a language that as once considered high-class and formal, probably Greek or Latin - and Linear A is related to Greek.

So then, Linear A would turn out to be Ancient Greek that's been run through some sort of substitution cypher.

And yes, a new vampire will have a sharp learning curve. Thousands of years of tradition needs catching up on...
