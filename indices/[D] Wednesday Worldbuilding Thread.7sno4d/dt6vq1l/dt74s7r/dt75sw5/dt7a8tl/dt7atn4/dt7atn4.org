Oh, I loove the Y2K bug writ large. Especially the thought of everyone just dying almost at once. They'd have to conclude it was magic.

And hey, if I do decide to turf the nanites handwavium for vampires, a magic spell that was cast to kill all vampires (which some happened to be immune to) is a feasible alternative.

I just want to post this link to the next Y2K problem that's going to have everyone freaking out: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem]]
