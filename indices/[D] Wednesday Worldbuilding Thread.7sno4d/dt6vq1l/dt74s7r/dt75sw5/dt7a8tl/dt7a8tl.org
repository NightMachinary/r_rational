Your isolationist vampire on a tiny pacific island is well insulated against both war and plague. If the war is one of complete extermination, however, and the aggressors have some form of vampire-locating magic, then 'isolationist vampire' might just be another way of saying 'easy target'; and perhaps the only survivors are a group of vampires who got together for the purpose of mutual defence (in which case they'd all know each other, hving once fought together).

--------------

On the plague side, on the other hand, one possibility is the Y2K bug writ large - that the vampire nanites were never intended to last quite /that/ long, and when their date counter rolled over, the nanites reset themselves; which worked out to 'shut down' except for one particular nanite line, which either (a) successfully rebooted or (b) due to an ancient bug, stopped incrementing the time counter a few thousand years before the time bug hit, thus never triggered it. This way, it doesn't matter /what/ the vampire did, they were all equally vulnerable - and the survivors have probably never worked out what it was, either, and have no idea how to prevent it from happening again. (Worse, all the vampires who did die did so near-simultaneously and with no warning).
