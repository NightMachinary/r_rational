Sorry, during writing the explanation flipped more than once as I realised what you were aiming for, and this isn't adequately represented in my previous post.

What I meant to say: What about an animal or species that became ubiquitous (or widespread enough) at the time of the plague but was a relatively local species before? Something like how potatoes were a food crop in South America, but then got introduced in Europe. Dunno which species would account for the whole world. Probably something like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teredo_navalis][naval shipworm]] or another more incidental species.

Mind, I'm just throwing ideas out there.
