Have the plague be something for which vampires aren't actually intentionally infected, but as a side effect. Like a parasite (mustn't be particularly relevant) that as part of its lifecycle goes through three different hosts: A, B, C. Let's say C is the primary host in which the parasite reaches (sexual) maturity. B is a required intermediary host, and A is also a required host. Let's say primates are an intermediary host. Relevant and important for the lifecycle of the parasite, but not /that/ important from the parasite's point of view. To add insult to injury, let's say the primary and for reproduction relevant host are rats or something equally ubiquitous at the time. Ideally some organism that became widespread at the time, but was only local before (to account for the lack of ‘plague' before that time).

Since humans /are/ primates and vampires are arguably human, they also get infected often enough. Now in regular primates the immune systems is tricked or some such so that the parasite can complete its stage and pass through the organism without too much damage (hopefully), but what if the vampire nanites dealt with the parasite swiftly, but due to unique markers and proteins in that parasite an apoptosis or delayed self-destruct program is triggered in them? The cascade may take some time to propagate through the body (i.e. sickness symptoms as nanites shut down throughout the body), but will eventually succeed and be fatal.

That way you can have a ‘plague' that was uniquely deadly to vampires, but only them. Regular humans would be carriers of the parasite and vampires might infect themselves by drinking an infected's blood (up to you, as long as you stay consistent). An upside/downside to this is you establish proteins/markers as one way of communicating with the nanites. Maybe only to trigger present programs, but still.
