First question I would like to ask. Why does the war have to have a reasonable reason? Does it affect the story if they did? If the guy must have a reasonable reason, say the main character worked for them and you are trying prevent the negative associations of having worked for a murderous bastard, may I suggest considering how many vampires ate people and did how many people they hurt or killed. If the number is high enough you might be able to portray them positively. However, you should consider multiple perspectives seriously as if you attempt to suggest they were totally justified your reader might complain. In addition, I can say from a previous attempt at asking, that a vampire who must kill once a month and cannot avoid it which is much higher that your story would find sustainable, still has people saying that it is still not okay to kill them on principle so you might have some difficulty managing to persuade people he was a saint, but if you do it right you should be able to convince people he might have had a reason.
