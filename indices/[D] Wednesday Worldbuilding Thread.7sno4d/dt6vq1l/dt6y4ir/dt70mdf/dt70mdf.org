  Why does the war have to have a reasonable reason?
#+end_quote

Rules of Rational fiction: characters should do stuff based on their own feasible motivations, rather than because the plot demands it. At the moment the Catastrophe happens because I like the idea of vampires going through a population bottleneck, so I don't want that Catastrophe to seem... weird or cheap or like an asspull.

  If the number [of people vampires kill] is high enough you might be able to portray them positively.

Yeah, that's basically the sort of thing I have going down: the problem is, the older a vampire is, the more powerful they are, and it's /basically/ logarithmic (not quite, but a 500 year old vampire can beat an arbitrary number of 50 year old vampires in a brawl). So vampires who aren't comfortable subjugating humans end up likely being killed by older vampires.

  I can say from a previous attempt at asking, that a vampire who must kill once a month and cannot avoid it which is much higher that your story would find sustainable

Fortunately, My Vampires almost without exception do not kill their humans; humans benefit from being fed on (the experience itself is pleasurable, and afterwards they have a cocktail of vampire-produced drugs in their bloodstream that basically lets them be on Ritalin and Modafinil for a month or so). William is a particularly irresponsible vampire in the human killing department and he kills maybe one a year, despite feeding 120+ times a year on a stable of 10-15 humans.

Do you think there's a reason to go with a war rather than a plague?
