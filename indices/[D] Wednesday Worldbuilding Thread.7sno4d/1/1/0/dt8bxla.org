  As the second law of thermodynamics states the amount of unusable energy in a closed system increases towards maximum. Due to the temporal bubble having restricted access to prevent needing to consider all the possible ramifications of things that exist on the edge, it certainly qualifies. Due to larger, less energy efficient systems it would require some means of having more energy input and waste heat being output.

This can all be handwaved away by having the edge of the bubble permeable to electromagnetic radiation coming out and magic ging in (but /not/ matter in either direction). Sure, the waste heat is going to come out of there as gamma rays, but there's a spell to deal with radiation, right?
