In theory, any calculation you can perform on an electronic computer, you can also perform on a mechanical one. (This is the same 'in theory' that states that any calculation that can be performed by a computer can also be done with pencil and paper - it says nothing about how long it will take to calculate).

In /practice/, the major advantage of electronics is that you can fit an awful lot of computer in a very small space. Mechanical computers are going to be /significantly/ bigger, and at the same time require some incredibly tiny and delicate parts. There will be trouble if dust gets in, or if a part deep in the machine breaks, or if a part is made slightly unevenly. So, we're probably talking a room-sized computer or so here.

  So what sort of things could and could not be done with simple programs with limited memory, but unlimited time to work?

A lot more could be done than you might think. In general, there's a tradeoff between time and memory - by giving unlimited time, you're allowing most of the problems of limited memory to be avoided by sufficiently devious programmers. (Modern computers tend to optimise for time over memory, so the default solutions to certain problems will change).
