After further consideration several problems can be seen. Firstly is the problem of wear and tear. It would be nice to run the computer at such a high temporal acceleration that every second is a thousand years. However in such a scenario if you replaced every part every hour, it would still need to be capable of lasting 3.6 million years. So in a more reasonable estimate if it had the computing power of a modern computer ( Taken as 63 Gflops after a quick google)( This still seems a bit high but with incentive to perfect the technology and magical aid it may be doable) and could be replaced once every year which seems expensive, and a acceleration of one thousand times could be maintained throughout then it would have computing power approximating one thousandth of modern supercomputers which again a quick google places in the pettaflop range. Secondly would be entropy. As the second law of thermodynamics states the amount of unusable energy in a closed system increases towards maximum. Due to the temporal bubble having restricted access to prevent needing to consider all the possible ramifications of things that exist on the edge, it certainly qualifies. Due to larger, less energy efficient systems it would require some means of having more energy input and waste heat being output. My current plan to solve this problem is to have the most powerful of these computers placed in close orbit to the sun where they could dip into the sun for power. Waste heat could then be vented into space as a plume of superheated plasma or vented back into the sun. This would also provide a solution to materials. The sun apparently contains a fair bit of metal which could be sifted out for parts by sifting spells. Failing a sufficient density of metal for that hydrogen could be compressed and fused into heavier elements. I am unsure if this would be necessary to supply the needed power, but it would look awesome and is likely to be done anyway for other high energy processes.\\
The third issue is interactivity. Given the system is held under very high acceleration it would be difficult to interact with it once it was started up. I predict that this would lead to low acceleration computers used for day to day uses with high acceleration computers used for purposes such as computationally expensive simulations.\\
These are the problems that have arisen so far in my ponderings. More details will be known as the magic system is hammered down and the matter is considered. The primary motivation for doing things like this with magic interacting badly with electricity is it permits me to write a alternate tech tree that I find more interesting and also permits a massive reduction in the likelihood of super intelligent AI. While many things can be said about the singularity, you cannot deny it would make writing a civilisation past it difficult and this lets humans remain relevant, even reducing automation.
