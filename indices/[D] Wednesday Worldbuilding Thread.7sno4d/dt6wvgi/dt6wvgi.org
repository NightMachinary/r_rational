I would like people's opinion on the following world building questions. In this particular world magic does not play nice with electricity. Specifically if the magic field interacts with electricity then it will cease to be ethereal and begin to become capable of maintaining two way interactions with physical parts, ruining delicate electrical parts. The stronger the magical field the weaker the electrical field needs to be. While this has many effects, such as the phenomena known as magic poisoning as it tears up your nerves, one major side effect is causing electrical devices to become impractical. Even in low magic regions this is a problem as a temporary thick spot forms. Therefore, in order to avoid this the people make use of magical solutions to most problems, but the one this post is about is computers. These people have started using mechanical computers to perform calculations. In order to compensate for the slow speed they have begun to use temporal acceleration to help. So the question is, what would be the downside of using purely mechanical computers? Secondly, my current thoughts about question one is that it would restrict the amount of memory and complexity of programs you can run as well as reducing the speed of human interaction quite significantly. So what sort of things could and could not be done with simple programs with limited memory, but unlimited time to work? I'm reasonably certain that many things that we have accomplished with modern computers are not merely the result of increased speed and are instead the result of increased complexity such as the modern improvements to AI. Would spaceflight be possible and if not what are the computationally expensive parts of spaceflight so I can consider magic solutions? Tldr What could be achieved with mechanical computers? P.S I have very little computing experience. About the limits on mine are having watched crash course computers
