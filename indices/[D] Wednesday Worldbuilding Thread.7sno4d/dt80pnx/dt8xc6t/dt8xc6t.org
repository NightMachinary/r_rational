Thank god for parenthesis in the opening paragraph, at first I was wondering if you were writing a rational dating sim story.

Binary star planetary habitability can be categorised in basically two kinds: S-type orbits and P-type orbits. In the former the planet orbits one of the two stars, in the latter the planet orbits both (circumbinary). Due to orbital dynamics one can't switch willy-nilly between the two; there are ranges at which a planet will be swiftly kicked out of the system.

For clarity purposes I name one sun Sol, the other Helios.

S-type: If the planet's distance to Sol exceeds about one fifth of Sol's closest approach to Helios, orbital stability is not guaranteed.

P-type: distance planet-barycentre >> distance Sol-Helios (by a factor of 2--4 at least).

To put all this in perspective with two smaller stars with a sum mass of our current star, because I like for Earth not to burn up for now, for P-type the two suns would need to be about .1--.4 AUs distant from each other, which is about Mercury's orbit or quite a bit less. And there would be no Mercury or Venus in this world, obviously. For an S-type, well, Earth would probably need to be in Venus' orbit or closer and the other sun not be much closer orbiting than Jupiter, to put them on the scale of our solar system.

Keep in mind these are the limiting cases, you may want to have some leeway before deciding on this right now.

As for the three moons... well, unless you have one major moon (like ours) and a couple lesser, well, it becomes relatively chaotic and unstable. The three body problem is a thing here. The gas giants get around this by having minor moons, speaking in relation to the respective masses involved, whereas an argument could be made that Earth and the moon are more like a double planet than a single planet + moon. Within our solar system Earth and Luna are the exception at least, not the rule.

Did you consider flipping the whole thing around? Have the world be an inhabitable moon of a gas giant in the Goldilocks zone, with multiple similarly sized moons whizzing about? I'd consider this a fun exercise in world building ;)
