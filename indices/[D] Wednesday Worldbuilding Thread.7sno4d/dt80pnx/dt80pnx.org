Dating system problem in fictional world (and general planetary system/weather/seasons issues).

How do you plan for a hypothetically habitable world with 2 suns (in a stable orbit around each other) and three moons?

I sort of got around the 2 suns issue by looking at how a similiarly rational world building/setting (Hello Helliconia!) dealt with it, but three moons is kind of .. interesting. The world likely has fun weather and tidal cycles hurhur at the very least.
