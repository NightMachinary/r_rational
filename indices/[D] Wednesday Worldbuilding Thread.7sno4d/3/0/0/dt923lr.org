First off, thanks for the reply!

I might as well be in some ways due to the fandom this fic plans to be set in. I think too much about making sense of childhood nostalgia.

It's s-type orbit due to plot reasons. (Plus this was originally a three star system on formation that ejected the third -it's relevant later yay)

There's interstellar travel and colonization planned in later story arcs and in background so your suggestion is definitely possible ... In another part of the story XD

And yes, I've been told given the work I'm putting in here I might as well file off the serial numbers and do original fic XD

My problem is without the original fandom characters I'm basing off, a lot of the plot would require more world building.

And damn Kyrnn for magic hand waving the whole three moons/constellation thing being deities.
