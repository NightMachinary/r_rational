The problem as I see it with that is getting the vectors around the world: there have been humans in Australia for 60,000 years, so you'd need those rats to be there (which aren't native to Australia, and 1700 precedes European first contact). So basically, if I want there to be vampires on Australia who are just affected as vampires in the slums of Berlin, you are /really/ having to stretch.

You still basically have the same problems of needing a plague to spread from Europe to Asia to the Americas to Africa to Australia, just you create a hell of a lot more vectors. (Mosquitos? But there's no malaria in Australia either).
