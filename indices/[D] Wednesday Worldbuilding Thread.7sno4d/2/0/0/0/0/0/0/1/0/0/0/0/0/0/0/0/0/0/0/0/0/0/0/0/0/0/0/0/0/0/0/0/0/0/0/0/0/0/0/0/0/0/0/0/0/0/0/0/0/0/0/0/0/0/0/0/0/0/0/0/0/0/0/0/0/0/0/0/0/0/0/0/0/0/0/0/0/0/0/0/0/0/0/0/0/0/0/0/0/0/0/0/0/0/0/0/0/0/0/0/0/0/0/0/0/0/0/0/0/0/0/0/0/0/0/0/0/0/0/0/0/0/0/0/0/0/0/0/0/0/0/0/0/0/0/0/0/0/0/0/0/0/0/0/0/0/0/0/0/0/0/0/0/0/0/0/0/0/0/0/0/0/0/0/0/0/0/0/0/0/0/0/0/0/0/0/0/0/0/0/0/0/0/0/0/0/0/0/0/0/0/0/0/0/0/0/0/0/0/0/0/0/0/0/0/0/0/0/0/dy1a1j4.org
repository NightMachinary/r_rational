  That works! It also implies that you might be able to take down a vampire by (say) dropping a WWII bomb on his house and getting /really/ lucky (but if you don't destroy the head on your first shot then you're in serious trouble because you won't get a second shot).

I think even if you didn't destroy her head with your bomb, you'd destroy her flesh/bones badly enough that she wouldn't be able to grow back before the "second shot" - fortunately, vampires don't really have access to explosives, or at the very least, don't really use them based on the evidence of the world as we know it.

(I think for the most part vampires don't want to kill each other, the same way humans don't want to kill each other for the most part).

    “Many of us are guilty of the sin of envy, my son.”
  #+end_quote

  What William has described is not the sin of Envy - Envy is more "I want what he's got", while what William is describing is clearly more along the lines of "I want /him/", which would be Lust. I'm not quite sure what you're going for here.
#+end_quote

I chose envy because I was going for the covetousness rather than the "lust" part. I mean, I don't want to paint it as a sexual thing, and I think using the word 'lust' would... colour the narrative. I might use a different word than either lust or envy though.

Like, one source puts lust as "a craving for the pleasures of the body" - greed might be better than envy though for the situation at hand, and probably fits William's state of mind better.

[[/bpthink][]] okay, I think I've managed to re-frame it into a 'greed' mindset

  Perhaps if William had stressed the maintenance of chastity somewhat in his previous reply, that might make sense...

Very good point, fixed!

    “I confessed my secrets to a heretical priest, and I plan to kill him very, very shortly. Do you suppose the Lord would forgive me that, too?”
  #+end_quote

  William has clearly gone a long, /long/ way away from the Church, and I think this line really highlights just /how/ far away he's gone. It makes a great ending to the excerpt, especially if there's some background mention, later, perhaps as a rumour or a headline, of the mysterious death and/or disappearance of an elderly Priest.

Ohh, I'd love to be able to put that in, but I don't know where. Maybe have Red list the news articles he's reading when he gets breakfast in the "oh he's a vampire" scene that comes up later on. "Red flicked through the paper, his rudimentary Italian giving him enough to make sense of the headlines. A shortage of butter, again. A call for people to donate to the war kitchens. An elderly priest had disappeared. A spate of thefts of farming equipment. An op-ed about whether the Americans were torturing Italians."

excerpt of interlude

--------------

“I accuse myself of a great many sins. But there is one sin in particular that is on my conscience, and led me to return after so long. I have become interested in one of my employees to an inappropriate degree, more than is proper of a gentleman.”

“Many of us are guilty of that sin, my son. It can be a form of greed, where the pursuit of things in the mortal realm is done without regard for the eternal. Is that why you have come today?”

“Not precisely. I fear my... greed... will cause a scandal. It could ruin me.”

“You are speaking of material things. Think not what effect your sins will have on you in this world, but on your soul in the kingdom of heaven.”

“My soul may be unsalvageable at this point.”

“Nobody who seeks penance is beyond heaven, least of all for the sin of envy. Have you acted on this desire?”

“Yes, though not to the point of committing the sin of adultery. Though I worry that my infatuation is excessive, even given the circumstances.”

“It sounds as though you are behaving as appropriately as can be expected. As greed is the enemy of charity, remember to give alms to the poor, especially in times such as these. Pray for guidance, make an effort to attend service and confession more often, and above all, continue live in chastity until you have been joined in the sacrament of marriage.”
