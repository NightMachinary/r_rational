  Fun fact: raisins are surprisingly high in iron. Eat lots of raisins, and you'll be less likely to need iron infusions.

The iron infusion was purely a result of losing 1L of blood, and contained one gram of iron. 1kg of raisins has 21mg of iron... So you'd have to eat 50kg of raisins... which is about 2.5 months worth of calories if you ate nothing but raisins. I think the hospital said it was on the order of 150 steaks.

Even on normal raisin consumption, a 1/4 cup serving (which is about twice what I'd eat probably) has only 1mg of iron which isn't much - 98% of menstruaters are covered by an 18mg iron intake (50% are covered by only 9mg), and my typical intake is about 10-12mg (and that is a typical intake for females my age regardless of diet).

So yeah... raisins don't do the job, unfortunately.

100R for a doctor consultation is super cheap to me! Probably a cost of living thing. And most people have to pay about 300R for a standard box of prescription medication (... basically any subsidised medicine costs 300R/30AUD, I purchased a medical device at one point that retails for 10x that but I only paid $30...). I think people who are "sufficiently poor" get these pills for even cheaper or free, and there are some complicated rules about certain medicines. (My husband takes adderrall for his ADHD, and because he was diagnosed as a child the box of pills is $12, but for people diagnosed as adults the same box of pills is $84...)
