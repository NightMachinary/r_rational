[[/twiponder][]] That's... one way it could end, yes. There is another. The vampire might have simply decided never to come up aboveground again - and, in the rare case where it might one day prove necessary, the vampire has prepared an antechamber, high enough that he can tell by the lethargy he feels whether it is day or night (and which he perhaps visits once a month or so when he needs a bit of a break from his - science or novel-writing or whatever he spends his time down there doing - and he wants to have a nap. It is, of course, still sealed against intruders larger than a neutrino).

On the (incredibly rare) occasion when he needs to /personally/ visit the surface, he strolls up to this chamber, waits until he falls asleep, then he knows when he wakes up that the night has just begun, and it is safe to exit.

But - he is almost completely disconnected from the world. The Internet - and the social changes of the last few decades - took everyone else by surprise - they totally blindsided the Cave Vampire. His Cult, though it had lasted for centuries, was finding it harder and harder to maintain itself in a changing society - and the fact that it was tied to one particular geographic location did /not/ help.

And then something happens to the Shaman. Struck by lightning, hit by a bus, poached by a rival vampire - one way or another, something happens, and the cult just collapses.

The Vampire, happily pottering about in his cave, doesn't notice at first. Then he wonders why there isn't any food. Then he resolves to send a strongly worded letter with the next cultist. Then...

...he finally decides he clearly needs to take matters into his own hands. He just has to remember, before he goes to the surface, to wait in the antechamber until just after he wakes up. Though he's shocked - his cult was always so reliable before! Still, he shouldn't have any trouble setting up a new one - he just hopes they last as long as the old one did.

Any educated person will still speak Latin, right?
