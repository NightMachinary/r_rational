oh my god, I love the idea of Julias' inner monologue: I knew I had a reason for asking you! It's going to be a giant undertaking, to get INTO his head, but it will be so very, very worthwhile. It's not mood whiplash, it's not doubling down: it's going to be very, very neutral. I won't have a chance to sketch it out today but I would value your input especially highly on that scene.

  Keep in mind that deserters were pretty reviled during the war. Short of claiming that he lost his memory due to a war injury to the head and only got it back recently, he's going to be in trouble when he goes home. (And even with the memory excuse, people are going to want to see his scar).

Yeah; he gets a new identity, a French immigrant, that passes muster with most. His sister is the main one, and she is just happy he's alive, because she knew how scared he was to go and all. Plus, their mother died only a few months earlier so she's just happy not to be alone.

I do have him living in his sister's house though (read: the family home). It's probably really unrealistic, now I think about it: the neighbours would recognise him. Ugh.

"Fortunately", Red's entire regiment was KIA (Battle of Cisterna) very soon after he deserted, so it might not have gotten reported.

Options:

- Keep it as-is: i.e. unrealistic (he moves back home, people who used to know him know he's back but the cover story is he's a French immigrant and keep his secret; strangers believe the French immigrant story)

- Avoid the problem by having he and his sister living in some other city (e.g. New York) where nobody knows him (not realistic: if his mum is dead, his sister is probably living in her house? Though we could say that the memories of her dead brother and dead mother were too much so she moved into her husband's uncle's home. Also I want William to make a friendship with a smalltime vampire who is human-sympathiser, so new york specifically would not be a good choice, but maybe somewhere like Cincinnati or whatever would work)

- Acknowledge it because it would only take two lines: "Red tried to keep a low profile, knowing how deserters were treated. People still recognised him though, and there were a few establishments where he wasn't served. On the whole, the town was large enough that he was able to carve out some places that had only met Reynaud Dubois, and never Reginald Wilkins. After all, Reginald Wilkins never went to the Saturday antiques market; Reynaud Dubois was there every week."

- He says he was in a prison camp and just got released: he comes back just as the war ends, so that means something. He refuses to talk about the details, explaining it away as shell shock (or the most appropriate name for PTSD in the 1940s).

- Red is in disguise and does it well: he bleaches his hair blonde or something, pretends to speak very little English, etc.
