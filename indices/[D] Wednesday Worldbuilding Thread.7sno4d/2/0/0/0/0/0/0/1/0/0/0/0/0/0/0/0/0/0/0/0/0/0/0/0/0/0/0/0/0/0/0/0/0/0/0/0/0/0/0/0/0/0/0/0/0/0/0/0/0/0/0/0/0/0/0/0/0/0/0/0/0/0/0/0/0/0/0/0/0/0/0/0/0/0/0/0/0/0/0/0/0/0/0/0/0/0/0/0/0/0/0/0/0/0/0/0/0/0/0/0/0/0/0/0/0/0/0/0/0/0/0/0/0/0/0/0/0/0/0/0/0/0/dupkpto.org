  In my personal experience, we did some awful stuff to the Aboriginal people as a society, and although that "stopped" some time ago (or admittedly continues to this day in its own way, but the stuff that continues to this day is not on the same scale as "literally taking children from their families and forcing them to speak English and convert to christianity"). But anyway, yeah... society still hasn't caught up, people are still racist, there's still a horrendous life expectancy gap, imprisonment of Aboriginal youth, etc. Similar sorts of problems with African-Americans even after Jim Crow laws are not allowed since ~1965. I can only imagine how much worse having something as /formal/ and /extreme/ as apartheid in the recent past would be.

The formality and the extremism aren't what made Apartheid so difficult to recover from. You've made references to some of the horrible things done to Australian Aboriginals and African slaves in America; and I don't think there's really much of a difference in terms of how horrible those particular things were for the victims (they were /all/ horrible).

I think the worst thing about the scars on our society has to do with the numbers involved. Aboriginals (from a quick Google) make up between three and four percent of the population of Australia. Our "previously disadvantaged" groups make up [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_South_Africa][somewhere over 80% of the population]], which makes it /particularly/ difficult to get everyone up to snuff in terms of education and infrastructure...

  Are there gangs or something that account for the high rate? I assume with a rate that high there's got to be pockets with extremely high murder levels...
#+end_quote

There are gangs in some regions, yes. And there are some particularly violent armed criminals as well (there's one group that were on the news just recently for attacking a police station and shooting some of the officers - news reports said that four people had been arrested 'in connection with' the incident within a day, though whether that's all of that group or not I'm not sure)

  I don't know.... the only other explanation I can think of at the moment is that the nanites have an internal clock, and they sync it based on star/moonlight, and that modulates the sleep time. But.... there's literally no reason a vampire would be designed to work that way, unless their job was to keep a curfew active or something. And then it would be based on Atlantis rather than their home country. And also if you move a vampire but keep him in a box, the nanites will not know when to wake up. So.... throw that in the bin.
#+end_quote

Hmmmm. There must have been some way to install updates.

How abut this - the original vampire was a creature of deadly speed and endurance, which never slept and could take down entire armies.

Then someone else managed to weaken them by making them vulnerable to the Sun. Now the vampires are still creatures of power and hunger - but perhaps not all of them started out as human. (Perhaps there were vampire cows, or bears, or gorilla, or something). Perhaps these were still only of beastial intelligence, and had a bad habit of wandering out at night and getting themselves killed.

So the original creator of the vampires (or someone else with an interest in keeping them going) added the shutdown during daylight - so that they would, near morning, start feeling tired and vulnerable, find a safe place to hide, and then /stay there/ until the next evening, when they spring out and annihilate armies again.

  A baby vampire doesn't use territory: it stays in its guardian's territory, unless it runs away or something. They don't need much blood and can even eat food.
#+end_quote

[[/batshy][]] Well, yeah, but once he's done what the vampire needed him to do during daylight hours, do you /really/ think said vampire would have a reason to /keep/ him around? If he ever needs anything else done during the day, after all, he just needs another useful idiot and six months' advance notice...

  It'd require way too much trust when you can just cut the part of your face you don't like off and regrow it.
#+end_quote

Hmmmm. So, either this is done exclusively by the owner of the Noon Plane herself (so she doesn't need to trust anyone besides her own underlings), or it's one of these ridiculously expensive and dangerous things that particularly wealthy (but not particularly intelligent) vampires do to show off their wealth.

#+begin_quote
  (oh god I'm imagining that now, a vampire who likes ageing and every century or so when she gets too old she has her thrall flay her skin off overday and then it slowly grows back - ugh!)
#+end_quote

...yeah. That is pretty disgusting. But I can certainly imagine a vampire /doing/ it...
