I found the tumblr I got the information from - SSC as luck would have it: [[https://slatestarscratchpad.tumblr.com/post/171006591796/my-favorite-section-of-the-new-south-african]]

So it's the new guy!!!! I hope you're prepared for mandatory ugandan cattle appreciation classes, or something.

  That's not to say that all judges are unbribeable, but in general they know that they're pretty much set for life as long as they don't break the rules and accepting bribes goes against the rules.

Ahhh... so if you accept a bribe your job is gone; whereas the utility company president was chosen because they would accept bribes and with the implication that bribe accepting would be a big part of the job. Fascinating.

  Corruption - at first - looks a lot like someone just forgetting to declare gifts. Once is forgiveable. But if that same politician starts to develop a pattern of repeatedly 'forgetting' to declare gifts... then you have a potentially serious problem, and it's time to hope that that particular politician has no control over any utilities.

Okay - good point - it is a slippery slope. And I'm at a completely different end of it: I had a contractor who I employ to do work for me give me a desk calendar - probably cost less than $2 to print, and they'd send it along with a "happy new year" message. Procedure required me to record that gift on a form and post the calendar back, since we don't accept gifts regardless of value. I followed the procedure but many people would just throw that calendar out. Still, would rather an overbearing gifts procedure than electricity supply problems...

  The ones asking whether or not New Zealand is a real country should go - not because of the dual citizenship, but because people who try to change rules around to their own benefit after the fact are not what you want in a politician.
#+end_quote

the is NZ a real country was a joke / someone considered that under a certain reading of the NZ constitution, all Australians have enough privileges of NZ citizenship for us all to count enough as citizens to not be able to run for office:

  Your minimum wage is way higher than ours. Though I imagine your cost of living is higher, too.
#+end_quote

Looking at the Mugg & Bean menu, your coffee is about the same price (maybe a little cheaper) but your food is.... like, half or a third the price accounting the exchange rate. I think last time I compared prices with South Africa I had an immediate urge to go there on holiday and just eat non-stop

  Because the sun never sets in space, so do they stay 'dead' permanently, or do they simply have to stay 'dead' about as often as a human stays asleep?
#+end_quote

Hmmmmm shit. I was about to say that it depends whether the sun is "in the sky" or whether it's "set", celestially speaking - and that would work if you were on a planet. But yeah, if you're on a spaceship you're probably out of luck. OR NOT...

let's say the sun thing is.... the neutrinos... and the difference in solar neutrinos hitting you before and after sunset is what causes you to sleep (mass of the earth and all that). So... basically you just need to be a /little/ further from the sun.... and you're good forever. Maybe not.

You know what: I don't want to grapple with this shit (okay... I kind of do - but not right now... maybe my next post in the chain)...

  Can a vampire stay active and in motion practically year-round by spending six months at each pole and alternating - alternatively, can a vampire be easily imprisoned by being forced to spend the six months of daylight at each pole?
#+end_quote

I'd say yes, absolutely. A little-known way of killing a vampire is to put her body on an airplane and keep the airplane on the light side of the earth (with judicious use of in-air refuelling, perhaps). The body will rot away and just end up as a brain, heart, and a series of blood vessels kept from rotting by the nanites. Well, actually, this doesn't kill her; once you let her experience nighttime again, she'll start growing back. I'd say it's a great thing to do to torture them except they won't have awareness.... soooo. Might scare them when they wake up - and if you can trick a vampire into going into an airplane it's a good way to incapacitate them so you can deal with them - but long term probably not a solution.
