  [[/pinkiepout][]] Soooooo.... the central, defining feature of your character's romance is the homosexuality?
#+end_quote

[[/sp][]]

Certainly isn't, but it was the thing I could search for on tvtropes that would be guaranteed to be relevant (except only half the gay tropes were relevant IIRC... so maybe I should have done my other idea of "randomly" opening 5-10 tabs)

  [[/flutterkay][]] So, if an entire excerpt is made entirely of placeholders, then...

[[/kdashangry][]] Very funny

  But let's see what else it's possible to get from that room.

  [[/sp][]]

  Swords are an elegant weapon, not as clumsy and random as a blaster.
#+end_quote

[[/fluttereyebrow][]] The blasters that are clearly littering the countryside in 1944? But no, I figure a vampire is more readily hurt by a sword than by a gun, since you can dismember them that way.

  Clearly, Paola used to be an officer in the Roman army (I think officers around the time of the World Wars would still traditionally wear swords? Not sure.)
#+end_quote

[[/spoiledshock][]] A /woman/? Who looks scarcely nineteen at that? No, it must be her /father/ who was in the army. She probably only inherited the place after he died a heroic death in battle.

[[/sp][]]

#+begin_quote
  [[/discordbox][]] Those locked boxes could contain /anything/. War memorabilia? Old letters? Military secrets?

  [[/sp][]]
#+end_quote

[[/ksilverbeam][]] Or just the /valuables/ left in storage by hotel guests. After all, you can't expect your discerning clientele to leave certain things in the /cloakroom/. I mean, /really/?

[[/sp][]]

#+begin_quote
  [[/ninjapie][]] And then, of course, there's that giant window without even an attempt to create fake blackout curtains. Wasn't it the law in Rome during war that all windows had to have blackout curtains, so as not to provide a target for passing bombers? If she doesn't even /pretend/ to be following that law, then she clearly /must/ have highly-placed contacts in the legal system, willing to turn a blind eye.
#+end_quote

[[/sp][]]

[[/murcasalute][]] Or she's... very much NOT the patriotic sort. Maybe on account of her father dying in that war? I wonder if blackout curtains were a thing in Rome: if it was an open city, you wouldn't expect the Allies to bomb it. If I cared more I'd use my rudimentary Italian bootstrapped by my good French and go into google.it and see if I could find any info about that sort of thing - it's how I managed to work out what a night porter with a murky might get paid (40% of the median wage, rounded down to a round number, if I recall...)
