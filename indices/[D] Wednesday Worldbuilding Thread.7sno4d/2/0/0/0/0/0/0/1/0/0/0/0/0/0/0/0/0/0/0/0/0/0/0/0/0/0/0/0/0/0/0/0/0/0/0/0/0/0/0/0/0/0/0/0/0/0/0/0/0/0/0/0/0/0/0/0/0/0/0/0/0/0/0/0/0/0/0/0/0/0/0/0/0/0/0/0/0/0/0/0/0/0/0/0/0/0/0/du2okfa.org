  Ooooh, worse, he's probably getting a network of /jannissaries/ together. Not a single one of them would ever betray their own vampire master, of course, but he can probably get a lot of info by asking any of them to betray his or her master's /enemies/... which allows him to develop quite a spy network right under the noses of the other vampires.

... I'm imagining a janissary network kind of like a [[https://www.shmoop.com/the-moon-is-a-harsh-mistress/line-marriage-symbol.html][line marriage]] - they keep on recruiting "junior janissaries" they meet into it, so once a vampire's janissaries are in the "clan", they keep on recruiting one another and any new additions. So it's kind of like a virus: once one of your janissaries has it, they'll all get it sooner or later.

Of course, vampires would know about it, so it would have to operate under a cosmo-like system with tips like "10 things your vampire wants you to wear to your next feeding! 23 vampires tell you what they want from you but are afraid you would balk at!" nestled in the covert spy network - and each vampire thinking they are getting more information /out/ of the janissary network than they are leaking.

Or vampires just periodically smoke all their janissaries and start again - and an enemy can manipulate them into doing that at a disadvantageous time.

  [Vampires wonder] Could it possibly be that [Erlis] /genuinely/ cares about these humans? Surely not, he's just putting on an act to get the jannissaries to talk!
#+end_quote

Nah, I don't think Erlis would let the janissary network get back to him: as in, he wouldn't use it for his own benefit. Some will suspect it's him but once Erlis gets a few janissaries at a convocation to talk to one another - and the janissaries are only /barely/ complicit sometimes anyway - the network is self-propagating for the most part...

  Personal reasons and maybe he decides he should be listening in to all these rumours that pass Erlis' ears as well. The jannissary spy network could well be a tempting part of the aforementioned thin end of the wedge; between that, modern technology, and the occasional mage, vampires are certainly going to have reason to take humans pretty seriously.
#+end_quote

Exactly! It's all coming together... I'm surprised Erlis doesn't have designs on "cashing in" on his success so to speak. But maybe a hundred and fifty years after he started the plan he might change his mind.

  They'll have to be careful. The sun never sets in space...

Just make sure you're not in the Sol system and you're golden - - - errr, platinum !

  The general King/Duchess dynamic is generally one wherein the King can do this and the Duchess can do practically nothing to stop him; but a lot of kings refrained on the basis that it would be rude to rub the Duchess' nose in just how much lower on the social totem pole she is. (Other, less popular kings would have done this sort of thing all the time, of course. Rude or not, it's good to be in charge).

Plus, if your Dukes/Duchesses aren't fond of you, they might revolt and cede their territories to a neighbouring Queen/King. It would be a pity if you woke up one evening with 12 duchies and by the time the sun rose you had only two, and that smug snake in the next town over had some prize spots in your territory. Sure, there'd be a war, and maybe you'd make an example of one or two of the Dukes... but you'd be hard pressed to regain /all/ that territory after such a fantastic coup.
