  That's a lot of land, and sparsely populated, for a disease to spread around. Especially for a series of nomadic tribes who didn't engage in a lot of formalised trade.
#+end_quote

Yeah, and I'm not trying to suggest it would happen /quickly/.

[[/scootaplease][]] However, I am taking the Wikipedia-quoted figure of a 90% drop in Aboriginal population to be, at the very least, a /plausible/ estimate. Bear in mind, that's over a time period of over a century, so there's plenty of time for diseases to wander across even a large sparsely-populated desert.

Now, it would make sense that the casualties were heavier - possibly even eventually 100% - where the colonists landed. And it's reasonable to conclude that they were pretty near zero on the opposite end of the country for the first few years after the colonists landed. But fifty, sixty years down the line, when the new diseases start hitting? /Then/ the vampires far from the colonists are going to really start to feel the pain.

  I think you're overestimating how much food a vampire needs; 12 humans, eaten from sustainably, is enough to feed one vampire. So a small tribe of 100 would be plenty.
#+end_quote

And if that tribe of 100 gets hit by something that kills 90% of them, then the vampire is in trouble. Not immediately, not something he can't try to get out of by finding more humans, but enough trouble to stir him to /some/ sort of action.

It only gets worse if that tribe had previously supported two vampires.

  ... it looks like if you navigated well, you'd be able to keep to the "shallow" parts of the ocean and avoid all the pressure issue. So I guess vampires can travel between the place... Eyeballing the chart and putting it into the depth calculator we're looking at 2.6k PSI to get around the place.
#+end_quote

So, navigating becomes important - or, failing, that, very carefully picking your choice of rock. (After all, if your rock is only so heavy, it'll only pull you down to a certain depth, at which point you can then swim along underwater - safe from pressure, but vulnerable to getting knocked off-course by undersea currents).

Here's another question - previously, we'd established that vampires can regrow limbs be absorbing the requisite carbon/oxygen/hydrogen/nitrogen from the surrounding air. Does this still work at all underwater? Or do undersea vampires only heal if they can find a source of these elements (e.g. eating a passing fish)?

#+begin_quote
  True. Hm. I'm two minds about this. I still feel scion is like an "alpha kid" name, for like Daddy's Favourite
#+end_quote

[[/twishrug][]] Fair enough.

  True, true. I think it probably depends on the vampire. When (spoiler alert) William turns Red, he might call him a scion (... actually, he wouldn't; although they're in love, William doesn't consider Red a "worthy successor" in the sense of being called a scion; Red lacks ambition).
#+end_quote

[[/twiponder][]] Ah - that makes sense. William turns Red because he thinks that Red is worthy to be turned - but this is /different/ from thinking that Red is worthy to manage William's estates.

And the same can apply to other vampires, then.

  ...actually, next month's chapter has the first use of janissary, and I'm wondering if it's easily guessable what it means from context. But I hate it when characters in books talk in a contrived way so the reader learns what the words mean. And I also hate it when the narrator "talks down" to you and says something like "he replied, referring to the humans who often became addicted to the bliss of the act of being fed upon".
#+end_quote

...I think you handled that fairly well in the excerpt, though testing it on someone who doesn't know what the term means is a good idea.

To point to specifics, these are a few of the things that I think you did right:

- No mention of the term until someone (William) used it in speech. Thus, we know that the person he fed from was a "middle-aged lady".
- First mention of the term referenced a recent-past incident, which has just been described without that term. Thus, we can instantly see that "jannissary", in this case, refers to the middle-aged lady; moreover, we can see that it is a thing which can be owned, and that this particular one is not William's.

In fairly short order, we also find out that a janissary is something that a person can be made into (but Red isn't yet) and can be kept sustainably (William doesn't, but considers it easy enough to replace them as he lives in a large city).

Now, there are a number of things about them that are still unclear; for example, you never explicitly say /how/ a person is turned into a janissary, or what the significance of such is. But this is not the place for those details, in any case. No, the place for those nitty-gritty little details is when Red hears the term and asks William what it means - or perhaps he hears the term, guesses incorrectly what it means (it wouldn't be hard for him to end up thinking 'concubine') and confronts William.

Your potential replacement opening paragraph, on the other hand, /is/ too heavy-handed, bludgeoning the reader over the head with the definition. I would advise against making that particular change.

As for the rest of the excerpt; the conversation is good, hinting at a few things here and there (like William's reputation of killing people). I'm going to assume that you're properly engaging the rest of the senses elsewhere in the chapter (this excerpt is small enough - and dialogue-heavy enough - that I wouldn't expect too much descriptiveness in it).
