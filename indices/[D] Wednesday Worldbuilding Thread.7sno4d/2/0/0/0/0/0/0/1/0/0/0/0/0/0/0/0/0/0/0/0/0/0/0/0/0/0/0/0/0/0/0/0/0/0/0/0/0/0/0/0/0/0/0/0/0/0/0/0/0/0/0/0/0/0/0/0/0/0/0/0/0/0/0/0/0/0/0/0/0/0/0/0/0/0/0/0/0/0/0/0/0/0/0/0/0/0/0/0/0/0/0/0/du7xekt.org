  As if they wouldn't just make a fake ID for the very purpose (or borrow a janissary's identity)

Oh, sure, they could do that. But if another vampire is introduced to that janissary, then he's going to figure out that the attached vampire now knows ancient Mongolian, and that's a secret worth keeping as long as said vampire continues to write his correspondence in ancient Mongolian...

It's not a matter of hiding themselves from humans. It's a matter of hiding the languages they know from vampires who might use those languages in front of them.

  The emphasis makes me wonder whether you're asking if it's possible to speak two languages simultaneously in a sort of... doublespeak.

There was a radio advert /wat het dit baie goed gedoen/ a few years back. /Hulle het geadverteer vir/ a hybrid car, and they kept switching /vanaf Engels na Afrikaans en terug/ throughout the entire ad to help push the 'hybrid' theme. It was only possible because /baie mense hier praat altwee taale/ and often well enough that if you weren't paying attention /miskien sal jy dit nie onmiddelik sien nie/. You might have to play fast and loose with /die reels van wordorder/ and pay close attention to where your transitions are /maar dit kan gedoen word/ without too much trouble.

[[/twiwink][]] And since you've just said that you /don't/ speak Afrikaans, I should translate about half of that paragraph.

It was only possible because /many people here speak both languages/ and often well enough that if you weren't paying attention /maybe you wouldn't immediately notice/. You might have to play fast and loose with /the rules of word order/ and pay close attention to where your transitions are /but it can be done/ without too much trouble.

  I'm only fluent in English but I speak French well enough to get by

Good, then you're familiar with the sort of trouble you can get in when you use one language's words with another language's grammar and can believably write a scene in which one character is only barely proficient in the language being used.
