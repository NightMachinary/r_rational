/Great/ so now Vampires speak this strange patchwork and every now and then Red catches a snatch - just a word here or there where William or one of the other vampires happens to mix English in just in case a secret listener doesn't know that. (I imagine in such a situation English would be in a low rotation: 1/1000 words or something)

/William spoke incomprehensibly, but with a start Red thought he heard something./

/"William, dear, did you just say... refrigerator?"/

/"No, darling, you misheard...."/

Yeah, English, French, Italian and Esperanto are all really similar. Thai is also SVO, actually, though it tends to just completely do away with pronouns (there /are/ pronouns, but in practise people tend to use names instead of the he/she equivalent). It also has a "noun class" thing where instead of two noun genders there's like 50+, but it /tends to be/ in more of a "loaf of bread" and "head of cattle" sort of thing - where the classes only come up when you're counting - rather than a gender thing that has to agree.

French and Italian are a bit different from English because of the way they handle verbs, but they're both very, very close to each other in that regard. French has some more weirdness with verbs (including a /whole tense/ that is so rare that most students in France don't even learn about formally in school!).

French and Italian both have gender like German does; unlike german it doesn't have a neuter though.

Esperanto, of course, doesn't have gender (though you can specify something as female - male is the default, of course - by adding -in- to the end of the word. So /avo/ means grandfather, /avino/ means grandmother, and the prefix ge- can be added to make it gender neutral, so /geavo/ means grandparent). It /does/ have an affix (-n) to mark the /object/ of the sentence, so you can be free with word order, though in practise it's SVO.

So, to illustrate:

Reĉjo trinkas la vinon: Red drinks the wine

Reĉjo la vinon trinkas: Red drinks the wine

La vinon trinkas Reĉjo: Red drinks the wine

La vinon Reĉjo trinkas: Red drinks the wine

Apparently it's very useful for poetry.

(Reĉjo is one way of converting the name Red into Esperanto, since all names should end with -o or -a; since Red is a nickname I gave him a familiar masculine affix. The Esperanto name would be pronounced "Rechyo"...)
