  I mean, sure, you could take two bombs, but there's only one set of bomb bay doors and when you open them everything falls out at once...

So, take two bombers ;). Anyway, like you said, there's more than one way to kill a vampire!

  I know it's not what William meant, but that phrase almost makes it sound like he's afraid of a photo of him kissing Red appearing in the local paper.

Well, replace "local paper" with "vampire rumour mill", and that's exactly what he's concerned about: he thinks it's going to /become/ fashionable, but right now it's shameful. He wants to be on the forefront of the new fashion / was kind of emotionally moved by the opera he saw at he beginning of the story.

  I don't think it's possible to make it come across clearly in that dialogue-only section without revealing a number of things to the elderly priest that William will not want to spell out

Yeah, we'll call it "mysterious" and "artistic" :)

  I know that it applies to out-of-wedlock sex. I have no idea whether or not the average person knows that.

Oh well, people will just have to learn / expand their horizons and/or be confused. :P
