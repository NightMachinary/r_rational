  He puts William in touch with Elodia
#+end_quote

All seems well up to here. Presumably Elodia and William have more or less compatible personalities.

#+begin_quote
  William then, after training a PERFECTLY GOOD HUMAN improperly, declares war on Elodia rather than letting her just kill that human
#+end_quote

Ooooooooh dear. Clearly William needs to do something very nice for Cassius at this point, or else Cassius will join Elodia's side in the war (mainly to improve relations with Elodia via the use of a common enemy).

William couldn't possibly be taking his promise to 'be careful' with this particular human /that/ seriously, could he?

#+begin_quote
  This entire 60 years he is using that human that he only got because Cassius was willing to give to him, after causing all that damn trouble
#+end_quote

To be fair, William got that human /before/ causing all this trouble. (He certainly wouldn't have got it after).

#+begin_quote
  Finally, but before Cassius' breeding programme reveals William's deception, Cassius has another child who needs to be kept out of the way in Australia for a few decades and arranges for her to be sent down to Australia for William to keep an eye on
#+end_quote

Presumably, this implies that relations with William at this time are better than relations with Elodia (Junior I must have /seriously/ annoyed her. Or perhaps they had an unrelated disagreement at the same time. Either way, William sounds like he's been working on repairing the split between them - and, of course, Cassius doesn't know what happened to Junior I yet).

#+begin_quote
  The vampire hunters that William has left alive FOR NO DISCERNABLE REASON kill his child
#+end_quote

Well, now, that is /clearly/ William's fault. If he's going to leave /vampire hunters/ of all things alive, then he must surely bear responsibility for any hunting they do - in fact, it's prudent to assume he intended it, specifically (either that or he's a complete incompetant who can't control his own territory).

#+begin_quote
  she kicks his arse because Cassius doesn't realise she's an android until it's too late, so Cassius dies(? not sure if I want him to die but I think if I don't do that he's gonna kill William and sorry Cassius William is the protag not you)
#+end_quote

Yeah, at this point I think Cassius' options are either 'die' or 'come back in the sequel, swearing revenge'.

At some point during their battle, though, Cassius probably needs to successfully stake her through the heart - and then get quite upset when that doesn't work as expected.
