Thanks for the analysis! I think you're right about the towel thing, and I probably /should/ think more about bits - gwern's analysis of death note anonymity really comes into the forefront of my mind here. I will simplify the implied dialogue, though I should say that context means a lot here: William is temporarily in town, Cassius owns a hotel William is staying at, Cassius had Red (the love interest) hired because of his random "communicates in vampire language" quirk, and Cassius probably knows that William would see a lot of Red due to the timing of Red's shifts. (Truthfully, Cassius probably hired Red and put him at work as the night porter because some vampire guest would be interested in him sometime and would then owe him a favour for poaching his territory: so this situation worked out well for him)

#+begin_quote
  I don't believe you
#+end_quote

The word/concept 'disbelief' would work fine for these four (five?) words; even if we don't allow gestures, orientation, etc to have meaning, it's clear from context that Cassius would not communicate that William doesn't believe him, but rather that he doesn't believe William. I mean, an English speaker can roll their eyes, or sigh a particular way and communicate the same thing.

Really, this is communicated by the "he laughed again" part, before he even picks up the towel.

#+begin_quote
  You are aware of your reputation.
#+end_quote

This is a complex thought compared with the above and is likely what is communicated by picking it up. Really, all that needs to be communicated for William to 'get it' is the concept of reputation and perhaps it being directed to him (especially in context - later in the novel, Cassius quips that the janissary William is feeding from "has at least a pint of blood left in her", so he needn't stop eating yet). Reputation is very important to vampires so it makes sense that they'd be able to communicate it with their system.

#+begin_quote
  You don't remember. They are impossible.
#+end_quote

THIS is the most complex part, and to explain its communication I have just written "he elaborated with some careful folds". Honestly, I don't think it's necessary Cassius adds this at all; William decides having a human lover will be good for his reputation because vampires will start respecting the huge amount of non-useful work it takes to cultivate one. Peacock tail style; if he can maintain a huge territory and keep all the conflicts smoothed between the vampires who live there, he must be a particularly good diplomat.

Anyway, I've gone through and shortened the "dialogue" in that section. Really, the most egregious example is "folds in a towel" asking "Do you know where I might get information about nearby Americans" so I elaborated a bit and reduced the sentence length:

#+begin_quote
  William folded a striped towel. Do you have information about nearby Americans? Asked the angles of the creases and the minor movements of his fingertips.
#+end_quote

* I know by distilling things down like this, we get something that is not "ordinary english" and so has more entropy than 10 bits per word.
