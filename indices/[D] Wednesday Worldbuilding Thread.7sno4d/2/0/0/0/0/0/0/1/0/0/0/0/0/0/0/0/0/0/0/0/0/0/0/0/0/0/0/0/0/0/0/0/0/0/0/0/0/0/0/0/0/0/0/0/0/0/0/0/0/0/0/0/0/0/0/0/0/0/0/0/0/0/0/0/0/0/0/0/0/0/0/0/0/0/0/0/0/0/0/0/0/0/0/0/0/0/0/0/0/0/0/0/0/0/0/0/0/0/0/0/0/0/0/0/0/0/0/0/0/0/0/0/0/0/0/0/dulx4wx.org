  So it's the new guy!!!! I hope you're prepared for mandatory ugandan cattle appreciation classes, or something.
#+end_quote

Huh.

...taking a closer look at the story, it looks like he didn't precisely /break/ the rules, but rather found a loophole (the rules prevented him from importing cattle from Uganda due to disease concerns, so he imported cattle embryos from Kenya instead and simply had them quarantined a while). Which isn't /great/... but it is a good deal less worrying than it could have been.

  Ahhh... so if you accept a bribe your job is gone; whereas the utility company president was chosen because they would accept bribes and with the implication that bribe accepting would be a big part of the job. Fascinating.
#+end_quote

That's it in a nutshell, yes. Isn't politics fascinating?

And now, as we speak, the judges are all still doing pretty well and judging away in court cases, plus if they convict someone of taking a bribe they can fine the recipient the amount of the bribe. Spent it on luxury cars already? Too bad! Pay it back! (I think they might be able to add punitive damages on top of that, if they're really feeling vindictive).

They can and moreover /have/ recently done so.

  Okay - good point - it is a slippery slope. And I'm at a completely different end of it: I had a contractor who I employ to do work for me give me a desk calendar - probably cost less than $2 to print, and they'd send it along with a "happy new year" message. Procedure required me to record that gift on a form and post the calendar back, since we don't accept gifts regardless of value. I followed the procedure but many people would just throw that calendar out. Still, would rather an overbearing gifts procedure than electricity supply problems...

[[/flutteryay][]] Yay for following procedure!

  the is NZ a real country was a joke / someone considered that under a certain reading of the NZ constitution, all Australians have enough privileges of NZ citizenship for us all to count enough as citizens to not be able to run for office:
#+end_quote

[[/flutterkay][]] Oooooooh. Alright. That was a lawyer making a joke, not a politician seriously trying to avoid the rules.

That's different, then. No-one's trying to dodge the consequences of their own actions.

  Looking at the Mugg & Bean menu, your coffee is about the same price (maybe a little cheaper)
#+end_quote

Bear in mind, the price on that bottomless coffee isn't just for one cup. That includes all the refills you can drink. And Mugg & Bean isn't a /cheap/ restaurant.

But yeah, exchange rates are (in general) great for tourists visiting here, but horrible for tourists from here visiting other places.

  let's say the sun thing is.... the neutrinos... and the difference in solar neutrinos hitting you before and after sunset is what causes you to sleep (mass of the earth and all that). So... basically you just need to be a little further from the sun.... and you're good forever. Maybe not.

[[/twiponder][]] Or figure out some sort of neutrino shield.

  A little-known way of killing a vampire is to put her body on an airplane and keep the airplane on the light side of the earth (with judicious use of in-air refuelling, perhaps)
#+end_quote

You don't /have/ to use in-air refuelling if your plane is fast enough. You just land at ten in the morning and make sure you're fuelled up before two in the afternoon.

...it would still be massively expensive, mind you. Far cheaper to just dump out the body on a nice, sunny afternoon. Unless you plan on needing that particular vampire later for some reason, of course.

But there's also the other option to consider - the vampire who spends all his time at the poles (or in aeroplanes racing the midnight) in order to stay awake forever.
