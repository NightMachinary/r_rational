  Yeah, you end up with a he said she said and I think he'd be believed over her due to their relative status levels. She's better off spreading bad rumours about him (which she also does following the war).

Eh, fair enough. It never went that far, anyhow; it turned out easier than expected to goad William into war.

  Doesn't turn out that way, but William owed him a favour at least. And hey, if Cassius looks better compared to William, that's a win for Cassius. I imagine they're of similar ages and status.

[[/flutterbat][]] That's the nice thing about win-win situations - even when your /most/ preferred outcome doesn't happen, you still win!

  Then again: vampirism has a ~50% failure rate, so maybe a transhumanist wouldn't take that until they'd lived a certain period of time.

Hmmmmm... at what point is taking a 50% chance on immortality worth it?

Tricky. Your expected number of years to live if you take the offer is half of forever (and half times infinity is still infinity). But for every two years you wait before taking the offer, your expected lifespan goes up by about a year (minus a factor to take into account the odds of accident during that year).

I guess it depends on the transhumanist.
