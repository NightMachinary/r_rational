  Adding 'Bane of Janissaries' or something to represent his well-known habit of damaging any humans assigned to his care might be appropriate.
#+end_quote

I'm going to have to think on it: my first thought was to agree wholeheartedly that it was perfect, but the more I think about it, the more I think that vampires wouldn't include "the bane of janissaries" because it implies that janissaries themselves are important - like, people don't like William's habit not because they think the humans are moral subjects but because it's /inconvenient/ to replace janissaries.

So I need to riff off /that/ concept: "the bad houseguest" is more the vibe we're going for. I'll think it over. If I go with something like "the inconsiderate one", for example, it doesn't tell the reader that William's janissary reputation is so entrenched it's gotten glommed onto his name, so I need to pick something that is explicit whilst still appealling to vampire sensibilities. "The thinner of the herd" might work, but that implies more genocide and less lack of self control. Hm.

  (if Rome? There has to be a story behind a title like that).

[[/twiblush][]] Yes a typo...

  I think a prankster would take care to accumulate a bunch of titles that refer to particularly spectacular pranks. "Greaser of Pigs", for example

  "Thief of Dignity" is also a good title for a prankster-type character.
#+end_quote

Good point - more specificity! I love thief of dignity so I will have to put that in.

#+begin_quote
  (I imagine the 'iron toe' title also fits vaguely in this category).
#+end_quote

I just wanted something inscrutable when I plonked that in: "the noodle incident" and all that.

Also I'm going to chuck a reference to Cassius being a protective parent in there since most of the conflict comes from him doing that.

So we get this:

God-king Cassius of the Eternal City, respected advisor of Magnus, long-awaited child of Tibillus, he who listens with a patient ear, the pranker of the third council, the mother octopus, the one with the iron toe, theif of dignity, keeper of the text

... octopodes apparently are supremely good parents...

#+begin_quote
  "He of the Long Memory" is also vaguely worrying in a known prankster (especially combined with the 'patient ear' title).
#+end_quote

Yeah, I wanted to get a lot of contradictions in the titles: I figure vampires live so long that they effectively get to /be/ dozens of different people.

#+begin_quote
  Erlis and Elodia might have one or more titles that are just plain humiliating to reinforce their place at the bottom of the totem pole - titles that Ursula finds amusing, so the titles stay. Elodia, for example, might be "Footstool of [more powerful vampire]", while Erlis might even be demoted as far as "Bootlicker of X"
#+end_quote

Very good point. I've added "lover of men" to Erlis's title because it's particularly appropriate: Erlis is the token "vegetarian" vampire who sees humans as moral subjects, but other vampires look down on such things, while Erlis sees it as a badge of honour. Sort of like a person who got Jews out of Germany in WW2 would kind of not mind being called a "jew-lover" even if it was /not/ a compliment. (Great I just compared my story to the holocaust, hatemail incoming).

I love the word 'footstool' in titles too so I have made Elodia the footstool of Mpenoi, and put it in between two loftier accolades: "Doge Elodia De Ferrari, the reclaimer of Corsica, the scourge of the three rivers, footstool of Mpenoi, the destroyer of Norina, she who binds her enemies"

The big problem is I haven't got scenes where I put the vampire titles in there, so these are all a freezeframe bonus as it stands. I actually inserted them into a small scene I just wrote, which is why I was thinking about them, but I don't think they feel natural the way I used them. I can get Elodia's in by modifying a ritual scene to have Red and Lucia introduce their vampire patrons by name, I suppose.

“Thank you for taking the trip to see me, your majesty.” William bowed.

“It's a pleasure. What did you want, your majesty?” Cassius bowed in return, and moved to sit on the bare earth, leaning against a tree.

William hesitated, moving to sit cross-legged about three feet in front of Cassius. “I am nervous about the war.”

“You were stupid to start it.”

“She's a duchess. She is no challenge.” William replied automatically.

“Then why are you nervous?”

“She wants to write operas, poetry, music. You know that creativity is not one of my virtues.” William muttered.

“She tells me you want to have an axe-fight. You know she's so much younger than you that it wouldn't be fair.”

“Wars aren't fair. Children should know that before they challenge their elders.”

“You challenged her.”

“She should have relented.”

“She should have relented?” Cassius laughed.

“Yes.”

“Were you taking me too seriously? When I told you to be careful with that human of mine?”

“The fact that I have a reputation for carelessness is a concern, yes.”

“What you're doing is coming across a lot more controversial than having poor self-control at dinnertime.” Cassius paused. “You must know that if you cannot agree on how to fight, then as Elodia's king I will choose for both you. I will try to be fair to you, but I will not send one of my subjects on a war she has no hope of winning. I'm worried you will lose.”

“I suppose I shall have to do my best.”

“You can still stop this. She'll take the human's head and a duchy.”

William paused, considering this. “Any duchy?”

“It would need to be a good one. Better than the one you gave me for the human.”

“So I'll be out two duchies and not even get to keep the human.”

“Better to lose two duchies than a war.”

“That's easy for you to say. You have dozens! I only have four.”

“A small price to pay to avoid a war.” Cassius paused. “I say this to you as a friend, King William, most high and most excellent King by the grace of God, conqueror of New Holland, uniter of the five lands, soother of warring clans: people are already speculating that your relationship with that human was inappropriate. I strongly suggest that you kill the human, before the rumour takes root.”

“I don't think I shall be doing that, God-king Cassius of the Eternal City, respected advisor of Magnus, long-awaited child of Tibillus, he who listens with a patient ear, the pranker of the third council, the one with the iron toe, keeper of the text.” William muttered. “Thank you all the same, but I believe that time will be on my side.”

Cassius laughed. “Suit yourself, your majesty.”

The above is poorly described I know and I'm not sure where to put them right now they're in a clearing? But maybe a cafe would be better? This is a secret meeting so probably a clearing. They travelled there transformed as bats so I kind of imagine them sitting in a tree, but that's kind of ridiculous....
