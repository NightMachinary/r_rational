  A mere human, with a match, against a strong and noble vampire?

/cough/ who is asleep during the day and completely defenseless...

I didn't nail down details for how William kills Junior1 though now I come to think of it: probably he overpowers J1 in single combat and then torches the house to make it look like an accident.

#+begin_quote
  Elodia's using this incident to blackmail William, isn't she?
#+end_quote

Genius! Almost certainly! She gets the benefit of killing J1, the benefit of W's reputation going to shit, and the benefit of having huge amounts of dirt on W - because even though she ordered the hit, W went through with it for really, really low-status reasons and instead of reporting her murderous desires to Cassius and getting a gold star, William decided to commit murder, so if anything he's /more/ culpable than Elodia is - especially because he knows better.

#+begin_quote
  Or perhaps she has another enemy who would profit more from William's death than she would...
#+end_quote

Probably also true, a major vampire in William's area could be a rival of hers of similar age and would be, at least temporarily, in charge of that territory. She wouldn't want /that/ status going to that worm /before her/.

#+begin_quote
  Mutual blackmail may well be a large part of vampire politics.
#+end_quote

Likely is. I imagine the closest friends become so because they can blackmail each other several times over, mutually assured destruction style, and just realise since they can't ever betray each other that they can actually fully trust each other. It'd be.... hard to get your head around.
