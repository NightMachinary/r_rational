  ... I wasn't thinking about it like that but you touch on an interesting point here: vampires probably can't fall asleep without the sunrise. I'm imagining far-future vampires when Sol is nova paying mages to enchant the stars they live around
#+end_quote

They don't /need/ to enchant an entire star for that. Far easier to enchant a teddy bear, an alarm clock, a pillow, or something, which gives a good few hours' sleep every time it's activated (squeezed, set, punched, however the spell is arranged...)

  This is probably the most tenuous part as... well, look at the history of religion; cults can hold on until they have millions of worshippers.
#+end_quote

Can. Doesn't mean "will". Besides, this cult already lasted a few hundred years...

  (She'll move them over to the cave in a century or so, after the cult has truly begun to accept her unageing nature and her divine powers: of course, she'll plant just enough evidence that she is her own daughter or something so the nonbelieving public doesn't get suspicious.)

That's her plan, at the moment she leaves her cave, yes. It's possible that it'll work - it's also possible that she finds something she really likes ("so, tell me more about these 'video games'"...) and either upgrades her lair or even delays founding her new cult a little - or, not knowing enough to be cautious of discovery, she ends up with her 'divine powers' all over the Internet, and thus attracting a number of /surprisingly/ well-informed vampire hunters (who are, in turn, not as ready as the should be for a vampire of her age and power)...
