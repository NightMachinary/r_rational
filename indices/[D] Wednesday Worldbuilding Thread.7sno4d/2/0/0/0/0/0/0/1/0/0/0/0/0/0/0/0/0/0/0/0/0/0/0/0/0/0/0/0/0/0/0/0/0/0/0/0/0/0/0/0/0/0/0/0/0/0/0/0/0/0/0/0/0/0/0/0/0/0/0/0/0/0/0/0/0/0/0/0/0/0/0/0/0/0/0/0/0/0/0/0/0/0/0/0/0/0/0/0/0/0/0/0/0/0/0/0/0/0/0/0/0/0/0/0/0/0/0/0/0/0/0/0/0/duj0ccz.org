  Jacob Zuma

Is he the one who really likes that one type of cow and dodged the rules so he could import and start breeding them? Or is that the new guy?

  We have an excellent and very unbribable court system
#+end_quote

What makes the courts so unbribable and why do the utility companies and pollies lack it?

#+begin_quote
  it looks like the people involved are going to face legal consequences for their actions.

:D

  load-shedding was quite democratic in its effects
#+end_quote

That's a surprise; our power outages are sometimes targeted, so areas near hospitals won't lose power (thankfully) but this also extends to places where politicians live... apparently. This might all be rumour.

  Declaring those things are important. Those rules are in place for a reason.

Oh yeah; she did the wrong thing, absolutely, but she's not engaged in shifty business to deny people electricity is more what I was getting at...

#+begin_quote
  Your politicians actually resign when they're caught breaking the rules?
#+end_quote

Some of them did; others are challenging the rule / saying they should be able to keep their position because they don't use their NZ citizenship / is NZ a real country anyway?

  There are waitstaff who take your order, bring food and refills for the bottomless coffee, and bring you a bill at the end.
#+end_quote

Ahhh. That's a cultural difference, probably... table service means restaurant but everything else about the place screams cafe. So... I'd find that really weird, to go to a place like that for breakfast and have someone wait on me - someone bringing you food yes, but not the full "table service" experience. I'd imagine if Mugg & Bean franchised to Australia they'd ditch the waitstaff (no doubt it'd save a lot of money as our minimum wage is $20 AUD / hr (185 rand / hr) - though for high schoolers it can go as low as half that).

  ...it'll make that scene feel even more disgusting.

  Which is exactly what you're going for.
#+end_quote

I don't even know what I was going for; it was a plot bunny... it was like... if Red got used to the way a vampire is when it's asleep, then a sleeping human would be super weird.

Because... I like the idea of a vampire becoming a corpse during the day: so they effectively "die" at sunrise, and their body slowly grows cold and stiff with rigor mortis, and the blood pools on their back, staining their skin... And then when they wake up at sunset, their body animates again, if they choose to they run their heating cells, pump their blood, etc. I'm sure there's vampires who are beyond caring and just walk around with a livor mortis pattern on their back and their skin pale, unbreathing - or maybe it was in fashion a while, to show you had no need to integrate with humans? Anyway...
