  I knew there was another word for orphan that I missed!

[[/twiwink][]] This is what thesauri are for.

  I also realised that cuckoo means "crazy" and is not the connotation I wanted to go for....
#+end_quote

[[/twiponder][]] Depends, really. If a sufficiently powerful vampire (i.e. Ursula or similar tier) thinks it's funny, then I think any title will stick, no matter how unfortunate the connotations. Of course, as soon as Ursula starts to feel that the joke is wearing thin, the title with vanish or be replaced quite rapidly.

  OK here we go, bleeding heart could work:
#+end_quote

[[/twibeam][]] Perfect!

Especially when we consider that these are /vampires/ we're talking about, and so blood has extra connotations to them. The bleeding heart isn't just overly compassionate - the connotation suggests an image of a vampire /giving blood/ */back/* /to humans/ - which other vampires will presumably see as a little perverse, the sort of thing that makes other vampires give poor Erlis a very wide berth, to the point where he's practically forced to talk to the jannissaries because it's often choice between them or the coat rack. (This, of course, ensures that he can never get rid of the bleeding heart title...).

  I was thinking it might be something they put on their envelopes, but they wouldn't put them in human-readable format.
#+end_quote

Perhaps they address letters by smell, with delicate scents and perfumes that not one human nose in a thousand can tell apart... and then have the full title written on the top of the paper inside, in scripts unknown to modern archaeology.

  Anyone can start a rumour: but I get your point. They needn't be so paranoid.
#+end_quote

A Duchess who starts a rumour about Kings that they don't want started tends to get squashed, quickly. Even if she thinks she can take William, that's only possible with Cassius' tacit support; if she does the first little thing that even might annoy Cassius, then she'll find her war with King William suddenly taking an extremely nasty turn and I'm sure she's politically aware enough to know that. If she annoys Cassius /enough/, then 'extremely nasty' might even end up 'lethal' (if Cassius and William can come to an agreement first about who gets her stuff and/or any opportunity to replace her).

So, even if she did know exactly what they were doing, why would she bother to start a rumour?
