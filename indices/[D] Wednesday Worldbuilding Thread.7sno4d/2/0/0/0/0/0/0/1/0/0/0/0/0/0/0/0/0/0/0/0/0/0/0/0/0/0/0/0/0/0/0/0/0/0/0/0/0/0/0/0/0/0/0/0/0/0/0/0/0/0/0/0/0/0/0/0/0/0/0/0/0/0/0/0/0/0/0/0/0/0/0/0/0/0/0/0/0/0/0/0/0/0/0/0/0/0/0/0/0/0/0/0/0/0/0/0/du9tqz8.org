  just a word here or there

If you're mixing SOV and SVO languages (like Afrikaans/English) then you can't just swap out the occasional word; you pretty much have to swap out entire clauses to avoid making a mess of the grammar in at least /one/ of the languages involved. I kind of imagine they'd leave English mostly out of the rotation if Red is right there, but sometimes other languages loan words from English (or, more likely, English loans words from other languages and refuses to give them back).

#+begin_quote
  French and Italian are a bit different from English because of the way they handle verbs,
#+end_quote

And the first time Red speaks Italian outside of lessons, would he handle his verbs in the English or the Italian manner? Would he get the gender of his 'big box' correct?

None of this would prevent him from being understood, but it's the sort of thing that would make him clearly new to the language. (And vice versa - what sort of mistakes would someone who only ever spoke Italian make when first trying to speak English?)

#+begin_quote
  It /does/ have an affix (-n) to mark the /object/ of the sentence, so you can be free with word order,

Huh. Now I wonder how Yoda speaks in the Esperanto translation of Star Wars. (Is there even an Esperanto translation?)

The colour 'red' in Afrikaans would be 'rooi' (pronounced the same as the name Roy) (and yes, if you're familiar with rooibos tea, 'rooibos' is Arikaans for 'red bush')
