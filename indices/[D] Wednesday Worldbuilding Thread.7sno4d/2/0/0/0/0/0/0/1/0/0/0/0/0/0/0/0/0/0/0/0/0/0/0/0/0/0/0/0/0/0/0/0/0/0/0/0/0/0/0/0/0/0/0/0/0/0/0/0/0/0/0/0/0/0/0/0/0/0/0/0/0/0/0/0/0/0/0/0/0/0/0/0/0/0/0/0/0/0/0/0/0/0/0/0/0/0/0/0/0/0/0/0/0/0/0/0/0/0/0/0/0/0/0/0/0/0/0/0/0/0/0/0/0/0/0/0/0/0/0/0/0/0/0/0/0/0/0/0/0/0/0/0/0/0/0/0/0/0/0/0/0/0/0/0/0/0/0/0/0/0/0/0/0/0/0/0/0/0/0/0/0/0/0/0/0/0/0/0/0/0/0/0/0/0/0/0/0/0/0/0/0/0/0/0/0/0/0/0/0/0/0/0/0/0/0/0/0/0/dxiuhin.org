  Fastest human speed in a short distance is 8.6km/hr.... Even if we assume vampires can swim at 100km/hr (an order of magnitude than it seems a human body is "capable" of), Spain to the USA is like, 3,500km - so it'd take at least a week, assuming vampires can swim 10x faster over a long period than an olympic athlete can swim for 50m.

Vampires with suitable maps of ocean currents and a truly brilliant sense of direction might be able to speed that up further. However, there is another issue to consider, talking about currents - the vampires are deep enough that sunlight doesn't reach them, and thus they can't navigate by moon or stars. Once they take their feet off the ocean floor, they become the playthings of ocean currents, which may whisk them here and there, hither and tither, back and forth without them even noticing.

In short, how does an undersea vampire /navigate/? And is there some vampire at the bottom of the Pacific who's got so turned about that he no longer knows where land is?

  And then the question comes why would a vampire do that? I could see a suitably evil vampire putting his flayed rivals in argon atmospheres until they slowly went insane, or whathaveyou?

...alright, point. Maybe, instead of argon, there /was/ usable air in there...but it was already all used up on earlier regeneration...

  I could see, say, a copper rod being inserted into a vampire's heart and the vampire can't eat it away to heal because the body doesn't use that much copper.
#+end_quote

[[/twiponder][]] Yeah, I can see that working... but it also implies that vampires are not bulletproof, that if you can smash the heart, you kill the vampire...and that's not hard if it's what you set out to do

  Well.... your blood has a shelf life (or does it? I always assumed vampire blood had a near-indefinite shelf-life, but maybe it doesn't) - anyway with a long enough shelf life, you just need to bleed into a vial every few years and have one of your janissaries deliver it to your thrall (or just have your thrall pick it up).

[[/batshy][]] I guess that works...

  Probably if serious research was your focus, as a vampire, your interests would be better met by becoming the subject of some king or another, who would do all the hard work of managing territories, and then you could take over later on if/when you felt like it.

[[/flutterbat][]] If he knows what's good for him, he'll call me "Emperor". Not that I'll interfere with his management, of course...
