  Not necessarily: maybe J2 has made enemies with someone other than Elodia; William is uniquely positioned to have a large swathe of territory that problem children can be exiled to, without it looking too much like being exiled ("Junior! I've found you a wonderful place you can stay! A whole town for you to rule, all to yourself! At your age, it's a rare feat! Now let's ignore the fact it's a remote part of Australia...")

Hmmm... point. Perhaps Junior II personally annoyed Elodia (in some fairly minor way, like sneezing at the wrong time - not the /seriously/ wrong time, just the /slightly/ wrong time). Or perhaps Cassius sees this at giving William a chance at redemption - Junior I's death might look like an accident, but it was still an accident that happened on William's watch, while Junior I was living in William's territory, so William must take at least some of the responsibility. So perhaps Cassius is trying to mend relations by giving William the chance to look after one of his (Cassius') spawn /properly/.
