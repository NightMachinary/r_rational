  I imagine most jannissaries have some level of loyalty to their current vampire - at the very least, they're happy with their current arrangement and are (on average) reluctant to move to an unknown vampire; though that's not to say you don't get the occasional exception.

Yeah, better the demon you know than the demon you don't; especially when dealing with creatures that could drink you to death.

  and they are surprisingly uninterested in having their names attached to new papers in the field...

As if they wouldn't just make a fake ID for the very purpose (or borrow a janissary's identity)

  So, Red opens the outer envelops and sees that the inner one is written in - oh - Chinese or Arabic or Linear A or something. Why wouldn't his eyes bug out at this? And then he asks William what it is and William reads it out, translating as he reads the entire title (which only makes Red's eyes bug out further, especially as he'd only meant to ask what language it was in...) - and then the scene progresses from there.

Hmm, might use that to open a scene that had a lackluster opening. Good thought.

  Incidentally, /can/ you speak in more than one language?

The emphasis makes me wonder whether you're asking if it's possible to speak two languages simultaneously in a sort of... doublespeak.

I'm only fluent in English but I speak French well enough to get by (can read a book slowly and with effort). My Italian's not too bad, I could have a basic conversation with a lot of gesturing. Thai I have at the "well prepared tourist" level - I can order food, negotiate prices, ask for directions, etc, but can't have an abstract conversation by any means. Esperanto I've just started picking up, it's probably a little better than my Thai.

The fact that my story is set in Rome and Corsica and the USA, while it seems like it's because of my personal experience with their languages, it's all purely a coincidence: I asked a WW2 buff where the US had heavy casualties, and he pointed to the Italian front and I was already planning an Opera so Rome was perfect... and then needed somewhere safe for Our Heroes to flee when the Americans reached Rome, and Corsica was one of the few places that had been liberated from the nazis and seemed relatively safe, and it would be a short boat ride away, so it seemed the obvious choice. The other one I was thinking was Portugal, FWIW, but that's so much farther from Rome.
