  Also, kind of off-topic, but I kind of realised that it makes perfect sense for William to be one of the vampire actors who act in these things
#+end_quote

William is hundreds of years old. He's had time to be just about everything, at one point or another.

#+begin_quote
  William is an actor partly because it gives him fame and immortality even amongst vampires (since he remembers fondly plays that he saw a thousand years earlier, delivered by long-dead vampires), and Red wants the more conventional sort of immortality.

That could certainly make a good contrast, yes.

  "... wait, so it wasn't a, the vampire gets a pet human and the human gets a pet dog parallel?"

[[/twidaww][]] To be fair, that is an excellent parallel...

  And my partner was like, "you should elaborate more on what you mean with the whole peacock thing."

  "What foreshadowing?"
#+end_quote

[[/grumpytwi][]] Believe it or not, that's a constant in practically /any/ writing. But it gets worse. Have you ever heard of something called "Magnum Opus Dissonance"?

...short version, imagine that you have two stories. One is the personal darling of a master in the craft, the story that he polished and refined and /polished/ and /refined/ until it /gleams/, with not a single word out of place, every last element a matter of /utter perfection/. The second story is something he banged out in a rush because he had a deadline, or to just make a quick buck. And then the first story does okay - not brilliantly, just okay - and the second grows a virtually instant fandom to rival those of Star Trek or Twilight.

...

Believe it or not, this is apparently more common than one would expect.
