  It's not a whole potato: it's like this: [[http://keithsfoods.com.au/images/products/large/r6qrs31uf1.jpg]]
#+end_quote

So it's basically deep-fried potato slices in batter?

I don't recall ever having come across that before, and I certainly don't know what it would have been called...

  I understand this term to mean something different: Tap (faucet),
#+end_quote

Tap - any little device that you turn or push or twiddle in some way and drinkable water (or other liquids, as in the case of say a tap attached to a wine barrel or an oil tanker, but /generally/ drinkable water) comes out. "Faucet" isn't used here - I always thought that it was an Americanisation of the word 'tap'. Why, does it mean something different to this definition?

Cafe - "Deli" generally isn't used here, and what you describe sounds more like a restaurant.

Lollipop/sucker - Can also be used for the room temperature sort (and in fact is generally used for that in any case).

  I have never heard the term Boerewors roll, and looking it up on google images, it seems to describe a hot dog?
#+end_quote

Similar, but not the same. A hot dog can use any old sausage, including those sort of pinkish [[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wiener_Wuerstchen_fcm.jpg][sausage-in-name-only]] kind of sausages.

A boerewors roll requires actual [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boerewors][/boerewors/]] (Afrikaans for "farmer's sausage"), which has some strict quality requirements (90% meat, no more than 30% fat, and spiced, often with coriander or similar) before it can carry that name. (Though any old bun will do.) Can be served with onions, or tomato sauce, or chutney according to taste.

Never heard of a name for putting the wors on sandwich bread, though.

  According to wikipedia: /The expression "by Jingo" is apparently a minced oath that appeared rarely in print, but which may be traced as far back as to at least the 17th century in a transparent euphemism for "by Jesus"./
#+end_quote

This does /not/ explain why it's listed on your Australian vocabulary page as a possible name for a frozen, water-based sweet treat, though...

  [excerpt]

I see what you mean... you're still doing a lot of telling (which is fine in moderation in order to set the scene in the introduction - all that about the history of trends in vampire society, for example) and what showing you are doing is exclusively in terms of the sense of sight.

So I agree with you that it's not /perfect/. But presumably you're familiar with the proverb, /The perfect is the enemy of the good/?

What you have here is /good/, and the fact that it is not /perfect/ should not prevent you from ever moving on and getting it out.

You're right, one and a half pages of exposition is not a bad thing.

Though that scene at the end, when William meets the night porter for the second time (I'm guessing that's Red) - that might (depending on how things flow in the beginning) work better relegated to the start of the first chapter after the introduction, and properly Shown. (At the moment, it's kind of half-Told still, sort of on the fence between Telling and Showing; and since it's done in the present tense at the time of the first chapter, it's the sort of thing that can easily be Shown once the scene is established).
