  I think the worst thing about the scars on our society has to do with the numbers involved. Aboriginals (from a quick Google) make up between three and four percent of the population of Australia. Our "previously disadvantaged" groups make up [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_South_Africa][somewhere over 80% of the population]], which makes it /particularly/ difficult to get everyone up to snuff in terms of education and infrastructure...

Yeah, good point. Never really thought of it that way; but it does make the fact that Australia hasn't recovered more even more horrible, since Aboriginals can just use the existing excellent infrastructure we have (which doesn't happen in practise as a lot of Aboriginals live in remote communities without fresh fruit and vegetables, good quality schools, healthcare, etc.... there's a saying that parts of Australia are like a third world country because of this).

  There are gangs in some regions, yes. And there are some particularly violent armed criminals as well

So like - does the average tourist / citizen have to worry about these sorts of things? If I went to say Johannesburg (or popular-tourist-city-here), would I need to look over my shoulder constantly? Or does the "tourism machine" mean that the tourist-frequented areas are perfectly safe but if you explore further afield you could end up in a very rough part of town?

    I don't know.... the only other explanation I can think of at the moment is that the nanites have an internal clock, and they sync it based on star/moonlight, and that modulates the sleep time. But.... there's literally no reason a vampire would be designed to work that way, unless their job was to keep a curfew active or something. And then it would be based on Atlantis rather than their home country. And also if you move a vampire but keep him in a box, the nanites will not know when to wake up. So.... throw that in the bin.

  Hmmmm. There must have been some way to install updates.

  How abut this - the original vampire was a creature of deadly speed and endurance, which never slept and could take down entire armies.

  Then someone else managed to weaken them by making them vulnerable to the Sun. Now the vampires are still creatures of power and hunger - but perhaps not all of them started out as human. (Perhaps there were vampire cows, or bears, or gorilla, or something). Perhaps these were still only of beastial intelligence, and had a bad habit of wandering out at night and getting themselves killed.

Good thought but I don't think this works: the sketch is:

- Vampires are created in labs as weapons with no vulnerabilities

- Vampires work out how to propagate themselves without lab conditions and end up overrunning the planet of Atlantis

- Atlanteans open a portal to Earth, and a rag-tag group of refugees go over.

- Vampires sneak through the portal too

- After the atlanteans realise there's a small number of vampires, mage enchants the sun (and by extension, gold and wood) to be dangerous to them

- This works a little bit but the vampire population remains self-sustaining

- Atlanteans decide to go to a new parallel world (Demontopia) and manage to do so without any vampires at all/any evil vampires following them^{*}

- Vampires are now on Earth, over time they forget their Atlantean origins

* This is probably where they get comatose during daylight. The mage would have cast some sort of spell to make sure they would not interfere. I'm not sure why the mage would cast a blanket "deactivate when the sun is around" spell rather than a "deactivate for the next few hours" spell, unless they wanted to use the daylight hours to fortify their base while the spell was cast - maybe over a period of months or years. This still runs the question of how it works mechanically, though; I imagine the "deactivate" part is grafted onto an "off-switch" the nanites had, that just deactivated the vampire rather than killing them. The "sun" part is strange, especially because a mage who made vampires vulnerable to the sun would surely make it so that a vampire would be awake when the sun was /up/ rather than when it was down and the vampire had freedom of movement....

Anyway I guess what I'm saying is in none of this does it make sense that vampire animals or stupid vampires would end up on Earth. The best I can think of is the algorithm of the nanites has "self-preservation" in there and the behaviour around the /magically charged sun/ is so strong that the nanites cause the vampire to fall asleep?

  [[/batshy][]] Well, yeah, but once he's done what the vampire needed him to do during daylight hours, do you /really/ think said vampire would have a reason to /keep/ him around? If he ever needs anything else done during the day, after all, he just needs another useful idiot and six months' advance notice...

I'd imagine there'd pretty soon be rules kept by certain Kings and Queens that any baby vampires must not be killed, for they make it too easy to hide your secrets. Putting more pressure on thralls again!
