  incorporating the other senses goes a long way towards making your scenes feel more real
#+end_quote

Absolutely. My mythical coauthor is the best for this, which is another reason I can't just finish this story on my own (and if I do write the werewolf story on my own - which is not looking likely at the moment because I won't have time - it's probably going to miss a heck of a lot of magic).

  that last excerpt, did the wine change flavour between the start and the end of the excerpt?
#+end_quote

More like, what a human tastes when they drink wine is very different to what a gargoyle made out of stone tastes when they drink wine :).

  [more senses] ideally need to run through the whole work, appearing in most descriptive passages.
#+end_quote

I just need to remember to put them in, and that's where I struggle I guess: I forget to include them as I don't imagine them. I can think about it and work out what it probably felt/smelled like but it's not in my image. So I need to try to think of a trigger that will make me go "put some more senses in there"...

  did you ever do anything with the sense of touch?
#+end_quote

Not much at all... Let's have a look....

  He grabbed at the catch, which felt colder than the others, and opened the trunk.

  With a start, Red felt something rough on William's back. Red broke the kiss, eyebrows narrowed slightly as he focused on what he felt, slipping his right hand under William's shirt. It felt as though William had some sort of rash.

  "Hm. Probably not. He's not blonde, is he?" Red's entire head felt cold and numb, hoping despite himself.

  The creature's skin, though it remained the colour and texture of sandstone, moved organically as the creature did. Its mouth was deep, dark, and wet looking.

  He was surprised at his own reaction. He wanted to know how to find him. He wanted to see him again. Perhaps just to remember what he looked like. To remember how it felt to be held in his big, strong arms. To feel the scratchy material of his shirt and smell that awful cologne of his again. And most of all, to have that indescribable feeling of being at the centre of a giant's world.

  The shrouded woman watched Red intently as he ran his hand over the lid of one, feeling the grain, thinking. “They please you?”

  Lucia moved to stand behind Red, holding her dagger to his neck. The blood from her hand started staining his new suit. He could feel the hair on the back of his neck begin to get stained with his sweat.

There's even a section where I say "red can feel the blade on his neck" but I didn't even add that the blade was cold, and I'm sure if I wanted to be extra evocative I could say "he felt the cold bite of the blade against the soft skin of his neck" or something. I should try that!
