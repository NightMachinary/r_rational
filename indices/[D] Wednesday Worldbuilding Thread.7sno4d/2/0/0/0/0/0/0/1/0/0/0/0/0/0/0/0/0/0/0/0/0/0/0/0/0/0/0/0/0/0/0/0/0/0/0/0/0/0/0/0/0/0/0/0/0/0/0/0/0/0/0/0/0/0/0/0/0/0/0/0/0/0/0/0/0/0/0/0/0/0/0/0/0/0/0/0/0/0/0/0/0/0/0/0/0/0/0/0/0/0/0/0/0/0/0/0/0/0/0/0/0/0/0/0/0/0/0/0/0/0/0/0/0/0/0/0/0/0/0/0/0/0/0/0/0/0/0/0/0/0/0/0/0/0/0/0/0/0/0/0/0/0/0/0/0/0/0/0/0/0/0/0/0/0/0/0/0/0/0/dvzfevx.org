  I'm not interested in romance as a genre. I am interested in your worldbuilding, and in storycrafting as an art, at least one of which all my notes have concerned in one way or another...

Still, editing is a profession. Hey, if you enjoy reading, and I enjoy feedback, then everyone wins, right?

  Ooooh, he's deliberately making things creepy for Red.
#+end_quote

Now you've got me wondering /how/ deliberately creepy he's making things: I was more visualising it in a "very much not sugarcoating" sense. (I did picture a creepy alley, though, so I'll definitely have to work on that).

  Then shouldn't William arrange for an 'attack' - perhaps a couple of his thralls with knives, under strict instruction to scare but not harm Red - just so he can show Red how utterly outclassed Red is?
#+end_quote

It's funny, my original instinct was having William stage an attack on himself, so Red could fight them off and feel nice/useful. Your idea sounds a lot better, and that arc was looking for a resolution: maybe that's it.

Because, bonus points, Red's watching in horror as William feeds; the thugs show up and start doing ninja moves on him; Red barely manages to fend them off, but has lost his dagger or whatever; then William finishes feeding, casually strolls up to the attacker, and picks him up by the neck.

  But I think that everything else I could say about this excerpt, you've already covered in the above paragraph - and it'll be nothing you haven't heard before.
#+end_quote

Yeah, when I show you stuff that's at /that/ level of rough, I kind of die a little inside. But it's seemed relevant enough once or twice that I've decided it's worth the embarrassment.
