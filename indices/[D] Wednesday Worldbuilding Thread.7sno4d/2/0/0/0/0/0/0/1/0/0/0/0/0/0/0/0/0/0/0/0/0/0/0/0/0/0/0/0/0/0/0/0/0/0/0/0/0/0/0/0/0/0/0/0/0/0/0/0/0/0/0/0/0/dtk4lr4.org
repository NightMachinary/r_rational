  German patent office worker a decade or so before that who was well-known for his mathematical knowledge, so one never knows...

pfft... not to disparage laborers, but patent examining is a skilled job requiring a high level of intelligence, the comparison hardly holds!

Red does ultimately become a heck of a lot smarter.

  Internal monologues and direct character speech is generally a lot easier to work with than descriptions of complex scenes...

Yeah... a lot of my writing forays end up with me researching whether hospital ships existed in the mediterranean, what Civitavecchia would have looked like in 1944, how much money a meal at a Roman "soup kitchen" would have cost in 1944... then checking the vintage floral dictionary on google books for what flowers would be best to put in this part of the book.

  You'll still have more to add, but there comes a point where the extra length is a detriment more than a benefit...

I don't think I'm there yet, but I'm definitely going to keep that in mind. The stuff I've added has improved it a lot so far.

And don't worry, it's not going to rival LOTR any time soon: each novel in that series is 130,000+ words.

What I had in June 2017 was about 55,000 words and I think it's gotten up to 60-65,000 words (the new chapter is 5k alone...). I predict the final product will be 75,000-80,000, max. I'm planning on writing three novels in the series so if each is 80k words we're looking at 240k words total, which is about /Order of the Phoenix/ length - for a set of three novels, each with its own "self-contained" story arc.

Actual predictions:

Volume One: 75k words

Volume Two: 60k words

Volume Three: 80k words

Epilogue?: 10k words
