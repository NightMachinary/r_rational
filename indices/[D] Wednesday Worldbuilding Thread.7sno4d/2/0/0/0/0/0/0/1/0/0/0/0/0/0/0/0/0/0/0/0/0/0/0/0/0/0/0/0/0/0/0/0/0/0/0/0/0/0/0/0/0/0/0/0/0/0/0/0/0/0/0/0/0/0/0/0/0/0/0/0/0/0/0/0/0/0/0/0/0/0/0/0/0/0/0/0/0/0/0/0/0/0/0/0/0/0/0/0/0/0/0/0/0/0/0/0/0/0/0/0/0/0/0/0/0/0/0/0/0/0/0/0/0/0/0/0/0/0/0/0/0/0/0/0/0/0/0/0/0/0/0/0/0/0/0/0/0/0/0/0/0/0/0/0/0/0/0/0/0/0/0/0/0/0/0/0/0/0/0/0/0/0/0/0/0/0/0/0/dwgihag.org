  Excellent!!! See, I am one step ahead of you sometimes!

[[/flutteryay][]] Yay.

  Yep, it's this month's book club book and I've been meaning to post a discussion for it
#+end_quote

...huh. What a coincidence.

  but I got the flu (IN AUTUMN!?!??!) so I was severely confined to bed because I was in too much pain to even watch TV (can you imagine???)
#+end_quote

Oooof. I hope the fact that you are posting now means you're better...

  I... didn't really like it, I found parts of it interesting but I think it's too 1980s sci-fi for me. (That said... I loved Dragon's Egg...). I get the feeling it's one of those books where if you read 300,000 words you'll see the majesty of it (my husband's girlfriend's partner is a huge fan of Cherryh and leant me his kindle, I feel bad that I'm gonna have to disappoint him).

Huh. Personally, I found it really great - though it wasn't the FTL that made it great (the FTL was merely a detail of the setting). What made it great, in my view, was the characterisation of all the different races - and how those characterisations managed to remain coherent and distinct while so often completely subverting expectations that those same characterisations had set up...

It's all about the different races. What they are, how they interact, how they respond to the sudden presence of a /new/ player in the midst of their long-running political stalemate.

FTL is a useful tool in sci-fi. There is bad sci-fi that uses it, but I don't think it is, in itself, a bad trope.

  Yeah, I'm trying to think what it could be. I have them meeting outside a church (I tried to pick a landmark that would have been around in the 1940s and this worked), so perhaps they could be watching a beggar and Cassius proposes to bet whether anyone will donate to him and William just rolls his eyes, grabs a few weeks' wages out of his pocket, and tosses it into the beggar's cup and then goes "I don't have time for silly games, let's talk business?"... and slip in an earlier scene where Red puts money into a beggar's cup, explaining that sometikmes when he first moved to Rome that's the only way he got to eat...

[[/twibeam][]] That works well! An excellent first showing of empathy.

Bonus point if it happens to be the /same/ beggar. (But if it does, don't call attention to it, just describe him in a similar way...)

  Red cleared his throat, and did something with his hands to indicate he was nervous.
#+end_quote

Little bit clunky phrasing here. "Red cleared his throat, wringing his hands nervously."

Apart from that - you're not wrong about the need for more pizzazz. My first, most immediate thought is better descriptions, more use of senses. And - that may very well be enough on its own, already.

  i gave her a quill and that's waaaay too much as quills actually sucked and any quill user would LOVE a pen, so i'll go and replace that with a dip-nib pen or even just give her a fountain pen.
#+end_quote

Does she use a quill because she wants to use a quill, or does she use a quill because her vampire master told her to do so a few decades ago and never rescinded that command yet?
