So... it's damp, small, poorly lit, the rustle and scurry of rats, smell of garbage that people have left out.....

  And then William casually tosses the attacker onto a nearby rooftop, where he perfectly sensibly stops moving. Because no matter how much William tells Red that he's outclassed, Red's not going to believe it until he sees it.

Ugh, there's the trouble of writing a /romance novel/ - William can't do anything too heinous on screen (ESPECIALLY not in front of Red), or people will hate him too much, or think the romance is unrealistic/etc. Like... if a guy I liked did that, threw someone onto a roof, and they died, when he'd already demonstrated he could just hold him at arm's length and stop any harm happening... I'd never be able to look at him the same.

I mean, I don't think I'd ever date a vampire who had a cavalier attitude about killing people. It takes a heck of a lot of trust for something like that.

Then again, thinking about William's reaction to Red training, it's two-fold:

1) He's glad Red has something to do during the day, because it means he's not depressed and mopey, and that's good for him on two levels: first, he cares about Red and wants him to be happy; but for plausible deniability/vampire-status-reasons, having a depressed human around is probably a security hazard and isn't going to make him look impressive for maintaining one. Also, it's something relatively harmless to keep Red occupied.

2) He's worried about Red getting injured: Red dislocates a shoulder falling out of a tree. And why risk damage to himself, if the exercise/training is worthless anyway?

Would showing Red he was outclassed by having a /Matrix/ style fight actually help? Or would it just make Red feel bad about himself / like exercising is futile and he ends up depressed and mopey again?
