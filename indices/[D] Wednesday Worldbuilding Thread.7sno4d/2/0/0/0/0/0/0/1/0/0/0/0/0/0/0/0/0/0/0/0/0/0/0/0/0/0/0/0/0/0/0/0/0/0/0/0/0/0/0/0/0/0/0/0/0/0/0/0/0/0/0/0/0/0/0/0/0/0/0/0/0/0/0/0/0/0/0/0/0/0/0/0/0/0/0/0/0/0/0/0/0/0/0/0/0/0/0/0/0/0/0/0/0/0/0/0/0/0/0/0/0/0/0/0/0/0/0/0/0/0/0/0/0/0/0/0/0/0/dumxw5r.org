  Loopholes mean he's politically savvy and has a don't-say-no attitude, eh??? :D

More like at least it means he /is/ obeying the letter of the rules, even when doing so is inconvenient. Unlike Zuma, who would flagrantly break them and then insist that he had done nothing wrong.

  I was looking at the prices for their fancy lattes, FWIW (turmeric latte and all that) as I figured that's more in line with what I drink. But yeah, cheap regardless.

Ahhhhh. Okay.

  ... SE Asia's $200-$500 return and the food's cheaper.

Ah. I think they've got us beaten, then. As long as you don't mind crowds.

  Which makes me think neutrinos are bad handwavium because, you know, it would be kind of like saying that 1000000 neutrinos per second is fine but if it's 1000003 OH NO THE VAMPIRE GOES TO SLEEP :(

It has other consequences as well. Do vampires all collapse when the neutrino front from a distant supernova hits Earth? And, if you really need one to, /can/ a vampire stay up past sunrise (albeit uncomfortably) and if so, for how long?

[[/kmidnightcrazy-intensifies-d][]] And then there's of course that one who insists on migrating between the poles so he never has to 'sleep'... but there's still a formerly-human mind running on that vampire hardware. Even if there are no physical side-effects to staying up for that long, surely there will be psychological ones...

  And if you do, just stake the damn thing. In air refuelling is stupid.

Yeah, much easier and more straightforward. The Noon Plane is incredibly wasteful and ostentatious.

...there's some vampire somewhere who maintains the Noon Plane to stick her rivals in just to show off that she can afford that level of ostentation, isn't there?
