  Yeah, she has a grudge against William and thinks defeating him will make her look really, really good.
#+end_quote

Hmmm. So, she also prepared better in advance, thus allowing her victory.

  She only suspected he'd declare war at about 10% probability but worst case scenario she kills a human, which is acceptable.
#+end_quote

Even in the worst case, she annoys William and pushes him closer to losing his temper and declaring war the /next/ time she pushes his buttons.

  Red is kind of like a transhumanist before transhumanism was a thing: deserted the army because he was terrified he'd die, and ultimately begs to be made into a vampire when his own death is imminent. (Before that, William had asked to turn him, but Red refused; he reneged when he was mortally wounded, though... but that's volume 3)

I don't think that counts as transhumanism. I think that's just a strong fear of death.
