  This may have happened: I don't explicitly state it but William wants to fight Elodia with a sword fight and Elodia wants to do competitive poetry writing or something. Cassius could well have been used as an intermediary to pick a "fair" battle: and of course he picks something William might lose at. Elodia is a lot less important than William though, but William lives far away and Elodia lives very close by.

Hmmm...

I'm imagining Cassius quietly pulling William aside at first, and pointing out to him how he can avoid the whole trouble by just killing the stupid human in the first place. Honestly, it's not as if it'll make the slightest bit of difference in a century or two, is it? (Maybe even ask him if he's taking Cassius' original request to be careful with this human a bit /too/ seriously). And then, depending on just how rudely William says 'no', Cassius might jump straight to picking a form of contest that works to to an automatic 'Elodia wins'.

  I think until Cassius finds out that Junior I was killed by William, he has no reason not to like William beyond trying to get on Elodia's good side: I imagine vampire attitudes / alleigances have a fair amount of "frenemies" time in them.

Oh, yeah. But if he's sending Junior II to William, that implies that his relations with William are /better/ than his relations with Elodia at the time - so he might be in a 'frenemies' state with Elodia as well (perhaps for unrelated reasons).

  I think "come back in the sequel" would really be "come back the next day where William sleeps and kill him in a rage", unfortunately.

Isn't William still protected by the Gargoyle? (Also, Cassius might need time to recover from his injuries first - usually vampires recover fast, but I can think of a few things an android might pull off that could take a while to recover from...)

  The original battle as sketched has Cassius /tearing her head off/ and then having no idea what to do afterwards because vampire hand-to-hand combat training ends at the "tear head off" stage because that's all you need to do to kill a vampire.

Decapitation works against vampires /and/ humans!

I recall a story in which the vampire hunters had wooden stakes that could be fired from crossbows, allowing them to stake at range. If that hits, it seems a pretty decisive way to end a battle with a vampire. And if he stakes /and/ decapitates her, then there's no way she can survive that, right? No matter how old she might be? (Wrong, but only because she's an Outside Context Problem for him...)
