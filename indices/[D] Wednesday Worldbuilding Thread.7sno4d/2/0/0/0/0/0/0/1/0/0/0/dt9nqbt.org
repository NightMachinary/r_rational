Yeah, that's my logic behind calculating the vampires as % of the human population; the vampire population would be in equilibrium with the human population, as new territories would be made when prey got too numerous.

Careful diplomacy is exactly what the story does! Here's an interlude - I may have shown it to you before, but hey. It does have your namesake character in it! (Originally it had an irrelevant character but then I realised it's better if Cassius is introduced early as someone William is on friendly terms with. Allows me to set up stuff that happens later, too).

(Later on, William agrees to give one of Cassius' allies a territory in the future because a new town - Kalgoorlie if you're counting - has sprung up after a gold rush in the last thirty years or so.)

William folded a towel. /Do you know where I might get information about any nearby Americans?/ Asked the angles of the creases.

Cassius sprinkled water onto it. /What sort of information are you after?/ Replied the arrangement of the droplets.

/I have found a human I want to serve me./ William replied by adjusting his tie, his left hand in front as his right tightened the knot. It was the left hand that indicated service and the right hand's action that spoke of personal service to him. Had he then gestured outward, the act would have suggested, instead, service to Cassius.

He trusted Cassius to fill in the gaps with pre existing information: had this been about a fellow vampire, his approach would have been entirely different, so there was a mortal American whose services he wished to obtain.

Cassius laughed. “You mean a human you wish to have served to you.” He couldn't resist the pun. He knew William was one of many who did not keep human servants for longer than a year or two before getting bored of them. Or just particularly hungry.

William narrowed his eyes slightly. Cassius was his elder and had something he wanted, so he had to accept some poor decorum. But William's manners were beyond reproach. He grabbed a rose from the table, and expertly pulled out its petals one at a time, deciding to be direct.* It is your hotel. You must know about that night porter. Is he one of yours?* He arranged the petals on the table into a kolam of sorts.

“Do you not think I can control myself, that you refuse to speak to me?”

“I think you are being rude, your majesty. I am asking you a simple question.”

“I do know who you are talking about. I found him interesting, too. That's why he works at my hotel.”

“He is one of yours?”

“I considered it. But I have too many. Do you want him?”

“Yes.”

Cassius laughed. “It's a pity. He's not an ordinary human. I fear you'll ruin him when you get hungry or bored.”

William frowned, and picked up the rose petals. /I won't ruin him. I can control myself./

Hee laughed again, and retrieved the towel. /I don't believe you. You are aware of your reputation./ The way he picked it up spelled out the retort. Left hand, picked up from the centre. He elaborated with some careful folds. /You don't remember. They are impossible./

“I will have him, with your blessing, your majesty.”

He grinned. “Now who is being rude?” But William knew that meant the American was his.

“Will you tell me where he came from?”

“I expect this favour to be repaid.”

“Naturally, your majesty.”
