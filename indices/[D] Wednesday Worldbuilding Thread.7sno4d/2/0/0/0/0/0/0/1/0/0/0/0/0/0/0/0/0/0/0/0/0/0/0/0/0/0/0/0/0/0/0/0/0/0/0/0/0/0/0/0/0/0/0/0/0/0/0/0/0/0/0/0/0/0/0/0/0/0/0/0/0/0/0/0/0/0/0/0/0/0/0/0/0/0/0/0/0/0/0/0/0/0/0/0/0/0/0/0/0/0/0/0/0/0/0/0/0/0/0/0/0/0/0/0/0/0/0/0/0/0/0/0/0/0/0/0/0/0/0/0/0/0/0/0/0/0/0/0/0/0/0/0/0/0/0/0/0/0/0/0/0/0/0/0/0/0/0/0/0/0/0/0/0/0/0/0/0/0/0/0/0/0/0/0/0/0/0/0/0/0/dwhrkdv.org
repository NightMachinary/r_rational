  Not really, I selected it because of your recommendation earlier in this thread.
#+end_quote

Ah. I had forgotten that I'd already recommended it. But I tend to recommend it often.

  Better /enough/. I mean, sitting on my butt on reddit doesn't exactly require a lot of health. I'm just garden variety sick, which is a massive improvement.
#+end_quote

[[/ppboring][]] But you're showing steady improvement, right?

  Yeah, I don't think I read far enough into it to get that from it: 60% into the first book, by the kindle's reckoning (which can sometimes be an under estimate).
#+end_quote

Myself, I quite enjoyed the first book - I do like a good adventure story. (Book One is one story. Books Two, Three and Four are the second story, and that's the big one. Book Five is one story, a sort of an epilogue). I do think that the first story is probably the weakest of the three, but nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed it. (The first story is not really all that different, in tone, to the ones that follow it...)

  FTL was maybe a bad specific example to use. Better one: the "robot becomes frankenstein's monster and turns on humanity" trope that Asimov wrote his stories to subvert and ultimately made relatively extinct.
#+end_quote

Have you ever read Asimov's short story, "...That Thou Art Mindful Of Him"?

There are no tropes that are so terrible that no good story can possibly use them; though there are some tropes that it is very easy to use badly, which earns them a bad reputation.

  Yeah... that was one of the "obvious placeholders" I was telling you about. Apparently not as obvious as I thought???
#+end_quote

Whooops. I thought the "obvious placeholders" were the bits in square brackets only.

It is a lot better now, yes. I think that the description of the room is necessary - readers need to be able to see the scene in their heads, and the more you dress up the scene the better their ideas of it will match with yours.

(On the other hand, you don't want to overdo it. It's a delicate balance.)
