  Then they'd richochet off her hard bones rather than harmlessly pass through them.

Only if they strike at a very specific angle, and then they'd still lose momentum due to passing through the muscles first.

If they strike dead-on, they'll knock the bone back (it's unbreakable, not immovable) and lose most of their energy to either that motion or the bullet deforming.

  oh, right. Ugh. Maybe... they can hear the gun cocking? But that does't need to happen immediately before the shot, so no. They are just always listening for the tell-tale sign of someone squeezing a trigger?
#+end_quote

...possibly they can feel the bullet breaking their skin, and their nerves are fast enough to trigger a reflexive, involuntary 'get-out-the-way' muscle twitch? But that allows a sufficiently well-prepared hunter to force a vampire to move like he wants, with the right pattern of shots.
