  Are power outages that common that a restaurant having a generator is a feature? Wow.

Not anymore. A few years back, though - as in five or six - there was long, complicated story involving corrupt politicians and a group of businessmen from Dubai who excelled in bribery and using that bribery to basically lever huge wads of cash out of state-owned enterprises, including the national electricity supplier, which had in turn (thanks to a /complete/ lack of foresight mixed with management incompetence) not built any new power stations for for too long - at the worst of the worst of that saga they were cutting off power to entire neighbourhoods for an hour at a time (all scheduled, there was a roster and everything) just to bring the load down.

Then they got new management in and the load-shedding just /stopped/. (Mind you, the bribery and corruption and patronage went on for a while after that, but the main guy who was pushing that got booted out of office last Wednesday and his replacement is doing a good job talking about cleaning up corruption, so let's see how that works out...)

I can go into more detail if you really want. But it's a whole long story with plenty of extraneous detail.

  Anyway, yeah, looking at the menu, they look like a cafe to me. They remind me of the Coffee Club [[http://www.coffeeclub.com.au/]]

Yeah... that looks similar.

  Yeah, we have compulsory voting so it gives us some election-related cultural touchstones (you walk to the local primary school, vote, have a sausage sizzle and buy a cake...).

We don't have compulsory voting, but voting day is always a public holiday so work doesn't get in the way of voting. There's generally a few stands set up by the various parties to encourage people to vote for them. I'm not sure why I've never seen a boerewors roll stand, though... it would make sense...

  also i'm pretty proud i wrote two passages with lots of senses yesterday!!!! And the senses were SO helpful in making the thing work... and the entire riffing off each other only happened because I started putting effort into senses and started wondering how a sleeping vampire would feel....

Yay!

Hmmm. Lots of touch, that's good. A few hints of sound (could perhaps do with a smidge more background noises here and there, like the sounds of the traffic outside in the second scene worsening Red's headache); excellent use of smell. No taste, but then again no-one was eating anything on-screen either, so that's fine.

A vast improvement! Well done!
