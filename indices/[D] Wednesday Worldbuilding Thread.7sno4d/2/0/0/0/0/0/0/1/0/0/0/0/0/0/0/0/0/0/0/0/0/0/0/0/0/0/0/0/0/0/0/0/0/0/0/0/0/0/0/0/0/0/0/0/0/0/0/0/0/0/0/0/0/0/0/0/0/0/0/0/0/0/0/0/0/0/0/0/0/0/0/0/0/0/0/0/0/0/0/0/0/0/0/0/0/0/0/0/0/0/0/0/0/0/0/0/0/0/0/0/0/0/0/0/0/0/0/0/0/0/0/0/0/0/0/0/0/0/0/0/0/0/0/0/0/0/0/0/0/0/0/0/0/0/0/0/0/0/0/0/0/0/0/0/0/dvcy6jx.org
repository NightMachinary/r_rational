Okay, you've got a good point. The final status of the vampire who lives in the cave is she rose at the wrong time, turned to dust by the sun (I'm.... not sure what happens to a vampire that dies in the sunlight, like, how they physically look when they die?), and her cult stays loyally sending humans down to the bottom. The sacrifices stop occaisionally returning back to the surface with manna, and the shaman says that it's because they're not being faithful enough so everyone just prays harder.

after a few months the ageless shaman detoxes from the vampire blood and is left shocked at what she did, but the townspeople take her and kill her, thinking that she has failed them or is possessed or something.

Eventually, the legends fade and they become a cult that buries people by throwing them into a deep cave, and forbid access there. Anthropologists remark on what an interesting cult it is and write papers.

Of course, one of those anthropologists wants to explore the cave to see the mass graves, and eventually they get permission to send a small contingent of cavers. The huge chambers are discovered and, eventually, a locked vault. They make a tiny hole in it and send a fibre-optic camera, revealing wonders that would rival King Tut's tomb...
