  So, she also prepared better in advance, thus allowing her victory.

Yeah, when she accepted his request to stay in her territory, she was probably hoping William would kill one of the humans in her territory and then she could confront him about it, and that would get things off on the wrong foot and lead to war. When that didn't happen, she had to go visit to see what she could do to push his buttons. Cassius was probably also in on it: not because he has any ill feelings towards William, but because if Elodia shows him up he owes her a favour, and if William kicks Elodia's butt then a local small-time rival is going to lose some of her territory and maybe one of his allies will be put back in. So he's in a win-win situation.

Yeah, you're right; I'm probably taking it that way because my interest in transhumanism is more motivated by fear of death than anything else.
