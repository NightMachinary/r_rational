  I don't have much desire to go visit Equestria, for example ;)

You'd probably be disappointed if you did. It's a fairly typical suburban area.

  A nice precommitment contract :)
#+end_quote

There's a few precommitment contracts around. I've seen a sign in a shop that stated that the shop uses a 'drop safe', the keys to which are not stored on the premises.

  basically if you have ovaries there's a decent chance you'll all of a sudden have horrible excruciating pain and need surgery to drain the blood or else put up with the pain for several months while the blood clears! fun

  Went back a week later and had an iron infusion
#+end_quote

Fun fact: raisins are surprisingly high in iron. Eat lots of raisins, and you'll be less likely to need iron infusions.

Last time I visited a hospital emergency room was for a minor infection - I went to the emergency room, had to wait an hour or so (because I was clearly not a priority patient) and then got seen, given a prescription and sent on my way. I only got the bill for the consultation (R100) the next day or so. (I had to get the pills from a pharmacist on my own time - that was fully covered by my medical aid, though).

So, there is a payment, but it's unlikely to break the bank.

  Hmmm that does sound interesting. Good place for low status vampires to live - most high status ones would have ostentatious displays of wealth that might make neighbours ask why they haven't paid to have windows added back.

What, and modify a piece of /history/? Why, it's probably a heritage site or something - and changing it would be like replacing an antique oil lamp with an LED bulb!
