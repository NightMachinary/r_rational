    And don't forget, the migrants lived in one small part of the country
  #+end_quote

  That actually might make things a good deal worse. Sure, perhaps the Eastern Australian vampires are fine... but the new diseases that are killing 90% of the native people aren't going to politely limit themselves to the new colony's borders. So the Western Australian vampires get all of the losses but none of the gains.
#+end_quote

I think you're underestimating the size of Australia. It's kind of like why there was Ebola in The Gambia but nobody in Ethiopia was seriously worried about it.

Size of (most of) William's territory compared with South Africa: [[https://i.imgur.com/1IcITOQ.png]]

That's a lot of land, and sparsely populated, for a disease to spread around. Especially for a series of nomadic tribes who didn't engage in a lot of formalised trade.

#+begin_quote
  There would almost certainly have been /some/ disagreements as a result. Especially if the Eastern Australian vampires didn't share.
#+end_quote

There probably was some internal posturing, for sure. Especially because they could probably anticipate further invasion by Europeans and vampires.

#+begin_quote
  I can see /a/ vampire thinking like that, yes. And then taking over his neighbours' food supplies so he can be sure to last through said lean years. (And then said neighbours object...)
#+end_quote

I think you're overestimating how much food a vampire needs; 12 humans, eaten from sustainably, is enough to feed one vampire. So a small tribe of 100 would be plenty.

#+begin_quote
  Actually... what happens if a vampire is in water deep enough to crush a human? Sure, if you bring him /out/ of there, he'll heal, but while he's stuck in there...
#+end_quote

Ohhh, that's... a very good point. It depends how "crushed" is "crushed". Like, if you're literally a bloody pulp, it'd kill a vampire. But if it's just like being run over by a truck, a vampire would be OK with it.

According to Quora, a tank running you over is about 1.1k PSI and I'll say a vampire can survive that but require healing afterwards... the bottom of the marianas trench is 15k PSI. So I'd say that pressure would kill a vampire. Average ocean depth of 2.1 miles gives a pressure of 5.4k PSI. So.... it's borderline. Won't address it until it becomes necessary and then address it the most appropriate way (e.g. "why didn't he just walk along the bottom?" "pressures about 4,000 PSI kill vampires" / or turns out a plot device works best if vampires can walk along the ocean... damnit now I need an ocean depth atlas...)

Ocean depth map: [[https://www.muralswallpaper.co.uk/app/uploads/world-ocean-depths-maps-plain.jpg]]

... it looks like if you navigated well, you'd be able to keep to the "shallow" parts of the ocean and avoid all the pressure issue. So I guess vampires can travel between the place... Eyeballing the chart and putting it into the depth calculator we're looking at 2.6k PSI to get around the place.

    Scion means like an heir, it has a connotation of being someone who is "chosen" to continue a legacy.
  #+end_quote

  Which fits. A vampire gets scions by /choosing/ humans to convert, after all.
#+end_quote

True. Hm. I'm two minds about this. I still feel scion is like an "alpha kid" name, for like Daddy's Favourite

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    So I could see a vampire calling their favoured kids scions but not /all/ of them.
  #+end_quote

  Are you suggesting that he would choose - gasp - /unworthy/ humans?
#+end_quote

True, true. I think it probably depends on the vampire. When (spoiler alert) William turns Red, he might call him a scion (... actually, he wouldn't; although they're in love, William doesn't consider Red a "worthy successor" in the sense of being called a scion; Red lacks ambition).

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    So really I'm tossing up between "progeny" and "children".
  #+end_quote

  Hmmm... I suppose they could invent their own words. "Progs" (short for "progeny") seems to strike the right disrespectful note while still having an easily guessed derivation.
#+end_quote

Maybe; I kind of want to adapt a new term like I did for janissary, but then I wonder how many "[[https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/fiction_rule_of_thumb.png][made up words]]" I get - one might be enough without things going weird.

...actually, next month's chapter has the first use of janissary, and I'm wondering if it's easily guessable what it means from context. But I hate it when characters in books talk in a contrived way so the reader learns what the words mean. And I also hate it when the narrator "talks down" to you and says something like "he replied, referring to the humans who often became addicted to the bliss of the act of being fed upon".

excerpt

--------------

Having had its fill, the vampire tossed the middle-aged woman to the side. She stumbled, falling to the garden path with a small thump. She lay there, with the calm of someone who had been through it dozens of times.

“Don't stop for politeness' sake. I am sure that one has at least a pint of blood left in her.” Cassius quipped, sitting at a table. His white-gloved hands gave gestured orders at the servants digging up flowers in the garden.

“It has been a long time since I've killed someone else's janissary, your majesty.” William muttered, the inch-long fangs shrinking back into his dentition. He watched as the woman staggered to her feet, gave a small bow, and walked away.

“Let's not be too formal with each other, tonight. I'd prefer to speak plainly.”

“Why, exactly?” William sat in the chair opposite.

“I think I know what I want in exchange for that human and I don't want to be bogged down with niceties,” Cassius paused. “Did you kill him, yet?”

“I have not even fed from him.” William held his shoulders proudly.

“Really?”

“Yes.”

“If not adding him to your never ending parade of janissaries, what use do you have for him?”

“I have him go shopping.”

“Ah, I thought I might try him at that, after the opera, when the hotel wasn't so busy.”

“He was very good at it. Better than any other I have seen.”

“Here I was thinking you were going to woo him, after what we saw at the opera. You were saying it might be fashionable, soon.”

“Even if will be, it would be a lot of work. And you know how conservative Queen Kalina is; even if I were to bother, I don't know if she'd be impressed by it, and nobody else worth talking about lives on the continent.”

Cassius gave a polite chuckle.

“No, I plan on having him do my shopping. Make him into a janissary.”

“And when you get bored?”

“What I do with my janissaries is my business,” William smiled. “Now, what did you want in exchange?”

“Do you have a duchy one of my progeny could rule?”

“You know I have plenty of land; it's prey that's the problem. Do they keep janissaries sustainably?”

“You're one to judge!”

“I make my home in a city of three hundred and fifty thousand. I have more than enough. The town I am thinking of has perhaps ten thousand.”

“That should be fine for a pup.”

thoughts: I could use the opening paragraph to define janissary or at least make it a bit clearer what it is.

/Having had its fill, the vampire tossed the janissary to the side. The janissary was a middle-aged woman, who stumbled, fell to the ground with a small thump, and then calmly got up and curtsied with the calm of someone who had endured this countless times./

Something like that. Then again, William's remark shortly after makes it clear that janissaries are humans that vampires feed on, probably. Or not. Maybe I should test it on someone.
