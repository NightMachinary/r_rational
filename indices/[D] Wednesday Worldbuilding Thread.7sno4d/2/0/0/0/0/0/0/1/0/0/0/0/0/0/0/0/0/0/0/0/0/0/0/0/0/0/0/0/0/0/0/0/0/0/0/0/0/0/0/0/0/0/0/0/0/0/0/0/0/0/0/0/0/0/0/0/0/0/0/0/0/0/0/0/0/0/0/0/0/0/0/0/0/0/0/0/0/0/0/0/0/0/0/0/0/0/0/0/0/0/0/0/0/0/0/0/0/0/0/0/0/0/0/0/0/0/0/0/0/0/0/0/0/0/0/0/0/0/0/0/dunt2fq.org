[[/twibeam][]] Yep! Which means it was at least /compliance/.

  Is South Africa not crowded? When I've been to Thailand it's been during "low season" so the hotels I've been to tend to be under capacity depending on the location.
#+end_quote

Define 'crowded'.

I mean, sure, if you happen to be on the popular beaches during the tourist season, or at large sporting events, then yeah, it'll be a little crowded. But not by the standards of someplace like India or Japan.

But let me put it this way; our biggest urban centres are Pretoria and Johannesburg. [[https://africacheck.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/000_Par3244361.jpg][Here's a picture of Johannesburg I found on Google]] (Admittedly, that's not the city centre, but nonetheless).

  Also... I imagine South Africa as having a high crime rate, which is probably unfair.
#+end_quote

No, no, that's actually pretty fair. It's a great place, but there are unfortunately plenty of criminals both in and out of politics. And there are certainly neighbourhoods where you don't want to walking through dark alleys carrying a big pile of cash.

  But the Oscar Pistorious coverage and him living in a "gated community" with security guards to keep the "undesireables" out seems excessive to my sensibilities.
#+end_quote

Honestly, it seems excessive to me as well. These gated communities are...

Well. Before 1994, we had this system called 'apartheid'. You may have heard of it, it was a pretty bad idea, it basically consisted of forcing different people to live in different areas based on the shade of their skin.

That officially ended in 1994. But a policy like that, held for such long time, leaves... /scars/ on a society. In this case, a lot of the scars come down to the idea that the black people (now diplomatically referred to as 'previously disadvantaged') had got the short end of the stick for a long, long time. And the short end of the stick was /very/ short - no education beyond what was needed to be an unskilled labourer, no economic power at all, poor nutrition. And so on. One could describe the short end of the stick as pretty near to no stick at all - except that sometimes, the entire stick would come crashing down and smash some poor fellow whose only crime was standing in the wrong place at the wrong time, and to make it worse, when that happened it was often being swung by a man in a police uniform.

So, you end that policy. That's good, but something like two-thirds of the country has no education and no money with which to /get/ an education. What do people do?

Some people, perhaps fearful of the 'unwashed masses' (who now have access to such luxuries as soap) turtle up in gated communities, surrounding themselves with echo chambers of like-minded people. This is made worse because a small percentage of said unwashed masses decide that now they're not being crushed by The Man, it's time to claim some of The Man's stuff - where 'The Man' is defined as the nearest guy who has stuff worth grabbing. And the stories of this get back to the people in gated communities, who shake their heads, tut-tut, and congratulate themselves on their foresight in keeping said unwashed masses out.

Further, you have entire communities who live in /fear/ of police uniforms, and instinctively don't want to speak up when they see something shifty - because, in the Bad Old Days, people from these communities who made themselves known to the police were in for a Bad Time.

Now, in all fairness, great and giant strides /have/ been made towards fixing the problems described here. (The fact that the country is still standing stands in witness to that). It's getting more and more difficult to guess the economic class of a stranger from the hue of his skin, and continually more and more people are receiving basic services (like water and electricity) or properly built houses (as opposed to shacks made of mostly corrugated iron).

And, while Zuma was a setback in the whole process, continuing it as fast as reasonably possible is still the best way to get votes from the biggest demographic in the country, so the chances are that things are going to keep on getting better.

Now, it might be possible to point out that this was supposed to have ended twenty-four years ago, so why are there still scars? And that's a common question, but it means that the questioner has not yet considered the sheer /scale/ of the original problem...

#+begin_quote
  Let's look at homicides...
#+end_quote

Oooooh, yeah. We do /not/ do good on that scale.

#+begin_quote
  Well no because it's particular to Sol, but if there's a solar storm at night then the same question holds.
#+end_quote

Hmmm. Could it be psychological? Some type of particularly persistent placebo effect?

#+begin_quote
  I haven't ruled on this either way: I want to say no, but if I change my mind, I wouldn't want it to be more than an hour absolute max. That said, the sun weakness evolves over time: a young vampire can walk out at high noon and is fine. Once they're a few years old they stop being able to go out in the sun though.
#+end_quote

Hmmmm. So, if you really need a vampire out at high noon, you make a new one and then send him out? (Maybe kill him once the job's done, so he doesn't take up precious territory).

#+begin_quote
  Oh, undoubtedly so. She'd probably have someone who insulted her at one point on it too just to drive the point home.
#+end_quote

She probably carries recent photographs around with her too, just in case the topic comes up in conversation.

...actually, could this be a beauty/rejuvenation treatment for vampires? "Let your skin and muscles fade away naturally and then regrow good as new, with no pain or long-term side effects" kind of thing?
