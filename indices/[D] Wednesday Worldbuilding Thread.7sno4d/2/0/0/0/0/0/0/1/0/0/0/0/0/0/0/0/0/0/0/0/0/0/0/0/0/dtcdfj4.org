  Cassius might need proof before he kills Elodia over it but I imagine she takes a significant social/political hit to her reputation in any case.

True: Elodia takes a big boon to her reputation after beating William, but being implicated for J1's death is going to be a smaller hit. I guess she hates J1 enough that she considers it worth it.

  William, on the other hand, uses the fact that he does not have an alibi to suggest that he didn't know the hit was coming and therefore cannot possibly be guilty

  he-said-she-said disagreement, which William is going to win (because he is more socially popular with the other vampires)

Nah, after losing the war, being suspiciously near one of Elodia's enemies deaths, and being widely rumored to have lost the war because he has /romantic feelings/ over /humans/.... William's reputation /SUCKS/.

I do like the idea of people thinking William has dirt on Elodia though. There's a lot of different ways to play it. I've tried to keep vampire politics out of it as much as I can (it's a romance story, after all, and told from the human's angle of vision), but I might have to add more of that sort of stuff as it could be quite interesting.
