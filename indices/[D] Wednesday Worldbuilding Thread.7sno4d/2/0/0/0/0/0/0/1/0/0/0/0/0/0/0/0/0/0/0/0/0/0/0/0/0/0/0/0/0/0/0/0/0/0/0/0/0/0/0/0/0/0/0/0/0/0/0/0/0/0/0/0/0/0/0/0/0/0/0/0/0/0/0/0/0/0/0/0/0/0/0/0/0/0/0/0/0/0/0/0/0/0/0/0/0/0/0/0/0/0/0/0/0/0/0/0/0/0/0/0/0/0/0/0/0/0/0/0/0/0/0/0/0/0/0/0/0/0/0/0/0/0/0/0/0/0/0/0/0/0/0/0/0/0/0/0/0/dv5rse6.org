Yeah, but maybe glow-worms or something of that nature. Wouldn't need much, and glow worms can't catch fire.

Great, now I'm imagining a vampire creating a society of mole people...

Also, in tangentially related news, I've just started releasing that novel and have posted it to the sub!!! I know you aren't interested in reading it but I thought you'd appreciate progress updates nonetheless. Again, thanks for your support and encouragement, there's no way it would have happened without you.
