  And it is happening, the cake is right there and the chocolate is completely overwhelming the coconut flavour

/grumble grumble/ I don't know it just doesn't feel right TO ME

  Maybe he picked up some minor grammatical habit there, which you have since picked up as 'usual' from him?

I think more likely Western Australian English is different from Eastern Australian English and it's got some affectations in common with New Zealand English... I should see what other people in my city get. (Unfortunately my husband was born in South Australia)

Here's some maps of Australian vocabulary: [[https://lingroadshow.com/resources/englishes-in-australia/vocabulary/mapping-words-around-australia/]]

(For the record: potato scallop/hash brown; bathers; drinking fountain; sausage sizzle; blood nose; canteen; pants when I speak normally but aunts if I'm speaking formally; deli; icy pole; most of them though pashing was popular when I was in high school c. 2004 and hook up a few years later; haha; awesome)

  (Some of them I suspect might not be used anywhere, and were simply inserted into the test to allow them to discard results from people who decided to just tick all the boxes)

Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if the more bizarre ones make sense in certain places... it's amazing what language is common

  Afrikaans did to Dutch spelling something similar to what the Americans did to English spelling, but I have managed to struggle through an article written in Dutch before.
#+end_quote

Probably Afrikaans did worse then because I find American articles smoothly readable with no effort; a missing -u every now and again doesn't alter anything for me.

  [afrikaans and 'to']

Interesting, thanks! Especially:

#+begin_quote
  Ek het my geld na die dief gegee
#+end_quote

So I get... I, give, my, money, to, the, "dief gegee" - I guess that's a compound word meaning robber?

#+begin_quote
  Now you know that some languages double down on that.

And how!

So I read this article (okay listened to it being read out on a podcast): [[https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/productivity/project-management/how-to-overcome-perfectionism]] and now I'm thinking I should actually make good on the remark in the valentine's thread that nobody cared about and try releasing my story on a "one chapter a month" schedule. I wanted to release it one chapter a week but there's 13 chapters (each with an interlude afterwards, so I could release the interlude two weeks after to kind of keep the content trickling), so I can basically release my mostly-perfect first half dozen chapters over six months and then the feedback will either completely demotivate me or will inspire me to work harder at it. If I get the thing finished up earlier I can always accelerate the release schedule after all...

So, of course, I'm critically eyeing my potentially overworked as it is first few paragraphs of my first chapter and wondering if they've got enough /oomph/ to try and hook in some people who would find the premise of sexy vampires dicey.

Since we've kind of gotten into language discussion instead of what we came here for - sexy vampires - I'd welcome your opinion on my first "section". I think I showed you my /original original/ first section which I'm kind of ashamed of how bad it was now, so if you remember that, hopefully you'll be super impressed by what follows:

--------------

Rome, 1944

Operas were dangerous as it was. Nothing less was to be expected, with a hundred powerful vampires gathered so close together for two long weeks. And during this opera, less than a hundred miles away, two human armies fought one another in a war that had begun four and a half years ago.

But the vampires paid it little mind; William, the eldest attending the opera, had lived through countless wars. He had fought in several, even had occasion to command armies. The war was not of interest to him; the opera was a rare treat.

There was no talk of cancelling it; no thought was paid to deferring to petty human squabbles. The opera itself had been planned for decades, and the city of Rome was a perfectly safe place to be, even though war was raging in Anzio some fifty kilometres to the south.

William had chosen to attend the opera not just because he was a great admirer of the librettist but because it afforded him an opportunity to meet with other popular members of high society. He had been isolated in Australia for some eighty years, and he wanted to reacquaint himself with the Europeans that he had close ties with. No doubt they would be clamoring to meet with him; he held a kingdom that was known to vampires as New Holland. Consisting of approximately forty percent of Australia's western land mass, it was among the largest held by anybody. Admittedly, its population was far smaller than some cities that were controlled by lesser vampires elsewhere; but he had always been fond of having control over large swathes of land, and there was more than enough prey for him there.

He had checked into his hotel the night before the first night of the opera. Such operas were so intricately plotted that many of their stories could not be told in anything less than fifty hours; this one was scheduled for seventy-five. The night porter had picked up his luggage - three more-or-less ordinary suitcases and six heavy wooden trunks that were anything but ordinary - and carried them, item by item, into one of the specially-prepared rooms that the hotel kept for the patrons that requested them. There was something about the night porter that intrigued William; he kept on running his gloved hands through his thick black hair, hesitating before he spoke. William could sense an odd, generalised fear in him. He was disappointed that the hotel still discouraged feeding on its staff. He would have loved to become better acquainted.

Were it not for the opera, William may not have thought any more of the night porter. However, like all of his kind, William was a slave to fashion.
