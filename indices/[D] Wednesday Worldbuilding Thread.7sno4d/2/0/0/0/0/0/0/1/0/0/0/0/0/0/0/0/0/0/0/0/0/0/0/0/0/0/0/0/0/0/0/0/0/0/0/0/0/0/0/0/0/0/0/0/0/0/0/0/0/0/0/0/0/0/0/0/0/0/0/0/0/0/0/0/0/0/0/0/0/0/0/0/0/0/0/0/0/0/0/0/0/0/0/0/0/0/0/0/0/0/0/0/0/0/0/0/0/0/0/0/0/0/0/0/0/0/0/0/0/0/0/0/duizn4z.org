  I mean, if you want to go into the detail, feel free, but I think it would just depress me more.

The good news is, it's looking like it's going to end up having a positive ending.

The major players in this story are Jacob Zuma, (now former) Presedient of South Africa, and the Gupta brothers, Ajay and Atul, businessmen and bribery specialists.

The current situation is that Zuma is (as of last Wednesday) no longer President, having been forced out of that role by his own party in favour of someone (Cyril Ramaphosa) who's really hammering down on corruption, as a result of which Zuma's lost virtually all of his political power; Atul Gupta is currently trying to argue in court that he wasn't involved in certain scandals, and Ajay Gupta is a fugitive from justice, currently being sought by Interpol to answer some very pointed questions about corruption in a dairy farm project.

And, a month or so back, there was this massive leak of a treasure trove of emails to certain newspapers which works out to whole /heaps/ of evidence of corruption on the parts of the Gupta brothers, and there's no way that's going to be ignored by the courts. (We have an excellent and very unbribable court system).

So, you know, the fact that it all happened in the first place isn't great, but it looks like the people involved are going to face legal consequences for their actions.

  (and I'm just throwing out a wild guess - were poor communities disproportionately affected by the outages?)
#+end_quote

No; there are some informal settlements that don't have electricity at all, but apart from that, load-shedding was quite democratic in its effects. Rich and poor were /both/ hit.

  For comparison, the biggest scandal we've had in a while in my state is that a mayor didn't properly declare gifts and free flights/accomodation she received;

Declaring those things are important. Those rules are in place for a /reason/.

  right now there's a national scandal that a conservative polititian (who was against gay marriage for ruining the sanctity of marriage) has just announced he is leaving his wife because he got one of his staff members pregnant,
#+end_quote

...the same Jacob Zuma who I mentioned up above currently has - I think - four wives? Five? And, as Nanny Ogg would put it, "that's only the official score".

So, yeah. All the corruption's a bigger story, but...

  We also had a scandal where a bunch of politicians turned out to technically have dual citizenship with New Zealand that they hadn't appropriately renounced, and our politicians must only hold one nationality, so a bunch of them had to resign
#+end_quote

Your politicians actually resign when they're caught breaking the rules?

Good for you. Ours can be a bit more difficult to dislodge.

  At Mugg and Bean, do you pay when you order your food or are there waitstaff who take your order, bring you your food, and then bring you a bill at the end?

There are waitstaff who take your order, bring food and refills for the bottomless coffee, and bring you a bill at the end.

  The sausage sizzles are the raise money for the schools to get new sports equipment or something, they're not organised by the political parties. (It's illegal for political parties to do anything that would be construed as bribing people to vote for them on election day.)
#+end_quote

Hmmm. We may have similar rules - that might be why I haven't seen boerewors rolls at election days.

  Could probably talk about how hungover!Red's rank breath stuck to his teeth or something though.

...it'll make that scene feel even more disgusting.

Which is exactly what you're going for.
