  That did happen in Tasmania - the last full-blooded Tasmanian died in 1905. Very sad.
#+end_quote

Eeeek. That /is/ a pretty horrible story.

...one thing I notice in the description of the war, though. The wikipedia page mentions that the Tasmanians tended to attack during the daylight hours, while the settlers did so at night or in the dawn. This pattern would seem to fit the case where the settlers had (presumably mostly without knowing it) vampire support while the Tasmanians did not...

Though one has to wonder whether or not there's a pure-blooded Tasmanian vampire wandering about.

  Oh yeah - I have 1:300,000 in cities / 1:100,000 in the country as my "canonical" vampire carrying capacity. So that gives a vampire, what, four orders of magnitude safety margin? A 90% reduction in population brings forth a few lean decades, but isn't going to make you fear for your life.
#+end_quote

Ah, right. That's plenty of food security, then. (Enough that I imagine vampires have to police themselves to maintain that approximate ratio.)

  (Or... you know, just whatever it is scuba divers use, I think they have some sort of device that helps).
#+end_quote

I... think scuba divers use a weighted belt? With lead weights on it.

  If they can absorb these elements from the surrounding air, then it stands to reason they can absorb them from gases dissolved in the water, or potentially from the water itself - since it requires some chemistry to happen in the vampire's skin or whathaveyou. So they probably can, with the old "not committing to it one way or the other in case needed for plot" caveat.
#+end_quote

Hmmm. Perfectly sensible - which means that the remaining question then is what about a vampire who wears a full-body wetsuit. My first thought was that if he couldn't touch water either, regeneration would be tricky, but then I had another thought - rubber is made of long-chain organic molecules, and thus it has carbon and oxygen and so on in it already. So, a regenerating vampire probably eats through rubber, meat, and other organic materials like acid...

  Well, yeah, and William thinks nobody is worthy to manage his estates. Vampires view wills as... pessimistic, I guess you could say. They don't intend to die any time soon, so why bother coming up with a succession plan? If you name a successor it only encourages them to kill you, after all.
#+end_quote

One doesn't need to be a successor to manage William's estates. He could always explicitly Turn someone in order to offer long-term employment as a manager and do all the tedious paperwork.

#+begin_quote
  So, looks like it's gone as well as can be expected for a term that has extra connotations that were not addressed in the passage.
#+end_quote

Excellent!

#+begin_quote
  yeah, it's when Red is talking to Lucia, and that's like, a year later, after which William has probably explained to Red what a janissary is.
#+end_quote

[[/twiponder][]] Ah. So a proper William-explains-to-Red scene would have to be specifically inserted, then. And I don't think it's enough of a plot point to devote an entire scene to the only minor nuances of that definition.

  Thanks to your... constant badgering [[/bflutterwink-in][]]... I'm getting better at adding senses.
#+end_quote

[[/flutteryay][]] Yay!

Huh.

A somewhat creepy look into the mind of a thrall, really - not creepy at once, but very creepy once you look deeper into it. Do they never at any point sit down?

And again, senses, senses, senses. I see you have a mention of the taste of the tea - which is good - but not a mention of Lucia's reaction to that taste (can she still even taste things?)
