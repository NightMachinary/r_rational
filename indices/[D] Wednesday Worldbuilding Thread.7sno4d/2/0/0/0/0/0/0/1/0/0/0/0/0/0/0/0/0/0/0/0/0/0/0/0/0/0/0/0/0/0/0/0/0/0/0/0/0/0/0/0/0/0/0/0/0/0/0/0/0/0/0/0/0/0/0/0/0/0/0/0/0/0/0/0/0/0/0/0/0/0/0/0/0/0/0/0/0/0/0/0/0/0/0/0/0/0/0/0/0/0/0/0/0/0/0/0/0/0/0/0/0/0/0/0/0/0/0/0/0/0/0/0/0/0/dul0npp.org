  Is he the one who really likes that one type of cow and dodged the rules so he could import and start breeding them? Or is that the new guy?
#+end_quote

I don't recall that incident /specifically/, but honestly, it sounds like the sort of thing Zuma would do. He does /keep/ cattle (cattle have strong cultural importance for Zulus) and he is the sort to ignore the rules if he doesn't like them.

  What makes the courts so unbribable and why do the utility companies and pollies lack it?
#+end_quote

Judges are appointed for life; the President can't get rid of them. CEO's of utitily companies and the head of the National Prosecuting Authority can be replaced by the President (in the case of the head of the NPA, it seems the previous guy took a large pile of cash in exchange for his resignation). Zuma went about deliberately appointing people who either could be bribed or who would do what he told them to such posts.

That's not to say that /all/ judges are unbribeable, but in general they know that they're pretty much set for life as long as they don't break the rules and accepting bribes goes against the rules.

  That's a surprise; our power outages are sometimes targeted, so areas near hospitals won't lose power (thankfully) but this also extends to places where politicians live... apparently. This might all be rumour.
#+end_quote

Zuma had (still has) his own country estate. I imagine he has generators of his own in there. Loadshedding almost certainly didn't personally inconvenience him, and I don't imagine he'd have cared much about others.

Hospitals, I believe, were specifically immune though.

#+begin_quote
  Oh yeah; she did the wrong thing, absolutely, but she's not engaged in shifty business to deny people electricity is more what I was getting at...
#+end_quote

Zuma wasn't engaged in shifty business with the deliberate intention of denying people electricity, either. He and the Guptas were engaged in shifty business with the deliberate aim of dumping piles of money in their pockets.

The denial of electricity only came in when it turned out that Eskom no longer had enough money to build new power stations and couldn't keep up with increases in demand. And that happened some time later.

Corruption - at first - looks a lot like someone just forgetting to declare gifts. Once is forgiveable. But if that same politician starts to develop a pattern of /repeatedly/ 'forgetting' to declare gifts... then you have a potentially serious problem, and it's time to hope that that particular politician has no control over any utilities.

#+begin_quote
  Some of them did; others are challenging the rule / saying they should be able to keep their position because they don't use their NZ citizenship / is NZ a real country anyway?
#+end_quote

The ones asking whether or not New Zealand is a real country should go - not because of the dual citizenship, but because people who try to change rules around to their own benefit after the fact are not what you want in a politician.

#+begin_quote
  So... I'd find that really weird, to go to a place like that for breakfast and have someone wait on me - someone bringing you food yes, but not the full "table service" experience. I'd imagine if Mugg & Bean franchised to Australia they'd ditch the waitstaff (no doubt it'd save a lot of money as our minimum wage is $20 AUD / hr (185 rand / hr) - though for high schoolers it can go as low as half that).
#+end_quote

Your minimum wage is way higher than ours. Though I imagine your cost of living is higher, too.

#+begin_quote
  I don't even know what I was going for; it was a plot bunny... it was like... if Red got used to the way a vampire is when it's asleep, then a sleeping human would be super weird.
#+end_quote

Yeah, and he's clearly expressing that weirdness as disgust.

#+begin_quote
  Because... I like the idea of a vampire becoming a corpse during the day: so they effectively "die" at sunrise, and their body slowly grows cold and stiff with rigor mortis, and the blood pools on their back, staining their skin... And then when they wake up at sunset, their body animates again, if they choose to they run their heating cells, pump their blood, etc. I'm sure there's vampires who are beyond caring and just walk around with a livor mortis pattern on their back and their skin pale, unbreathing - or maybe it was in fashion a while, to show you had no need to integrate with humans? Anyway...
#+end_quote

This could be an issue if you ever do that space vampire spinoff. Because the sun never sets in space, so do they stay 'dead' permanently, or do they simply have to stay 'dead' about as often as a human stays asleep? Can a vampire stay active and in motion practically year-round by spending six months at each pole and alternating - alternatively, can a vampire be easily imprisoned by being forced to spend the six months of daylight at each pole?
