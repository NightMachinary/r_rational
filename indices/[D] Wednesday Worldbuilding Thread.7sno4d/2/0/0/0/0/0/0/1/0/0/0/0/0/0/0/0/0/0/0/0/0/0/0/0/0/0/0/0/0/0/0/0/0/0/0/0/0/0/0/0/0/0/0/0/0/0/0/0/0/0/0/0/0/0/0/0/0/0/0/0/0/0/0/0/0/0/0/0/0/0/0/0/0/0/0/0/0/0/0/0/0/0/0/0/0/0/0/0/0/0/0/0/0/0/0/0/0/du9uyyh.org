Honestly, I think until relatively recently, vampires didn't really bother with what their humans heard them saying. They live a short time and can't read or write so who are they going to tell? The odd conversation aided by a magic mirror being overheard was not really a concern when a vampire visiting you across the nation would be a relatively rare event.

  Would he get the gender of his 'big box' correct?
#+end_quote

In Italian, yes, because the nouns end in -a or -o and the gender corresponds almost universally. So a big box would be /una grande scatola/, and a big table would be /un grande tavolo/ - that's probably a bad example as 'big' is an irregular adjective. A regular adjective like 'fat' would be grossa/grosso for f/m respectively to give you an idea. So Red might accidentally say /una granda scatola/ not knowing the adjectives

  what sort of mistakes would someone who only ever spoke Italian make when first trying to speak English?
#+end_quote

I can generally pick up on people writing in English who speak French as a first language (or maybe not - toupee fallacy and all). There's word choices that are slightly /off/ and little grammatical things here and there that I can't think of off the top of my head.

  Now I wonder how Yoda speaks in the Esperanto translation of Star Wars. (Is there even an Esperanto translation?)
#+end_quote

No esperanto translation of star wars, though there's an esperanto language [[https://eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars][wikipedia article]] of course.

A book of esperanto movie quotes has Yoda's most famous line:

Do, or do not. There is no "try" = Fari, aŭ ne. Ne estas "provi" = "[to do] or not. There is no [to try]"

(infinitives are in square brackets because English doesn't have infinitives as one word; below I am also putting esperanto words that come out to multiple words in English in square brackets). So it's a pretty literal translation.

There's also a few translations on an esperanto message board:

"Powerful you have become, the dark side I sense in you." = Fortega vi iĝis, la mallumflankon mi sentas en vi. = "[very strong] you became, the [dark side] I [hear/feel/smell] in you"

"Patience you must have, my young padawan." = Paciencon vi devas havi, mia juna padawano. = "patience you must [to have], my young padawan"

(not being very into esperanto I'm not really in a position to make a proclamation on this, but I'd probably translate padawan into esperanto using the esperanto roots available, since I think that's considered "best practise" - so you'd make a word that means [student][magic][taken at a young age] or something)

"Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future." = Malfacilas (antaŭ)vidi. Ĉiam moviĝanta estas la estonto. = " [Not easy] [to (fore)see]. Always moving is the future"

"Around the survivors a perimeter create." = Ĉirkaŭ la postvivintoj perimetron kreu. = "Around the [people who are living afterwards] [a perimeter] [create (imperative tense)]

Like I said before, esperanto tends to be SVO so altering the order, even if it's still /grammatical/, would have a similar effect.
