  Perhaps some Elder Vampires are subtly pushing for it to become a trend, but they are being outpushed by the Elder Vampires who just don't want to have to waste their time dealing with stupid smelly humans.

This is what's probably happening; plus, there are plenty of vampires who romance humans to various extents /anyway/, and it serves as a good marker of someone who doesn't have their priorities in order if it remains untrendy.

  A vampire story is the perfect place to slip in the word "exsanguinate".

I swear there's a big word in the chapter that i'm hoping to release in 48 hours... can I find it... Oh, I think it's "stiletto", used to mean the knife.

  probably less than a tenth of your readers will think that way, because probably less than a tenth of your readers will think any particular way. (It's not particularly important in this case, but it's worth bearing in mind in other situations).

For a second there I thought you were saying nobody would think about the story at all (which is patently untrue as I've got some lovely thoughtful comments on the chapter threads!), but then I realised you meant any one way and I felt a lot better :).

I think it depends how particular you get, though. I mean, if I do my job right, most people are going to like Red, many people will root for the relationship, many people will be intrigued by the William/Cassius dynamic, etc. I follow Survivor very closely and the fans of that show do tend to propose the same theories/ideas/etc a lot.

But specific lines of thought about a character having a wife based on a misunderstanding of a word that was used in the third chapter? totally see your point.
