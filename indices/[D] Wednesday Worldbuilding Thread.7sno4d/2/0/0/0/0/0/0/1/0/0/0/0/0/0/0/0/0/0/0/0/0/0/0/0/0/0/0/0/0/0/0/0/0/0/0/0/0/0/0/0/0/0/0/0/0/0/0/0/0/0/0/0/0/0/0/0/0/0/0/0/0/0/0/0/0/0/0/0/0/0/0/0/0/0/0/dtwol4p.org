  Even given current AI models, there's still not just one way to 'think like a computer'. Non-recursive neural networks 'think' in a very different way to fuzzy-logic expert systems, which in turn are very different to recursive neural networks - and you can never be completely sure what you're going to end up with when you start messing with evolutionary algorithms (within bounds, of course).

Yeah, don't worry: I discussed the sorts of ways I wanted to present Julias' thought with my partner and he said that the stuff I was going for didn't fit with a computery way of doing things. I think if I tried to faithfully write a /real/ AI thought process I'd do pretty badly of it.

  In short, Julias can think in absolutely any way you want him to, and you can claim with a straight face that that is exactly how all intelligent Atlantean computers thought. There's just so many variables and unknowns in there to fiddle with...

Yeah, but... let's say I'm writing science fiction in the 1850s and I want to design something to make people move faster, so I envisage the "clockwork horse" trope. A victorian who understands clockwork or horses would laugh at the thought, because it's obvious to any horse expert that clockwork would not do great at making a horse, which has a lot of flexibility and adaptability, and to any clockwork expert that a horse is not the sort of thing you'd use clockwork /for/ because it lacks the "adaptability" of a horse. And a victorian futurist would point out the steam-powered horseless carriages that are all the rage and say that making one of /them/ out of clockwork with a better power source would be a better idea.

And all of those experts look hopelessly naive to us, today, with our lamborghinis and self-driving cars.

So I guess what I'm trying to say is it's all well and good to say that the Atlanteans have clockwork so advanced that it can be used to make a great horse robot: but if you actually wanted a horse robot, you wouldn't use clockwork /today/.

So I don't want to be using a hopelessly naive image of AI, that looks silly and naive even to modern people with a passing interest in the subject. I don't think that's intellectually rigorous, you know?

So a human-like mind is going to be more realistic for atlantean AI than some IF-THEN arguments that look like they were written by someone who just learned BASIC...

No, I'm not! But as the book club co-czar maybe I'll put that on the list. It sounds like a great concept!
