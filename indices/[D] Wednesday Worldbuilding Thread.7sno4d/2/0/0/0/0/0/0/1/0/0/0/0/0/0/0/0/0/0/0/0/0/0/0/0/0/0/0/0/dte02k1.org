  /cough/ who is asleep during the day and completely defenseless...

That's not going to be how your average vampire is going to see it. Yes, they're vulnerable, but they won't like being reminded of that...

  I didn't nail down details for how William kills Junior1 though now I come to think of it: probably he overpowers J1 in single combat and then torches the house to make it look like an accident.

Makes sense. William presumably makes the fire look like an accident as well - electric systems sparking or something, not the arson it is.

  She gets the benefit of killing J1, the benefit of W's reputation going to shit, and the benefit of having huge amounts of dirt on W - because even though she ordered the hit, W went through with it for really, really low-status reasons and instead of reporting her murderous desires to Cassius and getting a gold star, William decided to commit murder, so if anything he's more culpable than Elodia is - especially because he knows better.

Complete and utter victory!

  Likely is. I imagine the closest friends become so because they can blackmail each other several times over, mutually assured destruction style, and just realise since they can't ever betray each other that they can actually fully trust each other. It'd be.... hard to get your head around.

But they can always betray each other to the point of death - if Tom the Vampire kills Jack the Vampire then it barely matters what dirt Jack has on Tom, Jack's too dead to use it.
