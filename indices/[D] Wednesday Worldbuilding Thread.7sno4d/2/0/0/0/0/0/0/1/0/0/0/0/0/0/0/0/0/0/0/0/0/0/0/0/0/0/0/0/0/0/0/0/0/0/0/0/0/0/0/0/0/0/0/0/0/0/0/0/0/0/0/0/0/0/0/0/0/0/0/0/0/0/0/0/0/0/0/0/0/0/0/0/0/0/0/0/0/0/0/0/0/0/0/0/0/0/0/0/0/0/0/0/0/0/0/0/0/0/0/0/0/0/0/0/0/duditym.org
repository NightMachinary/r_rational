  Why would you want to batter the potatoes when you can make slap chips from them instead?,
#+end_quote

It's not a whole potato: it's like this: [[http://keithsfoods.com.au/images/products/large/r6qrs31uf1.jpg]] - though slap chips is a new one! We call them all hot chips, though we use fries sometimes but those refer only to the shoestring ones and only in the context of mcdonald's/hungry jacks(what we call burger king)...

I understood the terms: Cossie, Nosebleed, Tuck Shop,

I understand this term to mean something different: Tap (faucet), Cafe (is different from a deli: a cafe has tables and chairs and you can order coffee, cakes, and usually breakfast/lunch: a deli is a little store like a 7-11), Lollipop/sucker (to me this is a candy that can be stored at room temperature; an icey pole is frozen).

I have never heard the term Boerewors roll, and looking it up on google images, it seems to describe a hot dog? A sausage sizzle is differrent: [[http://c8.alamy.com/comp/EFT3XP/sausage-sizzle-fundraiser-in-australia-EFT3XP.jpg]] - it uses a piece of sandwich bread rather than a hot dog roll.

  You have some strange language. Where does that 'by jingo' come from?
#+end_quote

According to wikipedia: /The expression "by Jingo" is apparently a minced oath that appeared rarely in print, but which may be traced as far back as to at least the 17th century in a transparent euphemism for "by Jesus"./

  Bear in mind, word order in Afrikaans is almost always different.

Lesson learned...

  It's an introduction, so a small amount of telling is not completely out of place in order to set the scene; however, now that the scene is set, I expect that there will be a lot more showing in future scenes.
#+end_quote

The very next scene is honestly much the same and I'm still not 100% satisfied with it but I'm trying not to let perfectionism get the best of me... :/ But after that I think it gets better; and what I sent you yesterday plus the below makes 1.5 pages so I should stop overthinking it. 1.5 pages of beginning exposition in a ~150 page novel is completely fine!

Halfway through the opera's fifteen day duration, William knew that it would be remembered for the ages. Its legendary librettist and composer had laid the groundwork for a beautiful tale, with hundreds of disparate elements coming together. The thread that William found himself drawn to was the story of a young vampire, some hundred years of age, who was pursuing the love of a human princess. Romances between vampires and humans were by no means unheard of, but it was a shameful secret of those that participated in it. It was the low-status sort of thing done by a young one who missed his old life, or, worse still, who did not care for his reputation. No reputable vampire, especially one of such advanced age as William, would ever debase themself so.

It was revolutionary that such a relationship be included in an opera at all, let alone be a major element of one so prestigious. He eagerly participated in the discussion. The opinions varied. Some thought it was only sensible for a young vampire to bring himself into a powerful human political position and that the princess would be a pawn and discarded. Others thought it was scandalous that such a relationship should be shown at all, and predicted it would end in tragedy.

William was a member of the cohort of the oldest vampires still living. In his time he had seen a great many of these performances and watched a great many trends in vampire society be born and die. The people in the audience speculating about the significance of the relationship with the princess seemed more excited than scandalised by it. And Vettori, the librettist, had a reputation as a trendsetter: an opera of hers had made the use of personal body doubles widespread amongst respectable vampires. Then, two hundred years later, a second opera had brought the practice into disrepute; a sign of earlier, less unified times. He thought back to his doppelganger, still hidden in a coffin in the basement of an Australian church. He had been caught up in it then, too.

William was coming to suspect that having a human lover would soon be in vogue. He had heard a human lover required a horrific combination of constant attention and patience: keeping one could well become a new display of extravagance. And vampires, who as a rule could afford most creature comforts, loved nothing more than austentatious gestures of luxury.

As he made the short walk back to his hotel, he imagined a rival Queen's jealous glare if he visited her ten years from now with a human woman on his arm; he imagined how her Dukes and Duchesses would gossip amongst themselves, wondering what could be taking so much of their Queen's time that she could not afford to win a human's affections. He thought of how impressive his will, intelligence and social integration skills would seem by comparison. He smiled as he crossed the threshold into the Albergo di Sole al Pantheon, thinking that the hypothetical Dukes and Duchesses might cede their allegiances to him, all over a human woman. He wondered if he might try to charm one.

In those early morning hours, the hotel front desk was staffed by the same night porter that had moved his luggage. Each time, the porter gave William a polite greeting in his heavily accented Italian. He had never thought it worth any acknowledgement.

But tonight, with his thoughts where they were, William couldn't help but take note of the precise angle that the night porter was wearing his hat at this evening; the place he had rolled his sleeves up to, and the number of times he had folded each sleeve to do it. To a vampire, such aspects of attire were carefully composed, and each button, each fold, and each accessory added meaning to the outfit. If the porter had been a vampire, he would be signalling to a superior that he wished to discuss an allegiance. It was unambiguous. It was absurd; he had never heard of a human stumbling upon a coherent message like that. He wondered what reason another vampire would have to dress him up like this, to tell this message from a human's point of view - and as humans went, this foreigner was as lowly as they came.

So this time, instead of continuing straight up the stairs, he paused at the desk for a moment and returned the young man's greeting, meeting his brown eyes with a small smile.

William found himself hoping that the night porter himself meant to signal William, rather than being dressed like a vampire's doll.

As he walked up the stairs to his room, William shook his head. Fashionable or not, it was a silly idea.
