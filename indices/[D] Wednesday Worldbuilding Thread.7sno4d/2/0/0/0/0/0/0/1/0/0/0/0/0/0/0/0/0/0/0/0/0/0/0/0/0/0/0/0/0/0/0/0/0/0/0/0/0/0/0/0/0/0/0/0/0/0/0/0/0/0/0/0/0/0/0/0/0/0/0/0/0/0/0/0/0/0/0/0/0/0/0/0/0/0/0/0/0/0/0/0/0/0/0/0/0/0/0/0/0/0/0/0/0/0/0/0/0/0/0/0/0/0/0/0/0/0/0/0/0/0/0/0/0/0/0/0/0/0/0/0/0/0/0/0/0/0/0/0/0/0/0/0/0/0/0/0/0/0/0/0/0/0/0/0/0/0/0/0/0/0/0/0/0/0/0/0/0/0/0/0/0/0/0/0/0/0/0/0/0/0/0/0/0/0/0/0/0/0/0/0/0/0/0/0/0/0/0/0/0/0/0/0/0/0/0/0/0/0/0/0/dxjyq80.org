  You could also swim to the surface to see the stars: if you swam too close during daylight you'd pass out (actually I think you'd probably pass out during daylight anyway unless you're very deep).

Hmmm. When the vampire passes out, he sinks to the level set by the rocks (or lead weights) he is carrying. If that's deep enough to avoid the sun (which is only sensible, so he can keep swimming all night) then he wakes up again, and has to keep trying to swim up until he manages the entire swim - with his weights - without passing out. (Which probably means it is near dawn. Risky).

Hmmmm.

Plan B: The vampire takes a thrall with him. The thrall is in a rowboat, with maps, compasses, sextants, etc. The vampire is at the bottom of a long rope, and they can communicate by a coded pattern of tugs on the rope, or by sending coloured flags up/down.

Downside: Everyone can see the boat.

  Yeah. I am also running into a problem which is that a headshot will kill a vampire if I make it canon that the brain can't regrow with memories/personality/etc intact, which I also don't like as it makes it too easy to kill vampires with guns.

[[/twibeam][]] Easily solved! Vampire skulls are completely impervious to anything non-magical (except sunlight etc.) So the bullets just bounce off their skulls and their brains remain intact.

  I can see it now: a powerful vampire King with a scientist who is working on something or other that is important for the King. The King acknowledges that the scientist is a bit loopy--asks to be called emperor and whatnot--but humours her nonetheless because of the small scientific advancements the scientist spits out for the King (not what the scientist is /actually/ working on, of course, just piddly little things they come up after a week whenever the King seems to be getting tired of her). Of course, the scientist ends up developing something to neutralise the sun, or to mind control the King, and she becomes the emperor of the earth /in earnest/.

[[/flutterbat][]] And in the meantime, the King helps the Scientist by dealing with anyone else who wants to challenge the King for a leadership role.

What the King doesn't realise is that the Emperor actually finished his mind control device decades ago (and occasionally uses it on the King to keep him quiet) but he doesn't actually /want/ to do the administration of the world, he genuinely just wants to be left alone to do his science in quiet...
