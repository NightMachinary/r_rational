That's a really cool premise!

... I wasn't thinking about it like that but you touch on an interesting point here: vampires probably can't fall asleep without the sunrise. I'm imagining far-future vampires when Sol is nova paying mages to enchant the stars they live around so they can get some damn /sleep/!

  And then something happens to the Shaman. Struck by lightning, hit by a bus, poached by a rival vampire - one way or another, something happens, and the cult just collapses.

This is probably the most tenuous part as... well, look at the history of religion; cults can hold on until they have millions of worshippers. Then again, just look at the wikipedia page for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_messiah_claimants][list of messiah claimants]] - most of these guys had a cult at one point, but only one endures to this day in any significant numbers, and some have [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakers][maintained a few hundred years but are dying out]].

Anyway... the denouement would be that the vampire is shocked by technology, even more shocked to hear that 90% of all vampires died in 1700 (how did she miss something like /that/?) and.... well, look at the list of messiah claimants again: pick any that are currently living and use them as a template. (She'll move them over to the cave in a century or so, after the cult has truly begun to accept her unageing nature and her divine powers: of course, she'll plant just enough evidence that she is her own daughter or something so the nonbelieving public doesn't get suspicious.)
