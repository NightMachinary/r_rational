  (I sort of realised that even though Australia is a white country, the vampires who were in Australia when it got colonised would obviously be from local stock, and I kind of realised it's pretty weird to have vampires being colonial just the same as white people, so I'm trying to fudge around that a bit...)

Alright, wait. Wait wait wait. There is an important point to make here.

Vampires have been around a lot loner than human history and thus are represented in all modern racial groups. Thus, colonial humans would have met native populations that included vampires.

Think on this a minute. The vampire is stronger, faster, smarter than an average human, functionally immune to most weapons, and next to immortal. They might not much care about humans on /average/, but they /are/ going to care about large disruptions to their food supply.

How could any colonialism in any land manage to succeed, unless the colonists included vampires from the start?

  a vampire is much stronger than its children by definition (because of the age gap), so a vampire child, even if not /magically/ bound to obey, is going to be /practically/ more bound to obey

Not just his sire, the same goes for all Elder Vampires. (Actually, that implies that a young vampire can disobey his sire with impunity, as long as he can find an equally-powerful Elder Vampire to act as his 'sponsor', supporting his efforts and protecting him from his sire).

  (Sire? I should come up with some terminology for vampire offspring/parents... I was trying out "issue" at one point but I think that's lame.)
#+end_quote

'Sire" is good for the parent. I've seen that used before, elsewhere.

  haha i'm imagining volume 3 coming around and Cassius chucking one of his kids in William's territory, and it's someone who just hates... either William specifically or like blonde men or something. Or just has been told vicious rumours about William (all of them actual rumours, of course, just rumours that most vampires know not to believe).

Or he's just really, /really/ irritated by the way William taps his fingers while he speaks, or by William's accent, or William's habit of wearing red ties.

Even better, all of the above.
