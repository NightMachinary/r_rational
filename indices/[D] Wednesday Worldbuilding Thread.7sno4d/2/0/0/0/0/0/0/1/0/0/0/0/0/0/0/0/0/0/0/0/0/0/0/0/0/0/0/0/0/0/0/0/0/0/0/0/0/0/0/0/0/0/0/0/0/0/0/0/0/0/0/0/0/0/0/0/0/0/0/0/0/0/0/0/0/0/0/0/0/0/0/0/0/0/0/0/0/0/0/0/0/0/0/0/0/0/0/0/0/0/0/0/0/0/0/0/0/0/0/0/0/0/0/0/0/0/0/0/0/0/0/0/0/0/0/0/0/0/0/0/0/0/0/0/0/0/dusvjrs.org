  We've got a "closing the gap" initiative. 7 targets, of which three are being met: [[https://closingthegap.pmc.gov.au/executive-summary]] - the last time that we met as many as three was 2011, so omg... And the one's we're achieving are the "easiest" ones: child mortality, kindergarten enrolment, and high school completion (though oddly enough not... school attendance or reading/numeracy).
#+end_quote

Hmph. Well, the initiative looks good, but it needs to meet more targets. And, from the executive summary, it... kind of looks like someone started out by just throwing money at the problem to see if that would solve it.

Fortunately, the same executive summary also suggests that the people running the program are learning and adapting their efforts in light of their experiences.

  Without going into too many details, how affluent is your area
#+end_quote

Hmmmmmm... upper-middle-class. Not a gated community. I think that's sufficiently vague.

#+begin_quote
  and how much of a concern is crime?
#+end_quote

I don't feel the need for an alarm system, and I can leave my car out in the driveway all day if I want with no negative consequences. So... minimal concern, really. I'm also something like five minutes' drive or maybe half an hours' walk from the nearest police station, for what that's worth.

  And if you're one of Pistorious's neighbours then that tells a different story than if your family environment is more like the median, if you get me. (Then again, a median in a place where 80% of the population is "formerly disadvantaged" is maybe not a useful thing to talk about?).
#+end_quote

I get you. The median is moving, slowly, over time, though.

#+begin_quote
  Ah, I can't think of any places like that. Even the most dodgy areas I can think of, you wouldn't want to leave any coins in your car or they might be stolen, but the car itself is going to be expected to be fine.
#+end_quote

I continually hear about trains being delayed because people have stolen the signal cabling in order to sell it for its copper content.

So... yeah. We /have/ a problem (and the whole Zuma administration did not help - when the guy in charge of a country spends eight years dodging and delaying the hearings of corruption charges, I think some people may have taken that as inspiration).

    I have a guess about why Australia hasn't done that, but it's really terribly cynical.
  #+end_quote

  Oh come on hit me with it!!!
#+end_quote

Alright. Your Aboriginal population is below 4% of everyone. Our "previously disadvantaged" is over 80%. When a political party decides which initiatives they're really going to concentrate on, are they going to pick the ones that keep a majority of the voting public happy, or a minority?

I'm going to guess that for (say) some... 75%? Let's say that for 75% of the not-directly-affected population, there's some local or other issue which is far more important in securing their vote than the rights of the previously disadvantaged communities. For Australian political parties, this means that if they ignore the Aboriginals and concentrate on these other issues, they get /way/ more votes at the next election than a party that's really trying to improve the lot of said Aboriginals.

While here, on the other hand, if you're not improving the lot of previously disadvantaged communities, then maybe 80% of the population is ready to give their vote to someone who (at least look like they) /will/. In fact, we literally get people [[https://mg.co.za/tag/service-delivery-protests][staging protests]] because it's not happening fast /enough/.

#+begin_quote
  Nope, never heard of such a thing here. So... obviously different demos!

  I'm a bit of a true crime buff so when you said "horrifying incident" I was expecting a lot worse than it seems like the poor woman got. And over AU$9,000??????????? How long could you live off that in South Africa? Here you'd live off that much money for... maybe six months, and it'd be a really meagre lifestyle.
#+end_quote

Hmmmm. That's... oooh, apparently that's about R80 000. I guess, if you're going for meagre... four years? Seven if you're going for /really/ super meagre and not paying any rent. (That's for one person, of course, and assuming that you never need any medical care or education or anything).

I think that ending with death is about the worst of the stories I've heard. (Other unverified horror stories end up with the victim, having being lured away into a dark alley with all his stuff, being later found naked and maybe with a black eye).

Although we have a lot of criminals, by and large they're not going into crime because they have some deep-seated need to hurt people. Mostly, they're going into crime because they really need (or really want) money - for any of a variety of reasons (including both survival and drug money). And sometimes people will be threatened with guns and things will go wrong and people will be shot (and that's probably where a good bit of our high homicide rate comes from).

  Aww, I'm imagining the second mage's daughter was turned into a vampire, and the daughter had... I don't know, Down's Syndrome or something and couldn't understand to stay out of the sun. That's.... kind of sweet.
#+end_quote

Something like that, yes.

#+begin_quote
  Or just two mages that don't know what the other did: one puts the sleepy spell on, the other puts the sunshine spell on, and then they both realise they fucked up and should have cast the sleepytime spell differently.
#+end_quote

Huh. I hadn't thought of that... but yeah, that works, too.

#+begin_quote
  A sufficiently deep tunnel of the type we can only build in the last ~100 years? All good.
#+end_quote

Just because we couldn't build it before them doesn't mean it didn't exist. What's the world's deepest natural cave formation?

Maybe the eternally-awake vampire lives down in there, instead of moving back and forth between the poles all the time.
