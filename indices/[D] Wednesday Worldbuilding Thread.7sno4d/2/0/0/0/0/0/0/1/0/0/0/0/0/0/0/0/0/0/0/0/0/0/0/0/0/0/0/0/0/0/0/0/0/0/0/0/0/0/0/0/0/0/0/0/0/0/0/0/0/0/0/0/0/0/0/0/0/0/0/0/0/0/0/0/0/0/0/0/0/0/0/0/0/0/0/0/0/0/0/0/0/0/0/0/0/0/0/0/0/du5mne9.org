  More than half the time,the vampires are probably deliberately leaking things into the jannissary network

The janissary network sounds hard to trust, on some level: you know the information is good, or at least has a kernel of truth - but you don't know whether the vampire in question wanted that information or not.

Also, janissaries aren't as easy to manipulate as vampires are: they don't have political motivations beyond wanting to ensure they have a vampire around (they don't much care which), so you have to offer them money - and your rival can just offer a higher price. I mean, unless you threaten them or their family, but a good vampire patron will guard all her janissaries with a ferocious vigor so on a practical level money is the best bet.

After all, unless vampires are cultivating a long-term arrangement with a family of humans - passing down the janissary benefits from mother to daughter and so on - they're going to try and pick out janissaries who aren't going to cause much trouble.

  Elodia seems the sort to actually take the time to learn the 800 BC dialect of Chinese and then merely pretend she doesn't know it, just to gain the advantage here

Human professors of antiquities - the more obscure the civilisation the better - have noticed this strange phenomenon where an intelligent, well-spoken student presents themselves to them. They ask for a fellowship, offering enough money to fund your research for a few years in exchange, and tend to focus most of their effort on reading and writing the language and not seeming to care as much about the culture. But getting funding in antiquities is a tricky business, and the students only come by after hours - at night - for lessons, so they're quite happy to turn a blind eye.

I was thinking about what you were saying about the envelopes and being addressed in scents or the like, a "secret double layer" so to speak, and I remembered that etiquette used to require that you have two envelopes - one inside the other. The idea was that, when mail was delivered by horse and carriage, the letters used to get jostled around a lot and might get dirty or torn. So you'd have the outer envelope which gets the letter to the destination, then the servants of the house would open the letter, discard the outer envelope, and present the inner envelope to the head of the household. This custom [[https://cdnll.invitationsbydawn.com/images/art/cs-inner-outer-envelopeInfographic.gif][has been (somewhat) retained in wedding invitations]].

I imagine this would have been maintained in vampire circles (or originated there - I suppose I shouldn't fall into the trap of giving vampires victorian customs.... I wonder how they addressed letters in ancient Rome?). When a vampire decides to deliver a letter by post (and come on, it's so convenient these days - you can't blame them!), they'd use two envelopes and the outer one would be like:

Mr William Ryan

123 Main Street

Perth, Western Australia 6000

And the inner envelope would be all:

The great and most high King William of New Holland, king by the grace of god; he who fought off the pharisees and maintained order in times of trouble; the scion of Callum; the keeper of the great tomb; the most beloved of my maker; the friend and confidant of Anastasia; etc

Or whatever.

Now I want to write a scene where William teaches Red how to prepare his mail (i.e. opening the outer envelope), and Red just has his eyes bug out at the title thing: except he wouldn't because vampires wouldn't do stuff like that in languages the servants spoke, and anyone William corresponded with would know William made his home in an English-speaking country so could be assume to have English-speaking servants.
