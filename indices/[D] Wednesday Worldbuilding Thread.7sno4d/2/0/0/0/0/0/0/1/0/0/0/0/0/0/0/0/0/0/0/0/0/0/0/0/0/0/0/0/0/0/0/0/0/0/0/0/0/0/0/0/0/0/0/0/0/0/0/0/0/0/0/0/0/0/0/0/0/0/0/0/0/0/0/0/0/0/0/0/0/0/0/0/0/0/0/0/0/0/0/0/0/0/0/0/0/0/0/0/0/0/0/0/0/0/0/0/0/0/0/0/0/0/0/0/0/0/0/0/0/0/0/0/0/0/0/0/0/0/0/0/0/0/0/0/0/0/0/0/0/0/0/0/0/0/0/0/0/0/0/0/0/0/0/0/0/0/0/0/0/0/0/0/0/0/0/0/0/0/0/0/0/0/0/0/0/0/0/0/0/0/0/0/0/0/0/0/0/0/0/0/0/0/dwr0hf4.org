  Yeah - at this point he probably has a bunch of children who have some sense of loyalty to him, and as many ghouls as he can manage (about 5 or 6). A bunch of his children are stationed in duchies of his allies all through the world, and if there's ever a city he wants, he'll spend 100-200 years getting his children in position, then challenge the Monarch of the area for control. Truth be told, it's probably how he got Rome; or perhaps he just decided he wanted it in the power vacuum caused by The Catastrophe and nobody bothered to challenge him. Or maybe he had it since before Then, and that's how he got it. Who knows.

Of course, other vampires his age or older probably have similar long-range planning abilities - even if they don't always approach things in the same manner.

  and to keep some of them keen with vague promises of immortality (which only rarely eventuate).

The promise is probably more along the lines of "immortality as long as you obey me", with the unspoken but nonetheless clearly expressed rider of "death the moment you /stop/ obeying me" - which probably happens fairly often, at least for a few decades at a time, if only because it's easier to keep a working thrall alive than going to the bother of training a /new/ one. (Actually Turning them practically never happens, of course).

  I wonder what his criteria is? Like, does he use his psychic cult and turn the most brainwashed cultists so they'll be loyal to him, even as vampires? Does he use his most devoted/interesting thralls? Does he do that vampire trope of turning people who he's in love with (except I don't want to make that shit common, so probably nixed straight away...)

Hmmm... I imagine that depends on the situation. If he's putting them in someone else's territory, then it has to be someone who completely /despises/ the vampire whose territory he's been put in on a personal level (helps keep their loyalty to him from being usurped).
