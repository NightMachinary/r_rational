  headcanon! plus the vampire god in question can just leave as she pleases, after all, she can sneak out at nighttime through an entrance the cult doesn't know about.

If she bothers to still keep track of day and night, yes. (Presumably she's arranged to get decent wifi down there).

  They send people down to be sacrifices and they wander around until they die of thirst.

Hmmm... it would make sense for there to be signs. "This way", "Down here" (a knotted rope having been helpfully tied to make the descent easier) and, finally, "Wait here".

Then the food is all conveniently in one place and not wandering around poking into places it's not supposed to poke into.

Okay, yeah. That's definitely a downfall.

Notable lack of descriptive writing, but I think that reducing the descriptiveness as Jack's disassociation from the real world grows could be quite effective - disassociating the reader from the fictional world as Jack disassociates herself, kind of thing. (Of course, to make that work, you probably need (a) proper descriptions of things before and after Jack's period of addiction, and (b) completely overdone levels of description of what Jack's addicted to). Mind you, I have no idea whether or not that will actually /work/, but it seems like a thing that could be tried...
