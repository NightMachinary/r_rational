  The problem is - when I use the average vampire growth rate I calculated for 800 vamps in 1700 to become 20,000 vamps in 1900, one vampire takes only 415 years to become 800 vampires. So there's no way that a single bloodline could leave only 800 vampires alive,

Or unless the mutation happened only 415 years before the Catastrophe. (It doesn't /have/ to start with the official founder of the bloodline).

It's worth bearing in mind that, before the Catastrophe, the vampire population was probably in equilibrium - the amount of new vampires being equal to those who died. Now, since there's not much that kills a vampire, this equilibrium could well have been artificial - that is, the planet was divided (by the vampires) into a group of territories, one per vampire, and all vampires were expected to only turn a child vampire if there was an empty territory for that child vampire to claim. (If there were no empty territories, vampires were not above the idea of emptying a territory belonging to someone they didn't much like - which is why alliances were so important, especially to young vampires). And the territories were likely small enough that it was impractical for two vampires to survive in a single territory.

This way, the youngest (and thus weakest) vampires would have been at the greatest risk, and there would be quite a few Especially Ancient vampires hanging about the place, being generally pretty near invulnerable thanks to their great experience.

Of course, this whole 'limited territory' business would go out the window after the Catastrophe, but the entire careful-complicated-diplomacy aspect of it (in which vampires were especially careful not to annoy other vampires) might hang on.
