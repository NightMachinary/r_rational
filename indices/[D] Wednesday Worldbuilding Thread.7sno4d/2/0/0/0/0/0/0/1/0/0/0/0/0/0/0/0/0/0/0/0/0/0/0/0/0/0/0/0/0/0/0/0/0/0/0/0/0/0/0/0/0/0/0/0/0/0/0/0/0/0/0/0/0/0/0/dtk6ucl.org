  Smarter or better educated?

Oh yeah. He was always smart, but gets better at that. But mostly it's the education, but some of that is because we're two university-educated millennials trying to write an uneducated 1940s steel worker: we give him a set of encyclopedias to be able to handwave a lot of it. (And because the day wouldn't be complete without another excerpt, here's the obligatory "Christmas Interlude" showing William giving them to Red).

  Sounds reasonable, as long as those words are all working towards the primary or secondary narrative arcs and not just wandering all over the landscape for no reason.

That's the problem with romance: my husband's main problem with the first draft was that you didn't get any... romance content, like, you didn't get any scenes of the guys /liking/ each other, so I added some romantic stuff in, and it's hard to say that's not vital when really them playing fetch with the dog and flirting isn't actually plot relevant, except in that if there were no such scenes there's nothing that makes you believe an actual romance is occurring.

So it's kind of hard to toe that line, having some meaningful romantic scenes but also keeping it tight and snappy. I think I erred too much on the "tight and snappy" side last time, partly because I haven't really written romance stuff before in a way that required detailed description, so it was kind of hard to do. (And I mean like... is someone holding someone's hand, is the hand around the waist, how do you describe kissing, etc: not "how many synonyms can I think of for genitals")

/Christmas Eve, 1944/

There hadn't been much in the way of decoration, but that was fairly typical across all of Europe right now. People made do.

Red had relocated a small pine tree into the living room and decorated it sparsely. There had been more decorations before, handmade, but thrown away. Red didn't mention it.

When William woke at sunset, Red was there, as he always was. This time he was reading.

“Good evening, my dear.”

Red set his book on his lap to stroke William's hair. “Did you sleep well?”

“I did.”

Red paused for a moment, then retrieved something from the dresser drawer. A package about six inches by three inches, wrapped in paper that was decorated in drawings of spindle flowers. Simple graphite on plain paper. It was obviously not something Red drew. “I got you something.”

“Oh? Thank you.” William took the package, examining the paper as he untied the string. It contained a vase, six inches in height, porcelain covered in a dazzling glaze that shone in green, black and silver. Pewter leaves encircled the mouth and base of the vase.

His mind automatically interrogated the vase for meaning: everything about it came together to tell of a young romance that the giver wished to pursue to its fullest extent. The colours (the shade of green: respect and affection; the proportion of black: something new; the hint of silver: something highly valued), the shape (a slight teardrop: matters of the heart), and even the size (proportional to a hand in height and width: a desire to work). The angle of the leaves was even appropriately chosen for a gift given in recognition of the winter solstice.

To Red, William was studying the vase closely, with the same care he looked over anything else he picked up on a shopping trip; or with the same keen eye he studied the array of letters and packages other vampires sent him.

“This is absolutely exquisite. Thank you.” He said, his voice full of sincerity.

“You're welcome. I'm glad you like it.”

William paused. “If you don't mind getting out of bed, I can give you your gift, as well.”

“Sure. Did you want me to get changed?” Red asked, getting out of the warm bed; William had a demeaning habit of making major or minute adjustments to his clothing on anything that William deemed an important occasion. It was harmless, if irritating.

William glanced at the extensive creases on Red's shirt. “If you could change your shirt. The striped green one, if it is pressed.” He said, climbing out of bed and pulling on a pair of navy pants.

“It is, no thanks to that steam iron you like so much.” Red grinned, unbuttoning his shirt.

“Good.” William pulled his own shirt on and selected a belt. Despite the weather, he wore short sleeves.

“How do I look?” Red grinned, placing his hands on his hips and thrusting his chest out.

“Perfect. Now come.” William led Red to the store room, where all his trunks and the dozens of things Red had bought for him were kept. He knelt beside one of the trunks, unlocked it carefully, and fished out what looked like a full Encyclopaedia Britannica. He pulled out five or six volumes at a time, stacking them neatly on top of another trunk.

“Unfortunately, I didn't think to wrap them.”

Red is silent, one arm folded across his chest and the other pressed gently against his mouth. “How could you have? How many are there?”

“Twenty-nine volumes in all.”

Red walked up to William, and kissed him on the cheek. “I love it. Thank you.”
