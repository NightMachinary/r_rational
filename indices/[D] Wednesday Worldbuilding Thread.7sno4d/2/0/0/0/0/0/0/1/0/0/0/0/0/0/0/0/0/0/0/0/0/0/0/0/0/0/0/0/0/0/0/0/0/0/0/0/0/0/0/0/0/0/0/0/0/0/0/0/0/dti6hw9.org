~THE POWER OF LOVE~

aaand since it's been 24 hours since I posted an excerpt in this thread, here's a real rough draft of William's internal monologue immediately following the thing I sent you most recently as William is like "wait, what did I just do? why did I declare war? that is so out of character for me!".

  at what point is taking a 50% chance on immortality worth it?

That's a tricky question: I mean, the second you get diagnosed with terminal cancer or something is probably a pretty good time. But you could get hit by a bus tomorrow, so you know... (or be driving at high speed while that friend of mine is texting in the next lane...)

William couldn't believe it.

He had been so stupid.

Why did he trust that a human, so inexperienced, would be able to perform the cup service?

Why hadn't he insisted on Lucia filling that role? Surely his human wouldn't be able to mess up something as simple as heating blood? Why hadn't that man - no, boy, what human can really be called a man? - why hadn't that boy listened when he said what to do in the event of a spill?

He'd taught humans in less time. Never perfectly, but he hadn't cared if they made mistakes. If they angled the cold cup too far to the left, he would let his counterpart take their prize; a small concession, perhaps a letter of recommendation, a small gift, a position of minor power in his kingdom, or his presence at an event he would otherwise have skipped.

He had not heard of a vampire requesting the human's life as payment since - well, it had to be before that time, back before they had reason to be concerned about stealth.

And any other time, with any other man - there he was, thinking man about the boy again - he would have let Elodia have her prize, held the boy still as she tore at its neck, drank it dry, maybe even demanded that pleasure for himself in the negotiation.

And he had declared war! A war, when he was travelling and did not have access to all of his supplies, when his opponent had every advantage but experience.

Why had he done that? Without even a thought?

His reputation - his precious, long-cultivated reputation - would be in ruin for his stubbornness. He was known for his lack of self control, for disposing of janissaries at twice the normal rate, so much so that people did not lend him their favourites. What would people think, if the heard he denied a reasonable request? The opera had changed no minds, brought forth no new fashion; his involvement with Red would be a high scandal.

Elodia had a reputation, too. She liked to flex her political muscle, and killing Red - which she had every right to do, under the circumstances - certainly would accomplish that. She must have been thrilled when he declared war on her. Was that her plan all along, in making such a demand? Did she know of the details of his relationship with Red? That he'd do anything to keep that boy's - that man's - heart beating?

He doubted it. William hadn't known himself, until he acted.
