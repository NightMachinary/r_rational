Was thinking more about Julias (gargoyle) last night (and discussing with Computer Scientist/Psychologist Partner). I've determined some more stuff about him - namely, he's not more intelligent than an intelligent human, and he probably thinks in a humanlike way. He doesn't "think like a computer", and he's not like an Asimovian robot who physically can't disobey a human: he is more a person with a very rigid and inhuman moral framework and different wants/needs. It doesn't change his behaviour in any way; it actually brings his description closer to what I actually think of him as. So that's good.

So I'm going to rewrite the interlude to be more like the way a human would think, because the fact he's prioritising things differently is enough.

The "pseudocode" stuff I wrote isn't what a computer would actually think like (partner has expertise in AI), so yeah, it's a non-starter either way, and writing something that looks like an AI decision tree would not be as interesting and/or would be super long.
