... what purpose would that have? Vampires talking to one another in a more obfuscated way? (so that way someone who knows ancient mongolian will still be confused because the other half of the conversation is in navajo?)

It's not really come up, strangely enough. This is the closest I can think of:

--------------

The part of the city that William showed Red that evening was full of strange and new things he didn't recognise. There were beggars who hid their faces beneath thick shawls, the smells of spices and clouds of thick incense the likes of which he had never experienced before, the sound of discordant music. It was hard to believe that such a place could have existed so near to the hotel he worked at, and that he had never happened across it before.

People stared at him as he walked, half a step behind William, trying to take it all in. People stopped talking when they got close, some giving awkward bows when William was within a few feet, and not looking up until he had passed.

Red was glad it wasn't just him who had that urge.

When he tried to return the next day, he almost couldn't find it again. When he did finally find the alleyway that led to the strange street he could swear he had passed the two shops sandwiching it (a shop exclusively selling flower vases and another selling jewelry that had spikes on the underside) three times before he spotted the entrance. The archway to the neighbourhood looked warmer, more welcoming in the light of day.

During daylight, it was much different; there were fewer people about, and no beggars at all. Perhaps that had been why he had so much trouble finding his way back. The few people who he saw did not stare, did not bow. There were a few small glances out of the corner of their eyes, a few whispers when they thought he couldn't see. So he still felt exposed and awkward, just in an altogether different way.

He saw the grand concert hall, with large posters proclaiming the shows that were put on inside. He did not recognise the names of any of them, but that was not surprising; he was not exactly a patron of the local arts. He stood out the front, taking in the strange names, and looking at the dates. Each performance seemed to have only one or two showings, but rather than being on consecutive nights they were showing weeks apart. He wondered what lead to such an arrangement. It didn't sound very profitable.

As he examined the posters, a woman came up to him. She was wearing a heavy red robe that covered her entire body, including her face. There was a thick mesh screen covering her eyes, and he could see the glint of a pair of black glasses through the mesh.

“Who are you?” She hissed at him in broken Italian. “What is your business?”

Red was quite surprised at receiving such an unprovoked, frosty reception. And in worse Italian than his own, no less. “I want to buy a...” Red searched for the word but was not able to find it in his limited Italian vocabulary. He gestured vaguely, outlining a square with his hands. “A big box?” He said finally, weakly.

The woman's manner seemed to soften, though it was hard to be sure with only the most basic outline of her form being visible. “A-ha! On a job for your master?”

Red tried not to cringe; his master? Her Italian was definitely worse than his. He had to remind himself he was in no place to be judge. “Yes. My boss needs one for... things.” Okay, he really couldn't be judgemental about it.

She touched him gently on the shoulder. It felt unpleasant and made him think of swimming and having his foot scrape something on the bottom. She gestured for him to follow her. “Come to my shop. I am going to help.”

Red followed, wondering about the wisdom of the decision; he had not seen her shop, so he couldn't even be sure that she would have anything appropriate. William had been quite emphatic about the importance of quality of the trunk. Moreover, he had never seen someone dressed in a shroud as this woman was. It was beginning to get warm out. She would have to be sweltering under that thing; he could only imagine what it would be like in June. Maybe she didn't wear this every day. Or maybe it was a religious thing. Red had never met a nun before. Maybe she was a nun. Nuns would have to be trustworthy. He relaxed.

[...]

The shrouded woman watched Red intently as he ran his hand over the lid of one, feeling the grain, thinking. “They please you?”

“Maybe.” Red didn't know which to choose, or if he should be choosing these ones at all. Apart from difference in the carved designs on the front and the colour of the wood, they seemed identical to him. He decided to open them and examine the hinges and clasps. Those would be the most likely places for the trunk to fail, he reasoned.

[...]

“I'll take this one.”

The shrouded woman moved her head up and down in an exaggerated mirror of his nod. “Very good. Carry it to the front. Do you want me to wrap it in paper?”

Red shook his head. “No. That won't be necessary.”

She made a small hissing sound, apparently irritated, and walked to the front of the shop where the cash register was.

Problem with the above is neither of the characters speak Italian terribly well and they both are just talking about immediate concerns (shopping).
