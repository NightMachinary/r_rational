  I'm glad you like the POW idea: it does seem to work the best. I'm not sure how quickly after the surrender that POWs actually ended up home, though. Red leaves Corsica basically one week after the official surrender....

In the 1940s, there wasn't anything nearly like modern communications - Red himself would probably be the best source of information on the process of POW reinstatement in the entire village in any case. (Unless a retired army officer comes through a year or so down the line and starts picking holes in Red's story).

So, unless he already has a reputation for being untrustworthy, it doesn't matter if he's exactly on time or not...

  I wonder whether, if Red was like, "look, I escaped about six months ago, but I don't want to talk about how I did it or where I was.", whether townspeople would pressure him to, you know, announce it and get a purple heart or whatever or whether they'd be understanding of his request for privacy?

I imagine some would pressure him and some would not.

  It's probably much of a muchness: I'm not doing any deep conversations with Red and townspeople about his time in the "POW camp", so the details can be left vague as Red probably left them. I'm guessing, realistically speaking, people who eagerly asked Red for details of what the POW camp was like, when met with grunts and "I don't want to talk about it - battle fatigue(1940s!PTSD)", wouldn't go any further and there might be rumours about him escaping "because he got back a lot earlier than Jim Johnson, who was in one of the nazi camps, don't you know"/"and I got a look at his identification card and it had some French name on it, I think he escaped/is trying to hide from the nazis"/"he says he learned French from other prisoners, but I think he was hiding in Belgium for a while. Who can blame him: little Reginald was always so jumpy, he probably had no idea how to contact the Americans"; but non substantiated.

Yep. All looks good.

  [Julias' interlude]

Some other solutions for consideration:

- Repair relationship by forging a letter of apology from William to Red (and sending it to Red)

- Stage accident(s) to kill anyone else Romantic Object gets close to in order to force him back (impractical amount of travelling to/from America involved)

As another note; Julias may be unfamiliar with Master's preferences, but Red clearly fulfilled them. So candidates for 'new romantic object' should start out with 'similar appearance/personality to former romantic object' and work from there.
