  If the vampire skull has a coating of, titanium or whatever, why isn't that over the whole body? I like the image of a vampire being shot, the bullets passing harmlessly through her as she gripes about her clothing being ruined.

Simple, immediate solution - it does apply everywhere, but only to her bones; bullets still ruin clothes, smash through skin, and so on.

  So, let's do it a different way: people can have half of their brain /removed/ and still seem to be the same person (maybe they're not, but they act and feel as though they are and don't seem to lose memories). Vampire brains grow back, and as long as too much brain tissue isn't lost, they can grow back and little is lost.

That also works. Have you ever heard of a concept called /forward error correction/? That's basically the principle by which the above would work.

In short, you have a set of data. You turn this into a much larger set of data, so that you can regenerate the whole data set even if a portion of the data is lost. (This is how a CD can still be readable if it has a scratch or two).

So, the human brain may already have /some/ level of forward error correction. Vampires might have a far higher level, and thus be able to retain the contents of their heads even in the face of substantially more damage.

  I think the best solution to this is to just give the vampires "bullet time" /matrix/-style - despite their name, silencers are very loud, so vampires could easily hear a bullet, use their super speed to look around for it, and then limbo below the bullet.

Not gonna work, unfortunately - bullets travel faster than sound, so by the time the sound of the bullet reaches the vampire, it's too late to dodge. It doesn't matter how fast he is...
