  The vampire is stronger, faster, smarter than an average human, functionally immune to most weapons, and next to immortal. They might not much care about humans on average, but they are going to care about large disruptions to their food supply.

I think a native vampire is not going to mind unless they care a lot about the native human culture, or they have a particularly well-honed cult around them. I mean, look at it from their point of view: you've got a group of humans you eat from and you live your leisurely vampire life. Suddenly, a bunch of people in ships and funny clothes show up. They can't possibly harm you - sure, they can harm your humans, but humans are fungible. They bring with them /more people/, which is great for you, and probably some technology or whatever that the vampire might enjoy (even if it's just literature).

There probably are vampires who are benevolent masters of their human herds, and they'd try to fight the colonists off, but the general rule I'd imagine would be "more humans? yum!".

  How could any colonialism in any land manage to succeed, unless the colonists included vampires from the start?
#+end_quote

Probably vampires were a "worldwide force" before colonialism happened. They can turn into bats, after all, so they'd be able to travel around the world and they certainly had the time to do so. So I'd imagine that outside some really remote islands, vampires would spread throughout the world pretty well: younger vampires would be more "local stock" and older vampires would be more likely to be diverse, since ageing gives you access to Bat Form and thus unfettered travel. Though the more isolated the location, the more likely the Monarchs are going to be from local stock because there's less competition for them.

Has an odd corollary: imagine Australia, before European colonisation. ~1 million inhabitants, which works out to be 3-10 vampires depending on density. Now, Australia has ~20 million, so 60-200 vampires. I'd imagine that vampires care more about areas the more densely populated they are, so in early European settlement, vampires might not want to go there that much, but now, in the Present Day, with 3 or 4 decently large cities, vampires might want to displace the existing owners. I don't know if I'm communicating this well, but what I'm visualising is after humans invade a new land, vampires don't give a shit about it for a few generations. So there's two "waves" of colonialism: the first wave where the humans displace the native humans, and a second wave where vampires displace the native vampires as the locations become more desirable.

So probably William displaced some younger vampire (say, 200 years old), but that young vampire remained in the territory - I'd imagine William would give her a Duchy. The rest of Australia probably had one or two old native vampires and an assortment of youngsters. The old ones either kept/defended their lands or were displaced. Maybe the convenience of ships meant that some of the native vampires decided to see the world.

  (Actually, that implies that a young vampire can disobey his sire with impunity, as long as he can find an equally-powerful Elder Vampire to act as his 'sponsor', supporting his efforts and protecting him from his sire).
#+end_quote

True; so sires would very closely limit the contact their progeny has with anyone more powerful than them. And more powerful vampires would try and sneak in to get with rival progeny, as young vampires can go out in the sun, making them particularly dangerous to their makers.

Let's think on terminology:

Sire & progeny is the most vampire-y

I kind of want something like "pup" or "cub". Just something that is a bit different. But being different for the sake of being different is not great. I do think "cub" has a connotation that is less respectful than progeny, which I like. Sire works for animals so it doesn't seem out of place with a counterpart like "cub" but has a much more important tone of respect.

  Or he's just really, really irritated by ... William's habit of wearing red ties
#+end_quote

"Seriously your majesty! I know the shades of red have different meanings, but why do you always do red whenever you possibly could??? I mean, why not try, instead of pale red for 'respect for a youngster', try something like turquoise for 'acknowledgement of the agency of the youth'? It's pretty much the same thing but you can stop looking like a fuckin' cartoon character."

...or something.
