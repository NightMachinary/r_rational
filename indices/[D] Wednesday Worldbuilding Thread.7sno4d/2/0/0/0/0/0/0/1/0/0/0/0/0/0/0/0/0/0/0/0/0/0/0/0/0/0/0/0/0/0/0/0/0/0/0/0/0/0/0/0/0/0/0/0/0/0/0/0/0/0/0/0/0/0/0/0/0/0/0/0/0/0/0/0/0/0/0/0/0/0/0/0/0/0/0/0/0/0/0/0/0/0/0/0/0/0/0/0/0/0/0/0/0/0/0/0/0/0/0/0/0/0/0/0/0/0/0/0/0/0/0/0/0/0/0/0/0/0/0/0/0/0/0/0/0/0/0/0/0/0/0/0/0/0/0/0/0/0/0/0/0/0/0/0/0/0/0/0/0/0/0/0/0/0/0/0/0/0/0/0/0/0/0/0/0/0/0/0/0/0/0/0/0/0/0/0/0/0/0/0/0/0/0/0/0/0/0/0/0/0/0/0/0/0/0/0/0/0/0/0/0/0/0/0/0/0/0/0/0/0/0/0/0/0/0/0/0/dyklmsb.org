  And if William is predicting it, then surely the other senior vampires are predicting it too?

Some are predicting it, some are predicting it'll still be untrendy later on.

I guess it's kind of like name trends - with /Twilight/, Isabella seems to have been popular largely at the same time as the book/movie phenomenon, but other names in the story like Jacob and Edward didn't. (Jacob was already a hugely popular name, Isabella has a huge peak). Anna has a small spike in popularity coinciding with /Frozen/; Elsa has a massive one. And Hans, Sven, and Olaf didn't spike at all.

So some movies have "hot" elements, some don't catch on so much. So William's thinking the human thing will be hot; turns out it's a dud.

  I think it's a good thing to require the average reader to reach for a dictionary once in the entire story

Very true! The only word that's like that in the story is janissary, and that passes through pretty quietly. I don't think anyone's going to reach for a dictionary with the reference to "adultery"; they just might be confused about the lack of wives in the picture.

And in the reader's mind it'll take the form of something like, "oh, William's moved Red to his house in Australia, he has a wife there doesn't he? I remember it was mentioned somewhere that William had a wife" - they won't remember the word adultery got them there.

Again, doesn't matter anyway.
