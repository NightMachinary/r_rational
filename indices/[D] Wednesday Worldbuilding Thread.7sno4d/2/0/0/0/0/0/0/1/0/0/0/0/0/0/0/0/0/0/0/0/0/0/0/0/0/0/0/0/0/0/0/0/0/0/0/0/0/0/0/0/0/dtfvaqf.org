  No, if you want to stop that then you have to either be sneakier, or develop a reputation for brutally killing any vampire who tries pulling that nonsense on you.

Nah, "william engaging in pleasantries" was actually William doing the only thing he could do to save Red: just not what Red was hoping at the time. (Red was hoping William would order his rival's thrall to stop trying to kill Red; Red was also hoping the thrall, who he had befriended, was not going to kill him; instead the thrall was holding a knife to Red's throat and William was just standing there talking instead of grabbing the thrall.

Heck, here's the excerpt in question because why not:

--------------

[Red fucks up at serving a ritual meal]

“What hapless idiot do you deem worthy of serving us?” Elodia said in French; clearly, she wanted Red to hear.

“I beg your forgiveness, your grace.” William replied. “I shall be happy to provide you with the appropriate reparations for this inconvenience.”

“I want that thing destroyed.”

Red flinched, stepping backwards. He knew he shouldn't have moved, that he was making things worse, but if she was going to move on him he wanted as much distance as possible. Every second would count when it came time to draw his weapon.

“Your grace, you should not give the most extreme penalty for a slave's first offense.”

“I am the wronged. You know I have the right to mandate the penalty. LUCIA!” Elodia called. “As you refuse to mete out the punishment, King William of New Holland, I shall have my slave do it in your stead.”

Lucia answered Elodia's call, entering the dining room. She took stock of the situation and hung her head, bending slightly and hitching up her skirt to take a dagger out of a sheath that was attached to her thigh. Red moved to grab his own dagger out of the sheath that was hidden in the back of his pants. He wondered if Lucia's was also silver.

“Put your weapon away, or her grace will do it herself, and she shall be far less kind.” Lucia's eyes were full of pity as she approached Red.

Red looked to William. He couldn't believe what was happening. Surely William would be able to stop Lucia? Her dagger didn't scare him, did it? The entire American army hadn't given him any pause, so what was one woman with one puny weapon?

“Don't. I'm sorry, I...” Red tried to keep his composure, wondering how long a silver knife could hold a vampire off. “I didn't mean anything by it, I didn't...” He gave William a furtive glance, but he made no move to intervene.

“I do not accept the punishment you have proposed. I offer instead full use of four janissaries, a place for yourself or one of your allies in one of my larger cities, and my assurance that you will never lay eyes upon this human again. That is more than generous, for this slave has never offended before.”

Lucia calmly grabbed Red with strength he immediately knew he could not equal. He attempted to wrench his arm away to break her hold, the way he had been taught in basic, and knew he had as much chance of breaking her grip as a bird did to a cat. He stabbed at her with his dagger; she grabbed the blade in her hand, pulling it out of his grip, not seeming to mind the crimson blood that dripped out of her palm after she threw it to the ground.

“No. I have the right to declare the punishment.” Elodia said, louder, glaring at Red.

“Then I declare war.” William stated still louder, with a flat, confident tone.

Lucia moved to stand behind Red, holding her dagger to his neck. The blood from her hand started staining his new suit. He could feel the hair on the back of his neck begin to get stained with his sweat.

“You declare war? Over a useless slave such as this?” Elodia gestured to Red, her voice growing shrill.

“Please, William. Please.” Red could feel the blade on his neck, bit his bottom lip, and closed his eyes. Was this any better than if he had just died on the beach that day?

“Yes. And my first act in this war shall be kidnapping your favoured slave.”

All of a sudden, the pressure on his neck disappeared. Red opened his eyes, and there was William, standing in front of him, gently holding Lucia's wrist.

“Go to the servant's quarters at once.”

Lucia looked to Elodia. Elodia gave a slight nod, her eyes cold.

“Yes, your majesty.” Lucia said, sheathing her dagger and going for the stairs. She made eye contact with Red and gave him a small smile. He looked away, not understanding what was happening.

Elodia produced a small glass vial from somewhere under her preposterously poofy skirt.

“By providing you this sample of my blood, I declare that I wish to resolve this without immediate combat.” Elodia recited. She gave William a withering look as she bit a small hole in her left wrist and bled into the vial. She handed it to him and went to the kitchen.

Red looked at William, his hand on his throat. His heart was thudding in his ears, his lungs burning as though he had just run for hours. “What... How...”

“Duchess Elodia is quite upset.”

“What just...?”

“I have forced her hand by kidnapping Lucia.”

Red could feel his throat closing, his eyes prickling. The situation was just beginning to register in the deepest parts of him. Lucia had her knife right there, she was his friend and she had every intention of killing him and William did not try to stop her, until...

Red didn't understand what had happened. He didn't understand what he had done wrong. He didn't understand how Elodia could be so mad at him. And he didn't understand why William would kidnap Lucia. Wouldn't that just make her angrier?

He looked back up at William, who was standing there in his long black coat and white cravat. The small vial of Elodia's blood was in his hand. And he was giving Red that look, the look that said the only thing stopping him from grabbing him and holding him for hours was the fact they were in public. That made Red's chest ache even worse than before.

As Red was beginning to work up the nerve to run to William despite the potential for further scandal that may bring, Elodia reappeared. Her four janissaries were in tow, the ridiculous green costumes that two of them had been wearing being replaced with more ordinary attire. Odette's face was even more sour than before, if such a thing was possible. Jacques and Florence, too, looked rather disappointed. Victor seemed disappointed, too, but Red knew that was only because his reading had been interrupted.

Elodia stood in front of William, met his gaze, and with a dramatic turn, she escorted her entourage out of the house.

Red couldn't resist now. He ran to William, who took a step towards him to hug him tightly, kissing the side of his head.

“I'm sorry, god, I'm so sorry.” He exhaled into the scratchy material of William's cravat, his breath only just starting to move past the knot of panic in his chest. “I'm sorry.”

“You have nothing to fear.” William soothed.

“What happened? Why?”

“Duchess Elodia and I are now at war.”

“War?”

“We shall negotiate the rules of engagement shortly. Now come, let us clean this mess.” William seemed calm as ever.

Red swallowed, trying to get his throat to relax enough to speak properly. “Did you just say you're at war?”

“Fear not. I doubt we shall be mobilising armies. That has not been fashionable for some time.”

“But...” Red didn't understand. “Why?”

“It seemed the easiest way to resolve the situation.” William said calmly, gently stroking Red's hair.

“What happens if you lose?”

“What have I told you, my dear? I shall not lose.”

Red hadn't doubted William when he said he did not fear the American army; but something about the way he stood, the way he spoke, and the way he had acted around Elodia... Red did not feel that same, unalienable confidence from him this time.
