  But you're showing steady improvement, right?
#+end_quote

Still sick, but yeah, improved from yesterday. I'm going through pain medicine like crazy (ibuprofen/paracetemol), and by like crazy I mean "in exactly the quantities my doctor recommended and no more because i don't want to damage my liver i'm not some sort of damn idiot".

  Myself, I quite enjoyed the first book - I do like a good adventure story.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I don't think it was for me, or possibly it's a timing thing: I started watching Stargate about 15 years ago, and I know if I saw my first episode today I'd think it was stupid. But instead I idly think to myself that Jack and Daniel are OTP and wonder if we'll ever get that damn reboot.

  Have you ever read Asimov's short story, "...That Thou Art Mindful Of Him"?
#+end_quote

Yep, it was a different take than the usual though. Subverting the trope. You can definitely subvert tropes, that's fun and good.

Great - now I want to find a list of romance tropes to subvert - okay here's one and it's long maybe not [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTropes]] - I know, I'll just search for gay and see how I'm doing, trope-wise

I'm probably playing into [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayGuySeeksPopularJock][this one]] a bit, though the closet means different things to each of them.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGaysArePromiscuous][This one]] no, I don't think so, though I guess that's in the eye of the beholder. There's no "quivering member" scenes but a few "kiss then fade to black" scenes, maybe too many for some peoples' tastes.

We've tried not to fall for [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasculineFeminineGayCouple][this one]] since it's so pervasive, but I'm sure /somebody/ would try to put Red and William into the boxes. But each of them has "feminine" traits (Red: short, young, inexperienced, no power/William: cares about his appearance, obsessed with social reputation, more passive in the relationship) and "masculine" traits (Red: army, strong, manly job, strong sense of honour/discipline/William: vampire strength, ego).

  Whooops. I thought the "obvious placeholders" were the bits in square brackets only.
#+end_quote

Nope... how about from now on you just assume that anything terrible I write is an obvious placeholder, thus making me a ~perfect writer~!

(and for the hands thing - Coauthor writes Red a lot and I knew he'd do something with his hands but not what, so I wrote that specifically to alert her to the fact that she should write something in there).

#+begin_quote
  It is a lot better now, yes. I think that the description of the room is necessary - readers need to be able to see the scene in their heads, and the more you dress up the scene the better their ideas of it will match with yours.
#+end_quote

I think there are a lot of rooms/scenes that are used more that don't get that much treatment, but I also think that describing Paola's room really gets you into her head and sets up her next appearance. The swords are in case she needs to defend the hotel patrons on short notice. The lockers contain guns that appear later on (if she needs them in an emergency, she'll just rip the lockers open, natch). The window is her own big personal "fuck you i can sit in the sun" to vampirekind - maybe I should write that there's a place above the window where the curtainrod had been ripped out. But she's meticulous so she would have painted over it, probably. She only appears once more and then vanishes forever, so she probably needs the little bit of personality.
