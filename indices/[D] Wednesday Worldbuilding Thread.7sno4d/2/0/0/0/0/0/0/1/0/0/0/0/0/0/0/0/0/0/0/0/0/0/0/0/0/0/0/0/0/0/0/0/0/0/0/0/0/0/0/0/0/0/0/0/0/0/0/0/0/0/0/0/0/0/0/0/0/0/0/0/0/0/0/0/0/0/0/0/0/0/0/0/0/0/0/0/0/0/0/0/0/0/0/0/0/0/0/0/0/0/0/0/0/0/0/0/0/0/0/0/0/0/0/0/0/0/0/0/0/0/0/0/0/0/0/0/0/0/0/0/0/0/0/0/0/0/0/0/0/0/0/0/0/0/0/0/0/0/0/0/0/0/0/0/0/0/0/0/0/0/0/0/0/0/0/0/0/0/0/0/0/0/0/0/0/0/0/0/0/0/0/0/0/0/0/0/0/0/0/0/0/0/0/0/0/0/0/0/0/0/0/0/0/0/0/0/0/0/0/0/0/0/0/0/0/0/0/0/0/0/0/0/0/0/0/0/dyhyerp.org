  William kills another vampire in the story ... and he does it by fighting them hand to hand (and creaming them because he's old) and then setting the house on fire. I think that's probably the easiest way to do it.
#+end_quote

That's certainly one way for a vampire to do it. A (human) vampire hunter would be best helped by taking advantage of the Daylight Torpor, since he won't be able to handle vampire strength otherwise.

  What do you mean by "actually attached"? Oh, wait, I think I got it - as it stands now, if another vampire sees him with a devoted human lover, they think, "oh, William is really good at pretending to care about humans! He must be smart, patient, and spend his time well because humans require so much of it", the same way I'm impressed with people who have very well-trained dogs? And upon finding out that William /actually is in love with Red/, the reaction might be the same as if someone told me they were actually in love with their well-trained dog? As in, firstly, could you have a meaningful relationship with an animal; and secondly, /eew/?
#+end_quote

You have it exactly. (In fact, thinking about it, the relationship between the average vampire and their thrall is going to be pretty close to human-with-well-trained-dog).

  The vampire-human trend is something William's predicting;
#+end_quote

And if William is predicting it, then surely the other senior vampires are predicting it too?

#+begin_quote
  Yes I have! It's good fun. I've played a varient called the dictionary game (I think) where you get one of those big unabridged dictionaries and look up words and people have to make up definitions (so it's the same as that one sub-game of balderdash).
#+end_quote

And good for vocabulary as well.

While no book should have the average reader reaching for a dictionary every page, I think it's a good thing to require the average reader to reach for a dictionary once in the entire story; and Balderdash is an incredible resource of poorly-known words. (Pratchett was a /master/ at this).
