  so if anything Elodia is taking the fall - but for her ironclad alibi.
#+end_quote

Ironclad alibis could mean 'I got one of my janissaries to do it'. You know, after having armed him with a suitable weapon and made sure there was no way to trace him back. Cassius might need proof before he kills Elodia over it (lest her more powerful allies take exception) but I imagine she takes a significant social/political hit to her reputation in any case.

William, on the other hand, uses the fact that he does /not/ have an alibi to suggest that he didn't know the hit was coming and therefore cannot possibly be guilty - and besides, it was /surely/ an accident and occurred in Blank's territory in any case.

(Elodia probably hates this explanation because it makes her alibi look bad, but she can't say a thing because if she gets into a fight with William over this, it's going to end up in a great big he-said-she-said disagreement, which William is going to win (because he is more socially popular with the other vampires), taking a large social hit in the process while she gets executed outright; the other vampires recognise that she's keeping deliberately silent but they think she's just angry that William is making her look bad and she's got nothing on him so she can't do a thing about it; even those who suspect that William might have something to blackmail her with think that it might be that William has proof of her guilt and he's sitting on it because Elodia is more useful to him forced to do what he says than dead; which means that, despite having lost the war, William is winning the social game and feeling quite smug).

Hmmmm. Does that sound anywhere near reasonable?
