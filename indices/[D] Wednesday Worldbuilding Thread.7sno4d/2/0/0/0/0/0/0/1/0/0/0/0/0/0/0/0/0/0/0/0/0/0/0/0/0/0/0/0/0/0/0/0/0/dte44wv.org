Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiine. The average human is an idiot. It's probably why so many vampires die before they get to a certain point.

(Great now I'm thinking of a guy I knew who would text while driving on high-speed roads.... I got SO MAD)

So, we have kind of tapped this well dry, I guess. If you want to continue pulling apart the worldbuilding in my story, here's another excerpt. If you don't, then no need to reply: I will take that to mean "thank you for the lovely chat, and I will see you around".

--------------

Yolande knocked gently on her master's door. “My lord?”

“Yes?”

“The messenger said that his majesty found the rain rather charming.”

Cassius paused, taking a moment to compose a reply. “Have him tell King William that my marigolds did not seem any better for it.” In context, the mention of something failing to grow would tell that Cassius thought William's desire to take on this human remained incomprehensible to him, especially given William's history. And the mention of marigolds served to emphasise the young American man was not in safe hands. He enjoyed the irony of the night porter sending a message predicting his own doom.

He got out of his chair, picking a heavy, wax-sealed envelope off a shelf. “And have the messenger deliver this.” In the letter, Cassius confirmed that William could take the human for his own use, and outlined the sorts of favours that he would one day expect in exchange.

“As you wish, my lord.” Yolande replied.

He nodded. “You are dismissed.”

“Thank you, my lord.” She curtsied, and rushed over to the drawing room where the messenger was waiting to receive the second letter and the third cryptic remark of the evening.

Yolande pondered over what she'd just heard. She had been doing this job for Cassius for a hundred and twenty years. Back in her youth, before she had gotten involved in all of this, it was popular for friends and suitors to send each other messages using flowers. Each bloom had its own meaning: there were dictionaries printed that kept track of them all. She fondly remembered giving a card featuring a drawing of a mimosa flower to an overly eager suitor. The flower - a symbol of chastity - had told him that she would not provide him with what he was after.

She had known for a long time that her master's letters and gifts were like that, but there was no dictionary that could begin to decipher them.

She idly wondered if her master's mention of marigolds meant that there had been a recent death, for they were the flowers of grief.

The part about the marigolds I am really reconsidering after what we discussed in the towel scene; probably too many bits are being transferred.

Really I should work out what the whole exchange means (it is, for the record, "my master hopes you are enjoying the current weather"/"my master found the rain rather charming"/"my master says his marigolds did not seem the better for it") and then reword the passage.

"current weather" though, in context, probably means "this American servant, who is standing here, speaking to you"; "the rain" has to have meaning, because there was no recent rain, but on the whole it seems to communicate that William is enjoying the servant; and the marigolds line, in context, seems clear that although the rain is charming (the servant is good), the marigolds will not grow (marigolds = grief)... maybe I should swap the marigolds for something else, or just swap it out for "and I believe my marigolds will be in full bloom faster than expected".
