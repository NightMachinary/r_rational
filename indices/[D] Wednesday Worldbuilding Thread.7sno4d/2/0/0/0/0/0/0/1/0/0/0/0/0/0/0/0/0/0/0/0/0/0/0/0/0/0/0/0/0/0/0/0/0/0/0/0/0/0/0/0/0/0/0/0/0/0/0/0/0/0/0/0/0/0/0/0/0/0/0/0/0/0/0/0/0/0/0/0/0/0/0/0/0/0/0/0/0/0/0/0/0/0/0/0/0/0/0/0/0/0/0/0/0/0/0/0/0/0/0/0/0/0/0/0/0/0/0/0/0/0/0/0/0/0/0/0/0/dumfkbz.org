  ...taking a closer look at the story, it looks like he didn't precisely /break/ the rules, but rather found a loophole (the rules prevented him from importing cattle from Uganda due to disease concerns, so he imported cattle embryos from Kenya instead and simply had them quarantined a while). Which isn't /great/... but it is a good deal less worrying than it could have been.
#+end_quote

Loopholes mean he's politically savvy and has a don't-say-no attitude, eh??? :D

#+begin_quote
  That's it in a nutshell, yes. Isn't politics fascinating?
#+end_quote

Extremely!

#+begin_quote
  That was a lawyer making a joke, not a politician seriously trying to avoid the rules.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I'd weep for any politician who actually questioned where NZ was a real country.

  Bear in mind, the price on that bottomless coffee isn't just for one cup.
#+end_quote

I was looking at the prices for their fancy lattes, FWIW (turmeric latte and all that) as I figured that's more in line with what I drink. But yeah, cheap regardless.

#+begin_quote
  But yeah, exchange rates are (in general) great for tourists visiting here, but horrible for tourists from here visiting other places.

Australians tend to benefit from visiting Asia but suffer visiting the US/EU; add South Africa to the "Asia" category (but... significantly less so: you can get a basic lunch at a food court in Thailand for something like 50 rand...)

BRB checking flight prices to Joburg... $1,400 return with SA Airlines, but at least it's a direct 10/11hr flight rather than the 30 hour flight via Sydney that QANTAS offers for $100 cheaper.

... SE Asia's $200-$500 return and the food's cheaper. I'm considering doing French a immersion course in Senegal in a few years but JNB to DSS looks like $1000 so it'd probably be cheaper to fly via Brussels if I decide to do it at all. NVM (actually kayak recommends a circuitous route via the UAE, Kenya, and Uganda at the moment... I guess not many people want to fly to Senegal).

  Or figure out some sort of neutrino shield.
#+end_quote

Yeah but neutrinos are "hundreds of metres of water" level stuff - mostly they go through the earth anyway. Which makes me think neutrinos are bad handwavium because, you know, it would be kind of like saying that 1000000 neutrinos per second is fine but if it's 1000003 OH NO THE VAMPIRE GOES TO SLEEP :(

But the only way to handle it that I can see - where you're tied to sunset/sunrise - is the mass of the earth to do the heavy lifting, and it has to be something that's blocked by the earth but not by a suitably thick wall...

#+begin_quote
  ...it would still be massively expensive, mind you. Far cheaper to just dump out the body on a nice, sunny afternoon. Unless you plan on needing that particular vampire later for some reason, of course.
#+end_quote

And if you do, just stake the damn thing. In air refuelling is stupid.

#+begin_quote
  But there's also the other option to consider - the vampire who spends all his time at the poles (or in aeroplanes racing the midnight) in order to stay awake forever.
#+end_quote

I could see this being quite feasible for a vampire who was rich enough (since it would be fabulously expensive, even by vampire standards). Definitely something a vampire could do in an emergency - like if you need to spend a few months making sure nobody kills you.

It probably would have an effect on the brain eventually....
