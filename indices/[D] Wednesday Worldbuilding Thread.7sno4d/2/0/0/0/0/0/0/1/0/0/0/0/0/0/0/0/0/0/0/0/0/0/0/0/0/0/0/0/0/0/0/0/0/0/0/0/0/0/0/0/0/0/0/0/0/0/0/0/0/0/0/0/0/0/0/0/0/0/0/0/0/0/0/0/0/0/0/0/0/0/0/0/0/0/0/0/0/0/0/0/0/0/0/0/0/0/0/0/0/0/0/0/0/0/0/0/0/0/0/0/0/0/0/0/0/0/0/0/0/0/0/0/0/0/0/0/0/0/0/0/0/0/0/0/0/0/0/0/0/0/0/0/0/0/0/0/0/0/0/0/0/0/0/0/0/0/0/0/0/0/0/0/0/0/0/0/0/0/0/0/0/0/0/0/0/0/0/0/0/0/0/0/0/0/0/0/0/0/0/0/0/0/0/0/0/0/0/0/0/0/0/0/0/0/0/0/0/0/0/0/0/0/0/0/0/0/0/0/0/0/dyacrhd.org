  I think even if you didn't destroy her head with your bomb, you'd destroy her flesh/bones badly enough that she wouldn't be able to grow back before the "second shot" - fortunately, vampires don't really have access to explosives, or at the very least, don't really use them based on the evidence of the world as we know it.

I suppose that depends how long it takes you to get to the airfield for a reload and back again.

  I chose envy because I was going for the covetousness rather than the "lust" part.

Okay, I can see how that would work under 'greed' - he wants Red as a possession, more or less, a position that he shows off to enhance his social standing among other vampires. I still don't think it makes him envious of Red, but I can see how /he/ might think that, which is enough for the scene.

  Maybe have Red list the news articles he's reading when he gets breakfast in the "oh he's a vampire" scene that comes up later on. "Red flicked through the paper, his rudimentary Italian giving him enough to make sense of the headlines. A shortage of butter, again. A call for people to donate to the war kitchens. An elderly priest had disappeared. A spate of thefts of farming equipment. An op-ed about whether the Americans were torturing Italians."

Significantly improved, I think, though the priest switches from describing William's situation as 'greed' to saying "least of all for the sin of envy" out of nowhere. But William's point about not committing adultery is, I think, very important to include; it makes the priest's following comments make sense.
