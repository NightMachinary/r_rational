  Um. Correct me if I'm wrong here, but - is it really important for the audience to like William?
#+end_quote

In my opinion, it's not necessarily important that the audience /like/ William as much as it's important that they /don't hate/ William. I would definitely consider it important they like him, though. I'm trying to do a Rational take on romance tropes, and a very common criticism of romance stories is that people don't get what the protag sees in the love interest, or the love interest is clearly creepy/abusive/etc. Just think of criticism received by Twilight or 50 Shades.

And since I don't have a market research company on the task, and I'm kind of writing something for which I'm the target audience, I can abstract that out as "would /I/ want to date this guy". If it's "maybe" then OK, if it's "god no" then not happening.

  when Red steps out of the picture, William should probably show the occasional hint of being entirely cavalier about the lives of /other/ humans
#+end_quote

For me the "meaning" of romance as a.... part of life, is that the people you love help you grow and become better people by exposing you to different points of view and calling you out on your shit. When William spends time with Red, he undergoes character growth. Having him throw that character growth to the side the second Red's gone seems disingenuous and contrary to what I personally view as the "spirit" of romance.

I mean, don't get me wrong, he's not going to /continue growing/ while Red's gone, and he might take some steps back, but he's not like the trope of someone becoming vegetarian because their partner's vegetarian and after a big breakup they go to McDonald's and get a double cheeseburger to stick to them. It's more like the trope of someone who is a drug addict, gets clean for a partner, sees how much better being clean is than being a drug addict, and even though the partner leaves they stay clean for a while with maybe a few relapses but still ultimately accepting that they /want/ to be clean even if they can't without their partner.

  Is this scene not the famous "knight in shining armour", one of the major tropes of romance? And did Knight not just brutally murder half a dozen people?
#+end_quote

Yes and yes; and that is what I want my story /not/ to do, because any damsel in her right mind would /not/ want to be with the knight at that scene. Add in some more scenes of the knight going "oh damsel, won't you love me?" and her going "not until you learn your manners" and a /Beauty and the Beast/ montage or five later and then I would be OK with it.

#+begin_quote
  Now, I can believe that you (or any other single person) would not want to date KNIGHT after those casual murders. But I do not believe that /no-one/ would.
#+end_quote

People stay with abusive partners all the time, or stay in loveless marriages for the children, or stay with opposite sex partners because they can't admit to themselves that they're gay, etc. Those people should not be the protagonists of romance novels as those are not romantic stories.

#+begin_quote
  And, again, at this early stage William /is/ a murderer. I think that this either needs to be shown in some way, or William's backstory may need to change to fit his portrayal.
#+end_quote

I'm not /showing/ murder, he probably kills a human every two years or so. It is not like he murders three humans before breakfast each morning, you know?

(FWIW, couteaubleu hated the story because he thought William was too evil, so it's not just me!)

#+begin_quote
  Oh, I wasn't trying to suggest that the guy on the roof had /died/. Just stopped moving because when some guy casually tosses you up four storeys, you /do not attract his attention again/ if you can possibly help it. (And then he slunk sheepishly down the fire escape an hour or so later).
#+end_quote

Wouldn't that be awkward to show on-screen, though? It's a nice thought, and I did think, "well obviously he wouldn't be ACTUALLY dead, he'd just look dead" - but if Red thought he was dead, then it's almost as bad as William actually doing the murdering because Red should still be shocked/disgusted by the whole thing since he, y'know, thinks it's real.

#+begin_quote
  But if his reasoning is drowned out by emotion, then Factor 2 could be unreasonably heavily weighted.
#+end_quote

Exactly. Red gets injured, and it could have potentially been quite serious, and all of a sudden William is a bit panicked.

Here's the excerpt:

--------------

[red has dislocated his shoulder training; he's lying on the floor and William is sitting beside him, trying to pop his shoulder back in]

Satisfied with the angle of Red's arm, William pulled it outwards. He was very gentle but very, very firm. “When I sleep, you can do anything but this. You could have been killed.” He scolded softly.

“I didn't think. It won't happen again.”

“It will! You have been injured before this, not so badly, but still.” He muttered, placing a foot against Red's hip to hold him in place as he pulled Red's arm. “There is no advantage to you doing this. No matter how hard you train, there is nothing you can do to protect me.”

“Wow. You sure know how to make a guy feel special.” He breathed in sharply as he felt the muscles in his shoulder give way, allowing the joint to softly pop back into place. The pain was suddenly gone, though the muscles were still tender. William made a small, satisfied noise.

“I am trying to keep you from hurting yourself.” William muttered, getting to his feet. He stood straight for a moment, before bending to offer Red his arm. It's the sort of thing he wouldn't have done a year ago: the sort of tiny human gesture that most would take for granted.

Red sighed and set down the whiskey to take William's arm. “Thank you.” He muttered, pulling himself to his feet. “But... I have to do something. I can't just sit around.” He rubbed his tender shoulder.

“What do you expect to accomplish, doing all this?” William muttered, making for the kitchen.

“It's not about expecting, it's just...” Red sighed, scooping up the bottle of whiskey. He followed William into the kitchen. “You couldn't understand.” He pinched the bridge of his nose.

“What exactly?” William asked, leaning on the kitchen table.

Red frowned, setting the whiskey on the table. “You're already as strong as you could be. It's different.”

William laughed. “You will not believe that if you see me fight one of my elders.”

Red paused, his train of thought completely derailed. “...Is that something you're planning on?” He asked, finally: William made remarks like this, sometimes, that made Red realise he didn't understand the first thing about his culture and filled his head with a thousand new questions.

“What are you planning on? Defending me from a street urchin?”

Red took a swig of the whiskey. “I'm not planning on stopping.”

“Why?”

Red paused, considering his words. “I know I'm not as strong as you. I know that. But if something... if something did happen, if you were asleep, or... I don't know.” He gestured vaguely. “And I could have done something but I wasn't good enough? And I could have been. It'd kill me.” He paused, taking another sip of the whiskey. “It'd fucking kill me.”

“If someone wants me dead, there is nothing you can do to prevent it.” William said simply. “I have lived longer than you can imagine. Longer than I could have ever imagined. In all that time, I have taken every precaution. I still do. I always will. The longer I live, the less it seems like enough.” William paused to take a breath; he didn't need to breathe to live, but talking took lungfuls of the stuff. “I don't need you to worry for my sake. You are only human. I once dispatched a hundred men stronger than you simply to demonstrate I could. And I was younger and weaker then. Every one of us has their routine for taming the sun.” He paused. “The only thing that brings fear into my heart is that another vampire wishes me ill, and there is nothing you could do to protect me from that.”

“I can try.” Red shrugged.

“Anyone who could hurt me would be stronger than me. Do you think you could stop me, if I wished you harm?”

“Nope.” Red shrugged again, taking another small sip of whiskey. He's starting to smile.

“Then please, I beg you, stop putting yourself at risk. Spend more time helping at the school, collect rare plants, take up sculpting. Anything else at all.”

Red sidled up to William, cupping the back of his head to pull him down a little, enough for Red to kiss William's forehead.

“I take that as a yes?” William murmured, placing a hand on Red's face.

“I'll be more careful.”

“Please do. I would never have forgiven myself, if you had fallen, hit your head, and been dispatched by the wolves.” He put his other arm around Red's waist.

Red licked his lips. “Wolves?”

“They would find you soon enough, my dear.”

“There aren't any wolves here.” Red repeated, his face tightening as he tried not to laugh. “They have foxes. And tiny weasels.”

“Wolves would be a far more dignified way to go.” He muttered.

“I think I can take the tiny weasels in a fight.” Red grinned, leaning heavily against William, the whiskey hitting him properly now.

“Not if that fall had made you insensible.” He pulled Red close and kissed the top of his head. The thought of Red being seriously injured was finally beginning to hit him. He didn't like it.

“Yep, that's how I'll end up going. Eaten by weasels.” He grinned into William's chest. “Put that on my tombstone.”

“I don't intend to do that for a while, yet.”
