  It is a variant of #1, but I feel it's less of an asspull because it stands to reason that a /hotel for vampires/ would have a 'bodyguard' onsite who was trustworthy.

That makes sense. If something happens to William, other vampires find out, and the hotel's reputation is trashed - and since most vampires are psychopaths, this does not end well for the hotel's owners.

  "if a character graphically tortures puppies in the first act, then spends the second act undergoing character growth, and in the third act realises how wrong it is to hurt puppies, it doesn't matter that she learned the error of her ways: people are still going to hate her because she tortured puppies".

That's not wrong. But the thing is - you have here a character who, as an important detail in his backstory, /does/ torture the puppies. Having him not do so on-stage means that the character as presented to the reader is... biased. Incomplete, in a way.

Yes, people are going to hate William for torturing puppies. But that puppy torture is nonetheless a true reflection of who William is - he /does/ start out as a psychopath and multiple murderer. He shouldn't get a blanket amnesty because he's going to be redeemed one day.

  Besides: I don't think he'd pick a "troublesome" thrall.

...hmmmm. Fair enough - I just wanted the greatest personality contrast between "before" and "after" to make it clear to Red - and the reader - that Something Happened Here.
