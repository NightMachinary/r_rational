  Excerpts to a story you said you aren't interested in reading? That you give me notes on? You do know /editing/ is a profession, right?
#+end_quote

I'm not interested in romance as a genre. I am interested in your worldbuilding, and in storycrafting as an art, at least one of which all my notes have concerned in one way or another...

  That's his preferred way of doing it, but he knows it would make Red uneasy (c.f. the excerpt)
#+end_quote

Ooooh, he's /deliberately/ making things creepy for Red.

Your alley needs a /lot/ more atmosphere to sell that. Remember, no-one else can see the scene that's in your head; only the bits you write. (And the alley that you wrote came across to me as fairly open and pleasant, because nothing you said counteracted that impression).

  The reason he wants to horrify Red is because Red is trying to get stronger and stuff to become William's bodyguard or something; William is just laughing because he knows that Red couldn't possibly guard him, and wants him to lose that notion ASAP.
#+end_quote

Then shouldn't William arrange for an 'attack' - perhaps a couple of his thralls with knives, under strict instruction to scare but not harm Red - just so he can show Red how utterly outclassed Red is?

Good point.

  It's super, duper rough: no senses, no flow, repetition, things appearing and disappearing, issues with tense, injokes, etc. So please don't bother with feedback on that sort of thing. It'd be heavily edited if it ever ends up being usable.
#+end_quote

You've got a good handle on character motivations, and that's good. But I think that everything else I could say about this excerpt, you've already covered in the above paragraph - and it'll be nothing you haven't heard before.
