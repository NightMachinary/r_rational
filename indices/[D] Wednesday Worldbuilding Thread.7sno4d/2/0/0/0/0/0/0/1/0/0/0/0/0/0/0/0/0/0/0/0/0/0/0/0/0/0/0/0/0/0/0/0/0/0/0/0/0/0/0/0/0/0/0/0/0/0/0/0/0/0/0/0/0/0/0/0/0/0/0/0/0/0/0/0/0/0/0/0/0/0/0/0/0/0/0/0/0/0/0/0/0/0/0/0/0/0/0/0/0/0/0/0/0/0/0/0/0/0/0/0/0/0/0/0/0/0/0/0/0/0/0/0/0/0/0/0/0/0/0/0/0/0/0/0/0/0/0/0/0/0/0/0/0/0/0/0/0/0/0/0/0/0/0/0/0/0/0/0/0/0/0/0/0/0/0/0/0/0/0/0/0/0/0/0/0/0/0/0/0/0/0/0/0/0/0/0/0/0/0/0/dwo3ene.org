  Probably Cassius is playing a /generic/ long game: he staffs his hotel with humans he thinks his vampire friends would like, and then tries to make sure people with stuff he wants have reason to visit Rome.

That seems likely, yes. He sets things up that have negligible cost but a chance of large benefits - and he does so often enough that those large benefits turn up fairly regularly.

  Also, probably the reason Paola is one of Cassius's favourite humans is because she does /not/ ask a lot of questions.

Yep! He asks for a lot of blind obedience and blind trust, but he won't /deliberately/ sabotage his own people and generally looks after them.

If for no other reason than that it's such a /bother/ finding suitable replacements.
