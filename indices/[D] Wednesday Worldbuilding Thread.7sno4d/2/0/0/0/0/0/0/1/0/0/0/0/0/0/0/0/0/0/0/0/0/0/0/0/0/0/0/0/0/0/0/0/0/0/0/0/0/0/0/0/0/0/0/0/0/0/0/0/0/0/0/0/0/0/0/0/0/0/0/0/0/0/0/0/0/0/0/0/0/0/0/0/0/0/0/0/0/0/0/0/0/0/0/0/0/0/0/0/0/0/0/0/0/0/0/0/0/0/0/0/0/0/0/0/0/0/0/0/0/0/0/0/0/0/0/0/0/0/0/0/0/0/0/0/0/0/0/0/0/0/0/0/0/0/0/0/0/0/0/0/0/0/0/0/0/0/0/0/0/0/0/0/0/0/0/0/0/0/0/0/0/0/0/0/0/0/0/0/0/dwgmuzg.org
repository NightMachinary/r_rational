    Yep, it's this month's book club book and I've been meaning to post a discussion for it
  #+end_quote

  ...huh. What a coincidence.
#+end_quote

Not really, I selected it because of your recommendation earlier in this thread.

    but I got the flu (IN AUTUMN!?!??!) so I was severely confined to bed because I was in too much pain to even watch TV (can you imagine???)
  #+end_quote

  Oooof. I hope the fact that you are posting now means you're better...
#+end_quote

Better /enough/. I mean, sitting on my butt on reddit doesn't exactly require a lot of health. I'm just garden variety sick, which is a massive improvement.

#+begin_quote
  What made it great, in my view, was the characterisation of all the different races - and how those characterisations managed to remain coherent and distinct while so often completely subverting expectations that those same characterisations had set up...
#+end_quote

Yeah, I don't think I read far enough into it to get that from it: 60% into the first book, by the kindle's reckoning (which can sometimes be an under estimate). But as far as I'm concerned, if 60% the way through a book I don't like it, I'm not wasting any more time on it - more likely the author/book/setting is not for me than that I "just need to get to the good part". (Then again: when I recommend people Sense8 I tell them to wait till episode 4 for the payoff, which is 4 hours into a 12 hour TV show, so maybe I'm being a hypocrite. Eh. Whatevs.)

#+begin_quote
  It's all about the different races. What they are, how they interact, how they respond to the sudden presence of a /new/ player in the midst of their long-running political stalemate.
#+end_quote

Yeah - I think that's books 2 and 3.

#+begin_quote
  FTL is a useful tool in sci-fi. There is bad sci-fi that uses it, but I don't think it is, in itself, a bad trope.
#+end_quote

FTL was maybe a bad specific example to use. Better one: the "robot becomes frankenstein's monster and turns on humanity" trope that Asimov wrote his stories to subvert and ultimately made relatively extinct. Then again, I'm getting dangerously close to comparing myself to Asimov, which I'm sure will go down well.

  [begger scene] works well! An excellent first showing of empathy.

Coolio. I'll add it to the list.

    Red cleared his throat, and did something with his hands to indicate he was nervous.

  Little bit clunky phrasing here. "Red cleared his throat, wringing his hands nervously."

    the flow is crap and has some obvious placeholders
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Yeah... that was one of the "obvious placeholders" I was telling you about. Apparently not as obvious as I thought???

Thanks to Coauthor (who is better than me at bodylanguage anyway), the line now reads:

#+begin_quote
  Red cleared his throat, and began to pick at the skin at the edge of his nails. “I won't be coming in for work tomorrow. Or after that, for the foreseeable future.”

  Apart from that - you're not wrong about the need for more pizzazz. My first, most immediate thought is better descriptions, more use of senses. And - that may very well be enough on its own, already.
#+end_quote

I think Coauthor's edits and my expanding on the description just now have made it passable. (Better be passable, it's being posted this weekend!).

Red was never comfortable speaking to Paola Di Pietro, right from when he first met her. It had been three months earlier, back when he had been going door-to-door, trying to sell services---cleaning, repairing, mending, anything---in awful Italian that consisted mostly of the word ‘laboro' (job) and a lot of gesturing. She had approached him in the street, telling him that her hotel needed a porter urgently, and that she was willing to take a gamble on him. He'd been suspicious at first: Paola looked to be his younger sister's age, with long, impossibly straight blonde hair, smooth skin, and a sharp look in her eyes. What authority could a young woman like her possibly have to hire a hotel porter?

But that day, Red had been knocking on doors for hours; and it was nearly noon and he hadn't even been able to sweep someone's floor in exchange for a sandwich. If she was willing to take a gamble on him, then he was more than willing to let her.

And now, after working in her hotel for three months and seeing how perfectly suited this young woman seemed to be to running it, he'd become intimidated by her. Especially now, when he had to resign. He was worried she'd been cross with him, leaving after everything the hotel had invested in him: not just the third-hand uniforms, but the help with the language, the advice that Adelina had given him in how to lift things without hurting his back. He knew that if things didn't work out with William he'd have to try to get his job back, and it wasn't a bridge he wanted to burn. Or smoulder even slightly.

“Singora Di Pietro?” Red murmured, knocking on her open door. Her office was small, sparsely decorated; tall, metal lockers that were never opened dominated one of the walls. A pair of crossed swords hung on one of the other walls, glinting in the electric light. Red had always felt intimidated by those swords: they almost looked as though they had been placed there so they could be pulled off in a fight. Unlike the ones in the trunk store yesterday, these swords were practical, with sturdy handles and blades that looked like they had been kept sharp enough to glide through a man's rib cage.

Finally, there was the window: it took up the whole of the back wall and showed the vertical columns of the pantheon illuminated in the moonlight. This was, to Red, the oddest part of the entire room: the window was not only unobscured but completely bare, not even sporting a curtain rod above the frame. Every other window in the hotel had shutters and layers upon layers of thick black curtains, but this one had no way to block out the sun's glare.

“Yes, Mister Rossi?” She spoke to him in English, not even looking up from the letter she was writing. She normally spoke English to him, one of the few people he met who did, but they were still the most uncomfortable conversations he had. She was never rude with him, but something about how she spoke always made him feel like he was interrupting something.

Red cleared his throat, and began to pick at the skin at the edge of his nails. “I won't be coming in for work tomorrow. Or after that, for the foreseeable future.”

That was enough to make her look up. “Why?”

“One of the guests has asked me to work as his valet, full-time, so I won't have time to stay on as a porter.”

Paola nodded, tapping her finger nail against her teeth. He wondered if it hurt. “Ah, yes. I had noticed Mister Ryan had taken a... liking to you.”

Red felt an unpleasant shiver down his spine, run down his back and into his belly where it coiled like a snake. He felt scrutinised, like he was missing something, like the  other staff were talking about him behind his back, gossiping in rapid-fire Italian they knew he couldn't understand even if he overheard. He knew that it couldn't have gone without notice: speaking to William so often, moving the furniture, the trunk, those things had to have come to their attention. She had once noticed he was missing a button on his shirt even though the button would have been tucked in anyway. Nothing got past her, not in her hotel.

“I'm sorry,” Red murmured. “It meant a lot, really, an awful lot that you hired me considering everything. But he gave me an offer that I can't refuse.”

“Believe it or not, this is not the first time. It is a most high acclaim of the quality of our staff when our most discerning clients take such a liking to them.” Paola turned her attention back to her letter.

Red had never heard her compliment him---or, well, anyone---before, and wasn't quite sure how to respond. “He wants me to start tomorrow night.” He said, deciding to act as though he didn't find it odd. “But if you're short, I can try to work something out with him so I can cover the desk when you need.”

Paola shook her head. “No, Mister Rossi. You are excused.”

Red nodded, his chest almost deflating with relief. “Thank you, Signora Di Pietro.”

She waved him off, not even looking up to see him leave.

    i gave her a quill and that's waaaay too much as quills actually sucked and any quill user would LOVE a pen, so i'll go and replace that with a dip-nib pen or even just give her a fountain pen.
  #+end_quote

  Does she use a quill because she wants to use a quill, or does she use a quill because her vampire master told her to do so a few decades ago and never rescinded that command yet?
#+end_quote

I love that idea, but I think the passage is now strong enough that she doesn't need to seem weird by having a quill, so I've just removed the reference to the type of pen. Phew!

I thought about putting more sensuous language, but I'm not sure where that should go: the "flashback" is a bit too long for my taste as it is, as it's meant to be a quick "she found me in my time of need" sort of acknowledgement, and I think the description of the room is about as long as the rest of the conversation as it is...
