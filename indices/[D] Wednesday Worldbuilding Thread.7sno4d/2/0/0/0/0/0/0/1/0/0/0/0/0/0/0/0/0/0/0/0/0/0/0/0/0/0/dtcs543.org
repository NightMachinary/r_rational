  Like... a match ;)
#+end_quote

What? A mere human, with a match, against a strong and noble vampire? Don't be ridiculous.

No, a 'suitable weapon' would be more like a flamethrower. And even that only after the vampire in question has been doused in petrol.

  True: Elodia takes a big boon to her reputation after beating William, but being implicated for J1's death is going to be a smaller hit. I guess she hates J1 enough that she considers it worth it.

Reputations recover with time, but vampires don't die easily.

  Nah, after losing the war, being suspiciously near one of Elodia's enemies deaths, and being widely rumored to have lost the war because he has /romantic feelings/ over /humans/.... William's reputation /SUCKS/.
#+end_quote

Then why doesn't Elodia destroy William entirely by letting some rumours of what he did to Junior1 slip out?

.......oh. Oh. /Oh./ Wait. She's using this incident to blackmail him, isn't she? Blackmailing him to get more benefits than she otherwise would from his death?

Or perhaps she has another enemy who would profit more from William's death than she would...

  I do like the idea of people thinking William has dirt on Elodia though. There's a lot of different ways to play it.

I'm thinking that most vampires who live long enough probably have some form of dirt on each other. Mutual blackmail may well be a large part of vampire politics. (And the lack of blackmail material a critical part of a newborn vampire's weaknesses).
