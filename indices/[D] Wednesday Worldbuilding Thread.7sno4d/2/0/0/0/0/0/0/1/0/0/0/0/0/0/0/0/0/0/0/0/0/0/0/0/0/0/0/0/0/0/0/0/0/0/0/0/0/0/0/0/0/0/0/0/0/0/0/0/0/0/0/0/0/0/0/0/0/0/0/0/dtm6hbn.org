  I just need to remember to put them in, and that's where I struggle I guess: I forget to include them as I don't imagine them.

It's not an uncommon thing - sight is a human's major sense.

Hmmmm... here's a thought. Just as a writing exercise, why not write one entire scene from the viewpoint of a blind person? Either recently blind, or spending the entire scene blindfolded, or blind from birth - doesn't really matter. The intent is to force you into writing a scene in which /only/ the other senses can be used to give useful information.

Hopefully, some part of the habit will stick.

Alright, most of those are great. There's a couple that might or might not benefit from a slight rephrasing ("feeling the roughness of the grain" instead of "feeling the grain" in the second-last one is a little more tactile, while "he could feel the sweat running down the back of his neck, soaking his collar" might work better in the last case (I originally thought "he could feel the sweat staining the hair on the back of his neck" was a little snappier than the original line, then I saw that it involved the word 'staining' twice in two sentences and started asking myself whether or not sweat could stain hair, so I tweaked it a second time))

  There's even a section where I say "red can feel the blade on his neck" but I didn't even add that the blade was cold, and I'm sure if I wanted to be extra evocative I could say "he felt the cold bite of the blade against the soft skin of his neck" or something. I should try that!

You should. I like 'cold bite', it's a very nice description in only a few words.
