  More like at least it means he is obeying the letter of the rules, even when doing so is inconvenient.

[[/r/maliciouscompliance]] at its finest, except with more rare cows!

  As long as you don't mind crowds.

Is South Africa not crowded? When I've been to Thailand it's been during "low season" so the hotels I've been to tend to be under capacity depending on the location.

Also... I imagine South Africa as having a high crime rate, which is probably unfair. But the Oscar Pistorious coverage and him living in a "gated community" with security guards to keep the "undesireables" out seems excessive to my sensibilities.

Let's look at homicides...

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate]]

South Africa: 34.27 per 100,000

Thailand: 3.51 per 100,000

Australia: 0.98 per 100,000

[[/rdshocked-r][]] You know what I will /not/ go to South Africa. Eighth highest murder rate in the world. Maybe that's why there's no crowds: everyone's too murdered!!!!!!!!

  Do vampires all collapse when the neutrino front from a distant supernova hits Earth?

Well no because it's particular to Sol, but if there's a solar storm at night then the same question holds.

  And, if you really need one to, can a vampire stay up past sunrise (albeit uncomfortably) and if so, for how long?
#+end_quote

I haven't ruled on this either way: I want to say no, but if I change my mind, I wouldn't want it to be more than an hour absolute max. That said, the sun weakness evolves over time: a young vampire can walk out at high noon and is fine. Once they're a few years old they stop being able to go out in the sun though.

  And then there's of course that one who insists on migrating between the poles so he never has to 'sleep'... but there's still a formerly-human mind running on that vampire hardware. Even if there are no physical side-effects to staying up for that long, surely there will be psychological ones..
#+end_quote

Absolutely... Would not recommend it...

#+begin_quote
  ...there's some vampire somewhere who maintains the Noon Plane to stick her rivals in just to show off that she can afford that level of ostentation, isn't there?
#+end_quote

Oh, undoubtedly so. She'd probably have someone who insulted her at one point on it too just to drive the point home.
