  I mean, look at it from their point of view: you've got a group of humans you eat from and you live your leisurely vampire life. Suddenly, a bunch of people in ships and funny clothes show up. They can't possibly harm you - sure, they can harm your humans, but humans are fungible. They bring with them /more people/, which is great for you, and probably some technology or whatever that the vampire might enjoy (even if it's just literature).

That's all well and good, until [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blood_River][each New Person kills a dozen or so Old People, on average]] and you end up with Less People overall. You end up having to either force the New People to stop short of murder (slavery, yes, murder no) or forcibly take apart the New People until the point where they can no longer threaten the Old People.

  Probably vampires were a "worldwide force" before colonialism happened.
#+end_quote

Given how long they've been entwined in human history, that makes sense. (I'm not sure they can cross an ocean in a night as a bat... but they can certainly be part of the original colonists, especially in a ship which has a sun-proof room).

  Has an odd corollary: imagine Australia, before European colonisation. ~1 million inhabitants, which works out to be 3-10 vampires depending on density. Now, Australia has ~20 million, so 60-200 vampires. I'd imagine that vampires care more about areas the more densely populated they are, so in early European settlement, vampires might not want to go there that much, but now, in the Present Day, with 3 or 4 decently large cities, vampires might want to displace the existing owners.
#+end_quote

Yeah... that all makes sense. I'm just thinking that, if there were native vampires and no colonising vampires, then there would now be a higher percentage of the original native population still around - instead of having around 3% Aboriginals, Australia might have - I don't know - 10%? 30%? It depends how many settlers came, and how quickly their technology would have spread to the natives when the vampires were making sure no-one got genocided, and perhaps even chased some settlers away if they were too trigger-happy...

  So probably William displaced some younger vampire (say, 200 years old), but that young vampire remained in the territory - I'd imagine William would give her a Duchy. The rest of Australia probably had one or two old native vampires and an assortment of youngsters. The old ones either kept/defended their lands or were displaced. Maybe the convenience of ships meant that some of the native vampires decided to see the world.

....yeah, that all makes sense, too. It doesn't really change the modern vampire situation all that much.

#+begin_quote
  True; so sires would very closely limit the contact their progeny has with anyone more powerful than them. And more powerful vampires would try and sneak in to get with rival progeny, as young vampires can go out in the sun, making them particularly dangerous to their makers.
#+end_quote

[[/eviltwi][]] More sneakiness and subterfuge!

  Let's think on terminology:
#+end_quote

Why not take both? Sire & progeny when you're being formal, but elder vampires will often call their progeny 'pup' or 'cub' because elder vampires don't /have/ to be formal all the time.

(Progeny call the elder vampires Sire /all/ the time, because they /do/ have to be polite and formal).

Yeah, something like that...
