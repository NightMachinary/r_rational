  AdrenalineMakeover : Red's full arc is /maybe/ like this, but he actually becomes Kinder and Softer overall, as does William. Red starts out more aggressive than William, relative to their station: William knows that discretion is the better part of valor, whereas Red has yet to learn that lesson.

I think that, in order to qualify for this trope, Red has to at some point take off his glasses while letting his hair down. And make permanent changes to his wardrobe.

  FateDrivesUsTogether : Nope. William just buys Red and then goes to visit him. None of it is coincidental.

This might count as a thoroughly Defied Trope, then?

  She might not even know they're gold specifically:

Make the bullets electrum - that's a naturally-occurring silver/gold alloy. This way they work as required, yet at the same time Cassius can tell her it's due to the silver in the alloy, and voila, secret maintained.

Well, for a few decades longer, at least.

  Depends who they are and how valuable they are: I imagine one of the lockers, at least, has the "most valuable" items from their "most important" guests.

...that /would/ make sense.

  That makes sense. There was a lot of extreme encouragement of patrotism during WW2 (duh), so yeah. Apparently even the coast of the USA did it????
#+end_quote

It seems that the east coast of the USA actually had more reason to do it than most places. They didn't have to worry about airstrikes, but their ships /did/ have to worry about German submarines. Now, a ship in the middle of the night that's running no lights is next to impossible to see at any distance, and can thus avoid being noticed by submarines - /unless/ there's a nice, bright, well-lit cityscape behind the ship, in which case the submarine just needs to shoot at the big dark thing that keeps moving in front of the lights.
