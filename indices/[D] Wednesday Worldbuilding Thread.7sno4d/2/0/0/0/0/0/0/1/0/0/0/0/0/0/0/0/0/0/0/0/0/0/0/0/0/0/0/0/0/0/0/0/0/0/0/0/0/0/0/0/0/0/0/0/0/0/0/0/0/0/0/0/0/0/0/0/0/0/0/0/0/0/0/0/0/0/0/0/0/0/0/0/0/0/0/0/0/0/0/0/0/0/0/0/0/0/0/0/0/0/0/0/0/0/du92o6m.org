  ... what purpose would that have? Vampires talking to one another in a more obfuscated way? (so that way someone who knows ancient mongolian will still be confused because the other half of the conversation is in navajo?)

Basically, yes. (And why stop at two languages?)

  It's not really come up, strangely enough.

...that was surprising to me, so I went and looked a few things up. English is a subject-verb-object language, that is, a language in which you (generally) first mention the subject of the sentence, then what the subject does, then what it is done to. (Example: "Red drank the wine.")

Afrikaans, the foreign language with which I have the most experience, is subject-object-verb ("Red het die wyn gedrink" - lit. "Red did the wine drink"). So, if you try translating word-for-word directly from the one language to the other, you end up sounding a bit like Yoda - you've got the right words in there and people can generally easily figure out your meaning, but it's clear that you're doing something wrong. Even if you're just talking about shopping.

Now, looking it up, I see that French and Italian are also both subject-verb-object languages (like English). So perhaps you /can/ get away with just literally translating word-for-word from one language to another without messing up the grammar. (I wouldn't know, I speak neither French nor Italian).

Of course, that's just /one/ of the pitfalls awaiting someone trying to learn a new language. In German, objects have /gender/...

I'm glad to see the use of the other senses here. I'm seeing hearing, smell, touch all represented; no taste, but there wasn't really space for it in this scene. Better yet, a few intangibles - a sense of welcoming or danger, a bit of body language, some social awareness. So well done on that.
