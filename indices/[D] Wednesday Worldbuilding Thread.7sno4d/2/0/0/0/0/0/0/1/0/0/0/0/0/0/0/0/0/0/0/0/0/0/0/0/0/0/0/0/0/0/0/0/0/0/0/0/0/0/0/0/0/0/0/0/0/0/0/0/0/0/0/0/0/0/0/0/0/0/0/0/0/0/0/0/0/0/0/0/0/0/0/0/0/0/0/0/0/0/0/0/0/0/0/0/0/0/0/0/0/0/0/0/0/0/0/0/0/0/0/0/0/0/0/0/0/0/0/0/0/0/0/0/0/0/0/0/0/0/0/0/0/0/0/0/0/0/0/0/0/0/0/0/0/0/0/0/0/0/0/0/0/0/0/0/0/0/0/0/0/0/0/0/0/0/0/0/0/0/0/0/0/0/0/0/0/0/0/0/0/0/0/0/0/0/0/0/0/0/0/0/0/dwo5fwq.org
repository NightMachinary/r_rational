  That seems likely, yes. He sets things up that have negligible cost but a chance of large benefits - and he does so often enough that those large benefits turn up fairly regularly.

Yeah - at this point he probably has a bunch of children who have some sense of loyalty to him, and as many ghouls as he can manage (about 5 or 6). A bunch of his children are stationed in duchies of his allies all through the world, and if there's ever a city he wants, he'll spend 100-200 years getting his children in position, then challenge the Monarch of the area for control. Truth be told, it's probably how he got Rome; or perhaps he just decided he wanted it in the power vacuum caused by The Catastrophe and nobody bothered to challenge him. Or maybe he had it since before Then, and that's how he got it. Who knows.

  If for no other reason than that it's such a bother finding suitable replacements.

It so is. When you're an old vampire, a thrall takes a good two or three years to reach peak strength. Much more convenient to keep them alive, keep them happy enough that they won't pick at the edges of their obedience to try and get released (by the sweet embrace of death if nothing else), and to keep some of them keen with vague promises of immortality (which only rarely eventuate).

Actually, there's a question: Cassius seems to have a lot of kids (maybe I'll change his title from The Wolf to The Sea-Turtle or something that is a similar r-selected species...). I wonder what his criteria is? Like, does he use his psychic cult and turn the most brainwashed cultists so they'll be loyal to him, even as vampires? Does he use his most devoted/interesting thralls? Does he do that vampire trope of turning people who he's in love with (except I don't want to make /that/ shit common, so probably nixed straight away...)

Likely it's from his cult, and perhaps he does it as favours to vampires he's friends with who like a particular human's appearance or moxy or similar and want to turn them into a vampire.

Who knows, maybe vampires have something similar to the really disturbing website that counted down until Emma Watson turned 18, in that they have a human they like aesthetically but it'd be "wrong" to kiss them until they turned vampire, so there are some weird vampires around the place who will turn your objects of desire into vampires so you can socially acceptably kiss them???
