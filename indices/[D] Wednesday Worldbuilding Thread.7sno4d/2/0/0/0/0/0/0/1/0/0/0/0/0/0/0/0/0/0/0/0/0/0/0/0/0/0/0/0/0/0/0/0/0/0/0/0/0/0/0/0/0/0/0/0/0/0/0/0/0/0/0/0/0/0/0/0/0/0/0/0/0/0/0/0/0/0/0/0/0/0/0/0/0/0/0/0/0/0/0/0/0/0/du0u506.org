  So I'm thinking of calling William "the cuckoo" to be poetic and mysterious, since getting by without a parent is a pretty impressive thing and it's the sort of accolade that would be forgotten after the Catastrophe if he didn't put something like that in his name. Alternatives include "the fatherless".
#+end_quote

"The Orphan". (If he had a hand in his sire's demise, and this is known, then it's "The self-made orphan"). Or perhaps "The feral child". Or "The foundling". Or add a bit to it - "The orphan/feral child/foundling of wherever".

  Yeah: don't want to go with mother bear which would have been my first thought because Ursula is going to have a really strong bear motif based on this myth (hence the name Ursula).

  Maybe the Ostrich would be a better choice. "The sitting ostrich".
#+end_quote

Hmmmm. TvTropes tells me that the male alternative to the "Mama Bear" trope is called "Papa Wolf", so wolves are probably also a good option. (Wolves also have some mythological links to vampires, so there's an extra thematic link there).

  Buuuut... I thought that was kind of funny :(... you're right though: I'll change it to "lover of man"
#+end_quote

I recommend "lover of man/kind/", for exactly the same reasons.

  Maybe I should change that passage to involve Lucia announcing Elodia by title and Red announcing William by title.
#+end_quote

Not convoluted enough for vampires. I recommend having Red announce Elodia by title (which he had to painstakingly practise and memorise) as she enters and Lucia announce William by title (flawlessly) in response.

#+begin_quote
  Do you think the thing I posted yesterday, where William and Cassius address each other by title as a marker of seriousness/respect, flows or do you think the titles just really bog it down?
#+end_quote

The titles don't really flow all that well, no. A set of titles like that is going to be /hard/ to get flowing.

Short of a large social scene between a dozen vampires with a footman at the door announcing them, the only place I can think of that might work to introduce titles is a scene where William is teaching Red the titles of several major characters (and Red asks about the backstories behind one or two of them because he's curious).

#+begin_quote
  Yeah - I think that is very much what Cassius might have been going for. He's worried that in another few hundred years New Holland may be as densely populated as Europe, and in that case then William probably has about ~10 kingdoms worth of land/population and Cassius wants to have his allies in place if/when that fractures.

  Of course, Cassius is also aware that the place is mostly a damn desert, so.....
#+end_quote

Yeah, but the way these humans have been going with their agriculture lately... and given enough time, weather systems do change...

#+begin_quote
  Yeah; the idea is they don't want Elodia finding out
#+end_quote

[[/ajbrow][]] Two powerful vampire kings are letting the opinion of a mere /duchess/ prevent them from doing what they want? Clearly Elodia has a lot more power than I'd expected...
