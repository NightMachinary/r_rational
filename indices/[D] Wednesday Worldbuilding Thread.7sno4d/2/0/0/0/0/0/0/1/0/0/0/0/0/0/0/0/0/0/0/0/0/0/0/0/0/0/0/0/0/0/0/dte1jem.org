  As a human, how constantly aware are you of the dangers of crossing the street?
#+end_quote

As a traffic engineer who frequently looks at accident statistics, nearly constantly. I panic when people use their phones at traffic lights or on deserted roads. I could show you road safety propaganda about that, about crossing the street being dangerous, etc. You picked a really bad example for me!
