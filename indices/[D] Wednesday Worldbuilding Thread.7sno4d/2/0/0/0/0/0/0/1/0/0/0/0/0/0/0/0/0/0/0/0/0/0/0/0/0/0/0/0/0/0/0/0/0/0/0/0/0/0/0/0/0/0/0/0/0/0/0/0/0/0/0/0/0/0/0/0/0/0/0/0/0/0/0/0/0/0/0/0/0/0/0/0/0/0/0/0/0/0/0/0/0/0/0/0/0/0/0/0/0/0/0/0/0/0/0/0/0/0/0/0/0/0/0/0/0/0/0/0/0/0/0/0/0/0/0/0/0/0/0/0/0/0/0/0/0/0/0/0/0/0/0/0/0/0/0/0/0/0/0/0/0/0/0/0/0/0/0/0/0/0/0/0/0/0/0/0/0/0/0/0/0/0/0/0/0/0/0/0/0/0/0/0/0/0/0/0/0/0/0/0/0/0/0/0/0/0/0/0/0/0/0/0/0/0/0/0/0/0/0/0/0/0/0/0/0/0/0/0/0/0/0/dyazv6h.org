  I suppose that depends how long it takes you to get to the airfield for a reload and back again.

As though you wouldn't take two bombs, or at the very least, one bomb and a reasonably expendable ghoul who can comb through the wreckage and confirm the heart has been separated from the brain / drag the corpse out so it'll be caught in the sun?

  I still don't think it makes him envious of Red
#+end_quote

Not being envious of Red, precisely, but envious of either Red's actual owner (Cassius, who William hasn't purchased Red from yet), or of Red's hypothetical-but-potentially-real-for-all-William-knows boy/girlfriend.

Really I tried to frame the scene as William being worried that his desire for Red is excessive, and he's worried that rather than wanting Red as a status symbol, he's going to end up too attached and do something stupid. (“Not precisely. I fear my... greed... will cause a scandal. It could ruin me.”)

Because a Big Powerful Vampire who wants to go through the exercise of talking to a random mook is not going to really care that he wants to possess Red to show off to other vampires, since that's the whole point; he cares that he's risking getting too attached. I wonder if that gets across clearly enough?

  though the priest switches from describing William's situation as 'greed' to saying "least of all for the sin of envy" out of nowhere
#+end_quote

that was a typo, i switched it back to 'greed' in the original document but I obviously didn't think to edit the reddit post :)

  But William's point about not committing adultery is, I think, very important to include
#+end_quote

I worry that it might be confusing; does the average person think adultery is purely marital infidelity, or do they know it applies to out of wedlock sex equally? I'm worried that line might have someon ego "wait, what, does one of them have a wife we don't know about?!"
