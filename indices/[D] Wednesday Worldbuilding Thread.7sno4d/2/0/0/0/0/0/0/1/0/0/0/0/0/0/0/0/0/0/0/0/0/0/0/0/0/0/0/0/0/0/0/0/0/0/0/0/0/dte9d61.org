Good argument for Linear A, it does make a good case that vampires might be using that as a secret language. There'd probably be tiers; Linear A takes a long time to write in because of the encryption and decryption, so it's for real secret stuff. Regular discussion can be in ancient Korean and basic updates can be in whatever language you both find mutually intelligible. (And the real top secret stuff, you speak on the /phone/ - NEW EXCERPT TIME!).

... now i'm imagining a human slave understanding, say, Hungarian but their vampire master having no idea and then hijinks ensue. Probably you'd ask a human what languages they speak and test them periodically.

[William has just lost the war with Elodia]. During the next few days Julias flew between the two vampires' houses as they exchanged letters that were by far the shortest Red had ever seen William send. Every time he received a new letter, he would frown, or sigh, or throw it to the table in apparent disgust. Red had spent the better part of a year around the man, and he was not prone to any big displays of emotion. Throwing the letter to the table was perhaps the most passionate display of anger that Red had yet witnessed from him. When pressed, he stated they were negotiating the terms of his surrender, but he refused to go into further detail. Red couldn't help but worry; did Elodia still want him killed? Had Lucia made good on her promise to put in a good word for him? Could Elodia send someone to take him, lying in wait in an alley? Red took to carrying the silver dagger with him.

Finally, one evening, William took a phone call from Elodia. He spat at her in Italian, each syllable falling as loudly and quickly as lightning, flashing by faster than Red could hope to comprehend. After fifteen minutes of this, William hung the receiver up and began pacing up and down the entryway. He ran his fingers through his curly blonde hair. Red stood in a doorway, still watching him.

“How did it go?”

William jerked at the noise, as though was caught off-guard by Red's presence there. That was a first.

“It went quite well.” He said, wearing the same calm smile as always. “We have arrived at a mutually satisfactory solution. Duchess Elodia has finally stopped insisting that I provide her with your head.”

Red rubbed his neck, frowning. “That's good. I hope it's not going to be too much trouble. With all the letters you got, I thought...”

William chuckled. “No. Everything shall be fine. She has agreed to spare you in exchange for an artefact that I must obtain from Sardinia. I will be gone for several days.”

“I'll pack my things.”

“No. You will need to stay here. Sardinia is not safe for you.”

“I'm not sure I'm safe here either, William! There's a vampire who wants to cut off my head.”

“I am leaving you with Julias. You will be quite safe.”

NB: William is actually speaking Latin, not Italian, but it sounds Italian to Red's ear because William is speaking so quickly / William speaks it with an Italian accent / etc. Do you think it would be better to specify, like, "he spat at her in a language Red didn't know" or just let Red's assumption go there.
