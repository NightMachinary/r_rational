  Plan B: The vampire takes a thrall with him. The thrall is in a rowboat, with maps, compasses, sextants, etc. The vampire is at the bottom of a long rope, and they can communicate by a coded pattern of tugs on the rope, or by sending coloured flags up/down.

The thrall can eat fish, that's easy enough, but what will the thrall drink? You'd need a huge supply of water in the boat, which I guess must be possible - you need 4L per person per day, so if we say the vampire takes a month to swim long distances that's... 120 L, which isn't too much weight-wise. And the thrall isn't going to be doing anything too strenuous (no rowing/etc) so 4L might be conservative.

  Vampire skulls are completely impervious to anything non-magical (except sunlight etc.) So the bullets just bounce off their skulls and their brains remain intact.

That old joke, "you know the indestructable black box they have in case of plane crashes? why don't they make the whole plane out of that stuf!?!?!" -- that's what I'm thinking. If the vampire skull has a coating of, titanium or whatever, why isn't that over the whole body? I like the image of a vampire being shot, the bullets passing harmlessly through her as she gripes about her clothing being ruined.

That said, I'm OK with a vampire dying if you put its head underneath a comically large mallet and smash it to a pulp.

So, let's do it a different way: people can have half of their brain /removed/ and still seem to be the same person (maybe they're not, but they act and feel as though they are and don't seem to lose memories). Vampire brains grow back, and as long as too much brain tissue isn't lost, they can grow back and little is lost.

Now, I'm not one for gore so I am not going to look this up, but I get the impression that a gunshot suicide involves, like, the back half of the head being completely gone in terms of level of trauma. But that's point blank, and if you're close enough to a vampire to do a point blank headshot without them being able to, you know, knock the gun out of the way, then the vampire has other problems.

But let's say, if a vampire has at least, say, 30% of her brain "reasonably intact", she'll be fine. Pissed off, maybe, but fine. And it's probably extremely painful even by vampire standards (maybe it's a punishment they use).

OK, damnit, I've looked up more stuff. There's plenty of bullets that can "explode heads", so all the above is kind of irrelevant, hunters or rival vampires are going to be equipped with those.

I think the best solution to this is to just give the vampires "bullet time" /matrix/-style - despite their name, silencers are very loud, so vampires could easily hear a bullet, use their super speed to look around for it, and then limbo below the bullet. (And they only need to limbo their head out the way, they don't care about body shots). It's stupid and gimmicky, but I think it's going to be the only way to do it without unintended consequences.

I wonder if there's more unintended consequences to a vampire being fast enough to do bullet time? Gonna try and remember to put that on the Saturday thread.
