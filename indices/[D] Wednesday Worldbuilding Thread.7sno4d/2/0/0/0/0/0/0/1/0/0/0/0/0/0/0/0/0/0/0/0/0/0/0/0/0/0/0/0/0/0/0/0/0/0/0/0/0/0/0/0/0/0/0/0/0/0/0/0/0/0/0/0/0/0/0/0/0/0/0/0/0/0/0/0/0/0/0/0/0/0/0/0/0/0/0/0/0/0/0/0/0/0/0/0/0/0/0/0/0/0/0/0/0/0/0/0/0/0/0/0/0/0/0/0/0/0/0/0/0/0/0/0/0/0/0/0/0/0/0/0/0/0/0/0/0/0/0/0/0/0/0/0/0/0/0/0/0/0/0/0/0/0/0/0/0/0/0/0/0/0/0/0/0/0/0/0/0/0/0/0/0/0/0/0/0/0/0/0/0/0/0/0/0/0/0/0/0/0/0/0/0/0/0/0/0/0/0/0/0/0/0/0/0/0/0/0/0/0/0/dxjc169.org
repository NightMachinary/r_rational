  In short, how does an undersea vampire /navigate/? And is there some vampire at the bottom of the Pacific who's got so turned about that he no longer knows where land is?

Compasses work underwater, I'm not sure what you'd do for a map though to orient yourself.

You could also swim to the surface to see the stars: if you swam too close during daylight you'd pass out (actually I think you'd probably pass out during daylight anyway unless you're very deep).

But yeah - wouldn't be very reliable. Might be better off chartering a small boat, though risky storms/etc would be a problem (actually: perhaps a vampire carries a waterproof box with maps, compass, sextant, etc and then surfaces periodically?)

  [[/twiponder][]] Yeah, I can see that working... but it also implies that vampires are not bulletproof, that if you can smash the heart, you kill the vampire...and that's not hard if it's what you set out to do

Yeah. I am also running into a problem which is that a headshot will kill a vampire if I make it canon that the brain can't regrow with memories/personality/etc intact, which I also don't like as it makes it too easy to kill vampires with guns. So I might say the brain can regrow perfectly, and there's some sort of 'backup' in the 4D copy or bat form or something or backed up on the nanites.

But that means that if the vampire is decapitated, we don't get zombies, we get the vampire's brain growing back, and if we take a small piece of the heart we make clones. And I have a /hard pass/ on clones. So that's... hard to reconcile.

    Probably if serious research was your focus, as a vampire, your interests would be better met by becoming the subject of some king or another, who would do all the hard work of managing territories, and then you could take over later on if/when you felt like it.

  [[/flutterbat][]] If he knows what's good for him, he'll call me "Emperor". Not that I'll interfere with his management, of course...

I can see it now: a powerful vampire King with a scientist who is working on something or other that is important for the King. The King acknowledges that the scientist is a bit loopy--asks to be called emperor and whatnot--but humours her nonetheless because of the small scientific advancements the scientist spits out for the King (not what the scientist is /actually/ working on, of course, just piddly little things they come up after a week whenever the King seems to be getting tired of her). Of course, the scientist ends up developing something to neutralise the sun, or to mind control the King, and she becomes the emperor of the earth /in earnest/.
