  I've determined some more stuff about him - namely, he's not more intelligent than an intelligent human, and he probably thinks in a humanlike way.
#+end_quote

That will make him a good deal easier to write.

#+begin_quote
  He doesn't "think like a computer"
#+end_quote

Objection, implicit assumption. There is not just /one/ way to think like a computer.

Yes, on the most basic level, a computer could be said to 'think' in binary, and there are very well-known rules regarding how one goes about that. In the same manner, though, a human can be said to 'think' in terms of complex chemical reactions in the brain. It's /true/, but you need to step back through several layers of abstraction before you get to anything resembling /thoughts/.

Even given current AI models, there's still not just /one/ way to 'think like a computer'. Non-recursive neural networks 'think' in a very different way to fuzzy-logic expert systems, which in turn are very different to /recursive/ neural networks - and you can never be completely sure /what/ you're going to end up with when you start messing with evolutionary algorithms (within bounds, of course). (I'm not sure that fuzzy-logic expert systems really even count as AI; that's more like plain probability theory and heuristics turned into code).

And what with all of that, we /still/ haven't cracked the secret behind actual, thinking general-purpose AI yet. (Though our investigations have revealed some interesting things about the human brain in the process, we still haven't figured out the difference between a neural network - which we can do - and a neural network that /thinks/ - which we have inside our heads. And even the neural networks inside our heads are practically all different). Thus, actual, thinking AI might think in a completely different way to what we would expect.

On top of that, Julias is an ancient Atlantean AI, made by technology so advanced that it's indistinguishable from magic. There's no reason to think he's bound by the various conventions of modern computing at all.

In short, Julias can think in /absolutely any way you want him to/, and you can claim with a straight face that that is exactly how all intelligent Atlantean computers thought. There's just so many variables and unknowns in there to fiddle with...

  and he's not like an Asimovian robot who physically can't disobey a human
#+end_quote

Even the Asimovian robots could physically disobey a human... under certain clearly defined circumstances. But I see your point.

#+begin_quote
  he is more a person with a very rigid and inhuman moral framework and different wants/needs.
#+end_quote

Perfectly valid possibility for an ancient Atlantean AI.

#+begin_quote
  So I'm going to rewrite the interlude to be more like the way a human would think, because the fact he's prioritising things differently is enough.
#+end_quote

That can be interesting, too.

I don't know if you're familiar with the /Chanur/ series, by C.J. Cherryh? I ask because she does a /brilliant/ job of getting inside the heads of non-human characters (in her case, aliens, not robots) and driving a lot of her plotlines off the differences between how different species habitually think.
