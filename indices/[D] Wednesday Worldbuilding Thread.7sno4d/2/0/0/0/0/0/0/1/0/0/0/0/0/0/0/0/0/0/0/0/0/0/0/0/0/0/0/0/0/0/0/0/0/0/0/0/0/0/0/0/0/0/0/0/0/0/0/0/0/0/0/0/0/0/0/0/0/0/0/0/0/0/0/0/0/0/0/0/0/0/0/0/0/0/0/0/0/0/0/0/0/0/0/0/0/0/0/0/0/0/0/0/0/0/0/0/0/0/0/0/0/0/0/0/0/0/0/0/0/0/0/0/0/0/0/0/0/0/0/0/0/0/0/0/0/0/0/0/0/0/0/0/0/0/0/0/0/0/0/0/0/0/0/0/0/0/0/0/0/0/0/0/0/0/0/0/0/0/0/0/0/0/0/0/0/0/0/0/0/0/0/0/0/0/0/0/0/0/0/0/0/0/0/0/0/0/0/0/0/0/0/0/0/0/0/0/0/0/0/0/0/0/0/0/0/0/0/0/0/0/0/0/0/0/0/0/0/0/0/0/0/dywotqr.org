  That opera in the prologue, actually, is probably a specific move by a vampire who wants it to be trendy - perhaps even in a deliberate attempt to distract everyone else while he deliberately bucks the trend himself.
#+end_quote

Ohhh, that's a good point.

Also, kind of off-topic, but I kind of realised that it makes perfect sense for William to be one of the vampire actors who act in these things (not in the particular one he visited at the beginning of the novel, of course, but in others). I think I'll see if I can work him acting in an opera as the main "thing" that happens in the second volume - or you know, a major subplot or something. It's all around Red and his fear of death and deciding he wants the immortality that being a thrall brings, so it might be a good foil: William is an actor partly because it gives him fame and immortality even amongst vampires (since he remembers fondly plays that he saw a thousand years earlier, delivered by long-dead vampires), and Red wants the more conventional sort of immortality.

  ...I don't know whether to bemoan general educational standards in general or not. Stiletto. Is that really something that most people are going to have to look up?
#+end_quote

I don't know, honestly. I also was thinking about tricky words as I was doing some proofreading and I noticed the words "sartorial" and "somnolent", both of which I had to look up to put them in the book. (Somnolent I would have worked out from roots and context, but I didn't have an "adjective that means pertaining to sleep" at the top of my mind when I was writing it even though I needed one).

  And then there will be those who really don't like Red for one reason or another, but perhaps they like something else.
#+end_quote

Haha, CouteauBleau read it and hated Red because he was stupid, but hated just about everything (which as I said before was great because I improved a lot of the stuff he hated - no doubt he still does hate it, but at least other people who are more predisposed to enjoy my work than he will benefit from his patience with reading the damn thing).

  And you will inevitably get some people who like a thing that you did not even realise you were putting in the book in the first place (but you go and look, and voila, there it is, somehow).

My partner, upon reading the first draft said:

"The dog thing was too obvious by the way, it was like you were hitting me over the head with it"

"... dog thing?"

"Yeah, the whole dog thing. You should be more subtle."

"... about what? We wanted to give Red a dog because he likes dogs."

"... wait, so it wasn't a, the vampire gets a pet human and the human gets a pet dog parallel?"

And there was a line from the chapter we've just posted to the main sub which has a bit that reads:

#+begin_quote
  He delivered a small statue of a bull to one apartment that had seemed refreshingly normal from the outside; but when the servant opened the door, the room was filled with peacocks. He couldn't see the floor for the sheer number of them. They were huddled so close together that Red solemnly wondered whether they could move much at all. He felt sorry for them.

  He wondered if he could sneak in and free them.
#+end_quote

And my partner was like, "you should elaborate more on what you mean with the whole peacock thing."

"What?"

"The peacock thing, it's foreshadowing for the slavery argument, right? Showing how he cares about welfare?"

"No, I just thought that if vampires give each other flocks of birds as gifts that sometimes you'll have peacocks all over your floor for a few decades and it's nbd"

"...oh"

"But did you like my foreshadowing in another part of the chapter, with the thing with the cup of coffee spilling?"

"What foreshadowing?"

"Remember how the climax of the story is because Red spills a cup of blood?"

"... oh, right. I didn't get that at all."
