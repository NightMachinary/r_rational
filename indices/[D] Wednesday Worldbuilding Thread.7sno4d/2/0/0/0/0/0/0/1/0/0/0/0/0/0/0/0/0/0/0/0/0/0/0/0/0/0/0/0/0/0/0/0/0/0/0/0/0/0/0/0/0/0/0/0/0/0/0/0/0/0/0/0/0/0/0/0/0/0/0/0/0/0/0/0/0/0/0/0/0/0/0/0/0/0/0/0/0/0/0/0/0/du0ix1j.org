  Eh, a thing doesn't have to be important for someone to be its bane. (For example, a rabbit might earn the title "Bane of Carrots" - no-one's suggesting that the carrots are in any way important, just that the rabbit chews through them like anything).
#+end_quote

Yeah, I could see a vampire who was proud of his lack of self-control calling himself the bane of janissaries, but I can't see another vampire bestowing the title on him. I have a friend who, whenever I have people over, he eats more than his fair share of the snacks I put out (it's gotten to the point where I have to tell him, "there's enough for everyone to have two", or he'll end up eating five). I wouldn't call him "the bane of snacks" - I'd call him "the one who takes more than his fair share", because of the impact it has on /me/. So I think vampires would call William "the greedy one" before they call him a bane on janissaries.

  ...but I do see the point that that would need to be demonstrated to the reader. Hmmm. "Messy Eater"? "Creator of bodies"? "Spiller of blood"? "He Who Wastes Good Food"?
#+end_quote

I like these ones, I also thought of "the ruiner of vessels" but that's not very... obvious what it means. "Messy eater" is probably my favourite.

William's most unique quality is that he didn't have a parent (specifically: the vampire who turned him - seeking political influence of some kind - was killed by his army, and it is fortunate that dark ages europe burial traditions (binding the body in bandages) provide the darkness and pressure a vampire body needs to turn). Fortunately, My Vampires slowly become weak to the sun (over the course of a year or so), so he managed to figure out that sunshine was not a good look over time, and would have ultimately found a mentor and been raised in polite society.

So I'm thinking of calling William "the cuckoo" to be poetic and mysterious, since getting by without a parent is a pretty impressive thing and it's the sort of accolade that would be forgotten after the Catastrophe if he didn't put something like that in his name. Alternatives include "the fatherless".

  . 'If this place goes,' he told me, 'I won't be able to keep them off your back anymore, Cassius old fellow. But as long as you can keep it going, you'll be fine. You're not the vampire /of/ Rome. You're the vampire /if/ Rome.' ...and the name kindof stuck."
#+end_quote

[[/llaugh][]] OK, that's a good one... The thought of Cassius holding Rome since antiquity is pretty impressive, too.

    ... octopodes apparently are supremely good parents...
  #+end_quote

  Which is less important than whether or not vampires /know/ that octopodes are great parents. The title doesn't depend on true octopodes, after all, but on the vampire's perception of same. ("The mother bear" would be a reasonable alternative, especially for an overly protective parent).
#+end_quote

Yeah: don't want to go with mother bear which would have been my first thought because Ursula is going to have a really strong bear motif based [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungnyeo][on this myth]] (hence the name Ursula).

Maybe the Ostrich would be a better choice. "The sitting ostrich".

    I've added "lover of men" to Erlis's title because it's particularly appropriate
  #+end_quote

  Given your chosen genre, you /might/ want to make that "Lover of Humans", because as it is it doesn't look at first glance like a species-specific title.
#+end_quote

[[/sweetiepout][]] Buuuut... I thought that was kind of funny :(... you're right though: I'll change it to "lover of man"

    The big problem is I haven't got scenes where I put the vampire titles in there
  #+end_quote

  What, is there never a big social event with a footman at the door calling out titles as people arrive?
#+end_quote

Nope: William's in Rome for an opera, and I did do an early draft of guests being announced and entering a ballroom to mingle, but I quickly realised I had no story to tell there and it was going to be - to do a callback - writing a scene of Cassius playing fetch with his dog just so I could tell the reader that Cassius' dog had a ~deep symbolic~ name.

There's a formal ceremony where Elodia and William meet, and there's a few spots I could put it.

For example:

--------------

/At the appointed time, an automobile parked out the front of their cottage, and six people walked out; Lucia, a young man, an older man, two young ladies and someone who could only be Elodia. She was dressed in a fine seafoam ball gown, covered in flower shapes formed from shimmering jewels that had been meticulously sewn into the fabric. It had short sleeves trimmed with lace and a tight bodice. The skirt was so full, so expanded by the number of ruffles that Red wondered if it would be able to squeeze through the door. Her attendants wore more modern attire; the gentlemen in suits similar to Red's, and the ladies in gowns that were far less extravagant./

/Red opened the door to ensure Duchess Elodia was invited in at once. “Welcome, please, come in, your grace.” He bowed deeply as he had rehearsed with William dozens of times. She gave a small smile, nodded, and entered the cottage./

/William bowed as well, and immediately addressed Elodia in what sounded like rapid-fire Italian. She responded in kind. After a few moments, Elodia looked to Lucia and spoke to her in Italian that was slow enough for Red to understand./

/“Take them to bed now.”/

/“Yes, your grace.” Lucia responded in Italian. She paused for a moment, gave Red a wry grin, and continued in French. “Would you please show us to the rooms his majesty has set aside for us? We would like some rest.”/

--------------

Maybe I should change that passage to involve Lucia announcing Elodia by title and Red announcing William by title.

Do you think the thing I posted yesterday, where William and Cassius address each other by title as a marker of seriousness/respect, flows or do you think the titles just really bog it down? I think the latter but that might be because I've read the titles a million times and my eyes kind of glaze over them... but I also think using them in a sentence like that will make it hard to read. Hm.

#+begin_quote
  I have to wonder if Cassius makes a habit of 'dealing with threats before they are threats' in this manner. After all, if that /was/ Cassius' aim, he could hardly do better then taking away half of William's duchies in exchange for nothing
#+end_quote

Yeah - I think that is very much what Cassius might have been going for. He's worried that in another few hundred years New Holland may be as densely populated as Europe, and in that case then William probably has about ~10 kingdoms worth of land/population and Cassius wants to have his allies in place if/when that fractures.

Of course, Cassius is /also/ aware that the place is mostly a damn desert, so.....

#+begin_quote
  Can they talk as bats?
#+end_quote

I don't think so: no vocal chords. Even if they could, I wouldn't want the damn segment to suddenly be about the cute widdle bats having a chat.

#+begin_quote
  The thing about meeting in a clearing in the middle of nowhere is that (a) as soon as anyone (such as a poacher) sees them, it's /clear/ that this is a clandestine meeting, and if the poacher recognises them then the rumour is everywhere within a day or two, and (b) vampires hiding such a meeting from mere humans sounds a bit like giving up a comfortable chair because you're worried a cow might think worse of you. I imagine vampires having clandestine meetings at private tables in top-class restaurants or conference centres (you know, where they don't have to give up on little luxuries like comfortable chairs) where they speak very quietly in languages virtually unknown to modern man while attended to by highly professional and very deaf serving staff.
#+end_quote

Yeah; the idea is they don't want Elodia finding out, but they could just meet in a town on the island that Elodia doesn't have much of a toehold in and hope there's no-one there who can recognise them. I'll change the setting. Cheers!
