  William didn't think he and Red would exchange gifts so had to panic and come up with the encyclopaedia thing at the last minute
#+end_quote

This makes sense - not that he's unaware of gift-giving, but that he's unaware that they, specifically, would be giving gifts.

And if you want to hint at this to the reader - then the box in which the encyclopedias are found is old and covered in dust, the encyclopedias themselves are from a decade or two before the date at the time, and, of course, they aren't wrapped.

  (Now I'm wondering: do the readers want to see a tutoring session? Probably not)
#+end_quote

Probably not; but yes, it makes sense for William to demonstrate and teach thinking skills in such a situation.

  But it's left by the wayside a bit. It's hard because I think very visually!
#+end_quote

Yeah, I understand that. Lots of people do think visually - but incorporating the other senses goes a long way towards making your scenes feel more real.

  [sense excerpts]
#+end_quote

A good start. (Though, in that last excerpt, did the wine change flavour between the start and the end of the excerpt?) When it comes to smells, there's nothing wrong with saying that the pine smells like pine - people know what pine smells like, and the mention of the scent thereof will remind them of the smell.

But a few mentions here and there, while a good start, are nothing more than a start. The background sounds, scents, smells, tastes and textures (did you ever do anything with the sense of touch?) ideally need to run through the whole work, appearing in most descriptive passages.
