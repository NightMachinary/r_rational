  "It is covering" has the connotation of the covering happening now or continuously, I think??
#+end_quote

So does "it covers". And it is happening, the cake is right there and the chocolate is completely overwhelming the coconut flavour!

  My Dad lived in NZ for a few years but I can't imagine a country my Dad lived in for a short period of his life before I was born is in any way representative.
#+end_quote

Maybe he picked up some minor grammatical habit there, which you have since picked up as 'usual' from him?

  It's interesting to see the logic behind the expressions. There are some expressions on the list that it has that I see as being clearly from one or another variety of English and then there's ones where I'm like "I actually can't believe that people would make that construction"...
#+end_quote

Most of them I could see what they meant but had no idea where they were from. (Some of them I suspect might not be used anywhere, and were simply inserted into the test to allow them to discard results from people who decided to just tick /all/ the boxes).

  Are [Afrikaans and Dutch] mutually intelligible? I always thought they'd diverged further than that.
#+end_quote

I don't personally know any Dutch speakers, but I have it on good authority that the answer is 'yes, as long as you both speak slowly'. One comparison I came across said they were as far apart as Received Pronounciation English and deep Southern American, if that helps.

As far as it goes in writing, Afrikaans did to Dutch spelling something similar to what the Americans did to English spelling, but I have managed to struggle through an article written in Dutch before.

  or at least I assume so - you wouldn't use "om te" to say "I am going to work"
#+end_quote

You would. "Ek gaan om te werk". (Gaan - go, werk - work)

#+begin_quote
  or "I gave my money to the robber"
#+end_quote

Here you wouldn't. "Ek het my geld na die dief gegee." ('To' in this sense is 'na').

#+begin_quote
  I thought English was weird for having "to read","to walk", etc when European languages (and latin) use just one word "lire","marcher"
#+end_quote

Now you know that some languages double down on that.
