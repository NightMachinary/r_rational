  Both "it is covering" and "it covers" pass through my parsing routines without so much as a flicker.

That's strange! I'd mark "it is covering the coconut flavour" as wrong on a test... "It is covering" has the connotation of the covering happening now or continuously, I think?? Eh. Life is weird!!!

  South African, first language English. Nailed it perfectly.

Yeah I don't know why it thought I spoke New Zealand English before Australian. My Dad lived in NZ for a few years but I can't imagine a country my Dad lived in for a short period of his life before I was born is in any way representative. Perhaps it's West Australian English VS East Australian English that is causing that difference.

It's interesting to see the logic behind the expressions. There are some expressions on the list that it has that I see as being clearly from one or another variety of English and then there's ones where I'm like "I actually can't believe that people would make that construction"...

  Afrikaans is to Dutch more or less what American is to English

Are they mutually intelligible? I always thought they'd diverged further than that.

  So, Afrikaans takes the word 'to' and splits it into different places in the sentence.

It's interesting because 'to' is an auxiliary verb used to make the word "read" an infinitive (or at least I assume so - you wouldn't use "om te" to say "I am going to work" or "I gave my money to the robber"?). I thought English was weird for having "to read","to walk", etc when European languages (and latin) use just one word "lire","marcher"
