  Presumably the bullet has a shockwave in the air that reaches the vampire marginally before the bullet does.

Nope - shockwaves through air travel at the speed of sound (sound is a shockwave through air) so the bullet outruns its own shockwave. The bullet has to actually touch the skin (and leave a wound) for this - the reflexive motion just gets the brain out of the way (the rest will heal). And since it's reflexive, your attempt at a headshot just caused the vampire to smash his head through the back of his favourite chair - now he has /another/ reason to be upset...

Of course, if the vampire knows you're there, he might well be fast enough to catch a bullet that he can /see/ coming.

  That'd have to be a hell of a well-prepared hunter, but I'm going to allow this.

Not to mention, an /incredible/ marksman.
