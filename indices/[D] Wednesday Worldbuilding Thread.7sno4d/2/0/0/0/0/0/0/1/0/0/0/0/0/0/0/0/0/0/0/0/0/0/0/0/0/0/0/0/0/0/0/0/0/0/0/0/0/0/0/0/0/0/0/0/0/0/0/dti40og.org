  she could always kill one of her own humans and blame him

Yeah, you end up with a he said she said and I think he'd be believed over her due to their relative status levels. She's better off spreading bad rumours about him (which she also does following the war).

  Of course, that means that for him the best situation is for William to win and come out of this owing him a favour...
#+end_quote

Doesn't turn out that way, but William owed him a favour at least. And hey, if Cassius looks better compared to William, that's a win for Cassius. I imagine they're of similar ages and status.

  I think if Red had taken the original Vampiring offer, there would be a better argument.

Yeah: better still, have him be like that guy in True Blood who sought out a vampire the second they came out of the coffin and managed to get turned because he wanted to live forever. Really transhumanist!Red should be saying to William, right away, "let me be a vampire oh please oh please".

Then again: vampirism has a ~50% failure rate, so maybe a transhumanist wouldn't take that until they'd lived a certain period of time.
