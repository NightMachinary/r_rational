  Of course, other vampires his age or older probably have similar long-range planning abilities - even if they don't always approach things in the same manner.

True... it's probably how William got New Holland in the first place. He didn't like the overcrowding that was happening after the Catastrophe and decided to get in on that Terra Australis everyone else was going to. Of course, they had local vampires there, so he probably had to drive them out and/or start out relatively lowly on the totem pole and/or befriend and backstab them.

(I sort of realised that even though Australia is a white country, the vampires who were in Australia when it got colonised would obviously be from local stock, and I kind of realised it's pretty weird to have vampires being colonial just the same as white people, so I'm trying to fudge around that a bit...)

  "immortality as long as you obey me"

that's a good point even though you were making it on thralls - a vampire is much stronger than its children by definition (because of the age gap), so a vampire child, even if not /magically/ bound to obey, is going to be /practically/ more bound to obey partially because vampires have weird sets of rules (which are partially invented to keep children on their toes) and they have nobody else to go to / etc than their parent. (Sire? I should come up with some terminology for vampire offspring/parents... I was trying out "issue" at one point but I think that's lame.)

  If he's putting them in someone else's territory, then it has to be someone who completely despises the vampire whose territory he's been put in on a personal level

haha i'm imagining volume 3 coming around and Cassius chucking one of his kids in William's territory, and it's someone who just hates... either William specifically or like blonde men or something. Or just has been told vicious rumours about William (all of them actual rumours, of course, just rumours that most vampires know not to believe).
