  Red does ultimately become a heck of a lot smarter.

Smarter or better educated? There's a massive big difference - a man who is poorly educated can still be frighteningly intelligent in certain ways.

Example: Jacob Zuma, current South African president. His official education went up to Standard Four. (That's still primary school). Yet no-one can deny that he's /very/ sharp and knows his way around diplomacy and negotiation like nobody's business.

  And don't worry, it's not going to rival LOTR any time soon: each novel in that series is 130,000+ words.

  Actual predictions:

  Volume One: 75k words

  Volume Two: 60k words

  Volume Three: 80k words

  Epilogue?: 10k words
