  That... actually works out surprisingly well, really.

headcanon! plus the vampire god in question can just leave as she pleases, after all, she can sneak out at nighttime through an entrance the cult doesn't know about. They send people down to be sacrifices and they wander around until they die of thirst.

I don't know if I've shown you this one before (maybe a year ago, it's quite old - I just went through and replaced the word 'e-cigarette' with 'vape' because the story's so old that slang has come out!), but this is the "most complete" thing I have from that, and it's during part of the Strong Female Character's downfall so maybe not.

--------------

She knew it smelled her. She'd read that a vampire always knew the whereabouts of a person it had bitten. There was no way to escape from it now. Even if it couldn't smell her, she was stuck; in the middle of a dark alley, surrounded by walls that seemed thirty metres high.

The creature stood in the opening; the entrance to the alley seemed narrower than when she'd walked in, only a metre wide now. It seemed to fill the space. There was no getting around it.

She didn't scream. She didn't run. She didn't even grab the crossbow that she had on her belt - the crossbow that always had a stake loaded, a stake that could puncture its heart and leave it helpless.

It stood there.

She walked towards it, holding her arms out.

It grabbed her in its big, strong arms. She tilted her head to the side, giving it access to the throbbing arteries in her neck. She could feel her blood pulsing in her jugular, calling out to it, begging it to take her.

It went to bite her....

Jack woke up, breathing heavily. That bloody dream again. That fucking dream.

She stood up, growling under her breath. She'd dreamed it almost every night since the bite. She thought it was the pain medicine at first, so she stopped taking it.

It made no difference.

The details were always different, but it always played out the same way. She was running from it, it caught up to her, and then she went into its arms of her own accord. Sometimes she even dreamed about being fed on. She didn't like waking up from that part.

At this moment, she was as annoyed about having had the dream as she was about having woken up before the good bit.

She paced furiously, her long, thin nightie billowing around her like a storm. She was disgusted at her subconscious. It wanted her to give herself to that steaming, drooling creature. To be embraced by the long dead corpse of a king.

She wasn't going to stand for that. This was a nightmare. It always was.

She would not let herself think otherwise.

~~~~ Six weeks later... ~~~~

Jack held the vape, the tip glowing green, to her lips with a shaking hand. The nicotine helped. She looked like a hooker on the job for the first time. She was even standing by a lamp post, she realised with a nervous chuckle.

She wondered what would happen.

She'd written the note a dozen times. The first time, she'd burned it within seconds of finishing, disgusted. The second time it had taken her a few minutes. The eighth time, she ripped it into big pieces, not bothering to put it in the paper shredder or even to make the pieces small enough not to be worth reassembling.

The ninth time, she took it with her to work. She threw it in the bin in the break room.

The tenth time she took it to work again, and this time left it on the doorstep of the church in broad daylight. But she didn't show up.

The last time, she'd shown up, but she nervously circled the block in her car and drove straight home.

This time, here she was, out of her car. She'd been here almost five minutes. She decided that was enough - she didn't want to do this. She wouldn't leave a note again. It was stupid. She took another drag, having trouble getting the vape into her mouth through the shaking.

She turned around, to get back to her car. She managed not to scream. She bit down on the end of the vape instead. The metal hurt her teeth.

The tall, blonde corpse was standing there. Silent. It looked at her.

“I almost did not bother.”

She managed a tight smile through her vape. She grabbed it out of her mouth and put it in her pocket.

“There are others like you, you know.”

She nodded a little. She felt the crossbow on her belt. She could grab it and shoot it, maybe. Before it knew what was going on. Perhaps that's what she was doing; setting a trap. Yes.

“Put the weapon away.”

She unhooked her crossbow and carefully removed the bolt. She threw it to the ground.

“And the other one.”

She grabbed the silver knife from inside her boot, and handed it to the dead man. It didn't touch it.

“Oh. Sorry.” She murmured. She dropped the knife, too.

“Do you want to go somewhere more private?”

“My... my car.” Jack's voice was high and shaky. She walked towards her car, not moving her gaze from her ghastly companion. She sat in the driver's seat; it moved around to sit beside her.

She couldn't believe she was doing this. What the hell had come over her?

It reached for her arm, holding her wrist up to its mouth. She could feel its cold breath.

“Uh...”

“Yes?”

“Can you... please, not too much, okay?” She tried to make herself smile again.

~~~ One month later... ~~~

She still needed the vape

She leant against the lamp post, waiting. She saw a kid walking towards her on the footpath; probably 18, 19. He was dressed in big pants and chains.

“Hey luv, how much?” He jeered.

She rolled her eyes, ignoring him.

He walked towards her, moving his arm to grab her. Jack reached to unclip her crossbow from her belt.

“Come on, you look like you could suck cock like a drowning -”

She held the bolt against his chest, but that wasn't what shut him up.

There was a six foot tall corpse standing behind him, its hand around his throat. In less than a second, its fangs were in the kid's neck. Blood pooled around its mouth, and the kid's eyes rolled back in pleasure, as he moaned.

The moans quickly gave way to silence.

The dead man dropped the pallid corpse, thick, warm blood still around its mouth.

All Jack could think was to hope it was still hungry.

The only other stuff in that vein I have is some "5 years later" stuff, so the epilogue of the Two Strong Female Characters Fight Bad Guys. I've got some prologue but that's roleplayed rather than written.

And, you know, it does have romance in it. But more action-focused. (I think the romance/action in W/R is about 60/40, whereas in the Jack/Gwyn stuff it'd be more like 30/70). But whatever. Me and Coauthor basically wrote our own Twilight-equivalent with much better male behaviour, so to speak; we loved it and had fun with it. No shame in that! blarggh
