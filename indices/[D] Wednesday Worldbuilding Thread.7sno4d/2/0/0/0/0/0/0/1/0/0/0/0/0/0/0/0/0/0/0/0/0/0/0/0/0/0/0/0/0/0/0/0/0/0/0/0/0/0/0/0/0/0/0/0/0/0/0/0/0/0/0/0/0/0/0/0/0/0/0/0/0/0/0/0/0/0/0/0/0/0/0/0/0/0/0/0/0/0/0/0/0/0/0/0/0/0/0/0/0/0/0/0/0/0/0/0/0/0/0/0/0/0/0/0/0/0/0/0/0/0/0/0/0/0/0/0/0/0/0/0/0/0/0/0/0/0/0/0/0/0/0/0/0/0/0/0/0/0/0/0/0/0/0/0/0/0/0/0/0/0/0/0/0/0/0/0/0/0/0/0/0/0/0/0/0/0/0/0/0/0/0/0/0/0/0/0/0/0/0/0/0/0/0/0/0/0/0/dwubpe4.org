  That's all well and good, until each New Person kills a dozen or so Old People, on average and you end up with Less People overall.

That's a pretty rare case though, I think usually the overall population increases during colonial events, localised conflicts excepted?

  (I'm not sure they can cross an ocean in a night as a bat... but they can certainly be part of the original colonists, especially in a ship which has a sun-proof room).

Vampires don't need to cross the ocean in a night as a bat: they can tie heavy rocks around their necks and walk along the bottom. They don't need to breathe, after all. (Made me realise that they probably had their own transatlantic telegraph before the humans did...)

  I'm just thinking that, if there were native vampires and no colonising vampires, then there would now be a higher percentage of the original native population still around - instead of having around 3% Aboriginals, Australia might have - I don't know - 10%? 30%? It depends how many settlers came, and how quickly their technology would have spread to the natives when the vampires were making sure no-one got genocided, and perhaps even chased some settlers away if they were too trigger-happy...

Maybe Australia has a 3% indigenous population instead of a 0.3% indigenous population because of the vampire influence?

  Why not take both? Sire & progeny when you're being formal, but elder vampires will often call their progeny 'pup' or 'cub' because elder vampires don't have to be formal all the time.

True. I am thinking about this exchange in particular:

#+begin_quote
  “What I do with my janissaries is my business.” William smiled. “Now, what did you want in exchange?”

  “Do you have some land one of my children[progeny?] could rule?”

  “You know I have plenty; it's prey that's the problem. Does this child [Does your progeny?] keep janissaries sustainably?”

  “You're one to judge!”

  “I make my home in a city of three hundred and fifty thousand. I have more than enough. The town I am thinking of has perhaps ten thousand.”

  “That should be fine for a youngster [cub?].”
#+end_quote

Put my proposed updates in square brackets. I've realised that "progeny" doesn't really work as a singular noun though, it feels plural. Also that I really don't like Cassius using the word "youngster" and I think this is probably a fine place to put a slang word like cub in...
