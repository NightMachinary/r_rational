  An average sufficiently affluent person who pays attention to crime statistics before selecting a residence, yes. (Crime statistics are available, and if you ever do come for a visit, it's probably a good idea to check them first).

If I ever travel to South Africa I'd probably stick to the "safe tourist" areas - I don't have much desire to go visit Equestria, for example ;)

  Also, "we're making sure everyone knows that you won't know where it is so that people can't try to threaten you to make you tell".

A nice precommitment contract :)

  Not free, no, but at the same time not "ten years' debt for one hospital visit" like I've heard of from the USA. There is a public healthcare system (somewhat underfunded and under-resourced, and you will find yourself in a long queue) and a private healthcare system (more expensive, but nowhere near USA levels, and the queues are shorter and equipment better).

Yeah, we have a public/private thing going: public has a long queue for some procedures, but the equipment is more or less the same.

About three years ago I had to be admitted to hospital for emergency surgery due to a pelvic bleed (burst ovarian cyst is most likely explanation - basically if you have ovaries there's a decent chance you'll all of a sudden have horrible excruciating pain and need surgery to drain the blood or else put up with the pain for several months while the blood clears! fun). Anyway, I was in hospital for two (maybe three?) nights, had keyhole surgery about ~8 hours after I arrived in the emergency room, and they sent me home with two boxes of pills (paracetamol/acetaminophen and ibuprofen: only $4 a box over the counter but hey), three meals (and milo!) a day, didn't cost me a cent. Went back a week later and had an iron infusion (WORST THING EVER. Would not recommend if you can avoid it), that took a few hours and a bag of... iron(?)... anyway, all of that, didn't cost anything. I do have private insurance but the only benefit that gave me was first dibs on a private room (which I would have got anyway, the hospital I was in only had private rooms since it was a gynecology specialist hospital and was mostly people having babies) and I think some vouchers for parking/lunch for visitors?

And last year I managed to screw up and cut my foot badly by stepping through a table, needed stitches and a tetanus shot, went to the emergency room and they did it for free (the whole rigmarole took 5 hours though :/). I also managed to screw up and injure my finger really badly (accidentally tried to catch a knife...), but I went to a doctor's office for that and had to pay $40 of the $80 consultation fee after the government rebate. Because I didn't want to wait 2-3 hours in the emergency room as I had work that day.

Would this sort of "show up at the emergency room, pay nothing, get treated in a relatively timely manner" be what you'd expect? Or is it less organised than that?

  As a result, there are apparently a number of houses in England to this day which have their windows bricked up, for reasons that don't make the neighbours suspect vampires. I have no doubt you can make good use of this piece of trivia.

Hmmm that does sound interesting. Good place for low status vampires to live - most high status ones would have ostentatious displays of wealth that might make neighbours ask why they haven't paid to have windows added back.
