  As though you wouldn't take two bombs
#+end_quote

I don't think WWII bombers permitted multiple shots. I mean, sure, you could take two bombs, but there's only one set of bomb bay doors and when you open them everything falls out at once...

Though yes, there are better ways to destroy a vampire than using a WWII bomber.

  Not being envious of Red, precisely, but envious of either Red's actual owner (Cassius, who William hasn't purchased Red from yet), or of Red's hypothetical-but-potentially-real-for-all-William-knows boy/girlfriend.
#+end_quote

...that makes /way/ more sense, yes. In that sense, 'envy' seems appropriate - but if he starts discussing purchasing Red from Cassius, then the priest might just start talking about the evils of slavery, so I can see why William didn't broach that topic.

#+begin_quote
  Really I tried to frame the scene as William being worried that his desire for Red is excessive, and he's worried that rather than wanting Red as a status symbol, he's going to end up too attached and do something stupid. (“Not precisely. I fear my... greed... will cause a scandal. It could ruin me.”)
#+end_quote

I know it's not what William meant, but that phrase almost makes it sound like he's afraid of a photo of him kissing Red appearing in the local paper.

#+begin_quote
  Because a Big Powerful Vampire who wants to go through the exercise of talking to a random mook is not going to really care that he wants to possess Red to show off to other vampires, since that's the whole point; he cares that he's risking getting too attached. I wonder if that gets across clearly enough?
#+end_quote

Hmmm. It doesn't come across /clearly/; but there's nothing that explicitly contradicts it.

On the other hand, I don't think it's possible to make it come across clearly in that dialogue-only section without revealing a number of things to the elderly priest that William will not want to spell out. (Ideally, that scene should work with others - perhaps with another interlude including a discussion with a fellow vampire).

#+begin_quote
  I worry that it might be confusing; does the average person think adultery is purely marital infidelity, or do they know it applies to out of wedlock sex equally?
#+end_quote

/I/know that it applies to out-of-wedlock sex. I have no idea whether or not the average person knows that. (My instinct is to say 'yes', but my instincts almost always assume by default that the average person knows what I do so they're not reliable here).
