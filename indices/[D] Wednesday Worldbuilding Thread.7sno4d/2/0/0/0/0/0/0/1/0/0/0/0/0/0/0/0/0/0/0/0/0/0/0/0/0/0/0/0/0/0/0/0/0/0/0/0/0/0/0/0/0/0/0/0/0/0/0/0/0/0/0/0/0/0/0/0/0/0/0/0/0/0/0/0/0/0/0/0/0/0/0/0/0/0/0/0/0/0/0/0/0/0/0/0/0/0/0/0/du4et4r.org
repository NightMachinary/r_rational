  ... I'm imagining a janissary network kind of like a line marriage - they keep on recruiting "junior janissaries" they meet into it, so once a vampire's janissaries are in the "clan", they keep on recruiting one another and any new additions. So it's kind of like a virus: once one of your janissaries has it, they'll all get it sooner or later.

Sounds about right!

  and each vampire thinking they are getting more information /out/ of the janissary network than they are leaking.
#+end_quote

More than half the time,the vampires are probably deliberately leaking things into the jannissary network. After all, espionage is /so/ much easier if you know at least some of what your enemies know... and then there's situations like when Cassius orders his janissaries to start spreading a rumour damaging to Ursula but to tell anyone who asked that they heard it from Erlis (because nobody believes Erlis when he says he didn't start it)...

#+begin_quote
  Nah, I don't think Erlis would let the janissary network get back to him: as in, he wouldn't use it for his own benefit
#+end_quote

Maybe he wouldn't. But a paranoid elder vampire who sees Erlis always talking to the janissaries is going to assume that Erlis /is/ using (or at least monitoring) the network for some reason, and when he can't find that reason, he's going to assume that he's missing something and spend sleepless days trying to figure out what he's missing and how it's going to come back to bite him later...

  Plus, if your Dukes/Duchesses aren't fond of you, they might revolt and cede their territories to a neighbouring Queen/King. It would be a pity if you woke up one evening with 12 duchies and by the time the sun rose you had only two, and that smug snake in the next town over had some prize spots in your territory. Sure, there'd be a war, and maybe you'd make an example of one or two of the Dukes... but you'd be hard pressed to regain all that territory after such a fantastic coup.

That is true, too. Not to mention which, Elodia seems the sort to actually take the time to learn the 800 BC dialect of Chinese and then merely pretend she doesn't know it, just to gain the advantage here... so there's another reason not to actually use her backyard unless one /really/ needs to flaunt power.
