Ah, you're right, that's the problem! Plague needs a vector to spread. Whereas a war makes its own vector (but then you ask: how could a suitably isolationist vampire not hide on a tiny pacific island until everything blew over? and then do I really want my 800 survivors to be disproportionately full of those hidden survivor types?)

Then again, it could just be airborne - but that puts a big tax on /AIR/borne if we're talking about it going across oceans. Human plagues don't do that. Have it airborne and spread by humans - but then you still have the same problem.

To get around the problem you need it to, say, have an incubation period of 200 years or so. Have it be a small contagious defect in the way the nanites (or proteins in cells, or whatever: no need to get specific) replicate. Because vampires grow so slowly, it takes a long time for this defect to be widespread enough in the vampire population. The defect is airborne (though vampires don't need to breathe, they do need to use their lungs to talk, and they feed through their lungs, so crap definitely can get there. In feeding they deposit stuff into the human bloodstream, so they can also infect humans they feed from). By the time people start dying from it, everyone has it; the young vampires are made from seed blood from their Maker, so proportionally speaking they will be as infected by the disease as their Maker was.

This has different connotations depending on the action of the Plague - are certain individual vampires just immune (thanks to something about their human DNA), or is it something about the "line" of their nanites (i.e. they have good antivirus or whatever). If the former then that gives me what I want but maybe makes less sense; the latter could be interesting as all the living vampires would be from one "dynasty" or another, and you end up with vampires who know each other and are grouped into a few loose factions. It doesn't cause much of a racial disparity as Making a vampire doesn't follow racial lines in the same way, and the lines can be very spread out (i.e. maybe all vampires who survived the Plague were the descendants of one Very Healthy vampire who Made a bunch of vampires c. 10,000 BCE - they'd be spread all over the planet in a few centuries).

I think I like the idea of the plague survivors being from "family lines", but they'd also have to be the "luckiest" people from them, probably? Hmm.

The plague winnowing the vampire population over a century or two is no big deal, so that's fine.

The big problem is, does that change the culture? Do the vampires know how it was spread? Would they institute a variety of anti-plague measures as a matter of course even if they didn't know how it was spread? Did vampires accept germ theory c. 1700? (It was first proposed in the Western world c. 1550 and accepted c. 1850). This could be an issue as I have vampires sharing feeding vessels - though that's easy to fix. Then again - even though we know not to share cups, we still do. And vampires are at even less risk from sharing humans than we are sharing cups, given how this plague is the only one of its kind in undead memory. So maybe they'd add a few superstitions - killing any humans a dead vampire fed on, ritual cleaning of this or that - but continue life as normal.
