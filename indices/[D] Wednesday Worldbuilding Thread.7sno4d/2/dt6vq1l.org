Urban fantasy!

Around the year 1600, I have a big disaster with vampires going from a population of, say, 100,000 to 800. The main reasoning behind this is vampire mythology didn't appear until around the year 1700, so having something Big happen in the vampire world around 1700 is a good way to have an in-universe justification for vampires being thousands of years old but mythology being far more recent.

For some reason I ended up settling on the Catastrophe likely being because some vampire almost managed to take over the world and kill all his rivals (i.e. War). Vague religious / purity / generic "save the world from evil vampire" justifications have been trotted out, but it's kind of hard to put a Bad Guy in history who basically almost succeeded in committing genocide and at the same time think of a "reasonable justification".

But, why... why can't it just be a Plague that only affects vampires? I don't need to justify how William (my main vampire) survived it, since the anthropic principle means I'm not going to be writing romance stories about vampires who didn't. The problem with Plague vs War is that a Plague would probably mean that all William's friends from Before were dead, whereas a War, if William had good connections and ended up with, say, a spot in a bunker safe from danger, it would make sense that he'd have quite a few friends from Before. But I've only committed to giving him ONE friend from Before, and if I don't give him any more, he can just have been lucky enough to have kept one friend (and they might even have drifted apart until after the Plague).

I imagine that after the Catastrophe, whatever it was, the 800 vampires would have met together, become friends, etc anyway. I mean they would have kind of had to to maintain their social order.

The other thing that is worse about a plague than a War is that I wanted the Catastrophe to happen around 1700 in e.g. Romania. A War can happen in one place; a Plague is by definition universal. I suppose I can make the vampires have a meeting, post-Plague, and for whatever reason the meeting was in Romania (perhaps it had an unusually high concentration of survivors?). Or the Plague starting in Romania, so the first affected vampires didn't have a "cover-up" plan like was developed later; vampire symptoms of disease could be like what people report corpses "with vampirism" today have (bloody mouths/etc). I'm a bit uneasy about it having a cure that was dispensed to people as in that time sharing a cure would be very slow and you'd end up with a racial disparity, and I don't want to give my vampires any more reason to be super white.

Big problem with the Plague: this will never be covered in-story so maybe isn't relevant, but vampires "under the hood" work based on nanites. So I suppose the Plague could be some sort of virus that causes the nanites to shut down; or just a regular "human" disease that the nanites aren't able to identify and shut off. (I mean, since vampires don't get poisoned periodically, their nanites can presumably fix prion diseases!). Although the whole nanite thing I'm not even going to TRY to touch with a ten-foot pole, I like to make sure that in my head it all makes sense so the worldbuilding has a consistent basis to rest on.

Anyway, thoughts on Plague vs War? Plague also has a lot of angst because it could happen again and they're not sure what caused it in the first place.
