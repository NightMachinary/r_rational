Further down, there's discussion of a mechanism for the Plague - a Y2K type bug (really: any bug that is activated by their own internal clock) in the vampire nanites that some "corrupted" nanites are immune to.

You end up with all the surviving vampires being from one "bloodline" so to speak, and if the bloodline is old enough there might not be anyone alive who remembers that the bloodlines are all related; so it could look like the spell didn't affect "a few dozen" vampire bloodlines, and that could potentially cause infighting.
