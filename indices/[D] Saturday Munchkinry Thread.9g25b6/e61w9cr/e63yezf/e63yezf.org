  problems given enough funding, get some friends to repost it various places so it's at least faux-viral. It doesn't actually need to be a working, or even particularly good, plan, though I'd do my best.

  Set up a video queue of documentaries on world wealth inequality, climate change, that sort of thing. (I don't expect this to help much but it's free so whatever.) Place the monitor in a dark room with no distinguishing features.

  Tie myself up in the dark room, watching the monitor. Have a friend around who's agreed to untie me after a day.

  Body swap with someone rich and evil who speaks a language I know, like Rupert Murdoch or a Koch brother.

  Notice my manifesto on the internet. Be moved to tears by it.

Assuming you can direct who it goes to:

1. Self-assassination through drinking slow acting poisons near the end of the day.
2. Transferring wealth or shorting stocks.
3. Terrorism.
4. Social gaffes or obvious lawbreaking to discredit enemies.
5. Handshake deals that would cost another person credibility to back out of.
6. Award show speeches to raise awareness of minute issues.
7. Large public donations or pledges that are hard to back out of.
8. Assembling blackmail material.

It would be really, really easy to do.
