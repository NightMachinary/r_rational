> And the temperature is always that of the surrounding

​

As in, infinite thermoconductivity? Does this apply to pure ectoplasm as well as transmuted, fake materials? So if you place a rod of it between two rooms with a difference in temperature, they'll equalize much faster than normal?

​

For offensive applications, my first thought was to gather a lot of gaseous ectoplasm in the air, then collapse it to a solid in an enemy's throat. What defenses are there against this?

​

And speaking of the application of Newton's third law, if you make an ectoplasm fist and punch a wall, does it feel like you punched said wall with your actual hands, or does your fake hand just recoil and possibly take damage/break as though it received it?
