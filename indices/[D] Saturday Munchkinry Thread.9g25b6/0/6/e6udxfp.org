Can I just send an ultra fine, durable needle through someone's skull? In the real world, without specialised machinery you can't propel a projectile with all that much force if it is too light, as (in assuming) air resistance quickly overcomes it. If you can constantly push on something very light and durable from a distance, you basically sidestep this problem. I know people love carbon nanotubes, but they have weaknesses. However, in specific directions they can be very strong. While a carbon nanotube needle works likely be easily snapped, from what I understand force applied to the tip or tail of it wouldn't do much at all.

From what I understand about the power system, you can create at the atomic scale, so long as you're producing a certain minimum amount of it (i.e. you could create coal that microscopically has Lord of the Rings written on it, so long as the chunk of coal is of a reasonable size, like a needle or something).
