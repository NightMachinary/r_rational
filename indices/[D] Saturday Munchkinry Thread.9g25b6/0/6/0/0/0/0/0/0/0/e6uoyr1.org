Well, if you burn wood with oxygen, you get energy of chemical bounding of wood + energy of bounds of oxygen (elemental stuff is always 0, cause we needed a reference) - energy of chemical bounding of the products of the reaction (water and co2) There are equations for that. I don't know the english names for that.

Why it is not from the point of creation is, cause you would need more energy to create mass. So nobody could create stuff from ectoplasm.

Why it is not after it dissolves/ is dismissed (not sure if I allow that) cause you could generate a atom bomb and it uses more energy than your body has.
