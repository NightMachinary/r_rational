Sorry I seem to have not made myself clear:

You can make a windmill. And have it powered through wind. No energy cost (except summoning which is neglet able, probably)

If you power it with telekinesis, you power it with your body.

You can also make wood and burn it. The energy you create through that way comes from your body. (And is limited to a not yet defined energy/time rate)

I just don't like to deal with infinity energy scenarios.

You can't exactly maintain it, it will dissolve back into ectoplasm after the time is up. You can resummon it. (That's why I would use real materials for devices and just holes to fill it with ectoplasm if they need to control it)
