As for what I'd do with the energy, anything that I wanted to achieve but couldn't achieve under my own magical power. You could create explosives, flying machines etc, with an abundance of energy you can basically just upscale everything. Obviously you can't use it to directly power up your magic, but you can still do a lot if you can come up with good ways to convert energy from one form to another.
