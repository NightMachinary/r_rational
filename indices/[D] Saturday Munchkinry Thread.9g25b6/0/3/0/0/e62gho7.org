  What would you do with it?

Just make a lot of money, throw parties, get a few wives, chill raise my children. I was mostly interpreting your question as to how can I break / exploit the scenario.

Pretty much the same thing I'd do on earth, if I got bored maybe I'd do some coup in somebody elses name and rule from the shadows while they do all the boring work.

But who am I kidding of course I'd get bored, there are no computers there..

  How would you make force shields with that power?

By that I meant your bubble thing, full plate could stop any other telekinetic attack anyway. Maybe I'd need a gas mask and to be able to transmute water or some fire retardant in case somebody tried attacking me, but that'd be it.

To fight against other telepathic guys I'd just go full plate, and cut them down with a sword. Use my powers for defense mostly. I could just have a unit of 5-10 men with crossbows and shoot the enemy down if needed, or just charge them while protecting my men.

Damage is easy to deal, the part you should focus on is not dying.

PS. thinking about it now, I think you could move faster in flight than we though just because if the power can take you of the ground and you continue using it to push yourself in the air you'd accelerate and go faster as a result, kind of like a skate. Then after reaching what you discovered was your max speed you'd just time your pushes in order to maintain it.
