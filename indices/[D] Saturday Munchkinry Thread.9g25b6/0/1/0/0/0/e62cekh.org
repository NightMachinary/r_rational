  could build a literal fortress around yourself, and move it around slowly as you iteratively destroy and recreate parts further forward.
#+end_quote

Yeah, you can, but recreating it costs some energy. If your time is too short and you don't remember to recreate your fortress (cause you are fighting), you lose your defense. Your fortress can also be only max 1000kg at any point. (If you put all your points in ectoplasm mass)

You could also just create a fortress around you and move it with telekinesis. Probably slow moving, depending on its mass and your max force. Would be interesting how you spend your points and what would make a bigger fortress/tank.

  If I slowly increase the pressure until it exceeds the creation pressure, what exactly happens?
#+end_quote

If outside pressure exceeds creation pressure, you can't create/transmute stuff there. So you can create stuff in water but (probably) not on the bottom of the ocean. Or you can't create a object inside ones body. Or destroy solid stone and bricks by creating something inside.

Since creation pressure is for everyone really low, you couldn't blow a warm water boiler. But a ballon would be no problem^{^}

  Disintegrate the first object, leaving behind a vacuum that causes the second object to implode.
#+end_quote

Sure you could do that. Vaccum wouldn't be perfect, since the material you use would give away atoms (Too lazy to translate/look up Dampfdruck on wikipedia) . I think vaccum bombs wouldn't be too OP to ban them (it would need to be in your range and is limited by how much mass you have), with some destroying pressure. Cause I was thinking of ectoplasm being somehow in an extradimensial space and you push out the material (with a fixed pressure) and destroying the material would mean you can push the material back into the extradimensional space. (Which would happen naturally) And if there is a vaccum on this side you would need to fight the sucking force.

#+begin_quote
  Wait, hold on. You can CHOOSE the material?
#+end_quote

Yeah, isn't that what transmute means? Changing one material (here only your ectoplasm) into anything? (Like lead into gold) I would say creating complex polymere chains (like plastic or wood) or big molecules is harder (more prone to errors and disintecration) than creating I'm thinking of people having specializations/talent. So some can create/control more easily ice/water other rocks. But I have no clue what the numbers would be for that and you are the OP protagonist so you obviously would have a trick to have the specialization of everything. (And if not, you could choose what you want)

  Can you create radioactive materials, like a huge chunk of uranium that would instantly go nuclear?
#+end_quote

Well, maybe... Your energy output depends on what your bodycells (mitochondria) can generate. You shouldn't be able to use up your whole body energy instantly. But if you could at max you can create Energy equal to 0.56 tons of TNT (assuming you have 80kg, it is all fat and 1 kg body fat has 7.000kcal=7.000.000cal) [[http://www.kylesconverter.com/energy,-work,-and-heat/tons-of-tnt-to-calories]]

  . I mean, it would kill you the moment you created it, but a kill everyone button has its
#+end_quote

Yeah, but I guess radioactive material (which kills with radioactive rays) or toxic gases (like HCN) would be produce more destruction. (Against unprotected people. Mages could bubble themself like your fortress idea)
