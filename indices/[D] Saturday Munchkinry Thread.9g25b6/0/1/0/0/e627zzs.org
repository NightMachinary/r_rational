> But just write what you would do if it recharges fast. (Lava ball?)

​

If it recharges fast enough you basically have infinite duration (possibly by creating the objects in shifts). So you could build more or less permanent ectoplasmic structures (within a certain range of yourself). So with enough points in range and strength, you could build a literal fortress around yourself, and move it around slowly as you iteratively destroy and recreate parts further forward.

> Also the pressure inside can't be bigger than the your creation pressure (everyone has the same)

​

What exactly does this mean? If I slowly increase the pressure until it exceeds the creation pressure, what exactly happens? Does the container explode since it can't withstand the pressure? This is what I would expect and works great for making grenades. Or does the whole thing just disappear with no explosion?

​

If creating too much pressure doesn't work, how about creating anti-grenades? Start by creating a large object, then create another object that is an airtight shell around the first object. Disintegrate the first object, leaving behind a vacuum that causes the second object to implode. (If creation pressure is a problem, use an actual solid rather than ectoplasm for the second object. E.g. Pour molten iron over your first object until it solidifies as a shell. It would mean that you need to prepare your anti-grenades beforehand though.)

​

> You would need to use material that doesn't melt (like some ceramics) and it still would lose heat over time.

​

Heat loss could be slowed by using two layers of ectoplasm with a vacuum in between, like a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_flask][vacuum flask]]. As for material, just use tungsten.

​

Wait, hold on. You can CHOOSE the material? Can you create radioactive materials, like a huge chunk of uranium that would instantly go nuclear? Or worse, a chunk of neutrons like that of a neutron star, which would explode out far more violently. I mean, it would kill you the moment you created it, but a kill everyone button has its uses.
