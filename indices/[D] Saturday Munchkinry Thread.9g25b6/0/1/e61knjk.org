> Ectoplasm can temporally simulate solid, liquid or gaseous matter. Like a (steel) sword, water or helium. Some can hold that state for 1min other for 1000min (16,6h). It is harder to control liquid and gases. By a factor of 10 (liquid) and 100 (gases)

​

How long does it take to recharge though? Can I just create a gas for 0.01min repeatedly, over and over?

​

> Some can move one solid object, liquid blob or cloud, others can move up to 100.

​

Say I invest enough points to move 5 solid objects. Can I still create 100 solid objects at the same time, and move 5 of them around to hit the others and get them all moving? For example, can I create 5 bows and have each fire 19 arrows at the same time?

​

I'm not sure I understand what this means. Suppose I go to an active volcano and create a hollow solid sphere of ectoplasm within the lava. Is this sphere as hot as the lava? Now let's say I lift up his sphere full of lava into the air. Does the ectoplasmic shell instantly become air temperature? Does it stay hot because of the lava inside? Or does it just lose heat as any ordinary object would? In other words, is there any way for me to carry a ball of hot lava around with me wherever I go?

Can you create explosions? First, create an empty airtight solid container out of ectoplasm. Then endlessly insert ectoplasm into the container and make it become a gas. Eventually the air pressure will become too much and the container will explode. (To avoid hurting yourself, make the side of the container facing you much much thicker, so the explosion bursts out the other side.) If you can do this fast enough, you basically have an endless supply of grenades. For added lethality, add tiny hard balls or spikes to your container to make a frag grenade.
