A big bottleneck in uplift fiction is that a lot of modern tech takes precision equipment to manufacture.

Ectoplasm solves this really nicely. Create an ectoplasm copy of an object. Wrap it in an ectoplasm mold. Dismiss object 1. Fill mold with metal.

Then, I'd use that to make radios. Once I have radios, I can use fast communication to arbitrage the hell out of whatever commodity markets I can find.

I wouldn't let it be known that radio exists. Instead, I'd use my new wealth to set up wired communication lines,and imply that they were my trick to pass messages so quickly. (See: Barbed Wire Telephone)

Then, I'd use my advantage at machining stuff to make rifles.

Then, you have goblin bands up against rifle infantry units, where the rifle infantry gets instant communications.
