For direct combat applications, I'd default to nitrogen asphyxiation.

The reason that airlines say, "put on your own air mask, before assisting others" is that our lungs burn when we have too much CO2, not when we have too little O2. So, go into a low oxygen environment and you'll feel fine right until you back out. You need to put on your own mask first, otherwise you'll collapse half way into helping the other person.

A cubic meter of air is right around 1.5KG, so it's easy to get the mass. And it takes around 40 seconds to make someone pass out, so putting 200 points into duration gets me there.

Put some points into mass and force, and I should be able to rotate out cubic meters or nitrogen every time one is going to expire.

The reason to do this, instead of overt poison, is that it would be an out of context problem for people outside the modern era.

The audience would see two opponents square off. One feints. The other is confused by the feint and stumbles. Match ends. With no sign of poisoning and no concept of 'inert gas asphyxiation' there's no reason for the opponents to guard against poison.
