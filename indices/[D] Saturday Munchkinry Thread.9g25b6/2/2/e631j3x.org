One day isn't really enough to accomplish a huge amount^{*}. Even if you body swap with one of the most powerful people in the world, your goals wouldn't even be in the planning stages by the time you swapped back and they could cancel it.

So most of the best plans involve getting power to my actual self in a plausible way that's hard to reverse.

1.  Post a manifesto about how to solve all the world's problems given enough funding, get some friends to repost it various places so it's at least faux-viral. It doesn't actually need to be a working, or even particularly good, plan, though I'd do my best.

2.  Set up a video queue of documentaries on world wealth inequality, climate change, that sort of thing. (I don't expect this to help much but it's free so whatever.) Place the monitor in a dark room with no distinguishing features.

3.  Tie myself up in the dark room, watching the monitor. Have a friend around who's agreed to untie me after a day.

4.  Body swap with someone rich and evil who speaks a language I know, like Rupert Murdoch or a Koch brother.

5.  Notice my manifesto on the internet. Be moved to tears by it.

6.  Start asking my advisers to figure out how much money I can get into the hands of the manifesto-writer immediately.

7.  Chat online with myself for a while then arrange a bank transfer to myself.

8.  Spend whatever remaining time I have talking about how much better the world will be now that we're following the plan to whoever will listen. (That is, raise the social cost of going back as much as possible.)

9.  Write a note to myself explaining what I did with my day, then lock my bedroom door and go to bed alone even if whoever I am doesn't normally. (I'm rich and powerful and spent a whole day acting weird so I don't expect this to be hard to convince anyone of.)

10. Post swapping back, start visibly but anonymously following the plan.

This is all assuming it's a one-time thing. If it's repeatable you can do most of the tricks that have been proposed for munhkinning Death Note with a little bit of finesse.

^{*} Unless your goal is just raw destruction, which unfortunately our world is much more ready to begin at the drop of a hat.
