I assume the person get's control of my body, and I can restrain the person in my body somehow (password locked doors, handcuffs, drugs, artificial coma...)

I also assume I can only swap once with the same person. Or is it once at all? If I can only swap once at all, I would research some years a person so I can make the most of it. (Like learn all about Putin and learn Russian... And then taking his body for one important day and telling all his allies (I researched too) they should sign whatever contracts I prepared. Also stealing all his money^^)

unethical means:\\
Political (large scale) goal:\\
Swap bodies with president or king... at important meetings. Maybe discredit politicians with opposing political goals. Like go with the body of an anti-gay rights politician into a gay location 2 days before a bill about gay marriage or something. Or make a (gay) sex video with that body.

Small scale goal:\\
Get money by swapping with a rich guy and buy expensive (untraceable) stuff like jewellery or gold and hide it in some park. And then come back with my own body. Or sign a (prepared) contract to give away all the money to my body. Use that money for small scale goal.\\
Personal goals (like being popular, destroy bullies, get your crush...) Use other people's body to make yourself look good and your enemies bad. Or swap with the boy/girl friend of your crush and break up with him/her/it.

Good stuff you could do:\\
Basically everything above just with ethical rules and altruistic goals (use money for charity...)\\
Fight crime, by switching bodies with criminal. Wearing a wire with the body of some criminal or there associates. Confessing in the body of some criminal or doing a crime so the person gets arrested, would be too unethical for me.
