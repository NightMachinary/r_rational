How much focus does it need to maintain and move it about?

​

Does this mean I can have flight from the start at 30km/h for as long as my build allows? With just a thread / leather band around my torso, and enough force to make myself float?

​

Or I could just fly like mistborn mages 'fly' make a coin and push it into the ground, with enough force it should push me away from it, controlling angles and starting momentum you could fly faster this way. You could land with simple a simple controlled belt around your waist. You can just pull the coin back from the air, because of it's low mass it wouldn't slow you down.

​

You could easily throw things by tying them with a magic rubber band and flinging that around, including people. This means you could remote control things that already exist by just gluing it to your ectoplasm.

​

30km/h is actually enough force to punch holes through people with sharp objects. So I guess flying small spikes that you can control remotely, even with a range of just 20m you could basically defeat most humans with that.

​

Force shields for defense.

​

You could manually make the poisonous gas, put it inside a telekinesis canister with high pressure, remote gas bombs. There's some really silly things you could do to pressurize things with this power, just make a balloon fill it with any gas you want, than contract it with your power..

​

I guess you could breath underwater with oxygen bubbles (you don't need to make the oxygen just the container) and swim at 30km/h with a telekinetic belt or faster with a bit more thinking.

​

You could make strings and control people like puppets.

​

Transmute your power inside a fire... Including things like flammables and explosives.

​

Other than that I guess the obvious, manually build / pay people to build: Steam engines, factories, electric power plants, full plate armor, rifles, cars, artillery, tanks, gas masks, antibiotics, planes, bombs, machineguns... If you had some better understanding of electronics you could have pretty much anything modern manufactured for you, I don't though.
