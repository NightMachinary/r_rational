  I meant making the full plate and sword / buying it..
#+end_quote

Not even sure what the misunderstanding is.

So I just say you totally could buy full plate or make it with ectoplasm. And it is a valid strategy in my mind at least.

The arrow and full plate would depend on bow and arrow and the armor. (I don't know how it was back then) Just keep in mind they could use ectoplasm to make better bows (or crossbows) or drop a 200kg from 200m on you... so you are not invincible.

#+begin_quote
  You are still ignoring acceleration.
#+end_quote

If you fly mistborn style, you can't go faster than 30km/h without losing ectoplasm. (Which I assume you don't want)

#+begin_quote
  Once you are on the air moving fast with your momentum you can just use your power as a belt and float,
#+end_quote

I don't understand the belt.

You could make a lightweight glider with a propeller powered with your power. Than you can fly faster than 30km/h.

#+begin_quote
  It'd be better than mistborn flight because you can make things out of nothing and move them 30km/h faster than you,
#+end_quote

Well you can create/transmute your ectoplasm into stone or something and push it away from you (making you faster with the opposing force). Until it reaches 30km/h difference and you can't target it (and you lose the ectoplasm) If you stop at 29km/h difference and make it follow you, but you would slow down again.

If you create wings and push them faster, you would get pushed in the opposite direction. Since you are connected you wouldn't move.

#+begin_quote
  You can bet that even before we came over some people would have made wings and flown that way with speeds higher than 60km/h.
#+end_quote

Yeah with wings or hotairballons, but not mistborn style. (Maybe I mixxed up comments... Sorry for the confusion.)

Also keep in mind you need to provide the energy.
