> For offensive applications, my first thought was to gather a lot of gaseous ectoplasm in the air, then collapse it to a solid in an enemy's throat. What defenses are there against this?

Well, if the enemy has his own ectoplasm, he can keep a thick layer of it around himself to prevent you from inserting your ectoplasm into his body. Or just stay out of your attack range, seeing as you needed to invest a lot of points into making your ectoplasmic gas last longer than 0.01min instead of range.
