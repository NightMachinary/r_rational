  As in, infinite thermoconductivity? Does this apply to pure ectoplasm as well as transmuted, fake materials? So if you place a rod of it between two rooms with a difference in temperature, they'll equalize much faster than normal?

At the point of creation it has the temperature of its surrounding. If you make a rod inside a hole in a wall, it would be like if you put a rod into it with a temperature between the temperature of those rooms.

  For offensive applications, my first thought was to gather a lot of gaseous ectoplasm in the air, then collapse it to a solid in an enemy's throat. What defenses are there against this?
#+end_quote

You can't transmute from one state into another. (Well you could cool it under the freezing point with normal physics) llYou would need to go back into ectoplasm. BUT you wouldn't need the gaseous state. You could just transmute ectoplasm inside the throat into some solid (since you are in range anyway). But that would be hard to aim if you cannot see inside the throat. Easier to just throw an ectoplasm knife into him.

Still you risk losing your ectoplasm, since your opponent could bubble yours with his.

A technique to counter this would be to always walk in a bubble of ectoplasm, if you can.

Still gas is a good way to kill non-mages (aka canon foddet). If you have the range, mass and time needed to suffocate someone (or poison if you can make it). Some ways around the limits I can think off.

Counter strategy: Have mages catch the gas inside bubbles until opponent is out of ectoplasm.

I forgot to mention how ectoplasm works untransmuted: It acts like ghosts, can't touch, nearly no interaction, can't see someone elses (just a vague sense that it is there and maybe where, if you have the sixth sense) can go through walls It still has mass for the purpose of acceleration (with telekinesis) , but you can't weight something down. You can store and hide all your ectoplasm inside your body (even if it should have a higher volume than your body) And if you transmute it in a place where already matter is (like air or water or maybe loose sand, the ectoplasm pushes the material there away with a really small force. Even loose sand is nearly too much to push away.

I will add it above.

  does it feel like you punched said wall with your actual hands, or does your fake hand just recoil and possibly take damage/break as though it received it?
#+end_quote

You don't really "punch". It would be like throwing a baseball. The thrower only has the opposing force of the throw. The ball get's the force/damage. Since you have a maximum of force you can apply with your telekinesis, that is the maximum of force that will hit your body. So it shouldn't matter if you accelerate a fist (to the max speed of 30kmh) or hit/push with that fist a wall. I think the force hits your whole body (or parts of every living cell of your body). It doesn't just hit your brain or liver or your (not existing) mana chacras.

I think you would have some kind of feedback. But it wouldn't feel like pain or be very accurate.
