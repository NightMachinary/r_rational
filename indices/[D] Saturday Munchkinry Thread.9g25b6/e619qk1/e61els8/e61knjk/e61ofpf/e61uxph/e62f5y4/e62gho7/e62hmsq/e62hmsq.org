  To fight against other telepathic guys I'd just go full plate, and cut them down with a sword. Use my powers for defense mostly. I could just have a unit of 5-10 men with crossbows and shoot the enemy down if needed, or just charge them while protecting my men.

Well, a bubble of ectoplasm would only stop them controlling their ectoplasm inside it. They could still throw something at you (like an arrow) or create poison outside your bubble. I doubt you could react fast enough to transmute the bubble into steel if someone shoots an arrow at you. And depending who you ask, an arrow could go through plate armor.

But yeah, full plate and sword is a valid strategy. (Also you can transmute a sword or armor parts, which you can control with telekinesis after.)

Not sure about the flight speed. The speed rule means, you can't focus your telekinesis on your ectoplasm, if it moves 30km/h relative to you. Let's say you put ~200 points in every category. So you have 200kg ectoplasm, a range of 200m, 200min, 20 objects and 2000N of force (that should be more than enough to keep you hovering, I think... F=m/a --> 2000= m/9,81 ~ m=200kg yeah, should work)

Now you create a coin/plate under you and push yourself up. Than one behind you (on the ground) and push yourself forward. Keep making coins/plates under you, so you don't drop. The coins don't move relative to the ground, but you do. If you move faster than 30km/h you can't target coins on the ground and you lose your ectoplasm. If you move at the speed limit for ectoplasm telekinesis, you can still move your ectoplasm in front of you, since the speedlimit is relative to you. (So you can move your ectoplasm at 60 km/h relative to the ground.) I think that was my mistake, I thought ectoplasm could only move 30 km/h relative to the ground. You need to still be wary of the range limit (here 400m) and keep in mind you have to accelerate your ectoplasm from 0 to 60km/h. (which comes out of the Force budget)

But yeah, "flying" would be like skating or how they fly in mistborn.
