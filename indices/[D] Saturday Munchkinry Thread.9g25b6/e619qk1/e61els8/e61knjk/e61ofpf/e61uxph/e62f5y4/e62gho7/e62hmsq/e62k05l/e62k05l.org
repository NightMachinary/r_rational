I meant making the full plate and sword / buying it..

And no arrows don't go through steel plate and even if they make a hole on it which is Very unlikely, people used gambesons under it so the most an arrow could do is give you a bruise.

And please because I know somebody will do it, Agincourt is the battle you're thinking of, and no the arrows weren't going through plate. It's just that their armor gave them 100% damage reduction 95% of the time but there were so many arrows that the 5% of the time it didn't they were getting enough small wounds to force them to change strategy..

People weren't stupid, knights had been consistently charging archers while under fire for decades by then, it wasn't a stupid new idea some guy invented on the spot, they did it because it worked, until that time when it didn't, for several other reasons other than the armor itself, and they learned from it.

Same with pretty much swords and anything. Steel plate can only be defeated with guns, and it needed to be a musket, early guns couldn't go through it consistently either. Of course a few people can take you down, but on any sort of remotely fair fight plate armor was very hard to beat.

  So you can move your ectoplasm at 60 km/h relative to the ground.

You are still ignoring acceleration. You'd go even faster, you accelerate more and more up to a maximum you could reach based on the speed of the power (Acceleration and speed are different things). So much more than that. Once you are on the air moving fast with your momentum you can just use your power as a belt and float, you wouldn't be moving relative to it at all.

And I guess then once there you can make some other sort of propulsion with your power, like wings or propellers of any sort to accelerate more. Again if you already have the momentum and your power is attached to you, it can give you more acceleration which as a result overtime will give you higher speed.

You could technically go as fast as air resistance wound allow you if you wanted.

And on air you can just wear any sort of wing suit (google it), and gain altitude by moving yourself. Flight is pretty much a given and the speed limit would be quite high.

It'd be better than mistborn flight because you can make things out of nothing and move them 30km/h faster than you, or if that's not possible you just attach the things you make to you and they take your momentum and can generate even more momentum to yourself by moving them. i.e wing flaps and propellers..

You can bet that even before we came over some people would have made wings and flown that way with speeds higher than 60km/h.
