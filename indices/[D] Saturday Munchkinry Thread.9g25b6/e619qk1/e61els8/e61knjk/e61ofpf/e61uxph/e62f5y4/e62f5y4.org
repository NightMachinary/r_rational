  How much focus does it need to maintain and move it about?
#+end_quote

Hard to say. Depending on what you do. It is like if you want to do the same stuff with your hands (if you could do it with your hands). So if you move a needle around with your telekinesis and write something. It would be like you tried to move a needle with one hand and write with the other at the same time.

If you have high objects, you would be able to focus better, 9.1 objects means you can move 10 objects with your telekinisis as precise as someone can move 2 objects on individual paths.

So if you want to rub your belly, pet your head, most can do it. But they get problems if they jump at the same time.

Hope that helps.

  Does this mean I can have flight from the start at 30km/h for as long as my build allows? With just a thread / leather band around my torso, and enough force to make myself float?
#+end_quote

Nope, that is not possible (you could make a ultra light plane woth the right materials) you would need to push against it.

#+begin_quote
  Or I could just fly like mistborn mages 'fly' make a coin and push it into the ground, with enough force it should push me away from it, controlling angles and starting momentum you could fly faster this way.
#+end_quote

Yeah, depending on your stats that should be possible. Keep in mind, you don't want to leave the ectoplasm coins behind (or you run out of ectoplasm). And the speed limit for your telekinesis doesn't care if you move or your ectoplasm relativ to you. So you probably only able to "fly" 15km/h (or max 30km/h by leaving coins behind) which would still be faster and more energy efficient than if you run.

#+begin_quote
  30km/h is actually enough force to punch holes through people with sharp objects.
#+end_quote

Yeah, you can snipe people. But they can catch your ectoplasm by bubbling it. Battle mages probably have always sphere around them with captured ectoplasm. (Some would fake bigger spheres to pretend to be strong, others smaller to pretend to be weak.) You lose telekinesis control if someone elses ectoplasm bubbles yours. (If you are outside the bubble). So yeah someone could bubble you, when all your ectoplasm is away. (So allways keep some near/in you)

#+begin_quote
  This means you could remote control things that already exist by just gluing it to your ectoplasm.
#+end_quote

Yeah. Depending on your stats. Control would be harder.

#+begin_quote
  You could make strings and control people like puppets.
#+end_quote

Limited to force and objects you can create (and range). The strings are also not indestructible, they are as tough as the material you make them off (so even normal peolpe could free themself). Still the danger of your ectoplasm getting captured by other mages.

  Transmute your power inside a fire... Including things like flammables and explosives.
#+end_quote

The energy/work you give to the environment is limited to your caloric intake/ energy your bodycells (mitochondria) can produce per second. (No free energy, that includes chemical energy.)

But yeah you could do it. Somewhere I wrote an educated guess how much that is at maximum. (Search for TNT)

#+begin_quote
  Other than that I guess the obvious, manually build / pay people to build: Steam engines, factories, electric power plants, full plate armor, rifles, cars, artillery, tanks, gas masks, antibiotics, planes, bombs, machineguns...
#+end_quote

What would you do with it? Get rich and powerful so you could become Overlord of the planet? Make an university and make everyone's live better? (You would want food, meaning fertilizer, and pesticides for that. Tractors can be replaced by mages. And fight diseases with hygiene and antibioticums )

Personally I would make a trade empire and undermine monarchies by empowering peasants. Also making it like the Habsburgers and making alliances with marriages. While also trying to make a more ethical world. Meaning human rights, feminism (hard to combine with political marriages), gay rights, freedom of religion and animal liberation. Hard goals. Maybe starting a university for philosophy with babies so I can brainwash them with my moral values

Keep in mind, there are monsters like slimes, goblins and dragons...

#+begin_quote
  Force shields for defense.
#+end_quote

How would you make force shields with that power? You would need ectoplasm matter there, and that would be not really different than holding up shields with telekinesis. Depending on what material you used as shields, someone can break them or shoot arrows through them.
