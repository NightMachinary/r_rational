But in the laser example, you could pick a material that is very poor at conducting heat, and just use the most reflective stuff you can to channel the beam into harmfulness. None of (or very little) of the energy is actually going into your constructs.

So if I created a windmill, that I then used to turn a gear, I would still pay for the kinetic energy turning the gear? If so, personally I really disagree with that decision. Any energy that you interact with with your ectoplasm drains an equivalent amount from you? It just doesn't seem to follow the vibe of the rest of the system for me. It seems very artificially restrictive. Easy to accidentally kill yourself too.

Basically, I don't like not being able to harness energy in a logical fashion because of an arbitrary limitation. It just seems a bit hacky. Surely if I create a windmill that gets spun by the wind, the only cost I need to pay is the cost required to maintain the windmill? But apparently not?

I might be misunderstanding. I am definitely rambling. Other than this, I love the idea of a more material based magic system, good job.
