Not sure how you would get a laser. But sure you could make a huge magnifying glass and mirror. But the materials you make are exactly as normal materials, except they vanish after a time, can be telekinetically moved by you and energy they produce has to come from you. Also your enemies can make mirrors or learn it fast.

  Does default ectoplasm divert normal objects? Because you could try the needle strategy with a real projectile and it would be "armour" piercing. If you can throw with enough accuracy and force from far enough away, (i.e. bullet speed) then you can oneshot anyone who doesn't always walk around with conjured material shields.

Ectoplasm only interact in small ways, like ghost basically, thats why I named it ectoplasm. But you can take a needle and put some transmuted ectoplasm on/in it and move the needle with it.

But I think you misunderstood the ectoplasm bubble. If you have an ectoplasm bubble around you, others can't control their ectoplasm in the bubble from outside. They still can throw a transmuted object in the bubble. (It is just stupid, because you would easily lose your ectoplasm and it takes long time to regenerate. )

  Unless there's an arbitrary limit around it, provided you have the required engineering knowledge and the magical skills and ability, there's nothing preventing you from harnessing other forms of energy in order to achieve greater effects than they otherwise could. Real materials can obviously aid in this as well.

Energy you win with ectoplasm comes from your body. I think that should mean if you heat up transmuted ectoplasm, the energy should go back into your body. Not sure about that, maybe there is energy lost. But yeah, sure there is a way to harness energy (as long as it doesn't come from you. The question is how ;-)

Still, what would you do with the energy?

I think most would make devices with real materials with holes to insert transmuted ectoplasm for control or something.
