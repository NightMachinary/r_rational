Could you use a construct to collect sunlight and channel it into a laser? All you need is the energy to create the materials and divert the heat from your body.

Does default ectoplasm divert normal objects? Because you could try the needle strategy with a real projectile and it would be "armour" piercing. If you can throw with enough accuracy and force from far enough away, (i.e. bullet speed) then you can oneshot anyone who doesn't always walk around with conjured material shields.

Unless there's an arbitrary limit around it, provided you have the required engineering knowledge and the magical skills and ability, there's nothing preventing you from harnessing other forms of energy in order to achieve greater effects than they otherwise could. Real materials can obviously aid in this as well.
