  6000 weak mages could accelerate a small object to a decent fraction of the speed of light.

No, they couldn't. You seem to missed this part of the rules:

#+begin_quote
  Speed (and acceleration) of telekinesis is limited to a human punch (~30km/h or~20mph) (but you could transmute a bow and shoot an ectoplasm arrow faster)
#+end_quote

In some commands I explained it more. You can't target your own ectoplasm telekinetically, if it is moving faster than 30 km/h.

Please explain how 6000 people have enough calories to accelerate something to "a decent fraction of the speed of light" Assumption: Calories of 6000 people = 338 *10^{7} kcal (= 6000 x 7000kcal (for 1kg human fat) x 80kg (average bodymass) ) Calories to accelerate 1kg mass to 2997924 m / s (1% of c) = 1073319517265.7 calorie = 107 *10^{7} kcal [[https://www.ajdesigner.com/phpenergykenetic/kenetic_energy_equation.php#ajscroll]]

So they would need to burn 1/3 of their body mass in the time it takes the accelerating object to leave their range. (Which isn't possible, since they produce the energy via their mitochondria.) Which would kill them.

And in that assumption, the 6000 people are made completely of fat (highest energy density).

Put yeah, a mage could drop a bolder. They wouldn't need other mages, since they could make an ectoplasm glider and power a propeller (or start at the top of a mountain). Still they risk their ectoplasm gets bubbled and a bolder is a lot ectoplasm.

Let's assume standard fantasy flying dragon: a few tons, strong enough to fly with too small wings, fire breath. And basically extinct. If the dragon flies 200m up, most mages can only throw stuff (including ectoplasm) on them. Maybe dragon fire burns (destroys forever) untransmuted ectoplasm. Maybe dragonskin untransmute transmuted ectoplasm. Maybe dragons have an aura that suppress transmuting ectoplasm. Not sure what ability I give them, but 6000 soldiers prepared to fight a dragon should have a winning chance, maybe not a much higher one than 1000 people, but still a winning chance. (Also I plan to have smaller dragons and some non flying ones, and some with no fire... )

Other monsters: goblins use swarm tactics, kill one human for every 3 goblins is a good result for them doppelgänger/mimics surprise attacks and hide again (tiny) insect monsters poison sting/bite attacks (still a slap can kill them) harpies/flying monsters hit and run tactics, cause nobody looks up... ghosts no walls will protect you zombies, you morn your friend/wonder why he walks funny, until he bites you. And he doesn't stop from a crippling wound. fae and vampire's hypnosis attack would flatten you.

I think monsters are still a threat to everyone who isn't prepared to fight them. Of course an army against 1-10 monsters should always win. (Still, maybe the monsters escape unharmed or they kill more soldiers than the army wants/can tolerate.) Except against doppelgängers. More people means just doppelgängers need more time to kill them all.

  Basically, what it means is that medieval society doesn't make sense anymore. "in a fantasy world with a tech level of the renaissance" well, they don't need to live in a medieval society (i know fantasy world is often synonym with medieval time/society, didn't mean it that way), but at some point they should have the tech level of the renaissance. (even if they don't follow our tech tree) Still, I think king and lords are still plausible with genetic mages or random mages. Castles are less likely to matter though. (cause dropping bolders, flying mages...) We don't have powers and still have many different forms of governments. I think as long as you don't have quasi gods, you will find the whole political spectrum with enough time. Unless there is only one very powerful person (that can kill armies alone). As long as the (magic) power is somewhat spread over the population, society will not be vastly different.

Also you get 1000 points, since you would be a summoned hero/reincarnated soul/the MC most other mages would get less points. The average mage would have 250 points, "randomly" spread in the categorie (talent, training, maybe genes). (Still there are some with more points than you.)
