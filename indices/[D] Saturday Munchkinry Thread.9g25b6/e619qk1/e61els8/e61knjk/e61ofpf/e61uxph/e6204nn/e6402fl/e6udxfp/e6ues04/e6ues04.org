I think a steel needle would be enough to kill someone in that way.

I think it is a good strategy for an assassin, but not good against a prepared mage with enough ectoplasm (aka on a battlefield or dueling area)

Cause one counterstrategy would be to have a bubble of untransformed ectoplasm around them. You would lose control of your ectoplasm in it. (So you would basically attack your opponent with a 30kmh needle from ~1m distance)

Also you need to somehow know where your needle is for aiming.

I think one knife or more would be better.

Or a crossbow/gun you control/reload with attached ectoplasm. You would still need to aim somehow.

I think a needle would need to be aimed at specific targets to kill. Other areas would make them easy targets in battles (like eyes)

But leaving needles on the ground and using them when you get an opportunity could save your live.

You would need enough points in time. And if someone finds one they can bubble it, so you have less ectoplasm.

I think every army would have a group of mages that are only responsible for captured ectoplasm.
