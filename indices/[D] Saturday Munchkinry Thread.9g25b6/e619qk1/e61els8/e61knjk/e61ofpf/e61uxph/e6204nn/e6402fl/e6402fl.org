It's pretty telling that no one thought of mages working together. 6000 weak mages could accelerate a small object to a decent fraction of the speed of light. Basically at those speeds, you're dealing with modern bombs in medieval times. An even larger army takes that into the scale of nuclear arms. The Battle of Lepanto had something like 140,000 people there (50,00 troops, the rest sailors and slaves). This plus the ability to make poison gas means that non-mage armies are relatively pointless.

Or imagine a team of mages that focuses on compressing matter. It probably wouldn't take that many working on an small point to get very high temperatures. They might even be able to make diamonds or diamond tools.

Castles would also be largely pointless without mages. Cannonballs and trebuchets become tug of war / homing missiles.

A bunch of mages could a powerful one up high, who could materialize a very heavy boulder, and just let it fall.

​

Basically, what it means is that medieval society doesn't make sense anymore. Instead you get a Spartan style tiered oligarchy with non-special people as slaves if the ability is genetic. If it's not, then a republic becomes more fashionable, because most people would remember their origins. Monsters aren't a threat unless they have the same abilities. Otherwise a dragon could just be /punched out of the air./ Though why Dragon's wouldn't use humans as slave labor is beyond me and structure their own societies.

If Goblins have the same power and breed faster, they would be on top unless they weren't good farmers. If they didn't, they would be wiped out, like the other species of humans that existed with us.
