So you would still lose bodily energy even if you burned the wood with external power? I suppose that makes sense, but wouldn't you lose the energy as soon as you created the wood, since that's where most of the energy in burning is coming from?

Or is it more like ectoplasm basically acts as almost-free energy until you try to convert it into real energy? If that makes sense.
