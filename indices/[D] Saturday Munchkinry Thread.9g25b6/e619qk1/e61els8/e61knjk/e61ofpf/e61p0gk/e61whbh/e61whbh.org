Drop me in ye olden times, without magic, and I could eventually get a machine shop running. It would be a beast and a half to do.

The practical problem is that modern techniques need precision tooling. And it takes precision tooling to make precision tooling.

1KG of ectoplasm, plus the ability to make any 2 objects, (and apply precise forces at 10N!) lets me skip the iteration of slightly increasing precision and just make whatever component is the current bottleneck.

So the real power is ability to do modern machining. Fighting with this is like bludgeoning someone with a drill press. You could, but why?

For instance, I want a magnet. So I buy some iron nails and a rope. Then I make 500g of ectoplasmic gold wire, and a 500g ectoplasmic rare earth magnet.

Use magic to wrap the wire around a nail. Use magic to create some inductance coils. Twist the rare earth magnet in the rope until it's under a ton of tension. Release. Spinning magnet near induction coils produces DC current. DC current in a wire around a nail will magnetize the nail.

It would take me a couple tries to get the technique down (which coil is supposed to have more loops?) but inside an afternoon I'd expect to have a supply of permenant magnets. Do something similar for the rest of the half dozen bits you need to make a shitty AM radio.

Or, for a ready supply of money, buy a shallow box. Magic up some mercury. Pour molten glass onto mercury. Cool. Polish with summoned high grit abrasive and a rag. Used summoned glass scoring wheel to cut into panes.

The result is "float glass", and is better for windows than anything people had prior to 1950.
