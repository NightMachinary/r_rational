  How long does it take to recharge though? Can I just create a gas for 0.01min repeatedly, over and over?
#+end_quote

Hmm... I edited my first post after you posted. The ectoplasm transmuting into gas would push the air away with a force (no number given cause i don't want to calculate). It would be like if you open a valve of a container that is under constant pressure (not much pressure) and you close it after your ectoplasm limit is reached . There are formulars to calculate how much volume goes out per second.

Back to your question, you could but the work you do by pushing away air comes from your body. And the Volume/mass you create is limited by that. You don't create your whole reservoir instantly

But just write what you would do if it recharges fast. (Lava ball?)

  Suppose I go to an active volcano and create a hollow solid sphere of ectoplasm within the lava. Is this sphere as hot as the lava? Now let's say I lift up his sphere full of lava into the air.
#+end_quote

You probably couldn't push the lava away. But in the air above the lava creating a sphere with a hole (as hot as the air in a volcano) . Now you move it in the lava with telekinesis and fill it up and close it. The sphere acts from the moment you create it like a ordinary object (you can move with telekinesis). You would need to use material that doesn't melt (like some ceramics) and it still would lose heat over time.

But let's say you can have a ball of lava with you (with some handicaps). The limiting factor for size would probably be the force. And how long you can maintain the sphere would depend on your concentration (if you constantly recreate it)

  Can you create explosions?
#+end_quote

Yes, but... Energy comes from your body, you would need at least two objects (sphere + gas) and each metal shrapnel would be an object (of course doesn't count to your object limit if you don't telemove it) but you can't generate more than your object stat at the same time. Also still limited by maximum volume/second.So it wouldn't be that fast.

#+begin_quote
  Eventually the air pressure will become too much and the container will explode.
#+end_quote

Also the pressure inside can't be bigger than the your creation pressure (everyone has the same)

You could put the sphere in a cold place and make a liquid that is liquid at that temperature and a gas at room temperature. Just less controll

Or just make a chemical explosive. Just keep in mind, that your body produces that used energy. (So you could starve by throwing granates) And chemical explosives waste so much heat... i think... but I also heard sugar has more calories than some explosives.
