Well, you would need points in objects.

I still don't get why you need precision tooling for a radio.

But let's assume you can make all the stuff you need. Keep in mind you still are limited by the points you have and can't change them later. And other people there have probably less points and basically put them into random categories.

Two (unmentioned?) rules that are important for you: if you heat your transmuted ectoplasm up and time runs out/you dismiss it at higher temperature, the heat goes into your body. (Cause I want conservation of energy)

Secondly, you are assuming you can create stuff precisely. I first wanted to make a category control, but decided against it (hard to put numbers on it, describe it) and instead make the category time and gave everyone the same control. So you can only have solid objects bigger than 1mikrometer (i think that is the limit what you can still feel an edge with your fingers). And creating stuff is limited how good you see it. (So if you can't see 1mm difference in thickness you can't create it that precise... microscopes are no help^{^{)}}

Well the second rule for control is more like: You create/transmute material by pushing it out of an extradimensional space. So creating precise is like you add material with a 3d printer that you control with your hands, not a computer

But let's just say you found a way around that. And can do what you want. So you would get rich with trade and advance technology fast to our level. (Don't forget agriculture, people still need food.)

Keep in mind people there can use also ectoplasm. So they have a slightly different technology and needs than we did in the renaissance. For example they would have better mechanical devices (like catapults) since they can create steel in any shape fast with ectoplasm. Chemistry shouldn't be more advanced. Maybe even less so, since they would think everything is made out of ectoplasm...
