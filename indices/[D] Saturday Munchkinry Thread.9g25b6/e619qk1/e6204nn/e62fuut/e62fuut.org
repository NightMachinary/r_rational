Yeah valid strategy and it would work most of the time. People can sense ectoplasm and transmuted matter in a limited way.

Just keep in mind most people can hold their breath for a minute in rest. (Athletes longer). So one counter strategy would be to kill you fast, breath later. Another one would be to bubble your transmuted ectoplasm (or you) and let the gas vanish. Or staying out of your range and snipe you.

I think most battle mages would have a bubble of ectoplasm around themselves, to prevent people creating/transmuting a knife behind their back. And also making it harder to bubble them and cutting their control of their ectoplasm farther away.

(I thought 1mÂ³ air is about 1kg... I will look it up later.) How would you distribute your other points? Every category ~200? (That is what I would do without knowledge what exactly is possible and practicable...)
