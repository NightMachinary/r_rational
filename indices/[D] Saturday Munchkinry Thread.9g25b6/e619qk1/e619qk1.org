You live in a world where 10% have the power to use telekinesis.

But they can only effect there own +magic particles+ ectoplasm. They can also transmute the ectoplasm into fake material. It reverts slowly back.\\
And there are some ways to block the telekinesis. (Like with distance, a thick layer of someone elses ectoplasm, and probably other stuff)Speed (and acceleration) of telekinesis is limited to a human punch (~30km/h or~20mph) (but you could transmute a bow and shoot an ectoplasm arrow faster)\\
And the temperature is always that of the surrounding (but you could build a freezer).\\
The energy you give the environment comes out of your body (produced by your mitochondria). So no free energy.\\
Also, that is still true: " When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body. "

Also to prevent chemistry shenanigans, no (solid) particles smaller than

- They have only a limited amount of ectoplasm. Like weak magic user have 1kg, the strongest have 1000kg of that stuff.
- Ectoplasm can temporally simulate solid, liquid or gaseous matter. Like a (steel) sword, water or helium. Some can hold that state for 1min other for 1000min (16,6h). It is harder to control liquid and gases. By a factor of 10 (liquid) and 100 (gases)
- Some have a telekinetic range from 1m other 1000m (1km). (They can't effect ectoplasm outside of there range.) You have a vague sense where your ectoplasm is, but you want to see it, if you want to control it with any skill.
- Some can produce a force of 10 Newton other the force of 10000Newton [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(force][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(force)]]) (without the mass of there own ectoplasm or it's speed included) So one could have a coin of ectoplasm and another a bolder and both could have the same carry capacity.
- Some can move one solid object, liquid blob or cloud, others can move up to 100.

Normally that all depends on talent and training, but for your min/maxing you can use 1000 points. You also start with 1 point in every category (so you have 1005 points). That means you can have 1kg ectoplasm, you can transmute for 1 min, in a distance of 1m, 10 Newtons and 0,1 objects. (0.1 objects means you can use one object with 10% of the ectoplasm you have. 1.3 Objects means you can control 2 objects, but one can only have 30% of your ectoplasm reservoir. And it becomes irrelevant at 9.1 objects.)

The object rules/points may change. Keep in mind, a crossbow is made of different parts, which would be counted as different objects.

So, what would you do, if you got transported (without any objects or devices) or reincarnated in a fantasy world with a tech level of the renaissance (~15.-16. century), where 10% have ectoplasm and monsters like goblins and dragons exist. You have all the knowledge you can google now.^^

Or what cool stuff should people there be able to do?

How would you fight/built your powers in a death tournament against single opponents?

And how if you had to fight against armies without ectoplasm?

EDIT: formating

Edit2: I forgot to mention how ectoplasm works untransmuted: It acts like ghosts, can't touch, nearly no interaction, can't see someone elses (just a vague sense that it is there and maybe where, if you have the sixth sense) can go through walls It still has mass for the purpose of acceleration (with telekinesis) , but you can't weight something down. You can store and hide all your ectoplasm inside your body (even if it should have a higher volume than your body) And if you transmute it in a place where already matter is (like air or water or maybe loose sand, the ectoplasm pushes the material there away with a really small force. Even loose sand is nearly too much to push away.
