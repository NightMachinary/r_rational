In terms of worrying about lending from Mercantis, I think once things settle they aren't going to be in as strong a position as might be assumed. Presuming that Black ends with some sort of success in his coup against Malicia, literally every country on Calernia that Mercantis can realistically do business with (ie. not the Golden Bloom or Bellerophon [or Ashur in its current state]) will have fought against the Dead King in some capacity (disparate portions of the Free Cities nonwithstanding). They clearly work with those across the ocean, but basing themselves solely on that isn't sustainable. Certainly not at Mercantis' current size.

 

The rest of the Grand Alliance isn't going band together to push for Procer to not have to pay Mercantis back anything, but if they wanted to they just about could. Especially since what ever mercenary pool Mercantis might hire from is going to be all but bled dry in between pushing against Keter and the bloodbath that will be the overthrowing of the longest reigning Dread Empress to ever live.

 

Who knows what the final deal will be, but Procer and Callow aren't going to be bent over a barrel at then end of it. Hell, if things go extremely well, maybe it can be parlayed into a funding of Cardinal.
