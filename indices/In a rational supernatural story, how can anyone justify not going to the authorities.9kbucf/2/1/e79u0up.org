I feel Jill Kismet dealt with this particular aspect very well. She had a chapter where the rookie cops are briefed on the existence of the supernatural, and the fact that to keep them safe, when they encounter that stuff, they contact the Hunters and DO NOT investigate it more themselves. The less they know, the better.
