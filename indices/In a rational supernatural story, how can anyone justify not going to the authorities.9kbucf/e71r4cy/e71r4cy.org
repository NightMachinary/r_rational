In my experience it's usually implied or outright stated that the characters expect the authorities will not believe them.

Depending on the situation that's not necessarily unreasonable, as it's unlikely that the police would say: cancel a parade because a bunch of teenagers say ghosts are going to kill people because of this old journal they found in the woods about a town fire that started at a similar parade a hundred years ago.

​

A variant would be that the authorities don't actually have any jurisdiction over the matter (possibly you juts don't know about the authorities who do), or you have to confess to a real crime to accuse others of a potential crime.

For example it probably isn't actually illegal to slaughter a goat and have an orgy while covered in its blood for the purposes of petitioning Sub'nigreth. But peeping in the window while people have an orgy is illegal and probably lands you on the registered sex offender list. And then it's you word against theirs when you claim they were petitioning it to accept the town as food for the monster they want to summon, not say: a plateful harvest.
