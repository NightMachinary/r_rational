The Anita Blake series tackles this by just having the entire world be low fantasy. Sure the cops are involved, but vampires are people with rights and when they step out of line, there are executioners who fix the problems.

That said, if you're curious about the series, don't read past Obsidian Butterfly. It goes from GoT stype "porn every so often" to full on smut afterwards.
