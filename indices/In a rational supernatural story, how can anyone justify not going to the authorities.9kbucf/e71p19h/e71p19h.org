Reality is self-censoring. If you wander off the beaten path, or something Weird wanders across it, you will not remember what you experienced. At least, not for long. You need repeated, regular exposure to Weird Shit for any of your memories to stick. Otherwise you will eventually rationalise it away as something mundane.

Meanwhile, trying to go public with your discovery will backfire horribly. The more unaware people who learn about your Weird Shit, the more the universe itself will take notice, and move to bury your truth. Maybe your camera breaks. Maybe your computer mysteriously wipes itself. Maybe a Thing from the Other Side bores a hole into this world, and erases you from history.

You don't hear about people going to the authorities, because those people disappear. Thus, in accordance with natural selection, the only people left are those who don't immediately try to tear the masquerade wide open.
