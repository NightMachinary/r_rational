The authorities being compromised is the easy solution.

But I think "information-security magic is really good in this setting" is also a strong option, especially for the types of stories people around here like. That includes options like Lovecraftian corrupting knowledge, Voldemort's name curse, all the antimemes in the SCP archives, and the cryptography-inspired stuff from Horry Patter And The Philologer's Stone.

Any of those could be inherent: everyone who knows about magic has to perform a ritual sacrifice once per moon or they turn into a wraith - or a passive effect of a creature: vampires know the location of everyone who knows their true identity - or a spell someone actually cast: no wizard would teach anyone their secrets without cursing them to be unable to speak them.
