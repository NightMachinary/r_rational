This is something I've gone back and forth on a few times- on one hand, aging the character up a few years and making them an 18-22 year-old rookie cop in the supernatural activities division is an easy sell, and in a lot of ways bypasses the common obstacles we've been discussing.

On the flip side, though, you miss out on an awful lot of interesting storytelling; this might just be a personal bias, but in stories that are rooted in a character or group of people discovering what lies behind the masquerade and using their wits to survive, I really dislike when there's a mentor character who exists explicitly to provide exposition and direct them. It's a really useful trope (Giles and the Watchers stuck around well into Buffy's adulthood for exactly that reason), but I think it's fundamentally more interesting to see the protagonist research and overcome their problem than it is to watch them blindly rely on a third party's know-how.
