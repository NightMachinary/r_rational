It was brought up in another comment, but I'll expand upon it here. What if your protagonist /is/ the authorities? Some government agency caught wind of something and is sending in an agent to investigate. Or maybe they've known for years and the character is part of a Men In Black type group meant to investigate and suppress the supernatural. Combine with a "people aware of the supernatural are more vulnerable to it" explanation for why the government doesn't just make it common knowledge.
