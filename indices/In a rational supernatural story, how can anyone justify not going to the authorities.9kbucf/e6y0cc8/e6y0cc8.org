A rational [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade][masquerade]] is going to be tiny, capable, isolated, ruthless, and savvy.

A group of vampires is functionally an organized crime framily. Law enforcement will treat cases surrounding them that way, so they'd be well served to foster that appearance and embrace criminal enterprises that embrace those assumptions, as well as whatever legitimate businesses organized crime would use as covers.

Law enforcement doesn't have to be incompetent in order to accept rational explanations, especially in environments where they have limited workforce or funding: An occasional chopped up corpse, a burned body, "Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown."

The few victims that escape with genuine stories of supernatural events can probably be accepted as delusion, wind up in a heap of mysterious crimes, or be bunched under the auspices a mysterious and theatrical serial killer.

Have the protagonists go to the authorities, have the authorities take their statements and answer their questions and possibly tell them about ongoing cases. Have the protagonist go to the media, and have the media get excited and write up something that ultimately sounds a lot like any other small-time crime reporting. Have them approached by conspiracy theorists who turn out to be crazy and wrong.

Strange things happen all the time, and lots of people think they've experienced supernatural events of many, many kinds. The background radiation is intense, and so long as the supernatural keeps its heads down they'll fade into obscurity with little effort.

This also means the rational supernatural has to be relatively mundane, and it's got to be trying to blend in. This excludes some fun and exciting tales in favor of hard-boiled deconstructions. Your mileage may vary.

EDIT: Oh, and if the protagonist /does/ acquire solid proof of the supernatural, have them take it to authorities and fight the "organized crime family" as it attempts to suppress them and see what story that turns into. That actually happens in the world of organized crime, but I've never seen the premise taken seriously for supernatural events.
