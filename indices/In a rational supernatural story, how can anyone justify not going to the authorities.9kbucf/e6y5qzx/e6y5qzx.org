In the real world, if vampires actually existed, we'd almost certainly already know about it. In your story, if vampires actually exist, and the protagonist did not start the story knowing this, /there is a reason/. Essentially, worlds that actually contain vampires (or other supernatural beings that manage to remain hidden from society at large) are likely to produce priors that argue against involving the authorities. Personally, I like [[http://www.tgdmb.com/viewtopic.php?t=52316][After Sundown]]'s take on the subject:

  Life for the common man in After Sundown is actually pretty horrible, and extremely dangerous. Life in After Sundown is life in a horror movie. Or rather, it is a world not unlike Earth would be if all the horror movies were real in different places and at different times. This means that body counts are extremely high, and it is very difficult to get help. This is good news if you happen to be the Bogie Man, but really bad for anyone looking for a life of vaguely normal properties. Here are some important things to remember:

  *The Police are no help at all.* Heavily infiltrated by cultists and secret societies, the police in After Sundown are astoundingly ineffective. Sure they will /occasionally/ bring down a killer, but the vast majority of crimes go unsolved. Many crimes don't even get investigated, especially if something supernatural is afoot.\\
  *Telecommunications are Shoddy.* Sat Phones aren't generally available in the realm of horror. Cellphone coverage cuts out constantly at inopportune moments. Most people still have landlines, but regular telecommunication wires go down frequently and are out for days at a time. The inability to get a call out of a building or town isn't unusual, that kind of thing happens a lot in After Sundown.\\
  *People Don't Travel Much.* It's not /weird/ for people to not know what goes on in the next town over in After Sundown. Things are just more dangerous, and people keep to themselves more.

  Keep this in mind when you're planning your nights in the realm of horror. Life is less connected to other life in the realm of horror and it is /much/ easier for dangerous elements to thrive in such an environment.

  That being said, it is important to remember that most horror movies begin with people thinking things are pretty normal, and /end/ with something of a return to normalcy as well (or do they?) So it's not like Jason is running around the streets murdering people left and right. Indeed, while the death rate from serial and mass murder is large enough in the realm of horror to compete with traffic accidents or opiate abuse, the fact is that you're still more likely to die from cancer. Supernatural creatures remain hidden and the president of the United States is openly a mundane human. A vampire can't just flash their fangs to get free entry to a movie theater, and indeed they could be in a lot of trouble if they flash their fangs in a public space of any kind.

Given assumptions like these, it's a lot less sensible to go to the authorities. You might start by considering how effective the police are at tracking down murderers in general, and make a rational decision about how helpful they are likely to be based on that... and you should then revise your calculations based on the fact that vampires have managed to remain hidden from society at large until now, and consider the possibility that any official request to the authorities might bring you unwanted attention from whoever's managed to pull off that particular feat. Given that there actually are vampires in your story, this probably results in pretty decent odds that you shouldn't actually bother involving the authorities... or if you do, that you shouldn't actually rely on those authorities actually being helpful, and that you should have plans for your plea for help attracting attention from the vampires.
