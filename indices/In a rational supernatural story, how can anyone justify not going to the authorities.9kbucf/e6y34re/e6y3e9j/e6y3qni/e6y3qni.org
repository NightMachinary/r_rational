That's exactly the reason why I've been thinking about this. In a lot of ways, the very same tropes that make this sort of story a tough sell for rational fiction are what make it interesting in softer settings- teenagers/random weirdos/scooby and his friends are practically the worst possible choice for handling the problem, and thus it's inherently much more interesting to watch them overcome the odds than it would be for an army of trained, well-equipped grunts to systematically raid vampire lairs or what have you.

While this isn't the story that I personally want to write, it occurs to me that mental illness or paranoia on the part of the protagonist would be another handy explanation- if your plot hook requires the protagonist to act irrationally, bake that into their character instead of into the world.
