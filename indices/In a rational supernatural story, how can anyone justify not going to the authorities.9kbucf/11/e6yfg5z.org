There's a pretty simple solution that I'm not seeing mentioned: the protagonist /does/ go to the authorities, but then the supernatural thing isn't around to be destroyed.

It doesn't have to be anything grandiose or complex: the cops don't have to be “comically incompetent” or “already corrupted by the supernatural.” There's no need for some grand conspiracy plot point.

Your rational character calls the cops. Maybe they don't say “there's a ghost in my garage,” because they want to be taken seriously, so they say there's an intruder or something. Or maybe they do just say, “there's a ghost in my garage.” Either way the cops arrive, openminded and willing to help out, but the ghost doesn't put in an appearance. So the cops leave. They can even encourage the protagonist to call them again if the protagonist hears anything else. They do want to help their citizens, after all.

Anyway, then your protagonist is afraid of the same thing happening twice, so they don't call back. Or maybe they just move into contingency operations on their own while they wait for the thing to come back, and when it does, they're prepared enough to start handling it on their own. Point is, after that first contact, the ball is in the author's court; the reader is no longer screaming “JUST CALL THE COPS” at the page, because they know that the character knows that's an option, and that it's not a cure-all solution.
