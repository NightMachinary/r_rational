Theres pretty good precedent in our own world that mysterious thing plus bureaucracies [[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html][goes nowhere quick]].

There isn't any common knowledge of paranormal problems- and most people already have it in their head that x doesn't exist. Usually, explaining the problem clearly would not even help you be taken any more seriously:

"Help! I am being chased across linear time by two distinct groups of immortals. One of which is a problem. They can teleport themselves around the world by using camera terminology. Which they abuse to kidnap extremely-special-kids and with the help of a very-evil-painting, crack open the kid's soul-egg to continue their immortality. The other group is at war with them but doesn't kill kids and can't do the camera thing but anyway they can't protect me from the first group and that is why I've come here to talk to you officer."
