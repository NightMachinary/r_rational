It's definitely an option, but there's a good reason for the "random teenager suddenly finds themselves in a supernatural world" - it's fundamentally far more appealing and identifiable, so I can see why OP wants to make it work.

The protagonist could /join/ the authorities after trying to contact them, but "random teenager joins a supernatural police agency" is still a very different story to "random teenager finds the supernatural world and is largely on his own in navigating it".
