"Government deals with vampires" however is potentially an interesting story too, and a less told one. "Gang of teenagers deals with vampires" can be easily achieved by leveraging a few possibilities:

- the age old isolation scenario, the teenagers went to party in some cabin in the woods in the middle of fuck all and now vampires are their problem and no one else's

- the teenagers are too confident, or did something they don't want to be found out so they're hoping to just hide everything and let no one else know ("What, do /you/ want to tell mom that we went to profanate graves in the cemetery for funsies and now a zombie wants to eat our brain?")

- a lot of the various other possibilities mentioned, like they have special powers, they don't want to be taken for crazy, etc.
