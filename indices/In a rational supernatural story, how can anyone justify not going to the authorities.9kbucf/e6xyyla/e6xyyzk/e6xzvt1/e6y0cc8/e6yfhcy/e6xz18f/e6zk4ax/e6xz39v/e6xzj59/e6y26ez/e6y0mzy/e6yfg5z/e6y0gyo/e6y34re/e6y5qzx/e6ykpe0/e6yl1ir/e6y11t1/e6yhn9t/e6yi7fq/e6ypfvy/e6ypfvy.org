Everyone is missing the obvious: The protagonist cannot go to the authorities because they /are/ the authorities.

Just make your main character the highly-trained, highly-put-upon, and moderately shellshocked civil servants who have the job of dealing with all the call-ins about the supernatural.

Task one: "Is this a genuine incident" Task two: "Deal".

And sure, calling for help from the higher ups is an /option/, but you know how much paperwork you have to file if you pull your gun? Now imagine the bureaucratic nightmare that follows after you call in an air-strike on a vampire nest or invoke the ancient treaties and compacts to have one of the Djinn eat a demon. Doing that sort of thing lightly looks really bad on your year end review.
