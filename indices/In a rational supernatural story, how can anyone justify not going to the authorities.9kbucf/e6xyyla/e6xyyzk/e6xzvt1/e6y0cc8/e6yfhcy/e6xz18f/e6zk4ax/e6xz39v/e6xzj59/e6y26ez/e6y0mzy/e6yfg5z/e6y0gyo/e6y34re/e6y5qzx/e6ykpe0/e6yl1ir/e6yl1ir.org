I think it can be reasonably justified.

In Buffy specifically, there's a couple decent reasons.

- One, they're teenagers, with all that that implies.

Most people don't think all that clearly at that age. Yes, even to that level of blindness.

I think this only applies to short-term or non-rational fiction, though. Anyone will eventually think of doing this, and the rational community doesn't much like incompetent characters, even if they have good reasons for it.

- Secondly, the proper authorities /have/ been contacted, as far as they can tell - those being the Watchers.

If you're keen to trust authority, then you'd probably expect them to contact or already be working with the government. If you have the time and inclination to ask, then there's quite a few potential excuses/reasons for them /not/ to be working with the government already.

That's just passing the ball a bit, though, but it's much easier to come up with good reasons for a bureaucratic, traditional secret society not to work with the government. Hell - you can have it be a plot point where the protagonist initially trusts the reasons given by the Watchers, but eventually rebels and tries to make things happen on his own.

- Thirdly, there's the issue of proving any of the claims.

The easiest way I can think of doing this in Buffy is to capture a vampire or two, keep them trapped away from sunlight, and then use them dying to sunlight as proof that at least something fucky is going on. But going from there to proving that the Master is going to be freed and kill everyone, or that the city is located on a Hellmouth, or that Glory is a goddess hellbent on destroying the world or whatever seems much more difficult.

Hell, say your first instinct in Buffy is to do what I said. Get a policeman and convince them to come with you to see proof of the supernatural. Say he's on the level and tries to rally the precinct. He's dead the next day (at best), because Sunnydale is corrupt. Where do you go from there, as a random teenager, even a smart one? How the hell do you convince anyone on the state or federal level of /anything/? In the 90's, especially? A letter is going to make you sound crazy at best.

- Lastly, there's the fact that you have no idea if the government is uncorrupted.

In Buffy, the mayor of Sunnydale is hundreds of years old and specifically planned and built the city as a playground for him and his. While it seems pretty unlikely that the entire country is in a similar state, it's pretty /likely/ that there are at least pockets of bad actors in the government in general.

None of this implies an unrealistic level of incompetence in the government, IMO. Look at how easily politics is already swayed with money alone. Now add to that bribing with immortality, arcane power, straight up mind control and placing your own people in power.

So yeah, it might not be an correct decision with ironclad logic behind it, but I think it's quite reasonable, and similar reasons could be built into most stories. You could definitely make going to the authorities a good idea objectively, but a bad idea given the information available to the protagonist.

Incidentally, I don't know of any rational-adjacent Buffy stories, I'd definitely appreciate some recommendations.
