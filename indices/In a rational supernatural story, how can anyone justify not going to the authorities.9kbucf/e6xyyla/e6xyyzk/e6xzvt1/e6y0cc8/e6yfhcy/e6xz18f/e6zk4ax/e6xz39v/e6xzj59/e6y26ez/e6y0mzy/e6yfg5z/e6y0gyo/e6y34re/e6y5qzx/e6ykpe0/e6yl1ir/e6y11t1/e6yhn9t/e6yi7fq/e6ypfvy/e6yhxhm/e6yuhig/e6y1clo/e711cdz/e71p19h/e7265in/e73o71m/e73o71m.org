If I suddenly found out there was a supernatural world hidden out there, I'd figure there were some very powerful people out there keeping it that way.

What's more likely:

A) A bunch of vampires, wizards, etc have suddenly appeared

B) They've always existed, but have gone unnoticed for millennia, and stayed hidden in modern times where everyone has a camera on them at all times.

C) that people who go to the government or spread videos of supernatural creatures are dealt with somehow.

I'm going to be heavily considering "C".
