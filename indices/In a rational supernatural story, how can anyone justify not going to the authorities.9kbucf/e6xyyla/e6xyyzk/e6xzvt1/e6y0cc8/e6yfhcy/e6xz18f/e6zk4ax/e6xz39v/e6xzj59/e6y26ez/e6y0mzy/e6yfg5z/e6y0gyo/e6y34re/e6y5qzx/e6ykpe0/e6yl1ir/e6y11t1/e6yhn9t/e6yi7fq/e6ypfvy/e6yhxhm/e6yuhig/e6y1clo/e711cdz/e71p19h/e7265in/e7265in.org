Depending on the kind of threat, they might have a reasonable fear of being considered crazy and possibly forcibly committed. Consider that usually people who see monsters or ghosts and think they're on a mission to defeat them are schizophrenic, and it'd be easy to be also considered a potential violent individual if you're going on about "killing the demons".

Another very reasonable possibility: the threat is beyond any regular human's reach, while the protagonist has special powers/knowledge to face it. In that case, involving anyone else might as well cause their death, and there's a case for not wanting to do that. Maybe not 100% rational if the stakes are high enough and external help could tip the scales, but it's normal to feel responsible.

Other possibilities: they don't want to share whatever loot/power they can get from the defeated creatures. They don't trust the authorities to not be corrupt. They don't trust the authorities to not have some kind of mole inside their ranks. The threat is specifically preventing them from disclosing information to /anyone/ (for example, can read minds and they're the only ones who are immune). They're criminals themselves and don't want to be arrested when all is said and done.
