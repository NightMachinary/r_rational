That would be one way to do it, but there are some issues.

1. You need to be in a position to call the police and continue to survive in place until they arrive. You can't be in active combat and you can't be on the run. You'd have to be holed up inside a locked room or such.
2. You need the werewolf to stick around for at least five to ten minutes.
3. You need to werewolf to remain even after hearing sirens, even though he's most likely trying to keep his existence secret.
4. You need the werewolf not to kill the police when they arrive.

If you can pull all that off then you, as a rational person, should probably do it. But it's tricky.
