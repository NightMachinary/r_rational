Yep, I agree entirely. I've writted snippets of a half dozen portal fantasies where the main characters don't tell the govrnment about the interdimensional portal they've found because they'll make more money if they already own the deed to the land the portal is on and have trade contacts in another dimension by the time the portal is revealed to the public.
