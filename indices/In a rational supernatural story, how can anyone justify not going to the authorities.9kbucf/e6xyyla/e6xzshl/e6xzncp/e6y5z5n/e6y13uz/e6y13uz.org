Unless there's an entire secret government underneath the real government, there's always a bigger authority... in the US, most state police and the FBI are specifically tasked with dealing with corruption in local jurisdictions. They've got whole departmental branches devoted to such things.

As soon as somebody runs complaints up the chain of command, things have a chance of getting ugly, and the more there is to cover up the sooner those authorities catch wind.
