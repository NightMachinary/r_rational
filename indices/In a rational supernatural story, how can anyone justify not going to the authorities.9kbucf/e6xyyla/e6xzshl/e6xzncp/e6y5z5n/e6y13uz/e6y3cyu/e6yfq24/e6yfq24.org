  Unless there's an entire secret government underneath the real government, there's always a bigger authority...

Higher authority infiltrated by higher supernaturals. In one of the urban fantasy I've read all governments are essentialy run by higher demons, and big cities by middle tier demons. But on the street level protagonist only conflicts with low level sorcerers and like. When apocalypse happen no one payed much attention because for common people nothing changed.
