Pact is pretty good about this. The [[http://pact-web-serial.wikia.com/wiki/Behaim_Circle][Behaims]] make up many of the local small town police officers in Jacob's Bell, where the story is set. They're not necessarily doing evil things with their magic either - they just (rationally) dislike the Thorburn family.
