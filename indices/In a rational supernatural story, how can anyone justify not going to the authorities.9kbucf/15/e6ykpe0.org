You could also avoid this by making the enemy incredibly powerful. So incredibly powerful, in fact, that the only reason it is currently operating in anyway the protagonists (or even humanity at large) have any chance of stopping, is because of convenience, instead of necessity.

Take Animorphs for example. In Animorphs, the only reason the evil alien brain slug Yeerks aren't razing Earth to the ground with their advanced alien weaponry and alien host-body army, is because they want preserve human bodies (to use as hosts later). The kids don't go to the authorities for a long time, because if they try to, and word accidentally gets to a Yeerk spy in the chain of command (of which they know the Yeerks have plenty), then the Yeerks will stop their slow-scale, secretive invasion of small town America (which the kids can feasibly slow down/sabotage while they try to think of a way to stop the aliens all together), and instead switch to the alien holocaust humanity has no chance of winning. A semi-major plot point is trying to find a way to alert the military to the infestation, without alerting any Yeerk spies, and that plot point could easily be copy-pasted into a more rational story.

Another way is to make the enemy grow stronger, depending on how many people are interacting with it. If you are familiar with the SCP Foundation, write a story where the protagonists are doing battle with some kind of antimemetic demon or something like that, or even just something like Slenderman that can only attack/affect people that have done some particular thing, and grows stronger the more people it can affect. They aren't trying to save the world; they're just trying to save themselves, and they know that bringing more people into the fold will only make their enemy stronger, and potentially doom the world. They can't alert the police, but perhaps they can risk bringing in the sheriff, if the increase in the enemy's strength per 'in-the-know person' is linear rather than exponential. But bringing in the whole chain of command, or the army? That would turn the enemy into a god, and so simply isn't an option.
