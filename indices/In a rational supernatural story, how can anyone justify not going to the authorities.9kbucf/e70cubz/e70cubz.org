This depends a lot on the other stuff you have going on, but

Make it personal (to the characters).

A 'normal' person:

The protagonist discovers they have powers, or their best friend gets possessed. They don't want them self/their friend to be taken away.

criminals:

An industrial saboteur accidentally sets the zombie virus loose on the world*, a jewel thief's steals a large, famous diamond with a long and bloody history only to discover that it's cursed, or when a new gang comes to town, the established factions discover things no one would believe. People who might be reluctant to call the cops because if they can take care of it on their own, they don't have to worry about going to jail.

*Or take the blame for global catastrophe.
