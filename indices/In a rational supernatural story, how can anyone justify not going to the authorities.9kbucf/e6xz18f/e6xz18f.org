The most common reason I see is that the authorities wouldn't believe them. If I called the police right now and told them a werewolf was trying to eat me they'd think it was a prank call and ignore me, or think I'm on drugs and arrest me.

A rational person might try to obtain irrefutable evidence to convince the police with, but in today's day of Photoshop and CGI that would be pretty tough to do. You'd need a lot of really convincing material and even then there's a good chance they would just blow you off. Making it worse, many supernatural beings are difficult to videotape (e.g. invisible ghosts, vampires not appearing on film).

If I were being haunted I'd be far more likely to approach a friend, medium, or ghost hunter for help than the police.
