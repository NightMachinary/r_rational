There's usually an assumption in these types of stories that the monsters have been successfully making an effort to remain concealed. They disguise their attacks as bear maulings or suicide, or they make the victim disappear without a trace.

It reminds me of Tokyo Ghoul, where the ghouls (who must eat human flesh to survive) do it by taking bodies from Suicide Forest where people go to hang themselves every day.
