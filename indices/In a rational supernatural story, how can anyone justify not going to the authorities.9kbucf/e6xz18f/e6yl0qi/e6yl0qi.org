You have to ask though, why are the cops so sceptical.

In the real world the answer is simple, werewolves do not exist. But in a world where werewolves exist why aren't the public more willing to entertain the possibility.

Is there only ten or so werewolves in the USA and you're just unlucky enough to be in one's way? Sure, then the cops are going to be pretty sceptical. Is there 20 in your town alone and they have a rivalry with the vampires. Then it gets harder to explain why nobody believes in the supernatural.
