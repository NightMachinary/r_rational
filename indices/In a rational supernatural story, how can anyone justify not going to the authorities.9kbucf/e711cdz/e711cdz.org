i have an idea for a rational time travel story that runs into this... and they cant go to the authorities because they have a time machine, and the bad guys are in the past. i lost the first draft (only a couple thousand words) when a hard drive died. i really should get around to that idea again at some point.

some stories have their own rational logic of why some solutions cant work. others just need to have a worse problem in order to stay rational.
