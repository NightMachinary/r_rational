AoE curse affecting everyone on the planet. Possible variants:

Mentality of "Nobody will believe me." As a result, even if person B believes your story, they don't want to look like a fool for trying to tell another person. Even if you tell them they shouldn't think like that, most people would still rather do nothing. Someone would have to actually die to get the conviction required of most people, thus the paranormal do not want to escalate that far.

After witnessing paranormal stuff, you lose very specific subsections of your vocabulary. Thief, stolen, murder etc. are included in this list, making you unable to describe even an adjacent crime.

The curse is actually several thousand curses. Many have found loopholes, then some mysterious faction has patched them. This has been going on since medieval times.
