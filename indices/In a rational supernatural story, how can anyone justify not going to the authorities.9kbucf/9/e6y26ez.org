I always imagine the first act of National Treasure.

"Someone's going to steal the Declaration of Independence because there's a map on the back, I could show you right now." [laughter] "no."

Not setting up NT as a pillar of rationality, but it was pretty accurate. At best you get the FBI tagging your cell phone calls.

Outside of elaborate effort made to trick law enforcement into experiencing it first hand, your protagonist just ends up at the bottom of a very long list of to-dos.

You can easily have the main character(s) try this, get laughed out of the room, and move on. This can set up later for a "there are parts of the government that DO know" sequence later, or maybe even get a few people's attention and bring them into the story as well.
