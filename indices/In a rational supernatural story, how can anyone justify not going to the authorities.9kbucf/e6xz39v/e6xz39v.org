i think wildbow has handled this pretty well; first in Pact he made a world where people not "in the know" just couldn't see/interact witht the supernatural elements so instead of seeing malicious spirts draining them of life they wrote it off as side effect from the local chemical treatment plant causing increased cancer etc; also in twig the protagonist and his friends /were/ the authorities response to the supernatural stuff and were genetically engineered for that
