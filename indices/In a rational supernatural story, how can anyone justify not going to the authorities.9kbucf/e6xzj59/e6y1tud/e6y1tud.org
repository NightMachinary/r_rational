I think there's actually a really interesting story in mixing supernatural/urban horror themes with a well-thought out memetic system. There would need to be /some/ kind of consistent angle for stuff behind the veil to still get at the real world, but I really like the idea of a group or agency balancing the need to study and understand foes they didn't have the capacity to blindly overpower with the fact that studying them was like opening a window and waving a bright flare through it.
