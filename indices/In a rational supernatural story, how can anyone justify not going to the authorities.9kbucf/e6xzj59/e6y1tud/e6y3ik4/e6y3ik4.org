Yeah, exactly. Full blown protection of the innocents might be too much... Maybe there's degree's of innocence? A fully "rational" engineer type who doesn't believe in anything supernatural might be fully "innocent", while somebody who enjoys reading urban fantasy is a little less protected, and so on, until you have the people with full knowledge of the masquerade who are not just unprotected, but are waving that metaphorical flare.
