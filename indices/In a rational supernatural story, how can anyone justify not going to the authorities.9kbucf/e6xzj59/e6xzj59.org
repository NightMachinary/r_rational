Hmmm, maybe there's a memetic angle. If the monsters can only hurt/attack people who are aware of them already, then going and informing the authorities will simply give the monsters a wider pool of victims. Maybe there's some kind of supernatural protection of the innocent and the monsters, due to their nature, can't spread knowledge of themselves to innocents. Only other humans can spread that knowledge. And so, if the protagonist knows this, and is at all self-sacrificing, they won't tell anyone who doesn't already know. I think you could take this a lot of different directions. Maybe there is a governmental agency that knows all about these monsters and how to deal with them, but nobody knows about them because they if they advertise their existence, they're dooming everyone.

I admit, it's still somewhat soft, but it at least explains why people wouldn't seek help and why this hidden side of the world isn't widespread knowledge already.
