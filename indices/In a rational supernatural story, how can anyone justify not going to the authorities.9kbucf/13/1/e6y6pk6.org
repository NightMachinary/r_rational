"Hey, look, just say I believe you have a Bigfoot in your house. First we cordon off your neighborhood. Second, we evacuate your neighbors, and third, we send a whole shit-load of cops in there to deal with the thing. I mean, fully armed and ready, Mr. Henderson. So unless you wanna be responsible for wrongfully turning your neighborhood into a war zone I suggest you drop this whole thing right now." - Harry and the Hendersons
