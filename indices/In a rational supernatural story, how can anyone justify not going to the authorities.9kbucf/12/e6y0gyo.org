I think this one is easy.

Reasons for not going to the cops:

1. Protagonist is an illegal alien.

2. Protagonist is of a minority which (rightly or wrongly) fears police brutality

3. At the end of the day, supernatural threat is completely invisible and leaves no trace... though actually that's usually not rational.

4. The authorities are corrupted by the threat. Let's face it, any threat that needs to be secret yet would pose a danger to the world at large would need to corrupt the social institutions of human civilizations. The Deep State is run by Cthulhu.... how else would a Deep State function anyway?
