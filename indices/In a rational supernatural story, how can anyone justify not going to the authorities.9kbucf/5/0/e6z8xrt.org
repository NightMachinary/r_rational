Convincing material could entail just showing them directly, though, right? Which you'd do by summoning them to deal with a related, but much more plausible threat (so they respond with appropriate briskness and preparedness). So if a werewolf is attacking you, say you're being attacked by large, rabid dogs (or a bear, etc. depending on where you are). If the werewolf retains human intelligence, describe them as a large, angry human.
