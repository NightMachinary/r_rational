I admit to not knowing where this is going and being intrigued.

I do think that much of the first half of this chapter suffers a bit from telling, rather than showing. Much of it is summaries of activities and feelings, rather than showing us specific actions and examples that allow the big picture to draw itself. I found myself starting to skim quite a bit, looking for a bit of dialogue or action to ground me and find the thread of the story.

I am still interested in where it's going, so do keep at it :)
