For as much as was made of the trauma from the duel in the previous chapter, it seems to have, well, vanished overnight. Other than a brief mention of the Goblet and Hermione's protectiveness of Fleur, she no longer seems to be troubled by it, and doesn't even bother to mention it when asked about her impressions of Hogwarts. Was she only traumatized out of fear for Fleur? If so, that's not the impression I got in the previous chapter.

Other than that, it was a very nice chapter!
