A full discussion of nuances, political costs, and consequences will be in the next chapter (it /is/ a cliffhanger, after all 8-)) But consider: A big problem for any vaguely competent group considering restarting the Lost Years was 'how do we hide what we're doing from Doc's damned Database'. They found a partial way--but not necessarily one that worked well with adequate oversight or timely communication. And a key link died just before the start of Fall (There is a discussion of Jumping Spider complaining about that a little later in Chapter 20).
