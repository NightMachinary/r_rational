(Fresh post so you get the alert.)

You know, you would think they could settle this by sending a message to the President, or the head of the CIA or something, saying "If this is you, cut it out or Flicker takes you apart. If it's not you, give us everything you have and put all your efforts into shutting it down or we'll assume it's you." Sure, they could interpret this as "she's a terrorist" but it's not like they could do anything to her.
