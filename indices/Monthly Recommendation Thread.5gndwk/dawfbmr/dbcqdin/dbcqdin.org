This book is great. The world is amazingly complex, the conflict is convincing from both sides, no one being 'evil just to be evil'.

Generally I'm very impressed by Dickingson's fiction; you can check out his short novel [[http://www.tor.com/2015/09/16/please-undo-this-hurt-seth-dickinson/][Please Undo This Hurt]] for free.
