I recently finished /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant][The Traitor Baru Cormorant]]/ and it struck me as a highly rational novel.

*Summary*: As a child, Baru's sleepy village is economically, and later, politically annexed by the Masquarade, a vast empire. She finds the Empire's knowledge fascinating, but the more she learns, the more her people's ways are subjugated by the Empire's dictates. By the time she reaches adulthood, she's aware the Empire is too vast and powerful to challenge outright, and so she resolves to join its bureaucracy and remake it from within.

There were a number of good quotes from it I highlighted in my kindle copy. My favorite:

#+begin_quote
  /“The sword kills,” Baru recited, trying to remember the Handbook of Manumission, its arguments for revolutionary zeal. “But the arm moves the sword. Is the arm to blame for murder? No. The mind moves the arm. Is the mind to blame? No. The mind has sworn an oath to duty, and that duty moves the mind, as written by the Throne. So it is that a servant of the Throne is blameless.”/
