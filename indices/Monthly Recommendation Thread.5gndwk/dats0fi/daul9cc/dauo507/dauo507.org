If you played /Ladykiller/ and liked the plot, try some of the other games by the same developer. I liked /Digital: A Love Story/ and /Analogue: A Hate Story/. But if you liked the "plot" then there are precious few of that kind that work on Linux.

The only other one I know is /Katawa Shoujo/, which was developed by 4chan users to satisfy the unmet demand for those games in the western market. It was made as a collaboration among many different artists, developers and especially writers (who often worked on different "routes") so it can be a little inconsistent at times, but that same inconsistency raises the variance and makes it so that it's very likely you will really like at least one of the routes.
