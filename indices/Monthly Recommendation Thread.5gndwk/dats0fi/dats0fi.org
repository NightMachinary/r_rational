Keeping with my theme of only playing videogames that run on Linux because I'm too lazy to dual-boot, I've recently been playing [[http://ladykillerinabind.com/][Ladykiller in a Bind]]

It's an erotic visual novel with an interesting game mechanic (you can download a [[http://scoutshonour.com/files/Ladykiller%20in%20a%20Bind%20teaser.zip][demo here]] to see how it plays like): If you don't like the dialogue options, you can choose to be quiet and hope that you(r player character) can think of something better to say. But if you wait too long you might cause an awkward silence or you might lose an opportunity. In this way it mirrors the tension of a real conversation.

That tension is important because the complexity of the social manipulation and plotting in the game is somewhere between Death Note and HPMOR's Three Armies arc. It's not as educational as /A Girl Corrupted by the Internet is the Summoned Hero/, but it does occasionally make some insightful commentary on the social dynamics and the writing is overall funny in a clever way.
