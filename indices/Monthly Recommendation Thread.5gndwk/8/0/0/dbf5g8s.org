There's definitely a bit of a lack of agency in some of the protagonists, but some of them are much better than others in that regard.

One thing to note is it isn't /really/ a series - it's a set of novels in a shared world with some overlapping characters and backstory. You can read them in almost any order and not really suffer from it (though you will miss some references).

"The Spriggan Mirror" and "Ithanalin's Restoration" might be particularly appealing to a rationalist audience. there's essentially a small subseries that goes:

1. With A Single Spell
2. The Spell of the Black Dagger
3. Ithanalin's Restoration
4. The Spriggan Mirror

Unfortunately I don't remember the first two very well (I read them years ago) so I can't say whether I'd recommend them in that context or not. I think they're reasonably intelligent books, but "With A Single Spell" IIRC involves the protagonist bouncing around from problem to problem a bit. The latter two probably make sense on their own but reference the first two reasonably heavily.
