  I've been continually surprised to find great stories over the years on Literotica
#+end_quote

I too will admit to reading literary erotica for the sake of sharing quality reading material.

First I highly recommend any of the [[http://storiesonline.net/a/Al_Steiner][long stories by Al Steiner]] over at stories online.net. He does dwell on some Marx inspired political opinions a bit too much. He's kind of an inverse Ayn Rand in that sense, but unlike her his erotic words are excellent. [[http://storiesonline.net/s/43998/a-perfect-world][A Perfect World]] starts off his series based around a Martian independence movement and features *some of the most realistic near-current-tech space combat I've ever read*.

I also highly recommend [[http://www.nickscipio.com/main.html][Nick Scipio's Summer Camp series]], though updates to the final book have been slow of late. It's a *coming of age story* about Paul who grows up spending summers *at a nudist camp* with his parents. Don't get turned off too quickly by the incest tag--none of it gets all the way around the bases and it's over pretty early in the series.
