I've recently discovered there are a whole bunch of Legends of Ethshar books by Lawrence Watt-Evans available for Kindle that I haven't previously read, so I've been binging on those.

I think they'd appeal to this reddit. I wouldn't call it rational per se, but they generally have fairly intelligent characters who are more inclined to solve problems by thinking through them and judiciously using the tools at hand than by brute force or hero logic. The world building is interesting too. It has, um, I think seven different magic systems in world, which works surprisingly well.
