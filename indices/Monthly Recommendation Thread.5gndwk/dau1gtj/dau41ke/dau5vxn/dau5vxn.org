Yeah, that's a pretty big bummer. In my opinion it and the Alexandra Quick series are maybe the best works to come out of the HP fandom, even surpassing the HP books in some ways. Besides having better worldbuilding, they manage to explore some meaningful themes while retaining a lot of that weird, whimsical quirkiness that first made HP popular. I'll never forgive rowling for the shift in tone after book 5, or for making the climax of the series into a hackneyed christ metaphor...
