[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2731239/1/Team-8][Team 8]] by S'TarKan - What if Naruto had been selected for a different team? What if he'd had a different mentor? Who would guess the consequences would be so large?

*Very good:*

Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4641394/1/The-Substitute][The Substitute]] by BajaB - The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11626470/1/Crime-and-Commitment][Crime and Commitment]] By serpentguy - Taylor had always had doubts about what she was doing, even after she had changed her mind on being a superhero. What might have happened if she had focused on all the good she could do if she approached law and order from the other direction? What might have happened if she had given being a supervillain her full commitment?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]] by Annerb - Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why. In-progress.

*Worthwhile reads:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3745099/1/People-Lie][People Lie]] by Nugar - Lies have power. They can change a simple-minded believer into a two-faced schemer and a timid follower into a fanatical devotee. They can change a child angry at the world into a man consumed by more than vengeance. But that power is a lie as well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11047152/1/Slaughterhouse-Nine-Power-Taylor-One-Shots][Slaughterhouse Nine Power Taylor]]: One-ShotsBy: Thinker6 - Short stories in which Taylor Hebert gets powers from the Slaughterhouse Nine.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8550403/1/THW][The Howling Wind]] by JMenace reviews - (Being rewritten) Naruto's chakra is warped at birth. Instead of strengthening his body and mind, it shrieks and wails like wind through his coils.

(Lovecraftian AU)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Forests-of-Valbon%C3%AB][Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë]] by enembee - Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them]] by evansentranced - After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

*Junkfood-tier fics:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2829366/1/Dimension-Hopping-for-Beginners][Dimension Hopping for Beginners]] by nonjon - COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9912044/][Hope Through Overwhelming Firepower]] By: Border42 - The smallest act or difference can be all that is needed to change the future. Now Diebuster!Taylor stands to make more than small or simple changes for the future of mankind.

Some notable fics from my spacebattles and sufficient velocities watched list, descriptions taken from [[/r/wormfanfic]] :

*Excellent:*

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/mixed-feelings-worm-oc.375923/][Mixed Feelings]] (Worm OC) by Kittius - OC with a traumatic past and rich internal voice and depth of personality runs into canon characters and completely misunderstands them and their world. Not too much action, but a great deal of character and interesting interactions.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.300816/][Dire Worm!]] by Lost Demiurge. A hammy, competent and interesting OC from a different setting shows up in Worm and turns everything upside-down with her particular blend of villainy-but-ultimately-for-the-greater-good greatness. Dire is one of my favorite OCs in all Wormfic.

*Very Good:*

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/playing-with-legos-worm-supcom.377328/unread][Playing with Lego's]] [Worm/SupCom] by Potato Nose - Taylor gets the Tinker(-like) power of the Seraphim faction from Supreme Commander.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/el-ahrairah-worm.372987/][El-Ahrairah]] (Thinker!Taylor) - Thinker Taylor with the ability to see powers joins Cauldron.

*Worthwhile:*

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/mass-effect-sid-meiers-alpha-centauri.221597/][Mass Effect/Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri]] by LordsFire - Weird, humorous crossover with no real plot. Really well written

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/co-op-mode-worm-the-gamer-si.354578/][Co-op Mode]] by Faria_Lyton. An OC joins forces with Taylor (who has her own parallel story, A Bug in the Game) with his absurd Gamer-based powers. Thoroughly entertaining, and building up to good things, if a bit slowly.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/that-gnawing-worm-cancer-worm-au.29151/][That Gnawing Worm, Cancer]] [Worm AU] by Nugar - Taylor with relatively weak but non manton limited telekinesis. And terminal brain cancer. Surprisingly light tone. Petty and bitter Taylor makes for some fun moments. Heavy AU allowing for more focus on smaller scale stuff.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/aberration-worm-d-d.369992/unread][Aberration]] (Worm, D&D) by themanwhowas - A D&D OC gets shoved into Worm, joins the Merchants, and things escalate. A lot. Still ongoing, currently on a bit of a break while I sort things out with my life, but I'd be happy to get more eyes on the story as encouragement to keep writing.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/watched/threads/all][H+ Mayhem]] (Worm) by Jurric - Bio-tinker OC is Bonesaw's brother. Uses a combat software called Mayhem that he can cede control to which is absurdly capable. Spends most of his time trying to figure out what the other side of him is up to.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nightingale-worm-dnd-bard-taylor.381918/][Nightingale]] (Worm/DnD bard!Taylor) - In which Taylor takes up barding... wait what? That's not what barding means. DnD 5E Bard!Taylor

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-cloudy-path-worm-supreme-commander.3604][A Cloudy Path]] is one of the best (and longest) Worm fics out there. Taylor triggers as a tinker with Aeon tech from Supreme Commander. Don't need to know anything about Supcom for the fic.
