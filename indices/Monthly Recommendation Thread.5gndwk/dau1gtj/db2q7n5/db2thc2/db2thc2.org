Yeah, it gets much better. The jump in quality is pretty stark. The first book is pretty childish and Alexandra is too unlikable. The author himself even said that he made Alex too much of a flawed character in the beginning. All the sequels take this into account and improve on this and everything else.

I should have mentioned this in the comment above, my bad. It's why I put book 2 and not book 1 in the excellent part.
