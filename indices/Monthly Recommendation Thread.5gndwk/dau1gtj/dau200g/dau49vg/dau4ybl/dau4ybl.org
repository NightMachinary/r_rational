  The proper attitude, IMO, is to see the current iteration of your long lost love as a new person

Actually the author and Harry show awareness of this problem, and Harry does make some effort to avoid it, except he has PTSD and therefore isn't very good at handling relationships, plus his emotional development was rather stunted by a long war. And he /is/ trying to befriend Ginny at an earlier age, as he does for most of the people he knew. And he attempts to give Ginny her space and let things happen or not naturally, despite literally killing himself to come back in time and save her, because he knows he should respect her independence from the Ginny in the previous timeline. I find their friendship an interesting part of the story, but YMMV. Have you read all of it (that has been written)?
