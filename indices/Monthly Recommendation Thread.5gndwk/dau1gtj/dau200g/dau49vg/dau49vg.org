S'Tarkan is an excellent writer, but I don't tend to recommend NoFP. I can't stomach when in time travel stories the MC is an adult in a child/teenager's body and has romantic relationships with other children/teenagers. It's just plain... squicky(for lack of a better word). The proper attitude, IMO, is to see the current iteration of your long lost love as a new person, and move the fuck on. Be sure not to engage in 'grooming', as well.

Having said that, I understand why most people seem to overlook its immorality, as the circumstances that lead to it are purely fictional.

That actually reminds me of this really weird subplot in 'Door into Summer' by Heinlein, written in 1957 and set in 1970. In the novel the MC gets cryo frozen for 30 years, finds out he's going to marry the daughter of his best friend(whom he only knew as a pre-pubescent girl), goes back in time, picks her up from girls scouts(!), and tells her to go get cryo frozen when she turns 21 so they can meet again. She might or might not be an orphan at that time, lol.

There's also this really funny scene where he single-handedly invents robots and then teaches it the intricacies of all household chores in like an afternoon, no programming required. It always tickes me when reading classic SF how optimistic the authors were about technological progress.
