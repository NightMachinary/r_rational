/[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52038][The Invasion of America]]/ and /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8684][The Conquest of America]]/ are two very fun pieces of anti-pacifism/-isolationism propaganda. Each book was published in 1916 and depicts an invasion of the USA--by a vague "Great Coalition" in /Invasion/, and by Germany (which has just won the Great War) in /Conquest/. In order to back up its claims of how pathetically weak the US military was at the time, /Invasion/ includes 173 endnotes! /Conquest/, on the other hand, is much more casual and adventurous in tone, and enlists Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, Alberto Santos-Dumont, and other such illustrious people in order to save the US from European imperialism.

A brief summary of /Invasion/ and a detailed timeline of /Conquest/ (including links to the Wikipedia pages of most of the famous people featured in the story) are available [[http://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/403306][here]].
