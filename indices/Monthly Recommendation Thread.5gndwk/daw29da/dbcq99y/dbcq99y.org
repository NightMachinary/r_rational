Well, it's a power difference thing, right? There's only a couple characters that can tell the new gods to fuck off, maybe twice that that could chastise the first group (and it happens sometimes, it's not like Arachne is never opposed by anyone).

Actually in retrospect I'm not sure I see all the 'jerking around'? Other than what Arachne does to students :P
