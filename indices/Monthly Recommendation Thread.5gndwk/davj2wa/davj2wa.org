I'm not sure how the readers here will react to this recommendation, but it's one of my favorite stories and it's on a weird site to find quality literature, so here it is:

[[https://www.literotica.com/stories/memberpage.php?uid=2065995&page=submissions][Dream Drive]] by Over_Red, over on Literotica.

Yes, there is word porn. No, you don't need to read it to enjoy the story. It's a SciFi/Fantasy story focusing on Virtual Reality in a somewhat-dystopian future.

Jackson Vedalt is a gamer/tech nerd specializing in hardware modding who wins a chance to be one of the first few people in the world to play a new multiplayer VR Fantasy game called Isis. He quickly discovers that this 'VR' game is a bit... too real. So real, in fact, that he retains his abilities back in the 'real world'.

The characters are well-written, the plot moves fairly quickly, and what is written has a very satisfying two-part conclusion of epic proportions. Also, the word porn is great if you're into that.

I've been continually surprised to find great stories over the years on Literotica that would be a delight to read with no sex scenes, and this is the best one of the bunch in my opinion.
