Someone recommended The Gods Are Bastards here last month, and I've read through a pretty good chunk of it (I'm caught up to July of this year.). The farther I get through it, the more I'm reminded of my D&D campaign, somewhat weirdly.

The sheer amount of 'people who are more powerful than you just fucking with you for what seems like the fun of it' is pretty comparable, but the farther I get through The Gods Are Bastards the more it's being leaned on.

So the campaign had less of that sort of thing and by the end my players were justifiably disgruntled at the amount of being led around and shoved into situations they really weren't happy about, and when they got their hands on an artifact of fantastical power, one of them used it to sever the ties between the planes, cutting the Material Plane off from a huge swath of the multiverse, especially the gods.

In retrospect, it's a perfectly in-character rational response to being screwed with that much that often, and now that I've seen that I find myself continuously surprised that no one in The Gods Are Bastards ever really stands up to the people doing the jerking around to tell to fuck right off.
