I haven't read Team 8, but have read and quite enjoyed S'Tarkan's other major work, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past. Unfortunately both are unfinished due to the medical situation of the author - but he continues to give assurances that they're not abandoned :).

As mentioned in another thread, NoFP isn't strictly a rational work, but it has a lot of "adult re-examines canon childhood through a critical lens", which may appeal to this subreddit.
