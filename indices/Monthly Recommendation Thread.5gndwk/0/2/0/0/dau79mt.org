Yeah the "squiky" issues in NoFP are something that one has to take or leave with that sort of fic. (Actually I think it does open up interesting possibilities as to "who" the time traveler is in regards to identity (mind of old Harry vs mind of young Harry vs physical chemical-producing body of young Harry) but I haven't seen a fic explore that aspect very well.) To be honest, I enjoy Team 8 much more regardless of squick issues. At this point, NoFP seems to be a bland mixture of Time Traveller Harry tropes. This is a credit to its legacy since it essentially kick-started that whole genre for Harry Potter fanfiction, but that doesn't make it easier to read.

Actually since you recommend a couple of nonjon fics, I'd recommend the Where In The World Is Harry Potter series, which I think is just as good as A Black Comedy. Admittedly in regards to dramatic tension it's junk food, but that really isn't what it is about. I find it really funny and to be the best portrayal of, among others, Nicholas Flamel I've read.
