  Actually I think it does open up interesting possibilities as to "who" the time traveler is in regards to identity (mind of old Harry vs mind of young Harry vs physical chemical-producing body of young Harry) but I haven't seen a fic explore that aspect very well.

I've seen a couple that touched on it, including [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][one that did probably about as good a job as it could've]] in the short space it spent talking about this point: when Ginny time-traveled back to her first year (a nice twist having her be the one to return!), she was horrified she was feeling this way about a twelve-year-old, and tried to just be a good friend to Harry for the present - but then, after several months of not explicitly thinking about it so much, her now-eleven-year-old body sort of submerged her older mental state in that regard.
