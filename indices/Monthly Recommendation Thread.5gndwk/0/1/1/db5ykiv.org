(Replying more to [[/u/GlueBoy]], but this seems a thread for it).

Tried to read this story, almost done. Didn't enjoy it tbh. The Voldemort seems too OOC even before [[#s][spoiler]], too forgiving and not insane (like in canon) at all. The take on politics inside Britain (specifically [[#s][spoiler]] ) is interesting, while the international politics seems a bit cartoonish and bland.

I really liked the exploits of [[#s][spoiler]], since I like stories like 'The 7th Horcrux'. Also, WYRA seemed like a major topic at the beginning, I wish that storyline would be developed more.

However you can only stand the same pattern of [[#s][spoiler]] over and over and over a limited number of times. That's the worst flaw -- I stopped caring for Harry mid-way.

[[#s][Spoiler]] is a major topic of the fic, and while it augments the HP universe, adding a new dimension to the system of magic (Not unlike the Spirit World in Avatar: The Last Airbender; the ultimate plot device), I sometimes questioned if it in this story more because of author's beliefs. (Like Christianity in Ginny Weasley and the Sealed Intelligence.)

Oh, and also almost all of the relationships between Harry and peers are overshadowed by relationships between Harry and adults, so the all the student characters feel unimportant.
