I liked it in large part because of the OOC Voldemort, to be honest. Besides it being a nice change to have a voldemort that's not a cartoonishly evil psychopathic villain, I don't think it strains belief that this is how he would be if he had won the war. That is, a charismatic, ruthlessly pragmatic, and power hungry despot with a healthy appreciation for his image.

Regarding the pagan stuff, IIRC the author stated that her reasoning for adding the pagan stuff was to have a more believable motivation behind the first war (as part of a greater "saving our culture" kind of thing, anyway). Racism /is/ a pretty stupid reason to violently overthrow a government you already completely dominate anyway.

I won't defend PotDK too much, as I haven't read it in so long. It's very possible nostalgia colors my opinion of this fic. Having said that, I know for a fact that 8-9 years ago when I started reading it it was a cut above everything else, significantly so. Having nuanced characters(particularly villains), every "book" having an actual plot(the number 1 sin of fan fiction!), character progression and growth, foreshadowing, and so much more was (and still is) very, very rare in amateur fiction.
