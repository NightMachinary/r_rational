I think the reason why I hate Kettle so much is because he is the same character as Val, except instead of a cool backstory where he is trying to live up to the impossible standard of his father -- Kettle is just a moron.

Plus a bunch of awesome characters just got slaughtered a couple of chapters ago, and Im pissed that Kettle has been roping more people into his idiocy rather than facing consequences for his actions
