There was also a reminder that Ameliah is hot, but other than that, not much. A couple game-mechanical specifics:

1. Potions degrade on contact with air.
2. There exists a low-level monster called a "plague rat." They come in swarms and deal minor poison damage on a bite.
3. The Froststorm skill is similar to Rain's auras in mook-killing AOE power.
4. "Nature Magic" has lots of druidy AOE/area denial stuff.

Also, Rain seems to have just casually hugged Ameliah. No explanation for this apparent change in their relationship was given.
