The author has no idea what a moral hazard is. To quote the simplest of google searches, a "moral hazard is a situation in which one party gets involved in a risky event knowing that it is protected against the risk and the other party will incur the cost." It is /not/ a moral hazard whenever you are put in a bad situation and have to choose between to negative outcomes. The pilot did not choose to risk unnecessary danger knowing she would pay the price, he found himself in a situation where she was already doomed and he needed to save everyone else.

Aside from that, the author also exaggerated the contrivance of the situation by saying that the characters on the planet had failed to bring medication. A minor point, but it is explained twice or so in the text, and you'd think you'd remember something correctly from a text when you use it to further your argument.

It's politically awkward that the main character was prepared to kill a male stowaway but unable to kill a female one, but I'd hardly call that "almost unbelievable sexism".
