Ehh... Not really.

The problem with this story is that while it's rational in the confines of it's own axioms, the story breaks down outside them.

Why was there no security on the ship? A locked door and pre-flight check could have stopped her.

Why is there no spare fuel? If the weather patterns aren't predicted correctly, the winds could blow him off course in the landing and then he'd crash for want of fuel.

How come no-one has warned her of this, since there's such an obvious danger? It seems like the sort of thing that would come up during the lifeboat introduction on the first day of the voyage. ("Don't enter the lifeboat once maximum capacity has been reached. Additional weight will risk the life of all passengers.")
