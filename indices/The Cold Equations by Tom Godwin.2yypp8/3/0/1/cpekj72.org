Indeed. The moral hazard is not on the part of the pilot - rather on the absurd society that pushes such risky frontiers with /no safety margin at all/.

If it's that dangerous, why not move more slowly? I just get a sense that someone likes knowing people die to the cold equations - possibly the author. There's no background of conflict. No explanation or hinting that colonisation is urgent instead of a luxury. Just an excuse for murder, which - in just this one case! - turned out to be regrettable.

I get where the story is coming from; I even get annoyed at the good-guy-isn't-subject-to-physics plotlines myself. But fifty-nine years on, I can't enjoy this one as anything but a historical piece.
