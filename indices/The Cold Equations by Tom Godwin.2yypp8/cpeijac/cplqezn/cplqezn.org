I read a fun counter to this story in /Analog/ back in the 90's. It was called "The cold solutions" and has the stow-away be a kid instead of a teen, but has the same mass-constraint issues. The pilot is fuming about the situation and knows she'd (female pilot) give an arm and a leg to save the kid...then realizes the obvious solution.
