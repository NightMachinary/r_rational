When it comes to tugging on the heartstrings, this story is the best there is.

When it comes to meeting the requirements of common sense...not so much.

1. Why do EDS ships carry absolutely no safety margin of fuel?
2. Why don't EDS ships have a parachute for emergency landing? If you're on your way with critical medicines and you have a fuel leak, a parachute would be the difference between everyone surviving and everyone dying. Shoot, 20th century NASA was fuel-constrained and they managed to put people on the ground safely.
3. She's a girl "in her teens". She weighs...what? [[http://www.disabled-world.com/artman/publish/height-weight-teens.shtml][115, maybe?]] There isn't 115 pounds of stuff on that ship that can be jettisoned? The chair, their clothes, shave their heads, the door off the supply cabinet, the /contents/ of the supply cabinet (whatever they are), food, water, deck plating, the radio...come on, people, get creative!
4. Why is there a supply cabinet on a ship that's so mass-limited? If it's where the cargo is stored, why isn't it called "the cargo cabinet"? Why is it large enough and empty enough that a teenage girl can hide in it?
5. The sheer fact that she's been onboard all this time should have already used up enough fuel to screw them all. It's not like her mass didn't count until deceleration.
