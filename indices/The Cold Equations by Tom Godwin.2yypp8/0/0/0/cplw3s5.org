Yeah, I read a parody version at one point. There's a city parking service where they have a spacewarp that leads to Arizona (or some place), which is actually where they park the cars (more space). A guy stays in the car when the woman goes to park it, she discovers him, she says "Oh no, I'm going to have to push you out or we're all dead...but here, at least I can boink you first as a parting gift." They boink, and then he asks "hang on, do /I/ need to go, or just my mass?" They then proceed to rip out the seats and everything else and save themselves. The final thing that they need to throw out in order to make weight is a playing card.
