I think I've decided- in the light of day, now that i'm not sleepy- that while the universe is probably in most meaningful ways deterministic, that doesn't mean that free will doesn't exist. It only means that I am predictable in my decisions if one has enough information, and perfectly predictable with perfect information. Just because someone predicts I will choose to get chocolate over vanilla does not mean that I didn't make that choice, however.
