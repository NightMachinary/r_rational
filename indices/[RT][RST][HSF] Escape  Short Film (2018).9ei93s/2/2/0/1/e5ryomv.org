Oh I agree with that. In my opinion that rigid way of looking at free will as something that is only there if the conscious entity can make decisions completely unaffected by events outside their control often ends with the "free will" concept losing its meaning completely due to being a logical impossibility in a causal universe.

On an everyday level I consider something to have free will as long as no other entity with agency can accurately predict or control that thing's decisions.
