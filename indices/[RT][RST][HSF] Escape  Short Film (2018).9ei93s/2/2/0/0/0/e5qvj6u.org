people aren't usually talking about anything very concrete when that say free will , so the question is free will an illusion doesn't really return anything . Both of you can say that free will is and isn't an illusion and be right if you mean different concepts . I doubt conscious though doesn't do anything(well probably not on short time scales, but that doesn't mean much) anyway .
