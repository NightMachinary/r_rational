You're right, I can't not make the choice... because I haven't chosen it yet. Like, yes, you can predict my choices with perfect accuracy if you have perfect information, but that doesn't mean I, as a thinking agent, don't make choices. It just means I'm a predictable piece of reality.

If that were the case, then what would it mean to change a habit. Say I pick my nose a lot, and I want to change that habit. How did that conscious decision to stop translate into me stopping if all my justifications for all my movements are posthoc in an attempt to make sense of the world. What would be the point of consciousness at all if it wasn't useful for something?
