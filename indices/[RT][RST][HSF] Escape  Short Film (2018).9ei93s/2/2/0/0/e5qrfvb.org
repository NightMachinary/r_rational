  Like, if you could predict my choices, that wouldn't mean I'm not making them suddenly, just because you'd know what they were.

But you didn't choose to make those choices, the fact that you chose it was determined by every variable in your life that led up to that choice. Given all the information necessary to predict what you would choose to do in any given situation, you can't not make the predicted choice (unless you could alter a past variable or your internalized perception of a past variable...eh, even then, that would just be one more piece of information plugged into the prediction machine).

As for the illusion of being a free and thinking agent part, I'm not that well versed on this but I've seen a few neurological studies that assert that the parts of the brain responsible for moving a part of the body, or some other action, are activated before the parts of the brain associated with conscious thought and decision making. Given what I've read, it seems to me that free will is an illusion but, maybe I just haven't read enough on this topic.
