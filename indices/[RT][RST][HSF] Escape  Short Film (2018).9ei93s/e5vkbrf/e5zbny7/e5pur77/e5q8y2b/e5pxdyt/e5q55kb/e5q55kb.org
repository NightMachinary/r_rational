It may not be deterministic, but afaik any randomness is introduced on the quantum level, which is much smaller than neuron cells or hormonal proteins. So except if you stipulate some kind of higher "soul" or some such that interferes with base particles in order to facilitate some "will" and then see yourself as being said force instead of the neural system of your human body, it still has nothing to do with free will.
