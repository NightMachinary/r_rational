That's mostly true as far as we know, you're correct. I guess what I think, now that I'm awake and not about to fall asleep, is that while my actions may very well be predictable and deterministic, that doesn't make my choices not choices made by me, as a free and thinking agent rather than the illusion of one. Like, if you could predict my choices, that wouldn't mean I'm not making them suddenly, just because you'd know what they were.
