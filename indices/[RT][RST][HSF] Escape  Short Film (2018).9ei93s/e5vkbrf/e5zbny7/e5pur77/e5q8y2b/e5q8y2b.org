What do you mean by free will exactly?\\
Does an rng have free will?\\
if you have something that chooses deterministicaly 60% of the time and randomly the rest of the time does it have free will?\\
(take into account that anything not random is deterministic, and our intuitions about randomness don't really match the ones about free will ).\\
Like even If I am a completely deterministic system I can just get a quantum rng ,and take decisions based on its results and stop being deterministic that way , and this doesn't seem to add anything meaningful to the decision(well maybe It is a bit more unpredictable , but you are loosing effectiveness in exchange, and for most purposes a pseudo rng is indistinguishable )
