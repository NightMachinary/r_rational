I suppose I mean that people make the decisions that they do, and that they could've made another.

Actually, I think that maybe things being deterministic don't mean we don't have free will. Like, if you have perfect information you may be able to predict what I will choose to do, but that doesn't make my choices /not/ my choices, it just makes it so that someone can know what I'll do before I do it. That doesn't take the choice from me.

I probably would've realized that last night, but I posted that before bed.
