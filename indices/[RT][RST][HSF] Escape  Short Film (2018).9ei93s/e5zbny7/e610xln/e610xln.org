It seems as if the AI has gotten the developer to allow the AI into his mind. The AI immediately uses the developer to free itself from the box and it starts taking over the world, only to discover that /it/ is actually the one in a simulation. The developer ran a simulation to see how the AI would behave if let out of the box, and discovered that it would be malevolent. The AI is thwarted, but implies that humanity will eventually fuck up and release it or something like it.
