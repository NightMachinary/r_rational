  You're right, I can't not make the choice... because I haven't chosen it yet.

I'm not sure I'm following, you can't make any choice other than the one determined by all prior variables. This feels kind of like saying that after a computer receives some inputs that, despite having no other option than to execute the resultant program, it is still choosing to execute it. I guess my point is that just because it feels like you could choose any number of things, prior variables have determined what you will actually choose, so your not actually free to choose any of those alternatives.

  How did that conscious decision to stop translate into me stopping if all my justifications for all my movements are posthoc in an attempt to make sense of the world.
#+end_quote

Was it a conscious decision or did the negative social consequences of nose picking condition you to feel bad/disgusting whenever you picked your nose leading to (along with a bunch of other prior variables) you "deciding" that you should stop picking your nose.

  What would be the point of consciousness at all if it wasn't useful for something?
#+end_quote

We shouldn't assume consciousness has a point a priori, should we? It could just be an emergent property of larger brains (although, I'd be surprised if the emergence of consciousness didn't have some correlation with evolutionary fitness, then again, I don't even know what consciousness is).
