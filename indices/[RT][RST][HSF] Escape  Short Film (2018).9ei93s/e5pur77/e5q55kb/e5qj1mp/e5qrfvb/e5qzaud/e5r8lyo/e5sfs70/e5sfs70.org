Duno about "consciousness" but the parts of the brain associated with conscious thought and decision making certainly have a point.\\
Not sure what you are even trying to say. Of course our internal narratives(which seem clearly part of the consciousness thing) aren't an accurate description of how we are taking decisions a lot of times , but that does't mean that they are useless or that we don't ever make "conscious" choices .\\
Which of course are actually determined by prior variables , but water125 already acepted that so there is not much point.\\
Our brains run some deterministic algorithms and output an action that they predict will satisfy our preferences,\\
if you don't want to call that deciding , or the posible output being more than one "free will" fine .\\
But then its just a semantic argument.
