This time they seem more keen on promoting tribal warfare in Africa and conducting midnight raids, although they've also stopped a train robbery and rescued a bunch of refugees.

In the first quest, the Omega are an amoral swarm of quasi-AI: if they solved social issues, it was for the intended purpose of gaining allies to deal with said apocalypse. Over the years they ended up allying with a LGBT group, a bunch of anarcho-capitalists, people who are in favor of cryptocurrency, people who are against cryptocurrency, Ancient Egyptian revivalists, drug dealers, and more. Skip ahead a few years/turns and see what bonuses and penalties their attempt to shape society resulted in :)

In the current quest, the Foreman is a regular human being, and will do what his morality or lack thereof (as decided by the players) calls for. A few people will be able to "see through" to the Foreman's karma, either because they have that supernatural gift and the Foreman hasn't figured out how to block it or because they are trained in psychology and investigative techniques, but most will go by his reputation (which has a lot more to do with PR effort than any actual heroic or villainous deeds).
