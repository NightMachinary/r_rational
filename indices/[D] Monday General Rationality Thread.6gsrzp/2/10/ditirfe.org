I've been thinking exactly this myself. The problem, of course, comes when you consider other forms of sapient life as well. Cutting this off at just humans seems racist, so would you attempt to simulate every possible arrangement of matter which could be considered appreciably sapient? Because that sounds like something our universe doesn't have the resources for.
