It's brute-force, and probably too resource intensive.

Brute force storage of 1 bit per graph results in 10^{400} bytes, whereas the number of atoms in the universe are ~10^{80.} You can probably reduce it, but that's just to store all the combinations. Running each one would take a lot more resources.

Also, that's only limited to /unmodified/ human minds. When we start getting into transhumanism, we're going to have many more minds that won't fit into that mindspace.
