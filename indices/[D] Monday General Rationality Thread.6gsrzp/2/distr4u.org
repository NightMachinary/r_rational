Is it possible to resurrect someone who suffered an information-theoretic death (had the brain destroyed)?

The knee-jerk answer is no: the information constitutes the mind; the information is lost, the mind is lost. There's no /process/ that could pull back together a brain that got splattered across the floor, as far as we know.

It's possible to work /around/ that by pulling information from other sources: basics of human psychology, memories of other people, camera feeds, Internet activity, etc., building a model of the person. The result, though, would probably only narrow it to /several/ possible minds, different from each other in important ways. And even if someone who died yesterday could be reconstructed nearly-perfectly, what to do about random peasants of XVIII century that nobody bothered to write about?

If we could resurrect nearly-perfectly every person who died in modern ages, we could use /their/ simulated memories to guess at what people they met during their lives, cross-check memories of /all/ first-level resurrectees, then reconstruct second-level resurrectees based on /that/. Do the same with third-level, fourth-level, and so on ad infinitum.

But errors would multiply. Even if it's possible to reconstruct an n-level resurrectee with 80% accuracy based on (n-1)-level's information, third-level resurrectees would already be 49% inaccurate, and I suspect that the actual numbers would be even lower. That idea is impractical.

But. The set of all possible human minds is not infinite. We have a finite amount of neurons, finite amount of connections between them, which means that there could be only a finite number of possible distinct human minds, even if it's a combinatorially large number.

So, why not resurrect /everyone/? As in, generate every possible sufficiently-unique brain that could correspond to a functional human, then give them bodies? Or put them in simulations to lower space and matter expenditure.

It would require a large amount of resources, granted, but a galaxy's worth of Matrioshka Brains is ought to be enough.

This method seems blatantly obvious to me, yet people very rarely talk about it, and even the most longterm-thinking and ambitious transhumanists seem to sadly accept permanence of the infodeath.

Why? Am I missing something? And no, I am pretty sure that continuity of consciousness would be preserved here, as much as it would be with a normal upload.
