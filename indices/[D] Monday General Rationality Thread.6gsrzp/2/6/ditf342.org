Hold up, you're assuming humans are just their number of neurons and their connection patterns. That doesn't seem like a valid assumption to me. For one thing, we already know about DNA molecules, so two people with the exact same configuration of neurons can still be very distinct humans if their DNA molecules are different.

I also suspect that positioning is going to be extremely important here. The slightest shift in the position of an atom could manifest in large behavioral changes. We already know this because of things like prion diseases and chemical imbalances and various enzymes. Therefore, the set of all possible human minds could actually be infinite, since you can keep moving things around in infinitesimally small units.
