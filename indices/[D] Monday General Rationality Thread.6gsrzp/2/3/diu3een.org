This, sir, is absurd.

This is not resurrection of any sort. What you are proposing is to create intelligent entities at random. This is not resurrection. You would, create every permutation of everyone who has ever lived, and also everyone who never existed. And no way to tell the difference.

A note to anyone proposing the resurrection of the deceased, "information-theoretic" or not: please consider the morality of resurrection before proposing it. It is not an objective good. The state of being dead is morally neutral, almost by definition. Think carefully before disturbing that equilibrium.
