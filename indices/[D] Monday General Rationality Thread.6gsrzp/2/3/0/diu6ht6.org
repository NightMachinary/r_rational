I also think that creating all posible mind states would be a bad idea( although i would consider that ressurrecting them but that just a semantic discussion). But I disagree in that being death is moraly neutral, most people I think assign positive utility to just being alive so although they don't have any preferences when dead but their previous preferences still apply, and since most people I think prefer being alive unless they are suffering a lot so I think death\\
Is negative and even if we have to be carefully of not resurrect the people who won't want to be resurrected(according to their cev not only because they though they wouldn't) but in most cases resurrecting people is a good thing , and if for some reason you accidentally revive someone that wants to be dead you can allways let them die.
