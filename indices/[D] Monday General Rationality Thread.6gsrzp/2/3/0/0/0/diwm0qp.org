Well my main point is that the life of people after reviving them will be generally a net positive. Also I aren't taking into account the preferences of non existing people, I'm taking into account the preferences of previously existing people of not dying , it's just that they don't exist in that moment . I'm not sure if I Did really understand what you meant by me having to consider the utility to the non-existent, do you mean that since I am considering the preferences of currently non existing people I have to consider the preferences of all currently non existing minds ,even people that never existed(which does sound like utility monster but I don't see why one thing would imply the other)? Or do you mean something else.
