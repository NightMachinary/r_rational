If you were to limit resurrection to only those who once existed, that would be one thing. But you're proposing creating all possible people as a brute force attempt to get those who did exist. In the process, you create people who never did exist. There is no reason to elevate the preferences of those who did exist over those who didn't. The preferences of any entity you create should be considered.
