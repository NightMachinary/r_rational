(Sorry for responding two days later)

I think that the simple case of "resurrect people who have died shortly after their death" is an iterated prisoner's dilemma. Most living humans would want to be resurrected after death, so even if it would minorly cost to resurrect someone who died in the past, it would have a positive return because then you would be resurrected in turn.

I'm not speaking toward the solution of "create all possible mind states" because that's an absurd possibility that I'm not sure how to respond to at the moment.
