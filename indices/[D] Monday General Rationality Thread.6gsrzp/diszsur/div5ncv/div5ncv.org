I've been thinking about this on and off for the past day, and it disturbs me. I've seen the term "pre-commitment" tossed about in this sub-reddit with some regularity, but now I'm wondering what it means -- or rather, what the people here think it means. What distinguishes a pre-commitment from a regular old commitment?

For instance, I think of the "point of no return". A common scenario: "Once we've crossed this line, we will no longer be able to turn back. We will be committed to this course of action." This is the normal language used. Is your "pre-commitment" somehow different from that?
