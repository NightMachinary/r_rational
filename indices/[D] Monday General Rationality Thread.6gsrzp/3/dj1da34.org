I found on [[/r/askreddit]] a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6hl62g/youre_given_immortality_but_as_a_cost_you_are/dizmx83/][surprisingly thought-out plan for how a single person might uplift a society, given said person is immortal.]]

What do you guys think? Workable, or critically flawed?
