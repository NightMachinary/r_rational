I'd like to finally settle the idea of whether or not quantum teleportation should be considered death for myself. I feel like I'm 99% of the way to agreeing with the camp that says it isn't, but then I get tripped up at the last step. I know that a perfect copy of me /is/ me in every way that counts, that teleportation preserves my identity and everything I'd care about, etc.

So here's my issue: None of this seems like a good argument as to why I should be okay with an instance of myself dying just because another one exists. No matter how much they also deserve to be called "me", they can't access my subjective experience and I can't access theirs. I wouldn't tell another me to die just because I exist, and I wouldn't want to stop experiencing things just because my information's still out there. I'm a mind running on a physical brain, so I still stop experiencing everything if the brain I'm using gets destroyed no matter if something else has the same pattern.

So if someone who would be okay using a quantum teleporter could help me understand your position, I'd really appreciate it. I feel like I'm still missing something.
