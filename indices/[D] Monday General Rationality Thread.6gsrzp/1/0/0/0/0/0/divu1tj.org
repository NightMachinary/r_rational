  I would say that that from a utilitarian point of view the teleportation would be considered a net positive as the loss of the original you is made up for by the creation of a new you, who should be in a better position as you would not teleport otherwise.

The argument that it has a utilitarian net positive "because you chose to teleport" is a poor argument when I am currently in a position that I would /not/ choose to teleport.

The fact remains. A viable individual was terminated to give another a more advantageous position.

  I would argue not teleporting is also a murder of the version of you, you didn't give a chance to live.

Not teleporting is not murder. Otherwise, every second we spend not duplicate people is also murder. It would mean that we have a utilitarian duty to invent duplication technology as soon as possible and then use it as much as possible.

Also, that kind of reasoning about "potential future persons" would make abortions and masturbation illegal. And we don't want to go /backwards/.
