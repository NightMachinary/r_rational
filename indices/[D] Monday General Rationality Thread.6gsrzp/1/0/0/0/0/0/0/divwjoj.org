The point in saying that "you want to teleport" is just if all the ethical concerns was turned off would you rather be where you want to teleport to than where you are? Becouse then a see it as value as you create a version of you that is more happy (becouse they are a place they would rather be) at the cost of a version of you that is less happy.

The argument about masturbation and abortion, is that there is no corelation between not allowing those and an increase in number of children or quality of life. (If you are forced to not have an abortion that makes it less likely you will get a child later (your total number of children is unlikely to change) and as the mother would be more happy getting a child she wants it is a utilitarian positive to let them get their abortion)
