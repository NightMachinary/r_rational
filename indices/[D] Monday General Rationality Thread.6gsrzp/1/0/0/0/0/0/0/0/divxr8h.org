  The point in saying that "you want to teleport" is just if all the ethical concerns was turned off would you rather be where you want to teleport to than where you are? Because then I see it as value as you create a version of you that is more happy (because they are a place they would rather be) at the cost of a version of you that is less happy.

That's a bit strange way to argue. I can get you to agree to anything by asking you to turn off every concern that would make you disagree with me.

I assign value to people. Is that ethics or utilitarian? Terminating a conscious, thinking individual has a very big negative value. It could be left alive and have a full life.

If I disregard ethics I could rob and murder a rich depressed guy, because I would have more money (be at a better position in society) at the cost of a less happy person.

I don't see how murdering a copy of me is better than murdering a stranger. Both, if asked, will not want to be murdered. Not giving them the chance to answer the question absolves nothing.

If your only way to get an orgasm/sexual pleasure was having sex, and if contraceptives and abortions were not allowed, we'd have a lot more people (and more rapes). And it is our duty to have more children, because not giving each potential human a chance to live is murder.
