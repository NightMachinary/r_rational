I am firmly in the "would not teleport" camp.

I agree that a perfect copy would be an instance of me. But I see no point in terminating /this/ instance, for any reason.

Like you say, this instance quite enjoys its existence. What is the value in ending it? While the net result would be just one me, the same that we started with, it also has added one death, which has a rather huge negative value. And if asked if they want to die, both instances would answer a resounding "no". Making it not just a death, but a /murder/.
