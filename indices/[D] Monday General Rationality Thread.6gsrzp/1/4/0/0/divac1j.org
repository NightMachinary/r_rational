I think that "consciousness" doesn't exist. It's all just input and output; no qualia needed.

(Am I being facetious here? Perhaps. If someone offered me a bet that there is a real-world physical phenomenon which corresponds to that-which-we-refer-to-as-qualia, I'd bet against it--just not at very extreme odds. But /even if there is/, our current understanding of it is so utterly, utterly confused that I think using the word at this point might very well be detrimental to our efforts to understand what "consciousness" actually /is/.)
