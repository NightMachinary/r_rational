I think a big problem is that people can rationalize the moral implications of teleportation on an emotional level but as soon as you change a minor aspect it recontextualizes the problem and suddenly the "gut reaction" is completely different.

Suppose that a teleporter transmitter consisted of a scanner, a destroyer and a data transmitter and a teleporter receiver consisted of a constructor and a data receiver.

- If you do the classical startrek teleportation "thing" and scan->destroy->send->recieve->construct then people feel like consciousness is neither created nor destroyed and whatever gut-level "law of conservation" exists isn't violated.

- If you however upload the data to a handheld data drive and "revive" the person months later then people think that's wrong.

- If you have two teleporters next to each other and the destroyer glitches suddenly you have two people and it would be unethical to kill the earlier one.

- If you wait until you know that the data packets have been received and the person successfully reconstructed before you engage the destroyer the same problem applies
