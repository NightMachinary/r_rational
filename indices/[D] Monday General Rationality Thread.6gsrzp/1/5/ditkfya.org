You've got to think about the nature of a self. It's like a song, it doesn't matter what speaker it's playing on, it's still the same song. Likewise, it doesn't matter which atoms make me up, or where in space I'm located.

That being said, I would not get into a machine that promises to disassemble me. By all means, create the copy, but don't destroy any copies of the pattern.
