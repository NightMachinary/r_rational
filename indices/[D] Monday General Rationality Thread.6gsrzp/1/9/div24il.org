Well to give you the point of view of someone who would teleport.

First it is important to realize that because of the no cloning theorem from physics it is impossible to create a clone of something without destroying the original. This is important as it removes many problems, such as why does the first must die, and what if it is not executed as a part of the teleportation (would you then kill it?)

So from my point of view there is a utilitarian loss of a single person, with the gain of a perfect copy of this person who is in a new and preferred position (as they would otherwise not have teleported). So, by my calculations that is a net gain, and in a case where the other option is doing nothing (a net neutral) this is therefore preferred.

I hope it helps you understand why someone would be for teleporting.
