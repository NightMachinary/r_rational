This sounds like an issue that crops up in programming with some frequency. Equality.

We start with some object, call it X. As long as we pass references of X around from place to place, all references refer to the same X, and are equal. We can even call X by the name Y if we wanted, and X = Y would still hold. You would continue to be you.

But sometimes references are not sufficient. Sometimes we need to make a deep-copy of X. Now, Y, which is a deep copy of X, is equal to X in a structural sense, but not in a referential (shallow) sense. That is, references to X are not equal to references to Y, even though the data is identical.

If X and Y are deep copies, and allowed to evolve, that is, the structure or data of one or both changes, then X and Y are no longer equal in any sense (so long as they aren't changing synchronously).

But what if after creating Y as a deep copy of X, we immediately remove all references to X and zero out the memory location of X. X is gone, destroyed. Does the expression X = Y mean anything anymore? Since all references to X are gone, you can't even pose the question. For a programmer, it doesn't matter: we can rename Y to X and continue on as though nothing had happened. If you want X back, you can just copy Y, after all. Since they never exist simultaneously, and no information is lost, it doesn't matter whether Y is a deep or shallow copy of X.

This happens behind the scenes all the time inside computers; The system needs to run a garbage collection pass, moves some objects from one section of memory to another (for defragmentation purposes), and updates the object handles. The executing program never even knows anything happened.

Teleportation of this sort is nothing more than moving data in exactly this sort of way. I know you "think" you are unique, but computation is also data. So go ahead, get in the teleporter, you'll be fine. Unless you think you have a soul that is intrinsically linked to your particular collection of atoms? Or do you think the universe would be better off with two of you?
