It may not be very helpful but I wrote a story that relates to this idea.

[[https://kishoto.wordpress.com/2015/08/06/n2-and-you-rrational-challenge-clones-clones-and-clones/][N2 and You!]]

As far as the idea? I mostly agree. If there's any sort of afterlife/soul (which I generally don't believe in but /still/), then teleportation has worrying implications, as it certainly results in your death. It will also result in a new you's birth.

Here's how I usually frame the argument. Firstly, what aspect of the teleporter requires your destruction to create the new you? What sort of scanning process is that? It doesn't really make any sense. How will you being vaporized assist in this machine's reading of your current state of being? It's not as if vaporizing makes your atoms weigh any less. It simply changes the density. And if you're vaporizing to that level, then you're essentially just going to have to have the tools to reconstruct a specific person from resident elements at the other end. So, theoretically, it's just a fancy cloning machine. If it's actually that? Then it's not teleportation.
