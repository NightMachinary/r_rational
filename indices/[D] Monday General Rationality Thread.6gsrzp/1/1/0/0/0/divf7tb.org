It was my understanding that what happened was that because The Doctor changed history so that the antagonist never became the horrible person that he did, completely ignoring all paradoxes, so the man's equally despicable father never programmed the machine to respond to his son's commands. It seriously stretched the logic of time travel as we see him fully aware of his changing memories, but I enjoy the episode regardless since it was otherwise a decent character study.

However, I have another example that's WAY more obscure. In Role Playing Public Radio's Know Evil campaign, the character SAIROC became bonded to a Seed AI, saved his own mind as a backup, and then left it behind to go on missions fighting alien monsters and mind control viruses. By the time they met up again he had experienced so much trauma that the AI's mind scanner didn't recognize him as its master, which made him request his brain be restored from a backup in a heartbreaking scene.

He wasn't even because of mistakes he'd made, he simply decided he preferred being the naive idealist to the broken nihilist he'd become over the course of just a few days. He didn't want to remember watching his friends die as he was powerless to prevent it, then see them be restored from a backup acting like nothing had happened. He didn't even care about the trauma his friends would go through themselves or that his mind likely would shatter all over again in the future. It was tragic as hell.
