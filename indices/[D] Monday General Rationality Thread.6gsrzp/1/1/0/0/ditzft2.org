IMO, it's a “sliding scale of the surveyees' emphasizing” problem. That is, how much, in the person's opinion, should minds A and B differ from each other for the person to consider them two separate entities.

There was a nice demo on this in Doctor Who's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Christmas_Carol_(Doctor_Who)][/Christmas Carol/ rendition.]] In this story, the antagonist was the only person whose commands were accepted by a certain mind-reading machine, so the Doctor uses his Therapy no Jutsu and time-travel shenanigans to convince him to help them out in solving the story's crisis. Only, by the time the antagonist becomes convinced enough the machine judges him to be too divergent and doesn't recognize him as the person entitled to issue the commands any more.

So in terms of this DW episode, different people would have different criteria for their “mind-diff subroutine”. Some would consider it a murder even all the difference between two instances of the “same” mind were that one has been shown a card with a square on it while the other a card with a circle. And some would tie the necessary amount of changes to things like key values, principles, etc.

TL;DR: Uniqueness of a personality is in the eye of the beholder and all that.
