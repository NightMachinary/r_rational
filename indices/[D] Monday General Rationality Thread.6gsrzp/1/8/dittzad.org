  I wouldn't tell another me to die just because I exist

I like to think that I'm extremely pro-teleporter, but I agree that doing /that/ would be wrong. But it doesn't seem to me that a teleporter would require anything like that. Maybe I'm thinking of a different sort of teleporter, though?

When I think about the teleporter problem, this is what I imagine: the teleporter scans and destroys my original body at the entrance, and then produces a copy of me at the destination. At no point is my original allowed to possess any subjective experiences or memories which the copy will lack*. So, from my perspective, I enter the teleporter in one place and exit it in another.

*Exception: Original!Me might get a second or two of standing inside the entrance teleporter between the scan and the destruction. Those memories wouldn't be transferred, BUT since the copy is perfect, this can be remedied by making the interior of the entrance teleporter and exit teleporter identical. Then my post-teleport self will think the same thoughts that my pre-teleporter self did, and re-sync with the "me" from the moment of my original body's destruction.

So you see, it isn't a "different" instance of yourself dying. Your mind just briefly stops running on your original body, and then starts running on a new body. In fact, you could delay the destruction of the original body as long as you wanted, as long as you kept copy!You in the teleporter for the same length of time as original!you was in there for. This would keep the two brains running "you" in sync. Or in other words, you'd have two bodies experiencing the same things and having the same thoughts, and then you'd go down to having one body experiencing those things. No one dies because no train of subjective experiences has stopped.

  I wouldn't want to stop experiencing things just because my information's still out there.

Assuming a perfect copy (well actually I believe a slightly imperfect copy would still be fine, but thats a completely different discussion), and assuming nothing goes wrong with the teleporter, you wouldn't stop experiencing things. My conception of the teleporter is based on the idea that "stop having experiences == dying"

Finally,

  No matter how much they also deserve to be called "me", they can't access my subjective experience and I can't access theirs.

Maybe I'm just a weirdo and everyone else on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] got a memo I missed, but where did anyone get this idea that people who aren't literally experiencing the same thing as you deserve to be called "you"? It seems pretty obvious to me that if you make a copy of yourself, and your train of subjective experiences branch off from their train of subjective experiences, the two of you stop being the same person. You might be extremely similar people, and you might be able to predict eachother's thoughts and behaviour with extreme accuracy until the differences between you add up over the next few weeks, but you aren't literally them and they aren't literally you, and the two of you will never be the same person ever again. If such a branched-off copy was ever created by accident (such as the dematerializer in an entrance teleporter failing to fire) it would be horrendously awkward, but the two people produced by the accident would both have a right to exist as themselves. If such an accidental copy of me was ever made, we'd have a weird few weeks as we figured out how to split up our stuff and what to do re: our boyfriend (possibly become the weirdest and sexiest 3-way relationship of all time), but the solution we would eventually find would absolutely not be "kill one of the copies!" And such an accident wouldn't make me any less willing to keep using teleporters. At most I'd become a little more paranoid about making sure the dematerializer is working properly every time. Four's a party, after all.

So yeah, that's my position. Am I missing anything?
