  Similar to moving files from computer to USB drive - operating system copies the data to USB drive, then deletes the original upon verification that the data were successfully written) The Windows computers I've worked with don't even do THAT, the files you transfer stay on the computer's HDD until I manually delete them. Do other operating systems go it differently?
