  the teleporter scans and destroys my original body at the entrance, and then produces a copy of me at the destination

I can see an engineering problem here. In my opinion, any sane teleporter design woudn't destroy the original until after the copy is created and verified functional. Otherwise any bugs or unreliability on the link between the teleporters would result in unrecoverable death. (Similar to moving files from computer to USB drive - operating system copies the data to USB drive, then deletes the original upon verification that the data were successfully written)
