Commitment is playing chicken and saying "I will not turn the steering wheel". Pre-commitment is throwing the steering wheel out the window so that turning is impossible.

However, commitment devices differ in severity, with that being a more extreme case; a lesser example might be the difference between saying "I will lose 20 pounds" as a commitment, versus giving a friend $50 and telling them not to give it back to you unless they verify that you have lost 20 pounds. It's not absolute, since you can still fail, but the principle is the same.

(I do see a lot of people get this wrong, or talk about pre-commitment without discussing any commitment device, sometimes in situations where there's no conceivable commitment device.)

In the case of marriage, you're usually saying "I will be with this person forever" and then the commitment devices that cut off (or weigh down) future options vary on the basis of whether or not you sign a prenuptial, the terms of that prenuptial, the laws in your country/state, etc.
