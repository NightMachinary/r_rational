I've been thinking about marriage in the context of game theory and pre-commitment. Since it's relatively hard/painful to get unmarried, marriage is not just a commitment, it's a pre-commitment, since you're limiting your options going forward (in addition to your public declaration, which is itself a pre-commitment in the form of reputational loss etc.).

The strongest argument that I've seen against marriage is that it's a legal/societal construct created for reasons that /probably/ don't match up with what any individual specifically wants from that partnership, and the convenience/social/legal aspects of marriage don't make up for the benefits of being able to roll your own partnership contract.

Prenuptials interest me from a game theory standpoint. If there's income/wealth disparity, then they act as a defection incentive equalizer, but either way they also decrease the disincentive to defect, since it's easier to get out of the marriage and break commitment. However, defection /within/ the marriage is also a thing; if you know that someone has made a substantial pre-commitment, you can use that against them by e.g. being a shitty husband with the knowledge that divorce is very unlikely.

(This obviously has some parallels to world politics.)
