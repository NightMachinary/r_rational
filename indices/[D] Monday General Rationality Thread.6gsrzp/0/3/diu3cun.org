"Marriage" is multiple things.

Marriage is a legal contract. It can be entered into as any other legal contract, and in this sense carries substantial consequences in a purely legal sense but no emotional overtones.

Marriage is a religious construct. It is a binding promise to be true to, to support and cherish a partner, to be someone who the partner can rely on. It is not to be entered into lightly; but when both partners hold to their promises, their trust in each other can allow them to be stronger together than apart.

Marriage is also a promise, made for the sake of future (or not-so-future) children; to (as far as circumstances allow) raise a child together, in a family that makes as much stability for the child as is reasonably possible, for this is how we get stable, productive humans in the next generation.

These definitions have become twisted and entangled (and I'm not entirely sure that I've untwisted them properly here). Many things can be said about marriage in one or the other definition, which often doesn't apply to all the /other/ definitions of the word. Especially since all of them are generally done pretty much at once, on the same day.
