One possible reason not to do it is if there is disutility associated with someone having a fake past. The number of people whose past is genuine generated in such a system would be a lot lower than those whose memories are fake.

Also, assuming they are all placed in cohesive worlds, each person, even if assuming their own past is accurate, could still be virtually certain that the people they are interacting with in particular (despite being indistinguishable) all have false pasts to some extent. This would be true even in the subset of worlds where everyone's past is in fact accurate, i.e. they would (falsely, as a special case) have every reason to suspect their reality to be fabricated.

Another nontrivial issue would be that you'd be instantiating a bunch of memories of suffering that never happened historically. Fake memories of suffering might carry a huge amount of disutility relative to only historical suffering.

Still, if the alternative is everyone just randomly awakening for brief instants as Boltzmann Brains, it might be better. You could at least limit the memories to suffering that is actually possible in realistic historically consistent physical universes, which would be a tiny subset of total possible hells.
