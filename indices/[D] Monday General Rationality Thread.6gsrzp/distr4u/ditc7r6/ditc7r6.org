  But. The set of all possible human minds is not infinite. We have a finite amount of neurons, finite amount of connections between them, which means that there could be only a finite number of possible distinct human minds, even if it's a combinatorially large number.

The adult human brain has around 86±8 billion neurons. On average, each neuron in an adult human brain has 7,000 synaptic connections to other neurons. Adults retain about 1/2 to 1/10th of their synaptic connections from childhood.

Even if you were cloning people and growing them under identical conditions so that every child starts off with identical neuron and synapse configurations, this would mean that by adulthood each neuron would be in one of at least 2^{14000} possible states of synapse connections. As a result, your final set of minimal possible brain configurations is going to be at least 2^{14000} × 8.6 × 10^{10} × 0.5. You end up with 1.1 × 10^{4225} possible combinations. There's only about 10^{80} atoms in the observable universe. That's the best case scenario even assuming you're only working with brains that all started off exactly the same.
