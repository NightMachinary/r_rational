  So, why not resurrect everyone? As in, generate every possible sufficiently-unique brain that could correspond to a functional human, then give them bodies? Or put them in simulations to lower space and matter expenditure.

Because most of those brain-states correspond to being randomly pulled out of your own place and time and shoved into this weird new one you never asked for.

Also, "combinatorially large" quickly reaches "larger than the observable universe can handle". Remember, it already does so for chess positions and Go positions. "Possible human consciousnesses", even constrained by a very good structural model, is /waaaaaaay/ beyond what the universe can handle.
