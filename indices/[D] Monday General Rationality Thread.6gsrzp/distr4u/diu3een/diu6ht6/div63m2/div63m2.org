No, prior preferences cannot still hold. The person is dead. They have no preferences. No utility, positive or negative. They cannot prefer life. But since you bring it up, it sounds as though you've decided that utilitarianism should be the governing moral framework. Now you have to consider the utility to the non-existent. Sounds like a utility monster to me.
