I'm totally with you.

It's fine for OTHER people to want to quantum teleport-- I'll never know the difference between the versions of themselves who get destroyed/created. But I rather like experiencing things, and I see no reasons why THIS INSTANCE of me would continue experiencing things after a teleport.
