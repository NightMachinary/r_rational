I'm pretty sure I see what you're getting at, and I don't find it a useful distinction to try to make.

Like it or not, certain elements of identity are baked directly into the foundations of language, because the people that created those languages all had self-identity (or at least, believed they did. Let's skip right over P-Zombies) and those didn't need to be discussed. At this level, it doesn't even make much sense to try to define "I", because a quantum copy of me 10 minutes from now would have the same memory I will 10 minutes from now of me writing this message.

Regardless, on some level there's a subjective experience of this moment being experienced by a thing, and that thing would like to continue experiencing moments.
