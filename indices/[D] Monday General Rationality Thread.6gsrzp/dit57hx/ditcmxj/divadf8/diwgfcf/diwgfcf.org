Uh, I mean the one typing this message, right now.

I'm not really interested in arguing over whether or not a quantum copy of me is the same person-- obviously we are up to the nanosecond the copy is created. But even if that other me is going to keep right on living, and no one else knows the difference, *I'm* still going to stop living.
