I was only describing that "the point in terminating this instance" is for the teleportation to be possible from a point of physics.

I would say that that from a utilitarian point of view the teleportation would be considered a net positive as the loss of the original you is made up for by the creation of a new you, who should be in a better position as you would not teleport otherwise.

I would argue not teleporting is also a murder of the version of you, you didn't give a chance to live. Or maybe there is only ever one you and no one is ever killed, but that is a question of definition which i don't find worthwhile to discuss
