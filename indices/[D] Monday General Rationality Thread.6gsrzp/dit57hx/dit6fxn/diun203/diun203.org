We are lucky enough that for teleportation to be possible, we need to destroy the original (no cloning theorem). So the point in "terminating this one" is to make it possible to create the other one. And if the other one is in a better/more optimal position then the net utility should be positive, and there would not be a better option (there being both versions at the same time)
