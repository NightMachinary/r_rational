I always have trouble with this kind of stuff because I've always interpreted the Star Treck "standard" to be that the matter that makes you up gets transported across the "teleport link" to the receiver and gets reconstructed there, rather than the matter staying at the sender, and the receiver re-building you from matter stored on-sight. So the idea of the sender failing to "destroy" you was nonsensical, because then it wouldn't be possible to build the "other you" at the receiver.

In retrospect is makes more sense for each station to have a stockpile of various atoms on hand rather than confront the engineering challenge of sending 70 kilos of matter who-knows-how-far.
