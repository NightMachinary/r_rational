Thanks for your thought experiment, but now I think I'm even /more/ confused for the moment. Previously I could imagine replacing each neuron in my brain with another substrate, and as long as the process was gradual and each neuron functioned identically to the one it was replacing, there would be no way for me to really tell. I could be the same mind running on a different physical brain, no problem. But then your thought experiment made me recall the ship of Theseus for some reason, and it occurred to me that if the neurons that were taken out were assembled back into a brain again... well, I'm not even sure of all the implications just yet. It makes me feel incredibly weird, and I need to go think for a while now.
