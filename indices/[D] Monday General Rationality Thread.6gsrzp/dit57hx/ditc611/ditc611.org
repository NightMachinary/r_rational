Why would that be so? Consider a copy of you uploaded in a computer. Suppose that copy would be able to transfer between computers at will. Destuction of the computer on which the copy was initially uploaded wouldn't kill him/her, if the copy already transfered from it at the moment of destruction. Thus, the continuity of consciousness would be preserved, even though the only thing that would survive is data.

Or do you believe that the upload would experience death in the process of /transfer/ between computers, in this case? What if that process is gradual? Imagine computers standing nearby, connected by a physical cable.
