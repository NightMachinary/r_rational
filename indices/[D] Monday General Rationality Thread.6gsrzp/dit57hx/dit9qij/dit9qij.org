If you don't let instances diverge (halt simulation of the original before making a copy and restarting it at another place) there is simply never "another you" that can die.

It's like, imagine you'reâ€‹ on your computer and copied you favorite photo out of your photos directory into another one. And then, /without modifying either/, you somehow believe that by deleting either one of them you'll lose something important.
