When given the choice between one or two instances of me existing, I would also prefer the latter. But I assume this is one of the constraints of the thought experiment, that having two copies is not an option.

When I think of my utility function, it is only dependent on the /state/ of the universe during the future. How I think of an action therefore only depends on its results, and I would readily agree in most variants of this thought experiment. There is only a choice between having one instance at location A or having one instance at location B. The 'process' of teleportation is not relevant, as there is nothing to experience that has a duration. I would argue that it is not a process at all! (To the version where the operator stabs me to death I object rather heavily, however.)

It is useful to think of things as changing over time, as continuous processes. You can estimate utility by considering your current state, and think of how a process might affect it. If you deal with discontinuities however, there are major differences between looking at points of time versus time spans. This is especially apparent in situations with extreme differences in utility over tiny time spans, which, in my opinion, makes this thought experiment so bizarre.

As I understand your position, you worry that at the moment of teleportation there are two instances: One is experiencing normal continuity of consciousness, but having traveled to location B; the other is also experiencing continuity, still at A, and objecting vehemently to their impending demise. This however, is true at the instant of teleportation, which is not a long time; before and after that moment everything is fine. My point is not that the latter instance should be smiling happily instead, but that its predicament is too short to matter. Dying here is instantaneous, I care about the time spent alive. To me, the scary thing is not the concept of dying, but rather the prospect of being dead afterwards.
