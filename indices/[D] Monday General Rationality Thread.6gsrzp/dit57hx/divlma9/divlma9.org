Is (damage-free) cryopreservation death? If not, you could potentially cryopreserve yourself at low temperatures, and set up a pair of nanotech enhanced surfaces, one of which disassembles and the other of which assembles an exact replica of what the other one has disassembled. Only a thin layer would be disassembled at a time, and it could be done as slowly as needed. Afterward, you would be revived and go about your business in the new location.

More speculatively, suppose we just stop your heart and replace your blood temporarily with an unpressurized gelatinous mass of nanites that can keep your cells oxygenated for several hours (without moving anything around much or involving pressurized fluids). Now, you can touch one plate, sink your hand into it, and observe it acting like a portal, as your hand reaches out of the other plate. You pick up an apple on the other side, pull it through, etc. No loss in feeling or nerve damage in your hand, everything appears normal and undamaged.

Now let's say you try putting your head partway through. Your thought processes are uninterrupted just like the feeling in your hand, because the nanobots are simulating the thin "digitized" layer in realtime and also quickly reconstructing it into a physical layer on the other side. There's only ever one "you" in the process, of which only a tiny (not itself sentient) fraction is ever digital at any given moment, and you aren't damaged or altered by it in any observable way when you pull your head back out.

Does it still seem like a bad idea to step through the portal?
