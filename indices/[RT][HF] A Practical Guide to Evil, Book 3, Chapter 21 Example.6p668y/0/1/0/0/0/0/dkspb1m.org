I like Bard as an intentional foil. I dislike Bard as the schemer who's trying her best to destroy Cat. Like, she's not even really taking swings at the Calamities she's trying to pull down all of Callow because it isn't how stories are done.

She's the literal antagonist of EVERYTHING Catherine is trying to achieve.
