Thank you for your two cents. They are gratefully received.

Regarding rituals, I think that part of the issue may be that I have a need for something that extends into the past. I'm not /entirely/ sure on this, mostly because I'm just extrapolating from "this is what other people say about the usefulness of rituals, at least sometimes" and "any ritual that I came up with on my own would feel shallow."

Though the community aspect rather than the time-bound aspect might be what's most important, since I just considered the possibility of "new ritual created by myself or a close friend and shared with that person" and, at least as I consider it now, it doesn't /seem/ to have the same quality of shallowness.

I guess that's another reason to make it to Solstice.

The space shuttle? The professor? Those are the only two "Challenger" references that come to mind.
