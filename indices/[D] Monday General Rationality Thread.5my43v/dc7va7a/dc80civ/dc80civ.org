There is nothing wrong in feeling tribal affiliation to the culture you were raised in, even if you don't believe in the dogma behind those labels. For example, I consider [[/r/rational]] as a sort of intellectual family, but I still occasionally surround myself with people from my home culture specifically to minimize the sense of isolation you mention. The best of both worlds sort of. Sorry if I am projecting my own interpretation on your issues. Hope you find contentment.
