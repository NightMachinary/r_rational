  is this a similar thing as finding a group of people whose ideas / beliefs you share?
#+end_quote

I'm not totally sure. I mean, I'm not Jewish, but my girlfriend is, and I noticed yesterday that I was starting to develop some tribalish tendencies in that direction despite, as I just said, not actually being Jewish (though I've been very fond of lots of aspects of Judaism and Jewish culture since before I met my girlfriend).

It might be an in-person thing. I haven't had much of an opportunity for in-person interactions with the aspiring!rationalist community. Hopefully I'll be able to experiment with that sooner rather than later, but that depends on whether and where I get accepted to grad school over the next few months.

  It also looks like you'd like to have more meaningful rituals that you can relate to?
#+end_quote

Yes. I used to have some, but their meaningfulness seems tied to accepting certain ideas that I no longer subscribe to. I feel like I'd be able to do without rituals if I'd never had any to begin with, but the question is moot because I did have some and that feeling of lack is present.

  Apologies for not offering good answers to your query, but it looks like there are a lot of things going on, and I wouldn't want to offer suggestions without enough information.
#+end_quote

No problem.
