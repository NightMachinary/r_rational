As one small little suggestion, something like a journal or gratitude diary (if you don't already have one) could be a ritual that isn't super tied down to a belief system.

I've been writing down thoughts daily for years (so it's a ritual for me in that sense), and I've found it very helpful for getting my mind in order.

It's not much, but it might be useful? Other things in that vain ("religiously" exercising, eating certain foods on certain days, etc.) sound like ways to ritualize helpful habits.

(But that doesn't sound like exactly what you need, alas.)
