PSA: Free weekly bites on cognitive tools.

If you recall that awesome [[http://mcntyr.com/52-concepts-cognitive-toolkit/][52 tools to add to your cognitive toolkit]] list a while back, you may be excited to hear that Peter McInyre and Jesse Avshaomov have a new thing called [[https://conceptually.org/][Conceptually]].

Conceptually sends you a new concept every week, from countersignaling to efficient markets. It looks fun!
