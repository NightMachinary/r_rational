Yes, I would be very happy if we got more overlap between rationalist and pedagogical spaces.

I know there are probably useful models of learning that a pragmatically-minded person could probably exploit, which would probably also be helpful in integrating these types of tools into our lives.

But for right now, it doesn't look like there are too many people in both (that I am aware of).

I'll hopefully be looking into some learning / habit things this year, so maybe some basic write-ups later on can prove useful to the general crowd.
