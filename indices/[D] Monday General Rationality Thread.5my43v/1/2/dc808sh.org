Well brother G that's a good set of questions. I don't have any answer's but I can give you my 2cp on the topic (and you didn't even pay two bent pennies so consider the price):

Tribe: (Finding your own) This is one of those journey not destination things. It's 50/50/90(1) I'd consider you a member of my own tribe from your comments, but as you said it is easy to fall into tribal labels, and in my own opinion, fall victim to Challenger-esque levels of group-think. Look for people and venues where you can find people you enjoy, if you haven't found your calling/profession/ect. think about what fields are most likely to attract people you'd want to work with. I'm currently mostly tribe-less aside from family hours away, work, and a few friends, but I have deep tribal roots to fall back on as a military veteran, so I think I empathize, but to a lesser extent, and yes fandom IMHO are a great place to send spurious tribal drives if you keep them non-obnoxious and limit there exposure to those who do not sympathize with them. In short give your loyalty, perhaps sparingly, when you do, give it well and be willing to speak up about things that are wrong.

Rituals: find the ones that work for you. [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/][Make them pay rent]] in that they are good for you.

Spirituality: Not much to add here. We are all made of starstuff; a few of Heinlein's better quotes about the value, and stupidity, of humanity come to mind but that's about it.

/end my 2 cents

(1) Navy nuclear power saying may also be common in engineering circles to the effect: if you guess against 50/50 odds you will be wrong 90% of the time. /Not rigorously accurate but emphasizing opportunities costs for guesses when more data can be acquired through interaction or, in the original setting getting deeper into the documentation/
