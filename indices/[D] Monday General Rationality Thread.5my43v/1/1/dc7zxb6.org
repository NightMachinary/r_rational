Hmm, is this a similar thing as finding a group of people whose ideas / beliefs you share?

It sounds like the rationalist-space/adjacent spheres have similar people who you'd click with (you mentioned SSC above).

Is it more of an in-person sort of thing? It also looks like you'd like to have more meaningful rituals that you can relate to?

Also, it sounds like you might have some tribe-related reservations?

Apologies for not offering good answers to your query, but it looks like there are a lot of things going on, and I wouldn't want to offer suggestions without enough information.
