I try to avoid having a tribal-centered mindset and avoiding the kind of reasoning that arises from it. When I notice that applause lights are switching on purely because of the labels that are involved, I try to stamp down on it.

I'm starting to think that it might be contributing to a sense of being adrift, or of loneliness in a general way, though, and I'm not sure how to go about dealing with that.

My spiritual affiliations are...odd, at the moment. Let's just say that I can't honestly claim to use certain labels in an orthodox manner and so any other uses come off as being shallow and disingenuous. I don't feel that identifying as an American really does anything to fill that "need for tribal belonging" or whatever it ought to be called, because national identities seem pretty shallow. I'm strongly opposed to

I /did/ get a sort of "This is my place; these are my people" feeling when I was able to attend a Slate Star Codex meetup last Spring, but it's going to be a long while before I can do something like that again (best case, most of a year; worst case, years and years), and I don't know if that's actually filling that need or if it's just filling a /similar/ need that I can't recognize as separate because neither has been fulfilled more than temporarily, and I'm also kind of nervous about trying to fill that hole at all.

Some of this has to do with rituals, I think. There are spiritual rituals which don't do anything for me because I don't perceive useful meaning behind them. I mean, there's definitely meaning, but I'd have to twist it out of the original context in order to give it a meaning that conformed to reality as I understand it, and that doesn't seem to me to be the same ritual anymore, but another ritual with surface similarities.

How do I fix this? Do I just deal with it, or do I find things to be super-ultra-tribal about that just don't matter, like fandoms or something like that, or what?
