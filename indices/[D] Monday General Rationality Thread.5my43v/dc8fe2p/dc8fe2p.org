This last week was my first week of school for Winter, and also new year's. What a show Fall was. I took way too many credits and was super demotivated/depressed now, my Best Friend lives next door and I'm on some antidepressants, which have helped a lot with some issues I've had. Due to last semester, I've dropped down to 12 credits from 17 last semester. I've got a job with one of my professors from last semester as a grader.

On the Discord server, I had a thought around something similar to the story "Everyone is Bob" from the front page a while back. Imagine that you have a Despot in modern 2017 of a reasonably-sized country that has a notable Homeless problem. The only unique thing about the country is that you have complete power over the whole country. Other than that, it's your standard faire Socialistic country of sorts. As a benevolent autocratic leader, let's say you become a full-fledged Utilitarian, and therefore make your goal to increase the overall Utility Point Output of each one of your "homeless" citizens - /no major changes to society or social structure/

You begin with your standard stuff of implementing various social programs to enlist each panhandler, mentally ill individual, and any other individual who is sleeping on the streets in a routine fashion. Perhaps you build shelters and force the homeless to move there. You can then evaluate them for their problems - normal except heavy drug use, schizophrenia, disability which makes them unable to work, etc. You begin to track these individuals. While you can't nail down each individual's UPO, you are quite certain that many of these people are decreasing the UPO of the local populace where these homeless people are residing, and so the program continues.

You try to rehabilitate as many as you believe is Utiltiy-Point Efficient, but soon you realize that no matter what you do, certain people will never be Utility-Point Neutral, let alone Utility-Point Positive, and so, for those individuals, you start to kill them off because in theory, it is impossible to bring them up to UP neutrality.

You, as the imaginary Despot, however, realize that your Utility-Point function is woefully incomplete, and figure even if the program is a failure in the long run, it was high time someone tried an honest Utility-Maximization program.

I've realized that my !Pokemon story needs to have conflicts inside of and outside of the story itself, if it's to be what I want it to be- My worldbuilding is going to encompass multiple regions, and to varying degrees of detail, long before the story takes place, and long after it takes place as well. Otherwise, I fear I'll end up into a trap of defining rules-as-I-go, and I want to nail down as many rules before the story gets going. Therefore, having a story longer than the actually published one will probably help with that quite a bit. I will world build for a multi-book series, and probably only write a short novel (45k words).
