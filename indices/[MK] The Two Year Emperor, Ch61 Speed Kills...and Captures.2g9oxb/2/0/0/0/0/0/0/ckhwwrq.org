Per round. (10' per second) And yeah, I agree: as far as I can tell, Milo's trick is not supported by RAW. Also, he readied an action (presumably to cast Feather Fall, since that's the only thing that could make it work), but then he took an action to cast a spell (Dimension Door) which would have canceled his readied action. Also, he cast two spells in the same round: Dimension Door to get into the house, then immediately a Feather Fall to not die. It's the first and only place where I don't think the RAW supports HPN20.

And a relativistic tarrasque sounds awesome.
