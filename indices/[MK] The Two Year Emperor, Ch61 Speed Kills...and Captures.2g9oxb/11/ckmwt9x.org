How are the Landguard (under Permanent haste, with 'heavily enchanted' adamantine daggers) doing all of this while under the anti-magic field that protects them from /kill-you-a-whole-lot-and-banish-the-ashes/ traps?

I get that the daggers still break DR even under the field, but the Landguard in their heavy armour should be moving 15ft/round.

In fact, shouldn't the Landguard in their heavy armor move 20ft/round (40 with haste)? Or does their armor have an ability that let's them retain a normal base speed?
