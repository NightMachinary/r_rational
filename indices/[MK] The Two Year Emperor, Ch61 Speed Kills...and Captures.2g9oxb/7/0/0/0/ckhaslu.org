It's all about reference frames.

In this case there's three relevant reference frames.

In the first, that of an outside observer, because of how D&D turn physics works, you can only really measure the position of the slug (item being moved via railgun) at the start and end of the round. In this case the round is approximately 6 seconds, and distance covered is effectively arbitrary. So the observed speed is very high.

The second is that of the commoners in the railgun. Because turn order is chosen to facilitate the railgun each commoner will be able to observe the slug for the duration of their round. Initially they see one commoner to one side of them holding the slug , and over the course of six seconds they will move it, at some sedate speed the few meters that is their purview.

The final reference frame is that of the slug is itself, which will see itself move at a bit under a meter per second until it has traversed the full distance, and noting each of the intervals where a particular commoner moves it.

Now, the best way to look at this is as a whole, is that while the slug is in the railgun, it is effectively carrying time. Whenever some entity can observer the slug, time is moving forward for it. The slug can alwys see itself, so time progresses normally. The commoners are only moving through time when they're holding the slug, and are paused otherwise. The outside observer is paused the entire time the slug is in the railgun.

Some consequences of this are, while the commoners or the outside observer might perceive the slug moving through the railgun, they'll never be able to pause and note a point where the slug is only partially through the railgun. (the exception being when the commoner is holding the slug themselves)
