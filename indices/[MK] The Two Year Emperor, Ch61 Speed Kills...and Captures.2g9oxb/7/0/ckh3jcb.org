Yep, the multiple booms are echoes. Which was totally not the original intent but, since I just said it, now it's canon.

The railgun is weird; the object is not traveling faster than a normal handoff, yet somehow it is also covering (potentially) thousands of miles per second. The original intent as created on the Internet was as a weapons platform; the idea was to hand it along the line until it's at relativistic speed, then let it fly off and blow something up. Doesn't work; it requires switching between RAW and real physics halfway through the trick. I'm fine to use RAW, I'm also fine to do physics...but switching halfway through is bogus.

[put it in the profile] Yeah. Could do. Thanks for the suggestion!
