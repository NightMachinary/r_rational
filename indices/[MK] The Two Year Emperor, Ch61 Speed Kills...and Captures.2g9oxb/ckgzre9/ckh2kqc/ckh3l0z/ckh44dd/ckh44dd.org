Well, the falling rules only specify how much damage is done to the person. They don't specify how much damage is done to whatever they hit so the orbital bombardment would be fine (at least, with regards to falling damage), if it applied to it, whatever it hit would be less fine. Though I'm not sure if the falling rules apply to objects, if they did, it'd still work.

Milo abused this in another fanfiction. He's more squishy so maximum falling damage would be bad for him but he avoided it with a spell.

  "In midair, he readied an action. He'd discovered from overhearing conversations between the Weasley's about Quidditch that, in this plane of existence, people had a hard time hitting moving targets for some reason---the faster the target, the harder the shot. Milo had no such restriction (in fact, it was significantly easier to hit a running target), which did not stop him from exploiting this quirk of the local rules.

  While falling, he adopted an aerodynamic posture to maximise his velocity. As he came within an inch of the roof, his Readied Action triggered."Dimension Door." Milo's view of the Dursleys' roof was suddenly replaced by a view of the Dursleys' tasteless dining room and Petunia's tasteless cooking. Like all Teleportation spells, Dimension Door placed the target on the nearest solid surface, in this case, the dining room table. Dimension Door, however, does not modify the target's momentum."Feather Fall," Milo cast the instant---literally---he re-appeared, sword in hand, standing on the table---still moving at terminal velocity.

  Feather Fall, contrary to popular opinion, did more than simply slow a falling creature, because if it did, the sudden deceleration would kill anyone targeted by it. In addition, it explicitly made the target immune to falling damage. It is this effect that Milo required. Milo appeared on the table loaded with an enormous amount of momentum, but, thanks to Feather Fall, the sudden impact had no effect on him. The table, not being a target of Feather Fall, had no such magical protection, and had to deal with Milo's sudden change of velocity in a manner more in line with the laws of physics, as if he had crashed into it at a high speed.

  The table exploded the moment Milo's feet touched it, filling the room with splinters, while Milo---now immune to falling damage, thanks to Feather Fall---slowly floated down to touch the floor. Wizards one, physics zero, Milo thought smugly amid the devastation."

Edit. If you did allow this there are fun ways to abuse it. Create a long diamond tube with a vacuum with true creation (you can reinforce it with walls of force later) create a teleport circle at bottom, leave the landguard member till they reach relativistic speeds, then teleport them at an enemy. Maybe give them immunity to fire somehow too. If the falling damage rules were allowed you would have a relativistic landguard member who took a maximum of 20d6 damage from their fall hitting a target with an arbitrarily high energy.

Edit 2. You can further abuse this with polymorph any object to polymorph into a dinosaur killer asteroid.
