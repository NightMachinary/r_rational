Probably doesn't work. Falling damage works by RAW, but Feather Fall is a bit iffy in that it says it slows your fall to 60 feet per second instantly and Milo has a quirky interpretation that it's not instant. So no way to do safe relativistic landguards with your world sadly.

Well, you can scale your attack to an appropriate level. A relativistic tarrasque would be fine too.
