I'm not sure. Max falling speed damage is only 20d6. They have 80d10 health plus constitution, so maybe 400+480. 60 damage vs 880. Does going at mach 11 do 14 times the damage of falling from orbit to earth?

Besides, if it was an issue you could just cast energy immunity: sonic and energy immunity: fire on the outer landguards.
