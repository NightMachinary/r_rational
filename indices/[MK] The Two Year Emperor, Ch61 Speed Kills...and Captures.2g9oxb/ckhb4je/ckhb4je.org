At the end of this chapter you say "the remaining five hundred Landguard ". Where did the other 1000 go? The only place I can see is the platoon which collected the fenfrogs, but a platoon is nowhere near 1000, especially when that platoon is out of action for a week and are only collecting a few dozen frogs.
