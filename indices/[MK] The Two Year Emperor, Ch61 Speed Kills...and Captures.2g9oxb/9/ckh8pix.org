Speaking of Time Stop, how does it interact with readied actions? Let's say that Al readies an action to stab the next enemy that is within range, and Bob Timestops and grapple drags Al to a Golem, then past it in his two rounds that he's stopped for. Does the fact that readied actions are instant trump the fact that Time Stop is also instant?

Also two details: Your chapter name is missing a space, it's showing up as killsand (which is an awesome name for a magic item). And I'm fairly sure (but not 100%) that your grapple description is off by one. Person 0 gets grappled by 1234, but person 1 can only be grappled by 567. Person 8 joining in would mean that person 1 was grappling with five people at the same time, as grappling always mutual between the people.
