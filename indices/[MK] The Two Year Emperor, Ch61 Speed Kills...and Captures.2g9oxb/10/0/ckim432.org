Can't do. I don't own the copyright on the D&D stuff.

Now, if you want to kickstart something, I could do [[http://greendogpress.blogspot.com][One Hot Night]], which is canon in 2YE but does not use copyrighted material. Alternatively, I could write something new. I have a great idea for a collection of stories related to Albrecht's fight / the founding of Grofhamr after the drauga invasion. Plenty of awesome in there, I should think.

Interested?
