Rules nitpick - it doesn't make sense to say some of the Landguard are on the outer most layer or that one is in the center, since the rules they're exploiting to share the same space already nullifies any concept of them having a position relative to another. However, all ranged attacks target a random person in the grapple, so you have a solid statistical defense against someone being hit by more than one attack.

Even more nitpicky rules nitpick - Grappling is transitive (if you grapple someone, they are considered to be grappling you as well), so you can only have a fanout of three people grappling per "layer," not the four in your example. Person 0 grapples persons 1, 2, 3. Person 1 grapples person 0, 4, 5, 6. And so forth.
