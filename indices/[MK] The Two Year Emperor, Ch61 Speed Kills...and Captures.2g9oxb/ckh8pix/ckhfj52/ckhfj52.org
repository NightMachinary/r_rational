Time Stop wins over readied actions, unless the RA prevents the Time Stop. Examples:

Al readies action "stab first enemy that moves past me". Bob casts TS and moves past Al. Bob makes it through safely.

Al readies action "stab the next person who casts a spell." Bob casts TS, but is interrupted by having Al stab him in the face.

Bloody FFN ate the "..." from the title. I am currently driving between point A and point B, both of which are in the middle of bloody nowhere with no wifi. I had wifi for literally 3 minutes -- I had to beg it off a hotel reception clerk so that I could post, and I didn't notice until after I was gone (I'm on my phone now). I'll fix it later.

The relevant line is: "Up to four combatants can grapple a single opponent in a given round."

The limitation isn't about how many can /be in/ the grapple, it's about how many can grapple a given target. The description in text was correct.
