Yes, part of the armor's enchantment is that it weighs no more than normal clothes and has no armor check penalty.

The Mach 11 calculations were done before the AMF was applied. They are moving slower afterwards, but it didn't seem critical to mention since there's not a lot of practical difference between Mach 11 and Mach 8 or 9.

Apparently I was wrong about this lack of criticality. ;)

EDIT: Also, the Landguard canonically wear chainmail, which is Medium armor.
