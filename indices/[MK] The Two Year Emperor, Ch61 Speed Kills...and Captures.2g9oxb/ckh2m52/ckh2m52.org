Am I right to assume the multiple sonic booms are due to echos? After all, not each Mach has it's own sonic shock and the sonic boom is actually a continuous shockfront in the wake of the supersonic object.

I just thought of it, but shouldn't the commoner railgun produce sonic booms as well? After all, if the speed of the item handed over surpasses the speed of sound, it /is/ moving fast enough for a boom to occur. This is probably only an issue for railguns of sufficient length, though.

On another note, eaglejarl, you can put URLs into your profile without ffnet roflstomping them. Though I can see why you'd continue to put it into the chapters---the profile is another degree of separation, after all.
