No, because it's never actually moving at relativistic speeds...at least, not by the D&D rules. This is why the commoner railgun doesn't work -- it relies on playing by RAW while the item is being handed down the line, then suddenly playing by physics when the item leaves the hands of the last person in the line.

If you play by physics the whole time, then the commoners can't pass it down the line at speed. If you play b RAW the whole time, then the item doesn't leave the hands of the last person any faster than a normal throw.
