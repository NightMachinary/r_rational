Legend of the Galactic Heroes. A star spanning epic, loads and loads of characters, space opera at its best.

Hunter x Hunter. Real fun, specific power usage (choose your power, basically)

Ergo Proxy, Noein, Serial Experiment Lain, Evangelion, .//hack, etc

It's an infinite setting, since the genres are really diverse
