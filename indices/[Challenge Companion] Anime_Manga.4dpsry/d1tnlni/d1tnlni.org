Shameless self plug incoming: I'm writing a Shokugeki no Soma (Food Wars) fanfiction called [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11804422/1/Nisegami][Nisegami]]

It's not particularly rational, although it does take the main character and place him in a position to be more intelligent and strategic with his choices, as opposed to blindly shonen-esque.

Ok. Plug over. Code Geass features a fairly intelligent protagonist. At times, it can be a little too much (for example, there's a scene where said protagonist has a phone call with someone where he uses a recording. He's just able to predict exactly what the other guy was going to say days in advance. Pauses and all) but it's still enjoyable. Tbh, I don't really enjoy anime/Manga for their rationale elements (big surprise? :P) but for their other strengths such as romance, characterization, humor, etc. A particularly funny anime I've watched recently is called The Devil is a Part Timer. It's one of those that I'd almost say is better to watch English dubbed as opposed to subbed.
