Be careful: make sure to watch Fate/Zero first. The other installments in the Fate series should not be watched until you have watched it. Although Fate/Zero was in fact written after the other Fate stories, it has a different target audience. It's a prequel of Fate/Stay Night written under license by Gen Urobuchi, and takes place in the same canon. Instead of being targeted at young adults (particularly young men), F/Z's target audience is older readers. It deals with darker themes and puts more effort into making character interactions more realistic. It's also non-H. I will also say I find Urobochi's writing much nicer than Nasu's, even though Nasu is a master of worldbuilding.
