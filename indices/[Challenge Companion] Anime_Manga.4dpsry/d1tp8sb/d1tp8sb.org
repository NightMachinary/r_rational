Oh, we're allowed to post already-written content here?

This is NOT a Challenge competition entry.

I wrote a @50k word Kancolle x Worm crossover fic called [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/any-port-in-a-storm-kantai-collection-x-worm.19959/][Any Port in a Storm.]]

I only recently finished it, and resumed working on my half-finished Vlad Taltos x Worm crossover. One project at a time until my life is sufficiently non-complex that I can start editing Set in Stone again.
