I'm writing one of this for the challenge.

From the New World/Shinsekai Yori is my #1 favorite anime. a really nuanced and rich story. I recommend it to anyone on here without reservation, because the showmanship and execution is superb, and I think it easily fits the criteria of being rational fiction.

So far writing in that universe is pretty fun, especially since it's not something I have to 'rationalify'-- it's just a logical (to me) continuation from that point.
