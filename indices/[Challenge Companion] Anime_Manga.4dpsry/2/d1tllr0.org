It might be interesting to see a story about the one sane man (or woman) in the Saitama universe. Yes, One Punch Man is now an anime series.

Having the protagonist recognize that all the 'heroes' are loosely connected to reality at best, and try to figure out how to alternately avoid triggering or intentionally using their various insanities or quirks to make them take sane actions could be a good read.

Insert an OC, with rationality-based powers!
