Watch the Fate Zero Anime. It's 2 13-episode seasons, and I found it quite gripping after episode 3. They really assembled an all-star team for it. The animation, voice acting, score, and writing are all top-notch.

It's available on Crunchyroll, and in America it's also available on Netflix.

The Voice Acting in the english dub is also fine, though it's not as good as in the Japanese dub. If you're willing to read subtitles, I recommend sticking with the Japanese voice acting, but the english dub is acceptable.
