Are you talking about the 2006 series? That isn't recommended at all, it's a very bad adaptation of the original Visual Novel and the animation is very dated. The UBW movie is a bit better in the animation part, but it's even more of a butchered adaptation.

I didn't read the whole VN yet, but they say the best way is to read the whole VN then Fate/UBW and Fate/Zero. For anime only it's Zero > UBW > Wait for Heaven's Feel Movies.
