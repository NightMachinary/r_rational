This is true: F/Z spoils F/SN. However, I believe that F/SN also spoils F/Z. Since F/Z has a plot that I personally found more interesting, I was glad I watched it first. And yeah, if you're only gonna watch one, it should be F/Z.

When I was first was getting into the Fate Series, I asked my friend Derek who works at Crunchyroll which to watch first to avoid spoilers. He told me F/Z and F/SN both spoil each other, so I should watch F/Z first. Since either way one will be spoiled, it's better to get the full experience of F/Z, which is better written.
