I'd actually caution you to do the opposite as to what [[/u/blazinghand]] recommended; if you watch Fate/Zero first, it will spoil some of the plot twists of the original TV series, Fate/Stay Night.

Fate/Zero is better than Fate/Stay Night, but if you're going to watch the whole series, it would be better to go Fate/Stay Night --> Fate/Zero --> Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (movie or TV series; same material is covered, but the TV series is newer). Unlimited Blade Works is set in the same time period and location as Stay Night, but is much darker and revolves around the protagonist being closer to Rin Tohsaka than Saber.

That said, if time is a factor and you only want to watch the best, Fate/Zero is the winner. It is definitely enjoyable by itself, but if you watch Stay Night first it'll make a lot of things "click."
