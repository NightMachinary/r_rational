That's a big question (also fix your spelling, you cur!)

Ok so. Fate/stay night is the original visual novel that started it all. It has three routes, the Fate route, the Unlimited Blade Works route and the Heaven's Feel route. You can feel free to start there, if you like.

Fate/zero is a prequel story to Fate/Stay night and covers the Holy Grail war (that term will make more sense once you begin watching/reading) that happened 10 years before. It's not a visual novel, but it does have corresponding light novels and a completed anime. I highly recommend said anime.

There's also a Fate/Stay Night anime, that follows the first route primarily (the Fate route). There's also a Fate/Stay Night anime that follows the second route (The Unlimited Bladeworks route) People generally agree that the second is better than the first, considering it's released years after and has more fights+better animation. There's also an UBW movie that wil make no sense to you without context.

Those are the heavy hitters, although there's also a ton of other Fate media (collectively known under the Type-Moon name, or the Nasuverse if you like) such as PSP games, other visual novels, etc.

Have fun, go nuts and cry for Sakura-chan (you'll know it when you see it)
