Hmmm I'm trying to deconstruct a broad phenomena in anime/manga/porn in monster girls (yes I'm still doing that I've just pulled back and I'm doing a lot of structural work to get the character and plot rolling better then the more interactive version).

That seems like it would not QUITE qualify for this. If it does I could probably clean up my scripts, maybe slap some character illustrations or sketches on the google doc and get to chugging away at that as a kind of 2nd draft.

What say you [[/r/rational][r/rational]] ?
