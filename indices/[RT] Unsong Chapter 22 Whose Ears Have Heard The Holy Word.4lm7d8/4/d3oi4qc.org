The Other King sounds like a weird title to me. I don't even know. The antichrist or something? The personification of Death from Revelations?

The association that pushed me to the thought of Death for the title of Other King is of course T. S. Eliot's [[http://aduni.org/%7Eheather/occs/honors/Poem.htm][The Hollow Men]] - where there are repeated lines about 'death's *other king*dom':

#+begin_quote
  Those who have crossed\\
  With direct eyes, to death's other Kingdom
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  Is it like this\\
  In death's other kingdom
#+end_quote

Has anyone got any other references that The Other King might be from? I remember from Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell there are repeated references to Faerie as The Other Lands, and one specific part of the book said in particular:

#+begin_quote
  The other two were called "the King's Other Lands". One was part of Faerie and the other was commonly supposed to be a country on the far side of Hell, sometimes called "the Bitter Lands". The King's enemies said that he leased it from Lucifer.
#+end_quote

Which is of course highly relevant to Unsong's themes, but of course the book is fairly obscure, and the King in question is the Raven King rather than The Other King. Anyone got any thoughts on a possible origin for the Other King?
