It reminds me a little bit of /Fine Structure/ or /Ra/ (both by Sam Hughes). But with /Fine Structure/, that was because it had started as unrelated stories that were merged together into an uber-story. With /Unsong/, I get the feeling that it was unrelated story /ideas/ that got merged together ... which is fine, but it's a lot of threads to track over a fairly long period of reading time, and with every new digression I get more worried about whether the payoff is going to be worth it.
