I was going to write a comment with [[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-22-whose-ears-have-heard-the-holy-word/#comment-6084][a link to this comment]] and some general words of agreement with you, but I stepped back a little bit. Some off the cuff word counts:

- Book 1: 48666 words
- Book 1 Interludes: 10500 words
- Book 2 includinge Interlude: 26201 words

That's a total of 85367 words. That is about the length of /Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets/, so someone could fault Scott for not being more efficient in his world building. But I think that the serial format coupled with his unusual approach to introducing the world really is working against him.

Given the complexity of what he's doing, I think it's not actually all that bad in an absolute sense: we've got a distorted perspective on things because we're getting this in a drip feed. I'm sure if the releases were longer and more spaced out, there would be a larger perspective and some planning to make distinct chunks of narrative, to present them, resolve them, and present new narratives and things would be fine.

That said, perhaps the best thing to do is to just sit and wait a couple of months and see if reading it all in one sitting helps any.
