I've never found that it works.

For that strategy to make sense, what you really need is defined starting and stopping points that encompass a complete arc. However, if the pacing is off, that might not be possible, and if the author doesn't take the time to split things into arcs, or splits their arcs incorrectly, then you're left in the same position as before, with the only change being that you get your disappointment in lumps instead of spread out.
