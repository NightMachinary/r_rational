So I'm 50/50 between guessing that it is a trap (The Other King needs a crew with noble intentions to operate the boat), or that it is narrative logic at work. On a more meta-level, introducing narrative based reality manipulation (I'll just use the disc world term narrativium) would be a problem if this was trying to be a more serious story. Basically any bizarre chain of events necessary for a plot can be justified via narrativium, so the reader stops noticing if there is an actual logical reason for the events (another character manipulating things for example). As it is, this story is over the top enough that it can kind of get away with it. Has Scott Alexander put any clear limits on narrativium or the way coincidences drive everything? The world building has made it so that captain Nobody (Nemo) ending up on a significant boat isn't really that weird, thus if it was meant to imply something significant about Nemo or the way events come together I don't know what it is other than that it probably has a lot of puns.

Edit: Did a search of the usage of the word nobody... and this quote stuck out
