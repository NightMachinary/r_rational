I don't really agree with this recommendation. That is, I'm watching Re:Zero and enjoying it, but I don't think that you'll like it if you like rational fiction.

Yes, it's a deconstruction, but it's not a /rational/ deconstruction. The main character is a stock shonen protagonist who gets put into a world that's superficially similar to a fantasy adventure world ... but it's not a /deconstruction/ of a fantasy adventure world, it's just a darker version of a fantasy adventure world than it would first appear.

As far as the individual tropes go, it's not enough for them to be present, they have to actually be used in the correct way. I would expect wish-granting genies (or variants) to show up often in rational fiction, since they provide a nice parallel to some hard problems in AI, but if the wish-granting genie shows up and the protagonist wishes for something dumb and obvious, that's got basically nothing to do with rational fiction (other than that it's something rational fiction tries to avoid).

Subaru is basically everything that I hate about most shonen protagonists; he rushes into things without thinking them through and tries to win through pluck, determination, and yelling. Only in Re:Zero, there are problems where this approach doesn't work /and Subaru keeps trying it anyway./ Normally there's some leeway, since the stupid things protagonists do actually work out for them, but things rarely work out for Subaru /and he keeps trying the same things/. He's the worst.
