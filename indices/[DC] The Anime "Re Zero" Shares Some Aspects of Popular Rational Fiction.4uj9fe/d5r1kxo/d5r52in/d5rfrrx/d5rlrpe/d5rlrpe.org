To be fair, Subaru /did/ try the whole "sit down and talk like adults" thing in episode 16, and it completely backfired because he was using modern world morals with medieval-era politicians. It showed that you needed more than a calm voice and rational discussion to solve problems.

It was why he didn't even bother trying to tell Emilia about what would happen; he knew she wouldn't believe him or would try to stay and help. The moment in episode 17 where he started insulting and deriding himself was when he realized how hopeless his situation was.
