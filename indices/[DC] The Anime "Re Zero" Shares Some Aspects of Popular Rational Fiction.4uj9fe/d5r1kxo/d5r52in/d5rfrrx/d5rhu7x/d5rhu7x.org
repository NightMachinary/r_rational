Uh, "until and unless"? I'm not totally sure why you'd doubt this; isn't the narrative pretty obviously pointed in a direction where Subaru reaches some level of self-actualization? I haven't been spoiled either, but at some point, he'll have to stop pretending he's a manga/LN hero and start taking things seriously or the story will end with him just repeatedly dying like an idiot.

And sure, I imagine a hefty percentage of conflicts in fiction could be solved by better communication. It's just a boring solution; who wants to read about a bunch of responsible adults dealing with their problems responsibly? The problem is when the lack of communication feels contrived and unrealistic, none of which really applies here.

It's obviously not "rational fiction" or "rationalist fiction"; if that kind of thing is important to anyone, they should read /MoL/ instead, as it scratches the same sort of itches from that perspective. But it's been a fun ride so far, and even though it fails to live up to the artistic heights of the works that inspired it, I'm still enjoying it.
