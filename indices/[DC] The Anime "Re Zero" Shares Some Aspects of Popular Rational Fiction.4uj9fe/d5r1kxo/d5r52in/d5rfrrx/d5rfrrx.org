Yes, it's the point ... but that self-awareness doesn't save it until and unless he (at some point) becomes not the worst, which hasn't happened at the in-progress point of the anime. If you watch the anime now, you'll see a lot of conflicts that could be solved in two minutes of talking. (I have not yet been spoiled on what happens later on and in any case don't think that's a good argument for watching it now.)
