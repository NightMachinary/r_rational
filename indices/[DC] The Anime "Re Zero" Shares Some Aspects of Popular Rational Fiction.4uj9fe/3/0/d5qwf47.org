Technically I'm not sure that it counts as antimemetic. Like a meme an antimeme spreads, editing/deleting memories and thoughts instead of strengthening/creating them.

This seems more instantaneous; it's not clear that a vector is involved. Additionally, physical circumstances seem have retroactively changed to fit the absence of the deleted subject.

Better to describe it as a more consistent balefire from WoT in that memories are destroyed as well (except for the one exception for unknown reasons).
