  Like a meme an antimeme spreads
#+end_quote

The only sense of "antimeme" I know is from [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/qntm-s-author-page][qntm's stuff]] on SCP. There's a bit of leeway about antimemetic effects there, they don't all quite fit that.

Is your definition from somewhere else in particular?
