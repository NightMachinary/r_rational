Ok, that's fair. My take was that the central idea of qntm's antimemes was they are /preventing/ propagation of certain information or actively removing it, rather than propagating a disappearance of information. That is, they're agents that are aware of who has certain information. Memetic hazards propagate knowledge of themselves, but "propagating" non-knowledge didn't seem to make as much sense to me as a description - if only because it didn't adequately describe all of qntm's antimemes.

I haven't read the Re:Zero source material, only following the anime.
