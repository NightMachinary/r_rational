  He's defined as a neet and so far he hasn't displayed any understanding of gamer strategies (ex. On KonoSuba the protagonist decides that the first thing to do on an RPG is to check his inventory to see what tools he has to work with and go to the main guild to get acquainted and get a job), or try to explore and exploit the advantages a magical world provides over those of ours (ex. he doesn't try to learn more magic or study the culture of that specific world so that he can finally be useful and not mess up as badly).
