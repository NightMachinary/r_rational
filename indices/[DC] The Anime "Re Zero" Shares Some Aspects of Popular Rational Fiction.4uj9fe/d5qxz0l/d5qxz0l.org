I like the premise but I'm not sure it can be accounted as rational, maybe someone more knowledgeable on it can give better judgment.

Mainly on the way the protagonist doesn't try to make use of the knowledge he already has to build up strong strategies.

He's defined as a neet and so far he hasn't displayed any understanding of gamer strategies (ex. On KonoSuba the protagonist decides that the first thing to do on an RPG is to check his inventory to see what tools he has to work with and go to the main guild to get acquainted and get a job), or try to explore and exploit the advantages a magical world provides over those of ours (ex. he doesn't try to learn more magic or study the culture of that specific world so that he can finally be useful and not mess up as badly).

I think it fits more as a deconstruction of the "stuck in a fantasy world" themes and the plot is certainly entertaining (so far its the only one I'm following this season).

I like the idea of the [[#s][Re:Zero]] and currently I've been trying to think of a way he could reveal it without triggering it. I'm very tempted to make a fic based on this premise.

I've been recommending it on every Re:Zero discussion but if you haven't, check [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]], its almost the same premise as Re:Zero with a very rational protagonist and [[#s][Mother of Learning]].
