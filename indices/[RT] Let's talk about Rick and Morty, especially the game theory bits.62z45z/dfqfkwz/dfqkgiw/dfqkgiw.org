The fact that there are basically infinite copies of/variations on Rick, all of whom have access to any given dimension due to their portal tech, adds weight to the AI comparison. In that sense, Rick is already "out of the box" no matter what they do. Even if they killed "the Rickest Rick", there'd still be any number of slightly-less-Rickish-Ricks out there. The only thing protecting the GA from an endless game of whack-a-Rick was that the other Ricks apparently didn't feel they had an incentive to fuck with them.
