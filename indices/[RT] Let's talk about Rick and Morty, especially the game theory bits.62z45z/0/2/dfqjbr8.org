I agree with that premise but then sapient greed comes in. The only proven way to win the AI Box experiment is to not interact with the AI. However, with Rick, they needed transdimensional technology and tried to use him to get it.

Were they not paranoid enough? Absolutely. But I also think their mistake is understandable considering the circumstances. They had Rick strapped into a chair that was liquefying his brain at a steady rate, holding him unconscious *AND* he was strapped down in every way possible. I don't think they're smart enough to reasonably predict Rick's hacking attempt. If they were, they wouldn't need Rick, because they'd be just as smart as he was.
