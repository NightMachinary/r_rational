Kind of going to go off topic here, but I just wanted to say that the reason I think the galactic authority, and all of Rick's other enemies have so much trouble dealing with him, is because they insist on treating him like a really really smart guy, and not like what he really is: a rogue super intelligence.

Rick, at least from a scientific stand point, is leagues smarter than almost any other character in the show, barring other Ricks. He invented trans-dimensional travel on Earth, building off of only Earth science. That alone should qualify him as a genius the likes of which have never been seen before.

He may not be artificial, but honestly the Galactic Authority would have fared a lot better if they just treated him like a general Artificial Intelligence. For example, in the season three premiere, if they had treated holding Rick a lot less like keeping a prisoner, and a lot more like an AI Box experiment, I think Rick would have had a much harder time winning.

Any thoughts?
