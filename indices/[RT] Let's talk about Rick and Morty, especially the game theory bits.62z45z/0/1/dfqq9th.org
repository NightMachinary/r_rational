I think you're over-analyzing a bit. I mean, if we're taking the episode and what happens in it literally, then the guards executed code given to them by Rick with admin rights, their most wanted prison also has a central computer that controls the Federation's entire infrastructure with no passwords or checks, apparently you can transfer consciousness through a radio, etc. It's not like they failed because of a central flawed philosophy or anything like that. It's just Rick being the protagonist.
