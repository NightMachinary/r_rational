I was under the impression (though I may be wrong) that the code, simply by being transmitted up to them was executed, like it was a virus that took over the "transmit data from the memoryverse to the display screen" software. For example, something like a buffer overflow exploit followed by rewriting the software of the transfer thing. They didn't execute the code, the code was a basilisk to the computer that made it visible to them.
