I wouldn't say that's what I believe; I moreso wonder how much "right" creating something gives you over said thing. Right and wrong is arbitrary for the most part. There's no such thing as absolute right or wrong. So if you had to pick one to be the "most" right, it would make some sense that you'd pick the Creator's view on said thing, as he'd be the one with the highest claim to making up the rules.

That's just one way of looking at it though. At the end of the day, if I truly adhere to my belief that there's no such thing as absolute right or wrong, then it's all meaningless anyway.
