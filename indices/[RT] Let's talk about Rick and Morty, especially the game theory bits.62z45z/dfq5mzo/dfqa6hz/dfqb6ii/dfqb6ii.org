Yeah, I didn't really care about the moral implications of this, more the Sci-Fi and how the characters reacted. I mean, you could spend hours debating it, but in the end most Rick & Morty episodes have very little parallels with realistic ethics. I mean, most of the time the realistic solution would be "Stop associating with Rick, he's a horrible person and he keeps killing people".
