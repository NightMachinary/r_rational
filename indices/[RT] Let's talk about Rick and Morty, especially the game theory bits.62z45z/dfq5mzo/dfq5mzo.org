Yeah, the hostage situation was brilliant. The thing with Morty having a fake gun was kinda dumb though. Councilman!Rick could easily have double-tapped OneTrue!Rick without releasing Summer.

I think S2E6's most brilliant moment was when the guy went "This sounds like slavery... with extra... steps" then realized he was being an hypocrite, connected the dots and went n+1. It's especially great because we'd been shown earlier that Rick was completely blind to it.
