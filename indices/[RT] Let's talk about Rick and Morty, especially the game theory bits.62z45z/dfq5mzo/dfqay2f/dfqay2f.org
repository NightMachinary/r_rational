SPOILERS:

The fake gun thing may have been flawed from a rationalist standpoint, but I think it was important from a narrative standpoint. Since Morty never noticed the note on the gun, his actions reinforced that he's prone to impulsive violence when pissed off (as we initially discovered in the Purge episode), and I suspect that that's building up to something in a future episode.
