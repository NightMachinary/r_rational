*SPOILERS BE AHEAD!!!*

  Councilman!Rick could easily have double-tapped OneTrue!Rick

True but, as we can see, Rick's prone to gloating and smugness. This trait gets him into trouble a *lot* (I'm specifically thinking about the Morty Jr episode, when he and Summer are talking to the all female race) so OneTrue!Rick relied on this well known character flaw. He even set it up by clarifying the specification on the gun; he subtly implied that the gun Morty held would one shot him no matter what by making it clear the gun HE held would definitely one shot Summer and only injure Councilman!Rick. Rick sets himself up and it works because OT!Rick isn't a part of the Council; he hasn't been lulled into a weaker position of safety by being part of a community and his skills and instincts are sharper as a result. In the same way that any feral human would totally kick a standard modern human's ass (excepting modern tools obviously)
