I honestly don't think "stupidity" is the right word for it. Morty's demonstrated that he's capable of thinking on his feet and coming up with out-of-the-box solutions. We know he's not bright academically and that he lacks Rick's particular brand of "mad science" genius, but I think there's more to his violent tendencies than just "he's stupid," even if those impulses sometimes drive him to do stupid things.
