Also, something interesting I thought of when watching that episode. Technically speaking, Rick is their God. He's the guy that created them and they certainly wouldn't exist without him. So is he justified in using them as glorified slave labour? I suppose your answer to that would depend on where you fall on the debate about how much authority you have over an intelligent being as its creator.
