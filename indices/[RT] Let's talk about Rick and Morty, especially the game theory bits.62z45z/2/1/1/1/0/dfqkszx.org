I think concern with "absolute" right and wrong is kind of misguided. People say "the universe doesn't have morality", but WE are part of the universe, and we have morality. I believe that there are objective moral claims that can be made, so long as you have some common definitions. Morality is concerned with well-being, by definition. If you grant that much, you can make a lot of positive claims about what is implied and what moral rules might exist. A being doesn't have the right to harm others just by stint of being more powerful or older, which is what the Creator claim is based on.
