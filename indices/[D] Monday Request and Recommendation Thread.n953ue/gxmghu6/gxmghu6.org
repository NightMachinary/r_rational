I'm reading [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40290/demesne][/Demesne/]], and it's pretty good so far. It's about a group of people who set out to build a town in the middle of nowhere. It's not really kingdom building, more like homesteading. But in a magical land with monsters and where the land around you is poisonous.

The MC is a magician who leads the group by virtue of being the only one who can "purify" the land and keep everyone from dying. I'm pretty sure she has antisocial personality disorder (i.e. she's a sociopath). She's not evil or killing people left and right, but she does lack empathy and has a pretty weak conscience. She's helped by Rian (Ryan) a guy who got isekaied and ends up her second in command. The story isn't about him, he just provides help and advice to show up the MC's shortcomings.

The world is pretty neat. It's filled with monsters, but not the "really fast with lots of fangs" type. More like exposure to magic over time causes mutations, so you end up with plants with teeth or animals with three limbs and two necks but one head.

The writing is well done. No spelling/grammar mistakes that I can recall.

If you like people building stuff with magic, I'd recommend this story.
