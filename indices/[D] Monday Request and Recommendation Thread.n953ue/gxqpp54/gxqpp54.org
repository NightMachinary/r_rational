If you are at all into Interactive Fiction (think "Zork") but haven't done it in a while, check out [[https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=aearuuxv83plclpl][Counterfeit Monkey]]. You are on Atlantis and have linguistic magic. You can remove a letter from words to transmogrify them (ie, turn a clamp into a clam) and later can do more complex manipulations. Honestly that's one of the greatest rational magic systems I've encountered -- a simple rule that you can exploit. ([[https://taogaming.wordpress.com/2021/05/07/counterfeit-monkey/][My full review]]).
