[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12716789/1/An-Early-Return][An Early Return]], in which Luke and Mara Jade...go back in time? Somehow? and try to run the Rebellion on a different path. Unfinished and probably dead, but I quite enjoyed it. Good flavor and plotting, but I'm not sure it explores the Force as much as you might like.
