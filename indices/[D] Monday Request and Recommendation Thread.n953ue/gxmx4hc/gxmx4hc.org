Just got done rewatching the Star Wars prequels.

It made me realize how much I hate Jedi and how their philosophy makes no sense.

Any recommendations for rationalist or adjacent Star Wars fanfics? Ideally something that explores Potentium, or where characters take the approach of exploring the limits of the Force, sorcery traditions, etc.
