I think you might like [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/star-wars-a-penumbral-path.60200/][Star Wars: The Penumbral Path]]. It takes place a few years before the clone wars, and follows some original characters - two trainee jedi who are taken as padawans by two very unorthodox masters.

So far the story has delved pretty deeply into jedi philosophy and why it may or may not be correct, as well as a little bit into other force-sorcery traditions. It has a fairly interesting and reasonable take on the dark side, too.

The two masters - one of them once a padawan of the other - are very unusual, and at odds with the jedi order, but still very much consider themselves jedi. They're both interesting characters with very differing approaches to most aspects of the jedi.

It's one of my favorite fics I've read recently, it /really/ nails the feeling of a journey.
