hot take: i've decided i don't particularly care for Unsong (I am 85% of the way through by my Kindle's reckoning). My husband loves it so we've had a discussion. Seems to boil down to:

- while I find the kabbalistic puns interesting/clever they don't carry the day for me (they are by far my husband's favourite element, whereas I was sick of the biblical whale puns like one page in)

- the characters aren't interesting to me (most interesting are Uriel and the comet king's wife, who seems to be a very minor character, and Sohu)

- a lot of characters are broadly similar and hard to distinguish (e.g. Ana and Erica, yes I know the difference, but I forget who is doing what - like who is with Booyum, who is on the ship, etc, especially with the time skips, I thought Erica at Booyum was a flashback of Ana's life for longer than I should have)

- the fact it jumps across time a LOT makes it hard to follow things

- all the little factions aren't easy for me to follow or integrate together: I don't really care about booyum and i don't get how placebomancy comes into it (are booyum placebomancers? they're not are they? they just have placebomancers?), the drug king seems like a whole thing, the other king is maybe the same as the drug king, the /Not a Metaphor/ was interesting but felt ultimately pointless, all the American politics stuff doesn't seem to tie in

- i don't find myself rooting for anything/anyone. a lot of stuff is happening but i don't particularly care about it.

- the premise of "turns out religion is true and the world is cracking" is really, really cool, but I don't care for which parts of it are being explored. maybe i should look into fanfic of it?

- my religious background growing up was catholic and I consider myself well-versed in catholic lore, which is obviously not as intense as jewish lore

The point of this post is not "ELI5" all the elements I've no doubt misunderstood, it's more, "If you didn't like unsong, you're not alone", and maybe if there's some element of its awesomeness that I've overlooked then let me know.

FWIW I will of course be finishing it. I don't know if there's a twist at the end that makes everything make sense or something like that, but my opinion on that sort of thing is that books with twists at the end have to be enjoyable all the way through because one mind-blowing twist doesn't make up for hours of mediocre story.
