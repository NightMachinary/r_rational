I recently read Double Fold, which a long nonfiction book about the history of microfilm within US library systems (heard about it from a friend who heard about from the SSC book review contest).

It's not an unbiased book; it's angry and very against the proliferation of microfilm as a substitute for storing old newspapers and other documents. I'm looking for more books written in the same style: nonfiction, extremely polemical, biased, or opinionated, /but only about extremely niche, ultraspecific issues that very few people actually care about/. I want "old man yells at cloud" energy.

I'm also looking for reading lists of good nonfiction in general, preferably ones that offer summaries/reviews of the works being recommended. I like Gwern's list of books, so anyone with anything like that would be fantastic.
