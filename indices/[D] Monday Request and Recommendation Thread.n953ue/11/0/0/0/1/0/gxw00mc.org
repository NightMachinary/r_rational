My main point was mostly talking about why high specificity is rarely seen, because that's interesting to me, and that imho looking for stories that have that trait is akin to looking for 'bad' stories from amateur writers.

Who often write mundane, plotless, follow along stories with glacial pacing.

Now I can see that what you want is not necessarily meaningless information, but rather a well thought out power / magic system. I agree with you, those are desirable and a sign of good writing.
