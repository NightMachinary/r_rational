The way the system (and the resulting metagame) is set up in the world depicted, people become superpowered in a small set of activities; a specific set of activities forms an implicit class; societally defined occupations/classes are restricted (in the particular empire the main character's in right now) to specific builds. Seems pretty interesting.
