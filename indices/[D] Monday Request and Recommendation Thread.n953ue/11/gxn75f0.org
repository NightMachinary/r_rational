I've been really enjoying [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42202/the-way-ahead][The Way Ahead]], I think the system in this story is one of the closest to being rational in the whole LitRPG genre next to The Daily Grind even if a lot of people (not me) seem to dislike the narrative style. I'm looking for either completed or ongoing (no hiatus or dropped pls) stories with similar systems, I don't mind if they are published or web novels but the longer the better. and assume I already know anything commonly recommended here or listed in top web fiction.
