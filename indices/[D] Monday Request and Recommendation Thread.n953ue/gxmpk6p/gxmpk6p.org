I just finished reading Kazuo Ishiguro's /The Remains of the Day/ a few hours ago. It's the story of an aged butler at a high manor in the mid-1900s taking a vacation for a week while his employer is away, and him reminiscing over his life so far.

I really enjoyed it. There's no real plot to speak of, but the main character is fairly intelligent and spends quite a bit of time thinking about ideas like "dignity" and our place in the world, which was handled fairly well in my view. It was shorter than I expected, so if you're looking for something comfortable or wistful to read, I recommend this highly.
