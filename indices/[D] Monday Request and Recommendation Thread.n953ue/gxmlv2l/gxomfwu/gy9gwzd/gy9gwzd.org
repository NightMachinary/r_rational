  Harry Potter fic that asks "what is the entire rest of the planet doing while Voldemort is rampaging around Britain?"

Do you actually happen to know any fics like that? The closest thing I can think of is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick series]], which takes place in the United States, around ten years after Voldemort's second fall. Iirc, the effects in Britain had major geopolitical effects that were felt even in the States, and the story's overarching conflict has to do with dealing with those aftereffects.

I actually didn't end up following the Alexandra Quick series after book 1, but I'd be interested in learning of anything similar.
