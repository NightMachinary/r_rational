Another second for this one, great story.

Catsy is still active in the story thread on SpaceBattles with a post as recent as last week and has confirmed that the fic isn't dead. He'll post smaller updates of the chapter in progress there as well, though nothing has been posted for a while and I normally like just waiting until the full chapter is done.
