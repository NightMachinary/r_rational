[[https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bacon-novum-organum][Novum Organum]] by Francis Bacon is an interesting read. Bacon is sometimes called the father of empiricism and wrote Novum Organum in 1620 to introduce learning through observation, and as a rejection of the idea that philosophers like Plato and Aristotle were always right and their knowledge could never be surpassed by modern societies.

It is the opposite of biased really, since if anything it is polemical against biases in particular. I wouldn't call it niche exactly, but not many people read about the origins of scientific thought.
