Have you read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984][To The Stars]]? It's a far-future transhumanist Madoka fanfic where magical girls are enlisted to fight aliens on an interstellar scale. It's pretty long and I'm a big fan. You don't necessarily have to have watched Madoka first but honestly you should anyway, it's great and (without spoiling anything) very much not a conventional magical girl show.
