I see! There is also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5579457/1/NGE-Nobody-Dies][NGE: Nobody dies]] which I haven't read but is quite popular, so presumably good. And [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6807420/1/NGE-Nobody-Dies-The-Trials-of-Kirima-Harasami][NGE: Nobody dies: The trials of Kirima Harasami]] which I /have/ read and which is very entertaining.
