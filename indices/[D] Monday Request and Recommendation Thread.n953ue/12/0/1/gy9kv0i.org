Prior Note: I haven't watched DxD and only had vague knowledge of it previously. It was understandable what was happening though. This is obviously mild spoilers.\\
I didn't /dislike/ this, but it felt like the story was spiraling towards the end. The main character early on is rather capable and dedicated (though focusing seemingly entirely on martial ability rather than knowledge, aka no making explosives at the home), and takes the chances they're given to uncover magical knowledge. At first the descriptions of the World Script are interesting, but as the story progresses its essentially a "main character spends several hours, and then they do whatever they want". We hear some hints early on of others using it, but no one except a single ally (Pua; Ignoring the ending stuff of first book, but that's essentially outside of focus and affect on story) bothers learning it. None of the enemies do, despite the extreme capabilities it brings. Sure, she's a very dedicated person, but she is also human. Seeing some of the higher-tier beings even think about using it would be interesting. It essentially feels like a cheat ability.\\
More egregious is the main character getting even worse at planning as the story progresses.\\
Another aspect is that it.. doesn't really give much character to everyone else. Obviously spoilery examples: Early on, MC is justifiably annoyed + wary of whatever-his-name-is main-character of DxD. Author notes that they plan on making him not entirely stupid. That never really happens, and he serves purely as a person to insult whenever he appears. There was an opportunity for some actual interaction with him being trained by MC, but that got skipped.; Rias is mostly there to be 'what the hell are you doing', but does have more (existing?) characterization than DxD-MC. This gets tedious after a bit.; Sota seems to be almost entirely there as a love interest? Like, she enjoys chess, and something about being romanced by whoever beats her in chess.; Pua was more interesting than others, but still felt kinda flat in that all she does is really help main character and a few bits about protecting her village.; Sarah has a good chunk of time early on, but mainly serves as that normal person she knows. There was some potentially actually interesting interaction between the MC's murderous attitude and Sarah's more moral perspective, but its just ignored as they drift apart.\\
Despite this negative review, I didn't dislike the story. The problems with it are: not really rational; bad characterization; MC is lauded for planning ability but she jumps into things without planning more and more as the story goes on; and cheat powers that should have been picked up by some remotely interested supernatural at least five centuries ago. I probably won't be reading too much of the second book, but that's more of not really liking Naruto than thinking the story isn't worth reading. I just wish the story managed to be more than what it is, because it could be excellent.
