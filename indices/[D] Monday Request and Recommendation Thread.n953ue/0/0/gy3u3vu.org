I really enjoyed this rec (and previously enjoyed /The Martian/).

It's been a long time since I've read 'optimistic' sci-fi where humanity bands together and pursues a single titanic goal. /Project Hail Mary/ really scratched that itch for me.

The numerous mini-crises + problem solving sessions were well executed, although they did feel a little repetitive after a while. "Oh, things are going so well right now, I guess it's time for something else to go wrong in 3... 2... there we go." This formulaic approach might have been exacerbated by the fact that I read the book in a single sitting because it was nevertheless a gripping read.

All in all, two thumbs up, very enjoyable.
