the problem with most litRPG's is that their systems assign meaningless numbers to things like strength, dexterity, or hp and then fail to accurately depict what that means or keep things consistent. in the way ahead there are no levels, the system is based on skills and achievements. your class is not an archetype of abilities you can get but a system label for the sum of your skills and paths. or in the daily grind, upgrades are not something like +1 agility but +14m/s^2 to acceleration, and we get to see a more accurate depiction of what that would do. and spoiling a bit of what happens further into the story when the second dungeon does give things like +1 accuracy, we see how that vagueness results in an overall improvement to everything related to the concept of accuracy. In any case, I don't think any of these systems are rational but they take a more rational approach to describing what a character can do.
