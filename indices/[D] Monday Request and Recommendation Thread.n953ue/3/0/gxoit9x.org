Actually, while magic causes mutations it's canon that the biosphere is absolutely not the one we're familiar with. Those mutations were caused by a dragon storm, which basically randomly transmutes everything. Rian is also only being heavily teased as an isekai, though from a lot of examples, such as knowing what bacteria are but not the common name for them, it's pretty obvious what his deal is.

I'll also second that the magic system is interesting and limited, with lots of it not yet revealed.
