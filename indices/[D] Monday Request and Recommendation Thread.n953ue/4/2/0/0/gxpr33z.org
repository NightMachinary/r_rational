Immortal objects exist as a constant reminder that the world's physics are ultimately game code no matter how many layers the players build upon them. It's also a dark joke about how the players themselves are very much /not/ immortal. And a major plot point is that weird maybe-NPC tempting players with true immortality.

Other titles could work of course, I just found that term particularly striking.
