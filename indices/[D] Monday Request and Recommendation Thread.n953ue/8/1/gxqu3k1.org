I feel your critiques are pretty fair. What I loved about Unsong was the unique world, the weird and quirky alt-history, and the witty dialogue between Urial and Sohu and others.

Unfortunately the plot splinters into 5 different povs across 50 years, and the pacing is just abysmally slow. I too pretty much lost interest in the characters, as no one really has much agency and seems to just move from scenario to scenario. The ending is okay but really the whole thing should be reworked to be viably read as a novel.
