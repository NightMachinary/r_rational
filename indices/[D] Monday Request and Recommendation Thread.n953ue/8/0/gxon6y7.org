I don't expect the ending to revise your opinion of the whole thing.

I did think the ending was well executed, but then I enjoyed the moment-to-moment experience of reading the whole thing (puns, weird references, interludes completely derailing the main thread, etc.). Part of this may have been due to reading as it released, as there were mysteries that really didn't get addressed until weeks or months of meatspace time. These also drove a lot of theorization and discussion on SSC, which was fun to watch.
