I mostly disagree with the characterization of Unsong as a "mystery box", at least in the sense that, say, [[https://qntm.org/mystery][qntm uses the phrase "mystery box" when describing various Star Wars films]]. In Unsong, the central mysteries and uncertainties of the plot are in fact /resolved/, and the mysteries' solutions were baked into the plot from the beginning with foreshadowing and authorial intent, not a result of haphazard flailing. It has a bunch of /mysteries/, but pretty much every mystery of importance gets a solution by the end of the book that seems pretty satisfactory to me - a "mystery box" work and "the story has mysteries" are very much /not/ the same thing.

(On another note I actually love flashbacks and nonlinear storytelling in general as a method, when used well - e.g. my single favourite of Iain Banks' Culture books was Use of Weapons, in no small part because of the brilliant structure of the book. This is not a disagreement about facts, though, so much as a disagreement of taste, and de gustibus non est disputandum).
