Answering point by point, below. Given the details of the story being discussed, please be warned that both the points and my comments are very spoilery.

That said,

  Why did the noble girl not go to help fight the undead with her childhood friend? All for a pretty face?
#+end_quote

To maintain her cover. She was attempting to get a scion from a very shady noble house to court her at the time. This came out in-story, perhaps after the point [[/u/WISHFULFILLMENTSUCKS]] (user name checks out) stopped reading.

  Why in the world is the nobles in the world not increasing their ranks with money? Someone should at least comment on why not every noble student with old money has not done so already.

The fortune in points the MC obtains is enough to get him from Rank 3 to Rank 5, at which point, it's spent. Wealthy people do, in fact, spend their points like this, but the cost quickly becomes restrictive. Also, training up skill ranks is enormously important, and generally best done while increasing class rank by defeating monsters or completing quests. Harold's life is apparently under constant threat, so he has opted to rank up immediately to improve his chances.

The protagonist's attitude toward nobility isn't very respectful, and it absolutely comes back to bite him. The entire reason he's an Ascended is his justifiable contempt for others who think they're his betters enraging him to the point where he punched a godstone. Being spiteful toward his betters when they give him attitude isn't rational, and certainly is self-sabotaging. At the same time, I suspect the reason his goddess has been so kind to him is that she wants him to humble those who have it coming.
