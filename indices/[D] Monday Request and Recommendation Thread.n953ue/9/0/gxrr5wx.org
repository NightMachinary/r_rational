Some parts of Hexcaller does not make sense. When the undead attacked the MC decided not to go because he was untrained and he won't be that much useful which was smart. However, He then convinced a noble girl not to go to when she even said she has a lightbringer class and can help out in range. The author made the noble agree to his sensibilities because the author made it seem like she's a weak beginner too. But then some chapters later the noble girl was apparently a badass that can fight of assassins and the like? Why did the noble girl not go to help fight the undead with her childhood friend? All for a pretty face?

Also this novel is blatant wish fulfillment. Not going to delve deep into that too much you got what you paid for.However, some worldbuilding does not make sense. Apparently you can buy ranks by buying essence with money. There is this one character that is your typical arrogant rich noble who lost a bet to the MC and apparently lost a fortune worth of contribution points because of that bet. Why in the world is the nobles in the world not increasing their ranks with money? Someone should at least comment on why not every noble student with old money has not done so already.

I kind of got baited by the reviews in royalroad which stated the MC knows what it's like to be an outcast so he goes out of his way to make everyone included and befriends the lonely. We have that sort of but from what I seen so far the MC does so only after his god gives him a quest to help the misfortunate. I never seen him do so with his own volition. I am probably nitpicking and you can construe that it's the same thing with the same results but the intention matters. Magnanimous hero or opportunist? Is he helping the misfortunate only for the quest rewards or he's helping because he wants to because he knows what it's like to be an ugly outcast? Why not both...? Lol, again I am nitpicking. I guess I am tryjng to find a reason to hate the MC because of the so much blatant wish fulfillment. I mean he even tried to weasly marry a noble damsel just to be protected by other noble families going after him! This wouldn't be a problem in the first place if you followed society and still have your peasant sensibilities to know to treat nobles with respect. I never seen the MC demure or give face to a noble once even though he is a peasant. I guess he's ascendant now so he's no longer a peasant and apart of the high society but the author doesn't even mention the class dichotomy of his word building and makes us the readers go confused and assume the cliche.

All in all it's a good popcorn read if your into wish fulfillment and turn your brain off but I dropped it around chapter 30 due to the inconsistencies.
