I read it because of your rec and it was great. It's cool that he replies to emails. He lampshaded a bunch of stuff to justify the probabilities but it's obviously for the sake of the story.

Only two minor mistakes I spotted:

The spaceship atmo was 40%, they gave him 1 Oxygen and 29 Ammonia, that means that it's not 29 Atmospheres it's more like 12, or the alien should've gave him way more
