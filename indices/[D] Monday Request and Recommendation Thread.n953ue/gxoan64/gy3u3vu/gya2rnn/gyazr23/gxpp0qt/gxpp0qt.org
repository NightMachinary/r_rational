How would you rate it in comparison to /The Martian/ and /Artemis/?

Edit: I listened to it as an audiobook and enjoyed it greatly. Excellent book, with only minor quibbles I could list if pressed. I particularly liked the "suspension of disbelief" element (astrophage) as it is easy to understand and works well.
