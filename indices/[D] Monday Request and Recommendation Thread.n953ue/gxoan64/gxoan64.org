I picked up Andy Weir's new book /Project Hail Mary/ over the weekend and tore through it in 2 days. It's an awesome book of the stay-up-til-3am, laugh-out-loud, miss-the-characters-afterward variety. While there are a few elements that strain belief, they're easy to accept for the sake of the narrative; Weir loves exploring edge cases of technology & engineering, so I'm willing to give him a pass or two to get where he wants to go. Highly recommended, so much fun.
