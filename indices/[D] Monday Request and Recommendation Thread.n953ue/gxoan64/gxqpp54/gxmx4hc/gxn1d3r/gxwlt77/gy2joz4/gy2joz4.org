Not a fic, but you may be interested in Noah Caldwell-Gervais' recent video on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI2iOB8ydGo][Knights of the Old Republic & Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]] (other people are recommending playing the latter, so maybe give that one a shot first if you're worried about spoilers).

Yes, it's a video essay - don't go! hear me out! - but it's treated like an /actual/ essay, with a thesis, proper structure, etc., as opposed to the usual four hour behemoths that manage to ramble over every aspect of something without going into depth on any of it.

The structural focus is about Joseph Campbell's 'Hero's Journey', and the how each game engages with its use in the Star Wars franchise/universe: the first straight on, and the second aggressively subverting it. *Why am I recommending it to you here?* It turns out that basically *everything* weird about the force and Jedi are the way they are because Lucas basically *directly adapted Campbell's weird-ass book* and all the spiritual frameworks for what the hero must do into aspects of the Force and Jedi. Jedi can't fuck? Campbell. The demand that you utterly annihilate your ego? Campbell. Jedi masters somehow surpassing all good, evil, and lesser mortal concerns in their unity with the universal will? You'd better believe that's Campbell. /The Hero With a Thousand Faces/ can basically be read like a foundational religious text for the Jedi.

Really eye-opening for me, highly recommended, listen to the first 10 minutes and if you fw it, put it on in the background like a podcast or something.
