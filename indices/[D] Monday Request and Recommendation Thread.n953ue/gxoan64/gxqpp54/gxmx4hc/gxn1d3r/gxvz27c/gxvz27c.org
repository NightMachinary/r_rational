Thanks a lot for the recommendations.

I'm fascinated by A Voice Across the Void. I felt both dread and amazement.

Reading it feels like seeing many trains going off the rails. Some crash with each other, some fall down, others manage to find their intended destination faster. One exploded, and this is good because baby Hitler was on it.

Very appropriately, it feels like watching the start of events that have been foreseen by a master mind. A pity it's not any longer.
