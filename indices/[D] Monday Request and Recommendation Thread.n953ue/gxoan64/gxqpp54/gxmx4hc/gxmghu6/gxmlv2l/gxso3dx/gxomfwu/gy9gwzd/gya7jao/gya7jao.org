I also read the first AQ book and never got around to the others.

It was harder than I expected to dig these up, but here's a few that I think fit. They tended towards canon divergence rather than AQ's canon avoidance.

- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][Arithmancer series]] seems to expand out from hogwarts after the first book. Haven't finished it though.
- [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12306845/1/The-Mountains-of-the-Moon][Mountains of the moon]], in which Harry transfers to a wizarding school in Uganda. Haven't read this but quite like the author.
- in general crack fic seems more willing to fly off the the canon settings
- there was something I read but can't find in which a retired Auror from Australia is an important character
