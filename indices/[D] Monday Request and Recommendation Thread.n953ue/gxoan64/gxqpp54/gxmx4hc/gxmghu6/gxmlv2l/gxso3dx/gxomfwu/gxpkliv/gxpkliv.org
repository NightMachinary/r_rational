Seconding /Fairy Dance of Death/.

It's a slow burn (and I've actually dropped it for now until more chapters have accumulated). Characters are mostly reasonable people interacting with complex game mechanics. Because it's a /large/ amount of people who all got thrown into the game at the same time, and because the game was designed around factions to begin with, some of the discoveries alter the whole social dynamics instead of just one character's personal munchkinry. That's an under-explored area in litRPG IME. Game theory is a bitch.

It's a shame this fic has a kind of awkward title, when /Immortal Object/ was right there.
