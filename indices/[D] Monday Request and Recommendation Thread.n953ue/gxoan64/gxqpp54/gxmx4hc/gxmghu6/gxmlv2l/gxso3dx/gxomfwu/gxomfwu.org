Seconding this for those who don't mind an unfinished fic.

It's the kind of fanfic that leans hard on worldbuilding the parts that were window dressing in canon. Like Naruto fic that asks "what the hell is a jutsu anyway," or Harry Potter fic that asks "what is the entire rest of the planet doing while Voldemort is rampaging around Britain?" In this case, it does double duty by presenting ideas that would be /incredibly cool/ in a game. This is probably a little trite to say on this subreddit, but the magic system really stands out, and gave me ideas for my own ongoing project.

The drama comes from the politics and interpersonal clashes as well as the mechanics of the game in a way that's much more satisfying than canon.

Also, Man in the Middle is both complete and much shorter than Fairy Dance, so if you're looking to try the author's style, start there.
