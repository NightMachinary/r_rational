the thing is that I do enjoy litrpgs in general. for example, I like the Azarinth healer just fine even though the system is absolutely meaningless and the story, in general, is at best a popcorn read. but I do enjoy better thought-out systems more and that's why I ask if someone knows any more that fit my criteria. Hell, I'm not even asking that they be as specific as the daily grind's, the system from the way ahead goes the completely opposite direction, I just ask for systems that actually succeed at depicting something consistently. so no offense, but going if you don't like them don't read them is not a useful answer.
