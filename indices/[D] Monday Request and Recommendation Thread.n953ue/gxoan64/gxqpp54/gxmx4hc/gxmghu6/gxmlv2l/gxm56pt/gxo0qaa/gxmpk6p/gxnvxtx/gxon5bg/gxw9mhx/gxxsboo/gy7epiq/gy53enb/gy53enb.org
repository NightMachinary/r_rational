Only two of these has a litRPG element but if you can overlook that then --

- [[http://crystal.raelifin.com/][Crystal Society]] Follows an AI, Face, (whose Purpose is to "understand and gain the adoration of all humans") housed in a single body with multiple other AI each having their own purpose. The book did a very good job at depicting the AIs, Face in particular (she is the MC after all). It dips a bit in the second half but it's pretty good overall. The book is the first of a larger series but I haven't read the sequels: one, because I... kinda forgot it existed, and two, because the sequels don't hold up that well apparently.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40888/the-great-cores-paradox][The Great Core's Paradox]] Description and the first chapter should give you an idea of what to expect. We are 254 pages in and not much of significant note has happened yet though the writing flows well and it feels much shorter than that as a result. The POV of a dungeon minion who regards its creator as more akin to God and sometimes has faith problems is also rather interesting to read. My only complaint is how our snek seems to live through situations when the writing makes it seem like it should be dead on its tails. They can be rationalised somewhat but yeah.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion][Super Minion]] Shapeshifting bioweapon gains unintentioned sapience and escapes into the wider world which apparently has superheroes. And supervillains. The story isn't a pit of despair and tension like /Worm/ but it's no lighthearted romp either. The writing is a bit bland but the memorable characters, especially the MC, make up for it. A warning though, author updates irregularly and the story has been on hiatus for the last few months.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests][Everbody Loves Large Chests]] Completed litRPG story following a mimic who becomes much, /much/ more over the course of the story. Read at least until the start of the elven city arc and maybe a few afterwards. It slowly becomes more of the same except on a few occasions.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/][The Last Angel]] Multi-POV, sci-fi space opera mixing horror with epicness. Characters consist of one very angry AI, a bunch of humans and one alien, who has been exacting retribution (more like bloodying their nose) on a theological space empire who nearly wiped out humanity --- her creator --- a few centuries ago. Very atmospheric with top-notch writing. Red One, the AI, just has that slight touch of inhumanness and madness that really sold me on her as a non-human lead.

*Edit:* Right, forgot these two.

- [[https://zalbert.net/octo/][OCTO]] Hard sci-fi xenofiction with horror elements. I won't say more except it has been recommended here a few times before and in one thread dealing with Outside Context Problems which is how I found it. It follows the alien for the first half but then shifts POV, so there's that.
- I'd be remiss if I didn't mention [[https://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm][Blindsight]] by Peter Watts. (The whole book is free!) While it doesn't follow an in-human lead, it does deal with first contact with aliens that are truly aliens. And it has vampires; biologically explained ones. Now, who doesn't love those?

I extent recommendations for the next two a bit hesitantly since I personally enjoy them and don't know how well they would hold up to scrutiny, but here they are --

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33295/summon-imp][Summon Imp!]] Journey of a demon (current young) that gets summoned to other worlds, each running on its own rules, and gets PTSD from being killed repeatedly. Well, the last one is not entirely accurate but yes, it's a thing and that makes me happy. The beginning is rough since the author wanted to show us baby MC but it gets better. The worldbuilding, especially in regards to summoning mechanics, raises a lot of questions that I hope get answered beyond 'lol magic' (there hasn't been any yet and I hope that continues). Anyhow, writing is rough around the edges but the story has a lot of potential. This story has also not been updated for a month due to the author's medical issues.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/12557/outlands][Outlands]] Wonderful writing, amazing atmosphere, characterisation that can leave a bit wanting, and plot that stumbles here and there but I very much enjoyed it overall. Story is complete.

I would also de-rec /Shade Touched/ since there was not one chapter where I felt that MC was a peculiarly smart beast rather than a normal human with heightened curiosity, and maybe empathy, stuffed inside of an animals body. MC whining about that every same observation multiple times helped endear her to me even less.
