The problem with that amount of specificity is similar to the reasons authors don't generally give the reader specific amounts of money a character has, or makes an entirely new language to use for character dialogue.

​

While moderately interesting to a few people at the end of the day it doesn't actually matter and the amount of effort required to do so is too high for the minimal benefits.

In my view you'd just avoid litrpgs, and system based stories if you don't like how systems are portrayed in them. There are millions of books out there, and just as many if not more webnovels around. If you're planning on writing a system based story, want more inspiration or is doing research sure. Otherwise just avoid things you don't particularly like, there are more things for you to read out there that you'll like than you'll ever be able to read.
