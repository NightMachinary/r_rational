It's not technically fanfiction because the original work doesn't exist, but you might still enjoy [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21107/isekai-speedrun][Isekai Speedrun]]: the protagonist glitches themself into a VR game with a grimdark setting and a fraught development history, and has to use their detailed knowledge of the game from speedrunning it in order to survive and try to achieve an otherwise-impossible happy ending.
