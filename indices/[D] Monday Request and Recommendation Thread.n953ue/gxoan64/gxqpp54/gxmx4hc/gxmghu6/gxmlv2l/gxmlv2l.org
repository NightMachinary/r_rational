I have been reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2393225/][Fairy Dance of Death]] [warning: incomplete] by [[http://ayashi.net/sao/][Catsy]]. It's a very good Sword Art Online fanfic, an epic from multiple character points of view, narrating the story of several fantasy states and their diplomacy and wars. I found it in [[/r/HPMOR][r/HPMOR]]'s recommendation thread.

The characters are trapped in a game where you die for real, but this time the creator was obsessed with Norse mythology instead of swords, and created the game of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81lfheimr][Alfheim]] Online. The players choose one of [[http://pm1.narvii.com/6023/acff8330b15ad004cf6297c1d85e6837f19e47b0_00.jpg][six fairy factions]], which each have their own territory, capital city and monthly-elected faction leader. The race that manages to clear the World Tree, Yggdrasil, can choose two allied races who all obtain the power of unlimited flight, and can thus escape the world.

As whenever you [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MBpj3QKfPg9xKNeXW/the-robbers-cave-experiment][divide humans into clearly delimited groups]], the relationships between factions quickly devolve into xenophobia and war. It (doesn't) help that only the first race to arrive at the tree is guaranteed an escape from the death game, so there is further pressure driving the factions apart.

I don't want to say too much, lest I spoil it. It's very long and well-written, and has been in the works for 9 years now. The last update is from January 2020, though, just before the whole COVID thing. I hope the author is OK and merely has moved on from writing it. Much less important, the desire to know what comes next has prompted me to write this review, and ask if someone knows whether the author will write more?

Another one of Catsy's SAO fanfics that I really enjoyed is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9303028/1/Man-in-the-Middle][Man in the Middle]], which I found in [[/r/rational][r/rational]] a few years ago. It's a story about the world outside the game, and how they deal with the fact that players are trapped within.
