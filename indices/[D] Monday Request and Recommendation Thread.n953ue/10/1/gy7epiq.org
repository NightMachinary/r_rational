My absolute favorite monster MC and one of my more favorite litrpgs is the Japanese light novel series So I'm a Spider, So What? The MC is very personable and quite competent despite being silly at times, which is real nice compared to all the stupid decisions and casual nature(despite the supposed life or death situations) a lot of other series has. She has to eat disgusting monsters and even her siblings, and you can really see her struggle, growth, and the danger of the situations. There's a lot to her character, especially as she changes throughout the story and through certain changes and events, like her torturous training to grind up her abilities, how she accepts and views killing, and even her interactions, or lack of social skills, and how she has to justify to herself about caring for others.

And it has one of my favorite litrpg Systems. It's nothing unique or mindblowing, but the way it's integrated to the story and universe is really well done, because it's there for an important reason. It plays into the mystery real well, with a lot of the more mysterious skills like n % I = W or Taboo having meaning and being teased throughout the volumes. It's by far my favorite monster MC and isekai series. There's also an anime of it currently airing, but it doesn't really do the serious story or litrpg elements justice, and uh, the animation isn't the best. Decent though.
