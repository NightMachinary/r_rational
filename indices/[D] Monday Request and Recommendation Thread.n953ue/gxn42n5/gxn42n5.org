I'm looking for Self Insert fan fiction that has the Protagonist munchkin the world they find themselves in. I'm looking for stories that make sense in the context of the original fiction, but the MC takes advantage of their foreknowledge or out of setting info to achieve their goals rather than some random power-up.

Any setting is appreciated.
