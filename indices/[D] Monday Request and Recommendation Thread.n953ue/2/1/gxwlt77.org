  I hate Jedi and how their philosophy makes no sense.

You're supposed to hate the Jedi. The Star Wars prequels make the most sense as a story the failure of a liberal democracy to effectively combat the rise of fascism. [[http://prequelsredeemed.blogspot.com/p/prequels-table-of-contents.html][Here's a nice blog series on this theme.]] You might get more out of them from that viewpoint.

(None of this invalidates the stuff you're looking for in your rec though; that stuff still sounds cool.)
