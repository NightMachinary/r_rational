  He's sulking because his favourite person killed someone and tricked him.

I don't see it. It's not like he has the option of telling Quirrel "sorry, I've something better to do". For one thing, he doesn't have anything better to do, it's not like he currently has some research project going on that can eliminate death (the stone might be the nearest thing to that). For another thing, there is a good chance that Quirrel would just kill, imperius, memory-charm or tortue him.

For another thing, Harry really thinks that he might have the power to reshape the universe so drastically that no one will die anymore, and he thinks Quirrel might be as or more powerful and ambitious as himself and that Quirrel is Evil.
