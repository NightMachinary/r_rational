Greek mythology isn't real in canon, there is no Hades. Magical creatures in HP are generally portrayed as the inspiration for various mythologies and legends. Hagrid says in canon he bought Fluffy from a "Greek chappie," which would make him (or more likely, his species) the inspiration for Cerberus instead of the genuine article.
