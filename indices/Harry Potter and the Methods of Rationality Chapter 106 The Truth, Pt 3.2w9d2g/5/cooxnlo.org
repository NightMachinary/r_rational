I'm afraid I am going to have to call shenanigans on this one. That isn't just a three-headed dog, and every reader knows it. That's Cerberus. Hades' own sweet pet.

You do not kill the dog of Death; it's the kind of thing where even if it's technically possible, it doesn't get you anywhere you want to go. Even /Hercules/ didn't kill Cerberus, just wrestled it into submission, and monster-killing was his stock in trade.

I get that this is not a setting where Hades is going to show up and interfere in the story, but still.../Cerberus/, man. If any magical creature has contractual immunity to death, it's that one.
