Yes. One might also want to make people exercise more and eat healthy food, distribute some mosquito nets, cure aging, popularise cryonics, create FAI and many, many other things. Sadly, one does not have the time to do all of them at once, and is forced to choose. If you actually want to win a war against death, you do not waste your time on tin-pot dictators.
