So ... what was the point of setting all this stuff up as a run up to the Mirror of Erised, from Dumbledore's perspective?

That Voldemort was able to disarm the traps over a period of months in such a way that this disarming went completely unnoticed by Dumbledore, Snape, and presumably Moody is ... not /unbelievable/ but certainly seems to be going without much comment in the text itself beyond "Oh yeah, I totally just disarmed all of it".

But with that said, what possible plan has Dumbledore set in motion which explains his actions?
