You will need to be very careful. Protagonist-killing tends to make readers annoyed.

  Plan to start the second part revealing how the antagonist played the protagonist since the beginning and how it was working on a whole other level the protagonist couldn't even fathom against even stronger adversaries.

I'm looking at your wording, and it seems as if you are considering a three-tier scenario. Protagonist, Standard Antagonist, and Anathema Antagonist.

If the plan is to have the original antagonist be a hidden protagonist, I can see some possibilities.

If you are going to kill off the initial protagonist and switch the initial antagonist into a protagonist role, I suggest you do it with a very powerful knockout scene at the end of a book. I cannot think of any books where this has been done, though I'm sure there have been some.

  Also, would a work still be classified as rational if the protagonist isn't at the beginning but slowly develops into one?

I hope so. That's what I'm trying to do with Set In Stone.
