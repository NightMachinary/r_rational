You can get away with anything if you write well enough. There is no convention that you cannot break if you break it with due deliberation.

So to know whether it's okay to kill a protagonist mid-stream and switch to his mentor figure, you need to know why the convention exists in the first place. Part of it is pattern-matching; it's pleasing to look at a story that's the same as other stories, because we can recognize the ebb and flow of the narrative as familiar.

More importantly, it's easier to develop a character if you're focusing on them, and it's easier to get the audience to feel some sympathy towards them. If there's just one person, it's fairly easy to make them proactive, competent, etc., since they don't need to share screen time with other people who are /also/ showing their proactivity, competence, etc.

Preparing for the switch is easy enough; you just have to make the antagonist/mentor figure likable enough to the audience, enough to counter what he's going to do to the protagonist. You also need to make sure that the "turn" is handled well enough so that it appears that the trajectory the protagonist was on is complete (or so that the actual trajectory -- the one that leads to his death -- is obvious in retrospect through foreshadowing). You also need to make the betrayal either sympathetic, competent, proactive, or all three, in order to enhance the enjoyment of the twist.
