I see, thanks a lot for the replies!

And yeah it's more or less what I intend. For the protagonist to become more rational but keep one major flaw that it isn't willing to change which the antagonist exploits to win.

At the end to be offered the chance of overcoming it to at least end with a tie but finding it's not willing to go change that and die.
