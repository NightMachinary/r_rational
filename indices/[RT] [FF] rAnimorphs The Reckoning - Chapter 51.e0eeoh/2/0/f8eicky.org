This is A+ rationality/munchkining, but note that it assumes that there's no localization at all to the morph control signals.

We've seen some instances of Z-space stuff that /is/ location-independent (discussion of the quantum virus), but we've also seen some instances of Z-space stuff that /isn't/ location-independent (Helium thinking in the previous chapter that if V3 is controlling doombots outside the Earth system, he needs previously-unheard-of technology).

It's a shame they haven't at least /checked,/ though.
