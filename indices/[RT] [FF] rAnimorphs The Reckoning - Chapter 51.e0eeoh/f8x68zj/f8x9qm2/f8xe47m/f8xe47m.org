Endorsed; the key differences from canon are:

1) you can acquire from someone who's morphed (i.e. You Don't All Have To Touch The Fucking Tiger)

2) when you stay past the time limit, the "real you" out in Z-space vanishes, and all that's left is the morphed body

So if somebody stays past the limit while morphed into a copy of you, poof---you now have a copy of you.

  Presumably the Yeerk tissue automatically reverts to controlling when not being explicitly made to give the controlled being autonomy?

Yes. Or not even "controlling" so much as it's just there, in the way, not letting any signals through.

  If the kandrona deprivation hypothesis is correct than any human morphs acquired post-modification won't have the tissue degrade and thus won't leave the coma naturally.
#+end_quote

This is a good catch, but it's not true, actually; the morphing tech artificial Yeerk-flesh doesn't actually have a fully functioning metabolism, so it'll still die even though there's Kandrona available. It's got enough to function for a few hours, and then that's it. That's not information that has been clarified in the text.
