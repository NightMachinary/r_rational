More like a soft limit than a hard one, because we're still talking biology and it's not super consistent, but yes---they were excited about a Yeerk being able to stay in morph for days'n'days and actually it wouldn't have worked out that well.

Two constraints are involved. The first is the power needed to maintain a pocket dimension, and that almost always masks the second, which is the longevity of the biological machine here in realspace. But if you remove the first constraint you'll hit the second.
