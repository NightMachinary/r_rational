Q2- The clone cannot naturally morph. Marco was able to grant morphing power to his clones while they were still in a coma with the Escafil device. His process was as follows:

1. Get consent from a cancer patient. Grant the cancer patient morphing power with the device
2. Have them morph into him. Wait for the pocket dimension collapse. He now has a clone of himself in a coma.
3. Grant the coma clone morphing power with the device.
4. Eventually the clone wakes up and is now a fully autonomous morph-capable Marco-clone.

I do wonder what happens if he tries to do step 3 before step 2. Probably just fails to grant the power, but if nested morphing works then who knows.
