I think that was mentioned for Jake's clone source, so it makes sense that Marco did that for everyone.

I wonder if any of the cancer patients just flew away? They won't last forever, but they can just cycle between morphs and only spend a few minutes per day in their original body (sleeping sucks though, they'd need to wake up every hour or so to remorph)

I suppose the cancer patients don't know that (and the ones who would think of it wouldn't be selected by Marco anyway) but it still seems like quite the risk. They'd just be more recruits that way I guess so no big deal I suppose.
