This explanation implies a few things I didn't catch (or at least didn't remember). 1:Morphers can acquire genetic information from someone who is in morph. Alice' acquires Alice from Bob (who has morphed).

2:After the Yeerk tissue is removed, morph armor is able to morph again after waking up from the coma.

Q2:does this require exposure to the Escafil device again?

3:The yeerk tissue is physically inside a person wearing morph armor. I thought that was just a metaphor.

4:Jake morphed into a physical copy of himself, without injuries /or the memories since his last backup/.

This means that Marco's clones were people that were exposed to the escafil device, morphed into Marco, waited for the time limit to expire, and then later emerged from a coma.

The constraint is that the Cube had to be present for each new Marco, right?
