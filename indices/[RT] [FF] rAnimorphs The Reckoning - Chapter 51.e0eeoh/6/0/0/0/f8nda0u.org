Elfangor wasn't a major player in that war (I don't know if I'll be able to make the timeline clearer on that; there are reasons not to derail the story too far into historical events). He was there briefly, on a special mission unrelated to the main campaign, and also just flew straight to the canyon. And by the time his mission concluded, the biowarfare had started to create casualties.

But yeah, in the worlds where he was a part of the campaign long-term, he would have thought of it.
