My intention was that it was a combination of the following:

- Better morphs, indeed including the bat, which I wanted to showcase as the "keystone" of a strategy, since we don't have the storyline from canon where the bat is how they get into a high-tech facility to steal the Chee chip. Things would have gone much worse without the bat.

- Different morphing /philosophy./ Note that the Andalites have only had morphing power for a couple more years than the humans, and also use it much less centrally; to them, it's mostly something used for infiltration and espionage rather than for overpowering the enemy. It would not occur to many non-Alloran Andalites, for instance, to even /try/ working their way up the chain, acquiring larger and larger monsters one by one. A squad of Andalites would be much more likely to go forward in their own bodies, attempting to simply shoot down the monsters, until eventually they made so much noise that they attracted a critical mass and were slaughtered. They also would have been less likely to have the key insight that Marco had, to weaponize the acquiring trance; note that the Animorphs were on track to /lose/ that first big battle until the two human Marcos made the sacrifice play.

- Less intervention from the Arn. Though it's not explicitly written out in this book, the Arn here have the same sort of pseudo-control over the monsters that they had in canon; once it becomes clear that people are trying to breach the mist, the Arn crank up surveillance and orchestration of the monsters, making them more like a police force and less like a random murdercloud. In this case, there's no current active large-scale conflict, so the Arn aren't watching closely, and the Animorphs weren't making a ton of noise/disturbance, so they didn't get noticed.

Note also that the Animorphs had penetrating the mist as a /specific goal/. During the Yeerk/Andalite war, the primary valued territory was the treetop villages (and eventually, at the very end, the canyon walls). That makes it worthwhile to /try/ sneaking through the mist, along the lines of "if we can approach unnoticed, that'll give us an edge in this battle." But once you discover that there is an extremely high cost to trying to sneak through the mist, and once your first, second, and third attempts to do it differently have all met with disaster, it's reasonable for many generals to just shrug and say "that's not really part of the map of this conflict; There Be Dragons." If neither side seems to be attempting to exploit the mist territory, then there's no arms-race pressure to be the group that figures it out. Again, Alloran and similar other 99th-percentile military minds (Marco, Ender Wiggin) would've probably kept at it anyway, expecting the payoff to be worth the investment in the end, but in this case Alloran (as Esplin's slave) was on the side that was already winning, and so didn't bother.
