  I do wonder what happens if he tries to do step 3 before step 2. Probably just fails to grant the power, but if nested morphing works then who knows.

My theory is that this is possible, but if your morph body A tried to morph into body B: Body A could no longer receive signals from your real body in stasis, and body B would just be in a coma for the duration. And then you'll die without being able to bring your real body out of stasis.
