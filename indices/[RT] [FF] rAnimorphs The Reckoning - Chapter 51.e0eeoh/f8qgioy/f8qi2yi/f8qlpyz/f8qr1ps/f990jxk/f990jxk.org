It's weird that there seems to be such variation in what is effectively identical bodies. I think you need a mechanism for that. There is just no reason that two Marcos should not take exactly the same amount of time to wake up, or just both die if they're going to.

If it's an immune process, they have nearly identical immune systems. The yeerk harness should be more or less identical, and they're physically very close if not identical. I just find it weird.
