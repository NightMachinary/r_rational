I don't think so?

1. Alice plans on flying down. Morphs into Alice->Bat.
2. Bob acquires Bob->Alice->Bat.
3. Alice flies down.
4. Bob morphs into Bob->Alice->Bat, checks for twitching.

If Alice is moving then Bob twitches, but Alice is not affected by this in any way. This does only check for the existence of Alice->Bat, if Alice morphs something else it won't do anything.
