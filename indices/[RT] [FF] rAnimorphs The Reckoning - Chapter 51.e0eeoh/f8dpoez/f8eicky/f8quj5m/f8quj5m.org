I was really surprised they didn't think of this, because they used the shared gorilla morph; which means they had to specifically plan around the interference in their morphing strategy.

I didn't get this part. Are the Marcos experimenting with the morph-altering technique Cassie discovered to make gorillas with super gorilla levels of size and strength, or is Marco just commenting on regular gorilla outrageous massitude?

What happens if you go partway into morph armor, stop before your brain copies over, and wait out the time limit? Is it possible to end up alive and "trapped" in a partial morph, and could that be a way to heal your natural body?

Another thing I've been wondering about since the canon books, is how powerful is the acquiring trance? If a monster's about to eat you, can you hold out your hands, focus on acquiring it, and have a chance to survive by putting it into trance the moment its teeth touch your skin? If someone like Cassie were infested with a hostile Yeerk, could she rebel Mr.-and-Mrs.-Chapman-in-book-2 style, take control of the morphing power just long enough to start acquiring the Yeerk in her head, and then use the (couple? few? many?) seconds the trance lingers after to go into morph armor, focusing on her brain first, and morph out from under the Yeerk?

(Not the morph armor part obviously, but 10 year old me was straight-up /angry/ that Jake didn't start acquiring the Yeerk in book 6 the second it touched his ear.)

I gotta figure out what I did with my list of r!Animorphs theories and questions I started making this time last year. This revival is seriously gonna be hard to beat as far as Christmas presents go this year.
