You guys have maybe convinced me to be ashamed that *I* didn't think of it, and to have them come up with it in future chapters and also kick themselves for not thinking of it sooner. :P

It's literally a meme, of the sort you'd find on imgur or [[/r/teenagers][r/teenagers]]; I'm outing Marco as a /memester./ None of them as-yet have the faculty with morph alteration that Cassie exhibited; she was somewhat genetically lucky as well as having an unusually good experience set (just as none of them can quiiiiite morph-scream as good as Garrett).

  What happens if you go partway into morph armor, stop before your brain copies over, and wait out the time limit? Is it possible to end up alive and "trapped" in a partial morph, and could that be a way to heal your natural body?

It all depends on which parts of you are gone; remember that morphing is only partially controllable through deliberate effort.

If you're going into your morph armor, you have the benefit of not having to deal with autoimmune rejection, which is good. But there's also the fact that your veins and arteries and capillaries and organ boundary membranes and so forth won't necessarily be exactly lined up; the morphing tech does some handwaving with force fields and nanotech to keep you alive and not in screaming pain while everything swaps out, but if you just stop halfway and wait for the battery to run out I suspect you'd have Problems.

The acquiring trance is a little more powerful in my canon than in the original books, where it didn't happen 100% of the time; in my version of things, Seerow put it in as an /absolutely necessary/ subtool for acquiring hostile animals, not to mention that it has the side effect of making scanning easier (since things are moving slower/less). It's enough to force docility and lethargy; not enough to force unconsciousness. If you've ever seen a Corgi or some other small dog just go oof after you put a thundershirt on them, that's about the level of it. Anything full-on attacking you will stop, but you won't necessarily take all of the strength out of a jaw chomp; the jaws will probably still close around you and if the monster is big enough you're still in a pretty tight situation at that point.

The problem with trying to morph out from under a Yeerk is that the morphing tech wouldn't leave it behind; you probably /could/ seize control long enough to start morphing, but you'd be sending both your own brain /and/ the controlling Yeerk into Z-space, and the emulator tech would spin up a copy of you-and-Yeerk, not just-you. I don't think you could focus subtly enough/specifically enough/give the right set of commands for it to disentangle the Yeerk from your brain physiology, especially in the middle of a mental struggle. The tech /can/ do things that subtle, but it can't do /anything/ that subtle; it's like a Mac, or a well-trained machine learning algorithm.

+1 to things-would've-gone-better if Jake had acquired Temrash the second it touched his ear in canon.
