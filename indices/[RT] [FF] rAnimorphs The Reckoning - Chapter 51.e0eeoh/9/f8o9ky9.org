  Because---I dunno---if it happened, the ur-Marco would still exist, or something? Like, I'd only be losing half of what people usually lose, when they die. I'd be losing the first-person experience, the chance to live the life myself.

Hmmm, I can't really agree with this on an instinctual level. To me the "first-person experience" is all there is to life. A lot of people seem to consider that to leave behind a legacy is to continue to exist in some abstract sense. Am I in the minority to feel that this isn't true? It's pretty interesting, quite a bit of fiction like Westworld and Soma deal with this as well.
