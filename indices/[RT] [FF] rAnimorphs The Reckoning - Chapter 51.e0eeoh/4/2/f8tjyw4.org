Elfangor was able to say the words "Crayak" and "Ellimist" when they morphed him because, as a morph, his Andalite brain was joined with Yeerk tissue. That is or has something to do with the special Andalite-Yeerk superbond the avatar confirmed, and it has to do at least partly with being able to access knowledge that E and C have hidden.

The Yeerk-Andalite superbond is part of the next stage of the game, which is why certain thoughts and ideas are locked off from both species until after they've joined together. One of the things at stake in this stage is whether that bond will be dominated by a single United Visser 3 mind controlling millions of bodies, or a Harmony of Helium-like cooperating systems.
