Wonder if this is worth a try:

1) Morph yeerk coelescion

2) Split into shards

3) Each shard gets morphing power from iscafil device and acquires members of the team Solution: Morph clones without need for sacrificing terminal patients

Would Yeerk be necessary or can it be substituted with any animal that reproduces via binary fission like starfish, flatworm or earthworm?
