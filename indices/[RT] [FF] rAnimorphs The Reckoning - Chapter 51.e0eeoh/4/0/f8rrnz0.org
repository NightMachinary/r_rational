Tobias and Terra will figure out how to munchkin the morphing power to grow Terra extremely quickly. If it's less concerned about this:

#+begin_quote
  “---one who has become both twice as angry and twice as patient is not in any sense the same, and the nature of Yeerks is such that twice the flesh is twice the personality.”
#+end_quote

than V3 is, Terra can have small sacrificial shards acquire and morph the entire coalescion, doubling the amount of co-operation and empathy Yeerk flesh available as often as it wants. The resistance could kidnap and acquire Silat hosts by being sneaky, replace their Yeerks with Terra shards, and slowly contaminate Silat with the true meaning of friendship.

Even better, one sacrificial shard of Terra could acquire the coalescion and infiltrate Silat. As soon as it hits the pool, it starts morphing into Terra, focusing on taking Silat into the morph with it. Any shards of Silat that went into the pool to investigate anything would be replaced by Terra Collaborator shards, and they would all come out reporting nothing unusual.

If the anti-morphing ray is a concern, they could take advantage of the fact that Yeerk shards are the only sentients small enough to have a morph time long enough for their construct bodies to gain and use the morphing power. Nest 160 tardigrade morphs inside each other, so that the average ~45 seconds it takes for each nested morph to emerge and start demorphing gets them through two hours in the anti-morph field without being discovered. Nested inside the 160th tardigrade morph is a full-sized, morph-capable Terra coalescion, broken into however many nested morphs are needed to get the right time limit.
