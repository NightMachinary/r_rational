  How the hell did Hedwig-Marco acquire that thing? Is it because of bats and humans are to small for it to even notice them?

Yeah. He landed on it, chilled out for a while, nothing happened. Demorphed halfway, to see if the increased weight would catch its attention; nothing happened. Plenty of spines to grab onto, so he wouldn't get rolled around. Eventually demorphed all the way, quickly acquired it, remorphed and GTFO'd.
