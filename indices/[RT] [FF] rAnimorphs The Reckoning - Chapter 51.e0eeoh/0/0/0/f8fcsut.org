#+begin_quote
  FWIW, my own interpretation as the author is that Jake is straight;
#+end_quote

Oh, I see; that's what I /thought/, but in this chapter some of the stuff seemed to subtly but explicitly confirm that he was bi. For example:

#+begin_quote
  “Yeah,” he said.  “It's just---first time.  You know.  Since Cassie.”

  I just barely managed to catch the question before it left my lips, stopped the words from becoming real at the last possible second.

  /Both, obviously/.
#+end_quote

I took Jake's line to mean that he was open to relationships with guys, just that he hadn't been thinking about relationships for a while. And I took Marco's "both, obviously" as him answering an implied question in his head - that Jake is into /both/ genders, and Marco is just now seeing the signs. I was kind of surprised you would actually do that, given that in previous comments sections you said you wouldn't go further in that direction, but I guess these lines meant something else after all?
