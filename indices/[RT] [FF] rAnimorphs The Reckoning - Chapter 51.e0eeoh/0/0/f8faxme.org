  as this has given them many powerful morphs they wouldn't have gotten otherwise
#+end_quote

One of the things I always hated about the /Sario Rip/ books is that they never let the Animorphs /keep/ the stuff they acquired during the trips. This will not be the case in r!Animorphs---Marco now just straight-up /has/ a Tarmogoyf morph.

  this chapter gave me plenty of setpieces and creature design to work with, let me tell you.

<3 <3 <3 I also think pretty visually/cinematically while writing, and was glad to hear that I was able to transmit some of that.

  Is there any other fiction out there that comes close to this level of weirdness?
#+end_quote

Also <3. Although my /true/ hope is that I can sneak in all of the weirdness without anyone really noticing until it's too late, and then you're trying to describe it to your friend as if it's all very sensible and consequential and obvious and they're just looking at you like *??????*

  I think this might be realistic even if Jake were straight - and not bisexual as he's implied to be here - I have a vague notion that throughout history there were times and cultures where men were much more open about expressing affection for one another. It's just a human thing.
#+end_quote

FWIW, my own interpretation as the author is that Jake is straight; we saw him being similarly accepting and affectionate when he realized Marco was in love with him on the mesa.

But also, I don't currently intend to confirm in-text the sexuality of any characters besides Rachel and Marco, in part because I want to leave readers to be able to make generous interpretations such as the one above. I don't think bisexual Jake is /incompatible/ with the story as written, and I'm going to try to keep it that way.
