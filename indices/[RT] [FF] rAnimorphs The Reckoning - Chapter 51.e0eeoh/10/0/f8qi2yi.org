Garrett told Tom where the cube was, and Tom picked it up, fairly promptly after the disaster.

Tom was looking for a safe place to stay with a wounded Ax and a comatose Tobias body (after Garrett stayed in morph).

Tobias woke up (naturally) and they decided to find volunteers to resurrect Marco, Jake, Rachel, and Garrett.

Marco was the first of the resurrected to wake up, and almost immediately began sneaking off with the cube to make clones. It was something he'd already considered even before the disaster, but once the line had already been crossed, he had basically no compunctions.

So the time in which clones were being made:

- Before the Jake-waking-up chapter
- During the Tobias chapter
- In the gap between the Tobias chapter and the Ax-waking-up chapter

... which is a span of something like 4-6 weeks; I don't have the timeline notes right in front of me. Enough time for him to make about 30 clones and for about a third of those to wake up.

(Remember that he can try convincing people in batches, i.e. an entire Hospice home at once.)
