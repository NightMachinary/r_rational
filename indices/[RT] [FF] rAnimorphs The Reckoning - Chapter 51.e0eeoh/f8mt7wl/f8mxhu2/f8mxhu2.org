Second: Kudos on using the Tarmogoyf as one of the scariest monsters in the Arn death forest. I thought it seemed out of place, but it makes sense after more reflection.

Despite playing a lot of Magic, especially Modern (and thus facing a lot of Tarmogoyfs), I never did register how large a 'goyf could be. One part of this is the [[https://external-preview.redd.it/Is_J4AfnLYwrt3Rvix3raQTkeFwFmZ03W52JY2Cbxeg.jpg?auto=webp&s=0ef45241cffe429055136cf2e36ad2f2e596b559][Future Sight art]], which makes it look much smaller than the [[https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/wallpaper/wallpaper-week-tarmogoyf-2013-06-19][Modern Masters's art]], which your 'goyf is based on.

But it makes sense, a Goyf can easily be a 6/7 in normal game play, and maxes out as a 8/9. Dragons are 5/5-7/7s, and the larger Dinosaurs are in the same range as well. From DnD and the like, dragons could easily be 25+ meters long, as are the largest dionsaurs in reality. So a monster able to win against a dragon or dinosaur through sheer brute force could easily be larger than 25 meters. The Modern Masters art makes the 'goyf look about 30-40 meters long, based on the deer. Godzilla was 50 meters tall in the original 1954 film, so a 30-40 meter long 'goyf could easily "might have a chance vs Godzilla".

Interesting, this iteration of the 'goyf was designed primarily by Ryan Berger (the artist commissioned to do the reprint Art) and not the Magic team. Here's the art description, which is vague as to the actual look of the 'goyf:

#+begin_quote
  Color: Green creature

  Location: Ancient coniferous forest, touches of snow

  Action: We see a huge pile of debris atop a hill in the forest---rich loam, broken and rusted armor pieces, and countless bones amid the black dirt. From the debris heap bursts a massive monster that feeds on death. It's yours to design, but it should have a grey-brown hide maybe mottled with green or beige, an enormous set of jaws, and huge hands that can scoop up chunks of food, living or dead.

  Focus: The ancient and terrible creature

  Mood: A devouring monstrosity

Given where they are though, it's a pity that this morph is vulnerable to being [[https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/562e2633e4b0b7066d01cbfa/1484058141496-7GJVABYY8EDF6J6UATSI/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kMzSg5MPsPopGNhO9hESjlcUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcWyJxmU_NBNSu0D06g18vUH1lc4wneOYq5_T5VkXXL3eToKGEASmf0sT4Mx9X1mef/400294-Fatal+Push.jpg?format=750w][pushed off a cliff]]. ;)
