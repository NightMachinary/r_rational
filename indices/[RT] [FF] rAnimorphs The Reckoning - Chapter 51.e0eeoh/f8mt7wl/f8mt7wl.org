As promised, a longer review. Spoilers, of course.

First: I was surprised at how much progress they were able to make, when the Andalites (with much better weapons and more experienced morphers) and Yeerks (better weapons + ability to directly mind control large beasts) never made much progress into the mist. Conditional on them making it to the bottom, here are several rationalizations/explanations/possibilities, from least speculative to most:

- Better morphs, in particular the bat morph. Earth's higher biodiversity might lead to faster/smaller/stronger morphs than what the Andalites have access to. Ax stated previously that the Tardigrade and mite morphs used by the animorphs are probably smaller than anything Andalites have morphed. In this case, the /kafit/ bird was stated by Helium to be less impressive than Earth avians. It's most likely way less impressive than the bat morph used by Marco/Jake, and probably lacks echolocation (another important factor in their success). In fact, Marco 2^{27} notices that the bat morph is faster than anything in the forest. The fact that they can use the bat morph to sneak up on beasts, demorph, and acquire probably explains a lot of their success (it let them acquire both the 'goyf and the Allosaurus.) *Cons*: That being said, it's unlikely that the gorilla morphs used for combat are more impressive than the combat morphs available to the Andalites, let alone Andalite military hardware. The Andalites probably had some way of seeing through the mist using sound as well. This combined with the fact that the animorphs could acquire the Churner /without/ really using the maneuverability of the bat morph suggests that this can't be the only explanation.

- Overt divine intervention. That is, Crayak or Ellimist are intervening directly in the mist to allow them to survive. For example, they were lucky to encounter the Churner first, before the Tarmogoyf, Scorpion, or Allosaurus. It's possible that the Andalite teams immediately encountered a 'goyf or similarly fearsome creature, and got TPK'ed before "leveling up". Marco 2^{27} acquiring the 'goyf morph can be thought of a combination of divine intervention (by encountering it) and better morphs (my guess is that the bat was small enough to escape the 'goyf's attention and allow Marco to land on its back, demorph, and acquire it). *Cons*: Divine intervention explains everything sufficiently unlikely, and still leaves the question of how /exactly/ the two gods intervened.

- Better combat doctrine. Perhaps by relying primarily on morphs instead of weapons, the Animorphs didn't draw as much attention as the Andalites/Yeerks did. In addition, I could see the Andalites favoring primarily frontal attacks, or Andalite military doctrine preventing suicide acquires. *Cons*: still, Andalites are a militaristic species, and had many more attempts to try to breach the mist. Even if the animorphs lucked into better tactics than the Andalites' first attempts, surely the Andalites would've eventually figured it out?

- Andalite plague. The Arn developed a plague that wiped out half the Andalite fleet in the system. In the worst case, it might prevent Andalites from going through the forest at all. In the best case, it still greatly reduces their interest in going through the mist, as opposed to killing the Yeerk fleet and glassing the Arn civilization. *Cons*: Helium was able to be in Andalite form without obvious ill effects, so the disease is likely not present in the forest at this moment. That being said, I think a lack of interest in talking to the Arn (as opposed to killing all of them) may explain why the Andalites haven't been trying to breach the forest very hard.
