(Not theorizing, but- This whole bit with Marco having made duplicates of himself and having a protocol for working with himself is great, and seeing the bright clear line speech made me grin.)

Alright, here's a theoretical thought; If the animorphs know the Arn are genius bioengineers, and also know they keep morphs they acquire here (or at least, have no reason to think they won't) then the most important thing for them to do is to acquire an Arn and make it back to earth. Depending on how much intervention from on high is going on and how much the Arn rely on infrastructure they couldn't build themselves, that could be the most important thing they do here.

Imagine being able to custom build morphs. The Arn can do big and stompy, could they do a full out Godzilla? The goal of the mists means they focus on the obviously scary, but could they do a bat but with cockroach survival and black mamba venom? That's just playing around with chimera, can they make a controller-sniffing dog or something that could handle hard vacuum? Can we go full Yuuzhan Vong, and then morph the results? The main limitation on a morpher is what morphs they have available, which means bioengineering has the potential to get gamebreaking.

Heck, we've already mentioned the intelligence explosion and different aliens being smarter than other aliens. The solution to the alignment problem is right here- have an Arn (or yourself, in an Arn morph) bioengineer something that is to Andalites as Andalites are to Gedd, keep it unconscious, acquire it, morph it, use that to design the next iteration. It seems like the Yeerk control mechanism can work on something smarter than you are (unless Yeerks are smarter than Andalites) so you have all the upsides of that brilliant mind yoked to the morpher's values.

Do I think that's going to happen? I dunno, but if nobody thinks of morphing an Arn and custom building stuff to morph I'll be surprised. Also, the idea of morphing a Yeerk resulting in morphing a whole pool feels like setup for someone doing that at some point, and if I had a Yeerk the size of a swimming pool I'd be curious what happened if it infested a brain the size of a lake. . .
