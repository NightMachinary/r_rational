  Even better, one sacrificial shard of Terra could acquire the coalescion and infiltrate Silat. As soon as it hits the pool, it starts morphing into Terra, focusing on taking Silat into the morph with it. Any shards of Silat that went into the pool to investigate anything would be replaced by Terra Collaborator shards, and they would all come out reporting nothing unusual.
