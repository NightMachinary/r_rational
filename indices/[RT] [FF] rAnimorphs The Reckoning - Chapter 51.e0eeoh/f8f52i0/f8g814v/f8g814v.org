  My interpretation of this was that one of the other Marcos acquired the dying Marco, morphed him right there, and absorbed his memories, giving this Marco the experience of remembering being on the verge of death and also watching himself on the verge of death.

Marco probably wouldn't remember the death - the construct instance only remembers what happened up until before it went to sleep the previous day, not whatever happened right before being acquired.
