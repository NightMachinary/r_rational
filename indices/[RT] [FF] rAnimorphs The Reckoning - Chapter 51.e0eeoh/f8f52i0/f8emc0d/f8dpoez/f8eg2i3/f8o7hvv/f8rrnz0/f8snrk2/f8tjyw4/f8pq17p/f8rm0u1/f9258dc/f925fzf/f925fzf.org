It's a biiiiit of an inconsistency, in that if I ever go back and do a final cleanup edit I'll probably change the line in Interlude 13 to more readily match Chapter 50.

But actually the avatar is doing a bit of "fallacy of the gray" there, and in fact all of the pieces can be manipulable by both parties and yet still given pieces can be favored by one god or the other. The Animorphs are just as "touchable" by Crayak as they are by the Ellimist, but they're certainly more naturally "the Ellimist's pieces" just as the Howlers are more naturally "Crayak's."
