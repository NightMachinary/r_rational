I was wondering something about the morphing tech in this continuity. Why even morph? Why not just summon construct bodies from Z-space and remote control them from some safe location. I suspect that to Seerow, the ability to turn into animals wasn't the point of the tech. It was made primarily to access the gods' domain, and the construct body was simply meant to be an anchor to return to real space. Although I'm pretty sure it was more convincing to investors to say 'I'm developing a new weapon to aid in the war effort' rather than 'I wanna communicate with the gods.'

EDIT: Any chance we're gonna see Aldrea and Dak Hamee in this continuity?
