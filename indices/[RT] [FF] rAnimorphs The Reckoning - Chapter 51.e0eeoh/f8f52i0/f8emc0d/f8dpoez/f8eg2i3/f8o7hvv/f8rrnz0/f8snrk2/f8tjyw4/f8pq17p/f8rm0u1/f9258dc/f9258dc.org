So I was combing through the chapters again to try and look for clues, and I found this:

Chapter 50:

  The creature chuckled, an unnervingly human sound. “You misunderstand,” it said. “Who am I speaking to right now---Aximili, or Perdão? It's not a question of black or white, good guys or bad guys, two distinct sets of pieces. *All of the pieces are gray. All belong equally to both players*, you no less than I.”
#+end_quote

Interlude 13:

#+begin_quote
  But in the end, the bait had simply been too tempting to resist. The reunification of nearly all of the *adversary's scattered pieces*---the Chee and the Animorphs and the new splinter coalescion---not to mention the further momentum toward cooperative symbiosis---
#+end_quote

So is this an inconsistency or something actually significant? Was Crayak (I assume) just referring to them as the adversary's pieces only because that was true at the time and not all the time? Or is it more like the Ellimist and Crayak have different 'playstyles' so to speak, and Ellimist sees 'all pieces belong to all players' whereas Crayak's mentality is more 'with-me-or-against-me'?
