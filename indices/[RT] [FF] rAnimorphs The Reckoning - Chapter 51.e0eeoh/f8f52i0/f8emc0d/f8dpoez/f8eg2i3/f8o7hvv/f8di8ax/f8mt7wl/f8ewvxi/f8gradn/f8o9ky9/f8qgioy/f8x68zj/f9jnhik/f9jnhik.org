Really awesome chapter! I've noticed that (unsurprisingly) the Marco clones have made each death feel pretty unemotional, compared to eg Cassie's death scene, though I guess this was pretty unavoidable. And I'm really enjoying the stronger transhumanist themes, and seeing Marco actually live the mindset that a clone of me is another me, and choosing to cooperate with it!

  "Nah," the other Marco said. His face was pale in the twilight, and growing paler by the minute. "Don't want---fuck with the objectives."

I'm quite confused by the long Marco death scene, it seems strictly better to have gone into a useful morph to get at least 2 hours of extra use out of him. My best guess for what the quote meant was that he expected this to be net distracting, because Jake would prioritise healing him later rather than the more important mission? But this doesn't feel that compelling, there ought to be a better alternative like injured Marco committing suicide at the end of the morph, or otherwise convincing Jake to give up on him.
