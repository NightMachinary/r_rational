I'm confused about the timeline on the Marclones? To be able to create them Marco must have had access to the cube, but after Ventura it was in the hands of the Chee, then Tobias, then Garret hid it for Tom to pick up later. When did Marco start making clones? When did he find the time to make so absurdly many of them?
