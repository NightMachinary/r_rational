I do think of sleep as a sort of temporary death. I also think that death is basically eternal sleep.

If we swap my brain with a computer and internally I feel no difference, then this is true immortality from my view. However, let's say something goes wrong, that during the swap I lose consciousness forever and never wake up, and a new consciousness that retrieves my memories and personality data starts to inhabit my body. Even though to an outside observer there is no difference, if my body eats a burrito but I don't taste it, I would have 'died'. This is also why Helium calls himself that instead of Ax isn't it? It's just difficult for me to consider backup copies of my personality as being 'me' :/
