1. Morphers can acquire animals. Humans and other sapient species are not excepted. They morph specific beings, not just the species.
2. As an example: Bob acquires Alice, then morphs into her (Bob->Alice). Alice cuts her nails, becomes Alice'. Alice' acquires Bob->Alice. Alice' can now morph into Alice'->Bob->Alice, effectively regaining her lost nails. This is called "Morph Armor", where a person morphs into a past version of themself.
3. Morphing into an animal gives you their instincts/reflexes. This is implemented by copying the brain (except short-term memories), and then applying modified Yeerk tissue with a Z-space link to the morpher's emulated brain. The full brain and thus personality of that being is still there, just controlled by the Yeerk-tissue (which is controlled by the morpher). It is normally unconscious but can be "turned on" by the morpher.
4. When morphing, a morpher's original body is placed in stasis in a Z-space pocket dimension. This pocket dimension is unstable, and will collapse after ~2 hours (dependent on the mass stored in it- small beings can morph longer). When the collapse happens, the Yeerk tissue remains and the morphed entity is placed in a coma. Eventually the Yeerk tissue dies (possibly from kandrona deprivation? Lasts longer than usual since it isn't doing much) or is removed by the chee, leaving behind a clone of the morph.

Having written all this out I do wonder why a morpher can't turn on the morph's consciousness and then let the time limit expire, skipping the coma step. Presumably the Yeerk tissue automatically reverts to controlling when not being explicitly made to give the controlled being autonomy?

Jake's death: The true body was irreparably injured so Jake morphed into a morph-armor of himself and let the timer expire, leaving behind an older Jake (plus Yeerk tissue that had to be cleared)

If the kandrona deprivation hypothesis is correct than any human morphs acquired post-modification won't have the tissue degrade and thus won't leave the coma naturally.
