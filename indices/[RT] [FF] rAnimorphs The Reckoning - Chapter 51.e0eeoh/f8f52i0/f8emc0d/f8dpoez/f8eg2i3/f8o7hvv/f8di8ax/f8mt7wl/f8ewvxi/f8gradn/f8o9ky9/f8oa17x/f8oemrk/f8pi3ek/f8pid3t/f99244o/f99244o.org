  Personally, I am horrified by people saying 'eh, I was a different person back then;' it seems akin to self-murder or personality erasure; if your future self is one day going to dismiss your present self utterly with a casual wave, then how can you even "know who you are" in any significant or enduring sense?

You're a meaningfully different person every few years until at least your 30s, and possibly right up until forever if you live that long. You're a natural progression of who you were five years ago, but you're not the same guy. And future you is going to be a different guy all together as well.

That's just the nature of what we are. There never was a consistent self. So... you can't “know who you are” in any enduring because there is no enduring “who you are”. Your horror at it feels a bit like the neurotic existential terror the Visser feels about his identity, when he'd be better off thinking of himself as what he is.
