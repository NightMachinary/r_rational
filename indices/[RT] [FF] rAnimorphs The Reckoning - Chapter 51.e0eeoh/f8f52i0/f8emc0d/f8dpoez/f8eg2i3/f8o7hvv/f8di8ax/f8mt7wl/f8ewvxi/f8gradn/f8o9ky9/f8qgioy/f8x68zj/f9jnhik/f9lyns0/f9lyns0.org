"Strictly better" is such a tricky term.

Would it have been better to have an additional large and powerful body for a few more hours?

Absolutely.

I'd also expect a Marclone (of all people) to be able to function coherently for two hours even knowing that he would die at the end.

But there are a bunch of other considerations (mostly interpersonal/emotional, as you guessed) in the mix.

My read on Marco is that he's a satisficer, not an optimizer. He takes the first viable option "above the bar" ... he doesn't wait for the perfect thing unless perfection /is/ the bar.

And wounded, dying, thinking about Jake's emotional state, thinking about his /own/ state/happiness/desires, thinking about the fact that they're already arranged for the kind of death scene that we've been programmed by a thousand books and movies to expect to play out in a certain way---

If Marco were a perfect "Spock" straw rationalist, he'd shrug it off and hop back up for two more hours of duty before dying.

But he's a (brilliant, but still only) 14 year old kid, and he looked around at the rest of the clones, and it was enough for him to feel like they would make it, that his own contribution probably wouldn't make the difference between Jake living and Jake dying, and he was tired, and he was frightened, and he was trying to keep his best friend from freaking out, and he wanted a kiss before he said goodbye forever, and ultimately ...

He chose a graceful exit, over other important goals. I think this is defensible, though I agree you could argue for something more coldly utilitarian.
