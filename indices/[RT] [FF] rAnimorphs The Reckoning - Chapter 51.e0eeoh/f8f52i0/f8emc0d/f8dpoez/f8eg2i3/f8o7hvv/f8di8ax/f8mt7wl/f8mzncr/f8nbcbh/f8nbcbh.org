  They also would have been less likely to have the key insight that Marco had, to weaponize the acquiring trance; note that the Animorphs were on track to lose that first big battle until the two human Marcos made the sacrifice play.

Ah. Didn't Jake use it against the howlers in Canon? But yes, I doubt that Andalites would've tried using the acquiring trance that way.

Re: not penetrating the mist. Wouldn't Elfangor figure it out too? And he was there. Was there some reason he didn't try, especially after the Yeerks started defending open the canyon center (and thus necessitating a way to breach the mist to attack the Arn)?

Well, I got 2/3 recall and 2/4 precision, which isn't too bad I guess. ;)
