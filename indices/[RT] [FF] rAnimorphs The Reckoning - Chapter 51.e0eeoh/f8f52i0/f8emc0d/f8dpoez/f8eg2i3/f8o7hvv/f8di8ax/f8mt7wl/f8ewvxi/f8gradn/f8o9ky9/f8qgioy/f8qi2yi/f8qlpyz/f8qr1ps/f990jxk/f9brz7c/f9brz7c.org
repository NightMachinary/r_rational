Think about a pair of identical logs rotting side by side in near identical environments. It's true that they will take almost exactly the same amount of time to rot totally away (same 'half-life,' if you will), but they'll rot in different /spots/ first. Different parts of the log will disappear, and with Yeerk-flesh blocking various neural pathways, different rot-patterns lead to wildly different wakeup times.
