You don't even need that. The interference is one-way. When Tobias and Garrett were flying, Garrett was twitching but Tobias was fine. This is because Garrett->Tobias->Bird has two layers pf Yeerk tissue receiving commands at the same time. Tobias->Bird is completely safe since it only has one layer of Yeerk tissue.
