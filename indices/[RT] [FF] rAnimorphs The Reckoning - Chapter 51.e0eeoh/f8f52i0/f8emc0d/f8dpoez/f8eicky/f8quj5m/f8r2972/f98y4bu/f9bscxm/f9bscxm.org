Agree re: dangerous; I think the scenario they were considering is one where /Hedwig/ is the original controller of whatever morph they use to communicate, and somebody uphill sits around in that morph 24/7.

When it's safe, Hedwig morphs into that body, and the person uphill starts twitching, but Hedwig himself isn't experiencing problems.

Still assumes that there's no locality, though, so it might not work.
