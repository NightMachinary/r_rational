Wouldn't it be potentially dangerous, though? Like, didn't morphing the same animal disrupt the control of all versions of the morph? So, they might morph this animal and confirm Hedwig is alive only to cause him to die due to temporarily jamming his morph. No safe way to use that in this situation, that I can think of.
