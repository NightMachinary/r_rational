Pure monster madness. Loved every minute. Until now, there hasn't been a lot of animal-v-animal action in this fic, but it seems that this set of chapters is finally getting that all out of the system. With regards to the note about 30,000 word chapters, I say that splitting them in half is ideal - or even into thirds. A 15,000 word chapter is already a /lot/. Even 10,000 is plenty to chew on. And I like the pace of one chapter every two weeks.

So, a few blow-by-blows, or rather, aspect-by-aspects.

I really like the atmosphere of this chapter - the whole dark and misty forest setting, where things are too quiet, where monsters lurk around every corner. This gave me some of my favorite mental imagery from the fic so far. So the way I savor fics like this is that I produce and direct a wish-fulfillment HBO miniseries production in my head - and I do mean this literally, as I tend to plan out the details of the filmography and the precise script changes that would be necessary to make the translation to the screen - and this chapter gave me /plenty/ of setpieces and creature design to work with, let me tell you.

The multiple Marco perspectives: very interesting. I was expecting each successive POV Marco to die horribly until there was only one left, but there was a smaller body count than I anticipated. Well, there still is the other half of this mission to go. But if this many Marcos have made it this far, that indicates to me that the /true/ body count will start when they reach the Arn / Howlers. Really, the Ellimist / Crayak were doing the Animorphs a favor by making them go through the forest, as this has given them many powerful morphs they wouldn't have gotten otherwise.

So towards the end of the chapter, it seems like Marco's sense of being localized in one body is beginning to slip, and this is reflected in the narrative, which did get a bit confusing at times. In the section where one of the Marcos is dying, the narrator seems to switch freely from the ground to another nearby Marco. My interpretation of this was that one of the other Marcos acquired the dying Marco, morphed him right there, and absorbed his memories, giving this Marco the experience of remembering being on the verge of death and also watching himself on the verge of death. Very cool dynamic. Is there any other fiction out there that comes close to this level of weirdness?

Alright, now for That Part:

  “Shut up,” Jake whispered.  Edging closer, he leaned over and pressed their foreheads together, whispering something I couldn't hear.  Then he tilted his head, and lowered his lips to the other boy's---

  /---to mine./

  -------------------------

  “Yeah,” he said.  “It's just---first time.  You know.  Since Cassie.”

  I just barely managed to catch the question before it left my lips, stopped the words from becoming real at the last possible second.

  /Both, obviously/.

Welp. Once again this fic surprises me. This is everything I've ever wanted. I've shipped these two since I was a confused gay kid reading Animorphs in middle school. But even if you're not a shipper, I think this works as a realistic and touching moment - even if Jake and Marco are just friends, I /love/ Jake's display of emotion here for his best friend. I think this might be realistic even if Jake were straight - and not bisexual as he's implied to be here - I have a vague notion that throughout history there were times and cultures where men were much more open about expressing affection for one another. It's just a human thing.

  “You, uh,” Jake said, faltering.  “You and me---”

  “To be perfectly honest, we're kind of more into Rachel these days.”
