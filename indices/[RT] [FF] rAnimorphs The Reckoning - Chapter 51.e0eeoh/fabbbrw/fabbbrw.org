I was so hoping Hedwig would return! Exciting fights, I completely forgot about the Marco/Jake romance but good to see it return slightly, really makes you wonder how you would treat the lives of multiple copies of yourself.

It feels like the copies think a bit too much alike, but I don't know enough about how people think to say for sure.

Maybe it's planned for later, but it would be cool to have some drift in thinking or values so that we can really highlight the difference between this version of copying and the version Visser Three is trying to do, one without value drift.
