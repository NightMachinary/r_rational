Alright, let's do a quick review.

#+begin_quote
  People don't understand the word ruthless. They think it means mean. Cold. Heartless. It's about being able to see that thin, bright line that leads from point A to point B---that one, narrow path that dodges all the dead ends. It's about seeing that bright, clear line, and not caring about anything but the beautiful fact that you've found the solution. Not caring about anything else but the perfection of it.
#+end_quote

Yes! The ruthlessness speech!

Easily one of the best parts of canon Animorphs, from one of the best books.

I really like this take on the speech, too. Now all we need is Marco threatening to murder Visser One and feeling conflicted about it and we'll hit peak awesomeness!

#+begin_quote
  Point B: Jake and Helium---at least---alive and well at the bottom.
#+end_quote

Gee, I'm a little worried by how the number of surviving non-suicidal Animorphs seems to be dwindling chapter by chapter.

#+begin_quote
  ‹Hedwig here,› I called out. ‹Crossing the boundary now, over.›
#+end_quote

You know, I'm realizing just now that Harry Potter references have taken the place of Star Trek references in canon. I wonder if they'll age better.

  Or like how there were no other plants in the forest at all. No bushes, no ferns, no flowers or vines. Not even any saplings or seedlings that I could see---just giant, silent pillars of wood, stretching up for what might have actually been miles.
#+end_quote

I wonder at the biological aspect of these trees. I mean, there's a reason trees in real life rarely grow the size of a skyscraper. The weight that the base of these trees have to support must be /insane/. They probably have a super-advanced internal flora keeping them together (aside from the Hork Bajirs tending to them).

#+begin_quote
  Well. Not like we were spares, exactly. Not like seven copies of one person. More like---like one person in seven bodies. Like there really was just one individual there, like there was some essential thing that was “Marco,” and instead of plugging into the rest of the universe in one spot, it was now plugging in through all seven of us. The same software, running on seven different machines.

I don't have much to say, except I like the exploration on transhumanism we get here. Very Rick and Morty.

  “He's not talking about himself,” I cut in, my throat strangely dry. “He's saying it's stupid that morphing technology can't fix this, when it clearly could.”
#+end_quote

Come on, dude, it's called suspension of disbelief. Stop questioning every little thing already.

#+begin_quote
  “Shut up,” Jake whispered. Edging closer, he leaned over and pressed their foreheads together, whispering something I couldn't hear. Then he tilted his head, and lowered his lips to the other boy's---
#+end_quote

... :(

Please don't make a habit of doing this, Jake.

#+begin_quote
  “Because,” said Marco, grinning. “Couldn't see---that well.”
#+end_quote

You know, moments like this I realize you've really nailed these characters. Marco making one last dumb joke as he's dying is a perfect character moment, and a good throwback to Jake's death scene. Also it's a nice joke.

#+begin_quote
  “To be perfectly honest, we're kind of more into Rachel these days.”
#+end_quote

THE SHIP! IT'S ALIVE!

#+begin_quote
  /I can't save you, that other version of me had said. I'm sorry. If I could save you, I would. But the morphing tech doesn't do that. What it can do is give you a chance to make a difference. Like donating your organs, except instead of organs, you're donating a whole person. And that person will fight---for you, for your family, for everyone you're leaving behind. As long as there's an Earth to fight for, he'll fight for it./ Those words seemed hollow, now. Cheap. Almost manipulative.
#+end_quote

Nooo, nothing manipulative about saying that to these people!

  The monster was alone, cutting sideways across the slope, moving maybe ten or twelve miles per hour. It was huge, easily twice as tall and twice as long as our current best morph, making the trees around it seem almost normal-sized. Its armor was like the result of a genetic experiment crossing an Ankylosaurus with a Stegosaurus, all thick bone with various knobs and spikes sticking out, some as big as Christmas trees. It had four massive, muscled limbs, splayed out to the side like a lizard, each ending in a giant, five-clawed foot the size of a backyard pool. And its head---

  Its head was like something out of a nightmare, all exposed bone and pulsing flesh. The whole thing was split down the center, with teeth lining the gap, as if the entire skull could yawn open like a Venus flytrap. There was also a normal set of jaws, like those you'd expect on an Earth animal, but inside of those were more jaws---an entire second set of teeth, the absolute smallest of which was at least three feet long. And there were eyes everywhere---eyes like a spider's, black and round and utterly soulless.

  I'd seen a lot of monsters over the past twelve hours. But this was the first one that looked like it might honestly have a chance against Godzilla.
#+end_quote

How the hell did Hedwig-Marco acquire that thing?

Is it because of bats and humans are to small for it to even notice them?
