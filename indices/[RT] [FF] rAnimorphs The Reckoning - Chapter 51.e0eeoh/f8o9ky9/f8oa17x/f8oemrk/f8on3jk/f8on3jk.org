So is sleep death? It involves an interruption of the first-person perspective that is then later resumed. How is that different from, say, uploading into a computer (assuming a lossless upload)?

Let's say we swap the brain with a computer when we do that so there's no visible difference when the swap occurs. From the first-person perspective, what's the difference between that upload and sleep?
