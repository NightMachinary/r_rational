  The most important defining aspect of one's identity is one's filter-nature ... what experiences you value, what things you would change about the world around you, what you would create, what you would destroy---the algorithm by which you, earthworm-like, filter universe through yourself and convert it into universe-prime.

What if I do not change anything about the world around me? If I choose to exist-just-to-exist? I'd understand if people told me "Look, son, if you don't make anything out of your life, you'd be nobody." But that's being 'nobody' in a very abstract sense. As long as I can continue to perceive things, I'd be 'somebody'. Only when I stop perceiving things, I'd be 'nobody'.

I wonder if a more literal-minded thinker like Garret would hold the opposite view? Like he would have trouble considering clones of him to be 'him' even if they all made decisions the same way, or held the same values, or did everything the way he would.

Another thing: what experiences I value and what I would choose to create or destroy, these things can change over time, right? It's the reason why people can say "I was a different person back then." But you're not really a different person, except in a very abstract metaphorical sense. You're still the same person. It doesn't mean that if your values change, you are no longer 'you' does it?

In hindsight, I think it was dealt with a little in that V3 chapter, but I'm not entirely sure... But I wonder if V3 is also pursuing first-person immortality?

  I imagine you'd prefer a legacy to no legacy, but would prefer life-without-legacy to less-life-with-legacy?

I guess I wouldn't really have a preference as to whether I have a legacy or not because if I'm no longer around to perceive it then it wouldn't matter at all.

  or even have gradual neuron transplant. Some people are willing to accept moving their software to a new machine (either biological or mechanical) as long as there's no interruption of consciousness,

these methods - where your old organic 'parts' are gradually swapped out and replaced with more durable parts - are in my opinion the only 'true' immortality because your first person perspective is preserved even if you have none of your original parts left.
