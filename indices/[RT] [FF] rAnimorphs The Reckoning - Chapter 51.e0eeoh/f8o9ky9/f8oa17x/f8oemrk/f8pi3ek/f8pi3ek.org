  I wonder if a more literal-minded thinker like Garret would hold the opposite view? Like he would have trouble considering clones of him to be 'him' even if they all made decisions the same way, or held the same values, or did everything the way he would.

Garrett's already on record in this fic trying to convince Tobias to do morph-death-regeneration in order to fix his amputated hand. He's also on record thinking it would be /much/ better if both he and Tobias had multiple redundant clones.

Even if you're not changing the world around you, you're exercising preferences within it; the planet Thanos chose to retire on tells us a lot about what Thanos thinks is beautiful and rejuvenating, and if he had chosen a different world he would've been meaningfully a different person.

  Another thing: what experiences I value and what I would choose to create or destroy, these things can change over time, right? It's the reason why people can say "I was a different person back then." But you're not really a different person, except in a very abstract metaphorical sense. You're still the same person. It doesn't mean that if your values change, you are no longer 'you' does it?

Personally, I am /horrified/ by people saying 'eh, I was a different person back then;' it seems akin to self-murder or personality erasure; if your future self is one day going to dismiss your present self utterly with a casual wave, then how can you even "know who you are" in any significant or enduring sense?

I note that if you enjoy questions like this, you should look forward to the Rachel chapter, upcoming in four weeks, with some amount of excitement. In particular, there's discussion of the distinction between identifying with your "sculpture" (the personality traits you currently exhibit) and identifying with your "sculptor" (the thing that decides which changes would be positive versus which changes would be negative).
