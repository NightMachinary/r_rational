You're in the majority, as far as I can tell, re: putting a heavy, heavy emphasis on the first-person experience; this is the belief behind (for instance) not wanting to take a Star Trek teleporter, or be uploaded into a computer, or even have gradual neuron transplant. Some people are willing to accept moving their software to a new machine (either biological or mechanical) as long as there's no interruption of consciousness, but most people identify an exact-down-to-the-molecule clone of them as /definitely not them./

I do think that a lot of people /comfort/ themselves with the idea of a legacy? Like, I don't think there are many that would trade away first-person life-years for guaranteed legacy, or at least not without a pretty steep rate of exchange. But I think you're still in the majority there, too---I imagine you'd prefer a legacy to no legacy, but would prefer life-without-legacy to less-life-with-legacy?

Marco, in this chapter, holds my own personal view, which has two main parts:

1) The most important defining aspect of one's identity is one's /filter-nature/ ... what experiences you value, what things you would change about the world around you, what you would create, what you would destroy---the algorithm by which you, earthworm-like, filter universe through yourself and convert it into universe-prime.

2) Anything that would filter universe in the exact same way as you /is/ you; any copy of you running on any hardware is still you; as long as at least one copy is extant and actively filtering, you're still alive. If I could, with confidence, push a button to create an exact clone of me, identical in every way except he had uninjured knees, at the cost of dropping dead, I'd do it. I imagine that /in the moment/ I'd have significantly greater hesitation than I do when it's just a thought experiment, but it's central enough to my life philosophy that I expect I'd push through anyway, lest I abandon that very philosophy.
