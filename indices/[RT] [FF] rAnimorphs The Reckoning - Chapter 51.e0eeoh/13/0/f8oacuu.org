I don't think Crayak gave V3 the Howlers (just) as shock troops; how much could he actually do with them that he couldn't accomplish with gas, bioweapons, and heavily armored Hork-Bajir?

In canon the Howlers have (apparently) infinite range telepathy, in the form of a collective memory that propagates so quickly that Crayak Itself couldn't react fast enough to kill off seven of them before Jake's memories corrupted the entire species. I think r!Crayak's actual plan was to hand r!V3 a shortcut to his goal of omnipresence/omniscience.

That said, acquiring the 'goyf is a pretty big win for the animorphs and therefore the Ellimist. Makes you wonder what Crayak's getting out of this field trip.
