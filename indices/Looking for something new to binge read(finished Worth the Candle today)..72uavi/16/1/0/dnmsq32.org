  How is the comedy and romance in HTADODB?
#+end_quote

The humor is VERY dry and self deprecating. I frequently laugh out loud at it, though. It's almost a parody/farce as everyone around the MC tries to do the tropey thing while he face palms.

There is mild sex and arguably romance, but it's not particularly romantic. The MC is a misanthrope who has a hard time accepting affection.
