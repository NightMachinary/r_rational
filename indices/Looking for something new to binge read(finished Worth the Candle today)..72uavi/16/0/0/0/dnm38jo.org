Ok, that makes sense.

I suppose my confusion stemmed from the fact that I just assume that the characters would question the narrative. I assume that step zero in every Saturday Munchkin thread is "Who else suddenly has super powers?"

Of course, that isn't the default, and it's my fault for thinking it was.
