I've read (and enjoyed) almost everything you listed.

If you like "The Good Student", you may also enjoy Mooderino's other two stories:\\
[[http://gravitytales.com/novel/how-to-avoid-death-on-a-daily-basis][How to Avoid Death on a Daily Basis]] - It's an atypical portal fantasy. The main character is a selfish asshole, but in a good way. Can't say if it's especially rational, but it is a heck of a lot of fun.

[[https://royalroadl.com/fiction/10293/bitter][Bitter]] - An atypical LitRPG story with a (refreshingly) female non-gamer as a main character. Lots of fun as he explores the idea that it's a game . . . some of the the worst excesses of game companies. Certainly rational-adjacent.
