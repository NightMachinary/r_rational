You should look at the d&d [[http://www.digital-eel.com/blog/ADnD_reading_list.htm][appendix n.]]

From there, I'd highly recommend Fritz Leiber's Farfrd and The Grey Mouser series. Starting with /Swords And Devilry/.

Leiber is (perhaps) the originator of the trope Swords and Sorcery, Thieves (Adventures) Guilds, and basically the whole modern concept of humorous fantasy (L. Sprague de Camp's /Complete Compleat Enchanter/ came later).

Gary Gygax based huge amounts of AD&D on Leiber's works. Nearly all of the stories you have mentioned and everything in modern fantasy draws from Leiber. As much or more so than JRR Tolkien.

Read it, you'll understand better.

You can find all of it on sale as epubs or (better) at your local library.
