I mean I'm not the OP but I suspect like a lot of people including myself they dropped it because it just gets too depressing and grimdark and everything you hear about the story indicates it's only going to get moreso as things progress. Plus the pacing gets a bit too slow in parts as well for some people's taste.

Also the OP mentioned dream drive as being something they already read and liked in the post.
