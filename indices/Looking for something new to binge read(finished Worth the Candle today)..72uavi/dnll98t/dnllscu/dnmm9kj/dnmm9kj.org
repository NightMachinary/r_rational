You hit the nail on the head for why I dropped it. Seeing Taylor suffer one setback after another when I wanted to see her succeed was emotionally unsatisfying. Breaking Bad at least had protagonists who I rooting against as much as for, so I was okay with seeing them get screwed over again and again while still wanting them to keep trying.
