You dont like xianxia or wuxia but you like savage divinity ?

i mean doesnt it like gets its inspiration from those genres and LNs. Its also extremaly "wishfulfilly" but i didnt read it after 100 or so chapter so i wont judge too much

I would also recommend "A Practical Guide to Evil" as many others have tried before me

edit: I would also recommend "Void Domain" although it isnt really rational but i enjoyed it greatly with the exeption of the latest arc i guess but its still good.
