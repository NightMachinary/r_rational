I see we have a similar taste in fiction. I've been in a wuxia/xianxia kick lately, but it's very hard to find anything readable, all translated LN I've found are trash.

If you liked the Cradle series and Savage Divinity, you'll probably enjoy [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/forge-of-destiny-xianxia-quest.35583/][Forge of Destiny]]. It's a xianxia quest currently being written on Sufficient Velocity. If you haven't seen a forum quest before it's something like a choose your own adventure story where everyone who has an account on the forum can vote on the options the author gives after each "chapter" or update. As sufficient velocity's (and it's sister forums: spacebattles and QuestionableQuesting (NSFW)) userbase tends to act mostly rational it's very enjoyable.

It's worth reading it one the forum just to see the discussion and thoughts behind the choices, but if you prefer to read in a ebook like me I'll leave a fairly up to date version in epub [[http://www120.zippyshare.com/v/DcMKrdro/file.html][here]].
