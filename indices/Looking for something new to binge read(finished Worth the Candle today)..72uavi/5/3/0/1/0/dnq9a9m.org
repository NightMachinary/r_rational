Assuming you mean the game aspect of Dream Drive...

It's honestly pretty hard to find decent litRPGs, but I quite liked the first act of [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shinobi-the-rpg-naruto-si.380860/][SHINOBI]], a Naruto fic focused around the real life consequences of having only 1 point in Charisma.

That said, stop reading after the first act is over, it's really not worth it to continue.

[[https://wanderinginn.wordpress.com/][The Wandering Inn]] is also alright, though it's pretty hit and miss.

I know I have read more good ones, but I can't remember them. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10252240/1/When-Signing-a-Contract-Always-Read-the-Fine-Print][This fic]] was in my favorites, for example, but I don't know if that means it's great or just passable. I really should start writing down the stuff I read that's actually worth recommending... I'll get back to you if I remember.
