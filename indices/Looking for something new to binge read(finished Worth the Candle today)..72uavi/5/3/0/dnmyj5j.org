I saw he tried Arcane Emperor, and Dream Drive is pretty much AE but well written and with a planned plotline. It's the best litRPG I've read, though Worth The Candle has been giving it a run for its money lately so I might have to update that.

I'd say Dream Drive's biggest strength is characters, in litRPGs non-main characters usually aren't that important, but in DD they feel like real people with real agency. It's appealing in a rational fiction way. Technical writing is flawless too.

Shame it's not finished, but again, WtC hits the same spot for me.
