I'll second The Gods are Bastards as my current favorite. It is epic in scope and length. I do agree that there a pretty significant number of POV characters. It's not quite Infinite Jest, though. I think it holds together better when read straight through.

It's harder for me when I come back after a month and try to remember who everyone is, especially once everyone starts to come together (as they are in the current arc).
