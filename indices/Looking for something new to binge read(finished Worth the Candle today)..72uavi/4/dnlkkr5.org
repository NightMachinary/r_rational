If the framework is medieval infantry warfare, a world that runs partially on narrativium, and international politics, then /A Practical Guide to Evil/ is a good one.

If the framework is industrial (and social) revolution as a weapon against a literal Zombie apocalupse, then /A Hero's War/ is a good call.
