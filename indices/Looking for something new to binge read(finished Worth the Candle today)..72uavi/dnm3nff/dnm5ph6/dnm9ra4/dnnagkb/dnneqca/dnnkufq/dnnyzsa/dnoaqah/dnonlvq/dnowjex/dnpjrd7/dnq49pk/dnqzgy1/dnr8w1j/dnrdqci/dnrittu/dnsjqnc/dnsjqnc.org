"to the author"

* checks definitions around *

oh, well... huh... nope...\\
The "author" part of those definitions is basically about how a Mary-Sue is generally a self representation of the author, nothing being said about that author believing or not that this character is perfect or not (which in itself would be saying quite a lot about that writer)

The notion of "too perfect" is brought, though, and I'm not sure I can see how an author would wish (aside from writing a parody) to make a character or story "too much" something. The pejorative aspect of the term speaks for itself.

So... Hermione doesn't think of trying to use elf magic to apparate in the horcrux cavern because of... nobody. She just dismissed the idea by herself when she thought about it... I don't see how the author could be willing to let her make such mistake if he or she wanted her to be perfect.

Hermione jumps in the middle of a battle like a noob : that is so perfect... right ?
