Oh, I didn't read that one yet.\\
Well, I like Harry Potter-Evans-Verres, but it's hard to humanly/realistically relate to the character. I mean, if it weren't for the intelligence boost given to basically everyone in the cast that goes way beyond the point of making them "not stupid", this Harry would be quite a mary sue of his own kind.

(but again, I may not have exactly the same understanding of that term : to me, a character too perfect making problems non existent, being used to solve them in a deus ex machina fashion, or making the story uninteresting when used as a main character)
