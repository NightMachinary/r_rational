  So... Hermione doesn't think of trying to use elf magic to apparate in the horcrux cavern because of... nobody. She just dismissed the idea by herself when she thought about it... I don't see how the author could be willing to let her make such mistake if he or she wanted her to be perfect.

So she can be shit on for making a reasonable mistake, thus making her a martyr. To silence the critics who called her stupid for his various other stupid actions saying "see, she's not perfect! I made her forget something once!" To make her more a self-insert Mary Sue.

Suffering heroically for reasonable or minor mistakes is totally in keeping with a Mary Sue.
