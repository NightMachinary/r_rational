Well, I must say that the lack of agency of most characters is real, to be honest.\\
Yet "lobotomy" still seems a strong word to me...

Now, how I remember the ambush thing : the enemy wouldn't fall for it unprepared more than one or two times ; and consequently, that would jeopardize their ability to perform it in the near future, so they should try to wait some time between rituals.

I'll have to keep those points in mind (especially the "letting go" one) when I decide to go for a second read of this story ;)

Side note : last chapter I was surprised to see Ron basically proposing to hunt and kill death eaters and even more surprised that it got a non offended answer (roughly "well, absolutely but let's be careful, 'kay ?")\\
A position I can't imagine this Hermione sharing exactly : she knows that she will have to kill at some point (and that she most certainly did it in the heat of the moment recently) but I'm pretty sure she would rather avoid doing so if she could. Moral dilemma don't always have to make logical sense.\\
What I mean here is those other characters do seem to have a bit of free will... maybe ?
