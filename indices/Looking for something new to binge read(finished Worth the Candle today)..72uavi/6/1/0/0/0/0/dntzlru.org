Japanese light novels have a style that tends to sound very conversational, understandably given their influences.

All the xianxia I've glanced at, including Cultivation 40K, has what translates as a kind of oddly and repetitively stylized purple prose, but maybe sounds completely normal in Chinese.

Don't speak enough of either language to say for sure but translation quality standards seem slightly higher with JLNs, which might have something to do with the smaller number of translations and slower release schedules.
