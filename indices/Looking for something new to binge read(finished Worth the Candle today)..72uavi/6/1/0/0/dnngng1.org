It's not what I would call "strong professional writing", but nothing OP listed that I've read meets my standards for that, so it may be worth ignoring me.

Fimbulwinter and sequels are particularly great for the "Protag builds things, works with others, doesn't completely ignore potential allies, etc" feeling that is missing from so much. It's particularly bad if you mind stunningly blatant self-inserts that the author doesn't seem to realize aren't subtle at all.
