(Minor thoughts.)

After reading through the first 97 chapters of 'Forty Millenniums of Cultivation', chapter 79's â€œAmiableness is Amiableness. Happiness is happiness. Blazing flames are flames. But Dreams... aren't something that can be sold!" was surprising and refreshing, the main character choosing the route of greatest utility and engineering-knowledge-acquisition even in the face of hotbloodedness, friendship, and the dramaticness of slaughter. Making the choice that was right for him, rather than taking the easier route of smooth interpersonal relationships.

At the same time, I had an unhappy worry that this would turn out to be lip service, and that the narrative would forcefully push him to the path in conflict with those values he'd chosen (and in favour of friendliness and hotbloodedness), after token resistance.

As part of in parallel with the feared pushing, the interpersonal side of the chosen path went to extreme lengths to throw its face away as far as possible, making itself as unattractive as possible.

The true finally-followed path, revealed in chapter 97, did not make me happy.

I must now (rant about/)paraphrase conversations from a completely different author!

"Hey, there's an opportunity for violence and conflict! Are you going to join in?"

"No, for I am a noble soul, and would far prefer spending the time with my loved ones here. I have chosen that I will not be going."

"Ooh, ooh, here are now some random reasons that you can't avoid going!"

"Oh well. VIOLENCE AHOY!"

[Repeat x2-20]

Specific plotthread (Coiling Dragon):

"Only two more Macguffins and you can reach your special level to become more powerful than anyone ever, something that you've always dreamed of!"

"Yes! I long for it so much!"

"Okay, now you've gotten one, just one more to go! Then you can finally attain what you've always dreamed of!"

"No, no... I would have to choose someone to kill in order to take the last Macguffin I need, so I'm just going to shelve that whole idea."

"Okay, now there's someone here who viciously hates your guts and is part of a group trying to kill you and your loved ones, and he also has a Macguffin you need! Are you going to get his Macguffin?"

"No, no... no call for violence, it would be so uncouth to raise my hand against him."

"Hey! You went up against the final boss with only half-baked incomplete power, and now he's going to kill you--"

"QUICK QUICK I HAVE TO QUICKLY KILL SOMEONE FOR THEIR MACGUFFIN!"

/"I am the final boss. I am responsible for all the worst unnecessary misery and suffering and torment that you have experienced. If you kill me normally, I will die tormented and regretful, my dearest wish unfulfilled, and you will finally have delivered true punishment, or vengeance, or whatever. If you instead use your full power to kill me, I will die completely happy and satisfied, thinking 'All those horrible things I did? Worth it!'. Will you make me happy?"/

"Yes. Yes, fulfilling your dearest wish--which you did horrible things to my loved ones for--and making you happy is a worthwhile thing to do. In fact, it's so worthwhile I'm even going to kill lots of non-complicit bystanders too with the power of this strike, and not display even a moment of guilt or regret, despite my earlier words about not killing even one murderous enemy for his Macguffin that would bring me to my own desired heights of power."

/"Joy!"/

Edit: ...Ahh, and more memories...

"...And then, for personal benefit, I slaughtered an entire family, including the elderly and weak and babies, every single one I could find."

"Meh, it happens. Morally neutral thing, in the world we live in."

"Oh, and though you never had any interactions with them or knew anything about them, it turns out you shared some of their genes."

"YOU ARE PURE EVIL AND MUST BE PUT TO JUSTICE FOR YOUR CRIMES!"
