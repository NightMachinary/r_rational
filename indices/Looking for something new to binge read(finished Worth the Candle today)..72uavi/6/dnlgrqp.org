"Worth the Candle" is pretty high on the list of things I've binged recently, but you've already read that, alas. If you didn't say you were against xianxia I would have recommended "Forty Millenniums of Cultivation" which is pretty much the /Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann 40K and the Methods of Rationality/ fic that the margins of HPMOR Ch. 64 were too small to contain, except that it's more "The Methods of Economics and Engineering" that are creeping in around the sides of the xianxia cliches. "The Erogamer" (requires login, very NSFW) has some of the same actually-thinking-about-the-implications as "Worth the Candle", plus the author is into either stats or ML and sometimes throws in math easter eggs or references. It happens to be randomly true that I've been rereading "Alchemical Solutions" (the wormfic) which might not be too far off the theme of your list. In case you weren't already on notice, ShaperV aka E. William Brown, the author of Time Braid, has an original SF book "Perilous Waif".
