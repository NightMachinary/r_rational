Liked HPMOR? Try Significant Digits. It builds into the characters set by EY and expands a lot into the world, when the rational Hogwarts trio are young adults.

I consider it a canonical continuation, as it doesn't change Yudkowsky's version, is extremely good and rounds up some loose threads of the original HPMOR quite nicely
