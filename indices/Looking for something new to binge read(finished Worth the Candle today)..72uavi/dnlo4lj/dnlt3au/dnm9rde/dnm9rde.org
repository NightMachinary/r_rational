It's worth saying that reading Pact can be /very/ frustrating. The protagonist makes intelligent, rational choices (maybe not the best choices, but reasoned and rational nonetheless) and everything just seems to get worse for him. Ad infinitum.

It's frankly depressing. Fitting, perhaps, considering the universe it's set in, but reading "/And then it got worse/" every single chapter gets tiring and boring quick. Or at least it did for me, I know many people liked it, though it didn't have nearly the same acclaim Worm had.
