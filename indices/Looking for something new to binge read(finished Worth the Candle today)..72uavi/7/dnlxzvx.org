One story I have enjoyed a lot lately, though I wouldn't call it rational per se, is [[http://royalroadl.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests][Everybody Loves Large Chests]].

The story features a very consistent system, and a main character that starts very weak (physically and mentally) and gets progressively smarter and stronger in a believable way. It is also rather funny.

As should be apparent from the link, the story has quite a lot of NSFW content. In fact, there are a couple of interludes early on that can be pretty much skipped if one isn't interested in smut but, after reader complaints, the author reduced the amount of sex significantly.
