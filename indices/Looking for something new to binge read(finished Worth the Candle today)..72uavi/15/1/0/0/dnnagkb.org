  The mathematical aspect

Yes and no. The mathematical concepts in the story may be real enough, but the application of them feels a bit like Captain Picard giving orders to "adjust shields to compensate for the instability."

It's definitely a step - several steps - up from canon, and book 1 felt reasonably well balanced. The sequel is where I really get a Hermy Sue vibe.
