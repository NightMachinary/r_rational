  Hermione (and by extension, Voldemort too) making mistakes here and there isn't necessarily completely nonsensical. I don't remember how the letting go of death eaters happened exactly, so I can't comment on this, but the other mistakes I can think of right now (the quite recent "Dobby could have teleported us" and the very recent "Oops, I teleported myself in the middle of a war zone") seem to me quite forgivable/understandable... unless she has to be perfect, in which case she would indeed be an mary sue... So it's hard to follow really : how can she be too perfect and not good enough in your opinion at the same time ?

My problem is both sides have an enormous number of options for quickly and decisively ending the other. None are used because they apparently suffered partial lobotomies. Hermione make reasonable mistakes and is disproportionately harped on, and everyone is shown to be in the wrong for criticizing her. When she does something stupid "we can't use ambush tactics against the murderers, torturers, and rapists, as that would be wrong" no one calls her out on it. This is war. People are tortured to death by an enemy that they are *letting go*. Someone being treated as perfect and/or being hated for no reason just to show what a fucking martyr they are when there are perfectly rational reasons to hate them makes them a Mary Sue.

  I thought the rational aspect of a story applied on a story rather than its characters, the idea being that what goes on makes sense if you consider the knowledge and intellectual capabilities of those who make choices.

You mean that most of the characters have pretty much no agency, just sitting there waiting for Hermione to do stuff for them? Because since Dumbledore died that seems to be the role of almost everyone.
