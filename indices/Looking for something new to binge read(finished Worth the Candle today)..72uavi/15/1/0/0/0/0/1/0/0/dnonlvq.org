So if I follow you correctly :\\
- making one mistake, like not thinking of some solution, or not being able to put in in application for lack of sufficient control of the environment (he controls the ministry, but that's clearly still a long way from an official situation : it's reasonable to consider the possibility that he doesn't have /full/ control over it) makes someone... retarded ?\\
- "retarted" main characters will prevent any story from being rational ?

I thought the rational aspect of a story applied on a story rather than its characters, the idea being that what goes on makes sense if you consider the knowledge and intellectual capabilities of those who make choices.

Hermione (and by extension, Voldemort too) making mistakes here and there isn't necessarily completely nonsensical. I don't remember how the letting go of death eaters happened exactly, so I can't comment on this, but the other mistakes I can think of right now (the quite recent "Dobby could have teleported us" and the very recent "Oops, I teleported myself in the middle of a war zone") seem to me quite forgivable/understandable... unless she has to be perfect, in which case she would indeed be an mary sue... So it's hard to follow really : how can she be too perfect and not good enough in your opinion at the same time ?
