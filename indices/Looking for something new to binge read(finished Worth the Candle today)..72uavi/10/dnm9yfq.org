[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice][The Moon's Apprentice]]. It's very HP:MoR-ish, and centered about the protagonist trying to become a God, so I think it fits your itch pretty well. The writing goes from meh to pretty good, and is overall pretty strong.

On the other hand, it's pretty dark and depressing; the protagonist is bitter and self-destructive in some ways, and her quest isn't exactly motivated by healthy reasons. Still worth a try.

[[http://www.prequeladventure.com/][Prequel Adventure]] The story can be extremely depressing, not in the "Holy shit this character I liked just died" way, but in a way that hits very close to home. Like, "Holy shit, this girl is a loser, I am really not comfortable with how much like her I am". The characters builds herself up, in the sense that she starts at the bottom of the barrel, with nowhere to go but up.

The moments where Katia does get her wins feel like some of the most moments I've felt from any work of fiction. This is a story that tells you something about yourself, and in a twisted way, gives you hope for the future.
