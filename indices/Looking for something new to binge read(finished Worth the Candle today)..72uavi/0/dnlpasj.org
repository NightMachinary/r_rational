I've been enjoying [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/2014/08/20/book-1-prologue/][The Gods Are Bastards]] recently. There is quite a lot to it, though, so you won't finish it in one binge. There are a number of main characters, and mostly they work hard (well some more than others) at getting better at stuff.

Also, [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/][With this ring]] has had quite a lot of good character empowering themselves stuff over the years.
