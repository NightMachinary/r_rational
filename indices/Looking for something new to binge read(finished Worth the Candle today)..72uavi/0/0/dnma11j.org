I'll second With This Ring, with a caveat: I think it's very much the "junk food" of superhero stories. There's no grandiose story-spanning arcs like Worm, or exploration of deep social issues like Strong Female Protagonist or The Metropolitain Man.

But it's there. It's just that story that consistently has a new post every single day (the author is /really/ serious about that), with consistently okay writing, fun moments, mini character arcs, explorations of DC Comics and superhero tropes, etc.
