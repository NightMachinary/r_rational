Why is it junk food? Among its main themes are deconstruction, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyUplift][technology uplift]] and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech][schizotech]], and it works on these themes quite well. It also has good fight scenes and rational (if somewhat marysueish) protag.

It does have a slower-paced, “zoomed-in” narrative that also includes slice-of-life moments, but that's just what its format is --- it's not trying to gain its competitive ability through the story length alone (which is what I'd call “junk reading” --- just feeler chapters, but lots of'em).

Though admittedly I haven't checked on this story for some time by now, its quality could've deteriorated from what I know.
