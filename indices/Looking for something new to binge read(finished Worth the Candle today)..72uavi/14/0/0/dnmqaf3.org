Not really. I have a particular hate of wishfulfillment xianxia wuxia xuan huan and harem Light Novels( they dont need to be harem but they usually are...)

I just dont like powertrip fantasy wishfulfillment, in fact i despise it with hate. Thats why i try to not read things from [[/r/noveltranslations]] nowadays.

There are always classic Light Novel that i very much recommend tho like Bakemonogatari and the monogatari series. Katanagatari too(i separate series by the same author). I would tell you more but my knowledge is failing me. If you stick to the classics then you rather wont meet any wishfulfillment power trips.
