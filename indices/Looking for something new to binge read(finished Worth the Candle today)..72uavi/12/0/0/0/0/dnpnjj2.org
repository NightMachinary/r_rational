Considering his ignorance on the supernatural and the fact that some threats (especially demons) have really esoteric ways of getting at you, I don't exactly blame him for not reading the "super-duper" books in the library. There's also the fact that as far as I can remember (it's been a couple years since I read Pact) he had basically no allies and almost everybody was out for his head.

I am not saying he made the best or most optimized choices, but neither did he choose stupid things (most of the time). Actually, the point of my comment was to warn about the fact that regardless of his choices, he only survives each encounter by sacrificing something.

Much like Worm, I would say it suffers from a pacing problem, with no time to unwind and relax and a protagonist that simultaneously has both plot armor and heaps of suffering piled upon him.
