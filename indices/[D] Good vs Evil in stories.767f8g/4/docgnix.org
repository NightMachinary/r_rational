  Was the point of HPMoR that "the power he knows not" is somehow "a desire to do good"?
#+end_quote

I'd like to point out that HP:MoR doesn't really aim to be realistic in the first place. The whole "Good vs Evil" thing is an unrealistic dynamic to begin with; in real life, conflicts are between people with incompatible or competitive goals, not between a 10-yo and a bored sociopathic demigod. The conflicts we see in HP:MoR is engineered by higher forces (Dumbledore, Fate, Voldemort).

Real life conflicts don't have to be zero-sum. They can be (for instance, there's not much common ground between Occidental interests and Daesh's interests), but most conflicts are borne out of coordination problems, not fundamental differences. Regulatory capture, realpolitik, immigration crises, poverty, corruption, etc. We solve them through social engineering, better law-making and technological advances, not finding evil people and punching them in the face.

If we're talking about large scale "my army of knights vs your army of orcs" conflicts, then again most fiction isn't realistic. Stories are about individuals, superheroes, super-spies, charismatic rebels, secret agents, etc; but in real life 99% of conflict is massively controlled by governments, because governments are /based/ on having a monopoly on military strength. A "government" can take the form of feudal lords, bureaucratic institutions, a ruling caste, etc, the general principle is "the ones in charge are the ones with the most guns". Good and evil and ideologies don't really factor.

  So I guess the question I'm thinking about is, to what extent is there a relationship between "the desire to do good" and "being effective at achieving your goals?" What would would we expect to see in the world, if there somehow was a positive relationship?

A good first step towards being effective in the struggle between good and evil is "Don't break the law because then you end up in jail".

We like to glorify being an underdog, being the lone hero who has to defeat the cunning villain, but in real life? People like Voldemort are the underdog who must hide from the law. Real conflict isn't between the likes of Batman and Joker, it's between Random Cop #48 and Random Thug #21, and Random Cop usually wins.

  To the extent that our intuitions are accurate, we might feel like the relationship between "wanting good things" and "being effective at achieving your goals" should be at least non-negative.

That sounds like magical thinking to me. I mean, in most social situations, not being an asshole means people respect you meaning it's easier to get your way, but it doesn't /have/ to apply, and it certainly doesn't always apply in high-stakes situations like business or politics.

On the other hand, enlightened self-interest and the invisible hand of the market are a thing. Institutions with less corruption are more profitable, trade deals make war less likely, allowing women to drive is good for the economy even when you're Saudi Arabia, etc.

That doesn't mean "being on the side of Good gives you a boost on your stats", because on an individual level there are effective selfish people and ineffective altruistic people, but on aggregate, over long periods of times, institutions made of selfish people are out-competed.

tl;dr: Most conflict isn't about good or evil, it's about governments, coordination problems and people not being consequentialist enough. Good eventually triumphs over evil because it makes more money.
