Problem is that the farther removed you are from the people you're cooperating with, the less you'll /feel/ cooperative. And the less you understand what the other players are doing, the more they'll be able to get away with without you being any the wiser. Good probably wins more often when there are fewer players involved and the group is trying to achieve a simpler task. Make things too complicated with too many agendas and someone might be able to get away with cheating more easily. And then the good guys have to become less cooperative just to keep up and stay in the game. That being said, it's probably all a matter of incentives. Make things less complicated by agreeing to organize your system better, make the rules norms and expectations more clear to all the players, and then it becomes much easier to tell when someone defects. Then you can punish the defector. The punishment for the defection must of course be made clear to everyone as part of the rules. Its a lot easier to stop someone stealing food from their fellow tribe members in the ancestral environment then it is to stop Putin from interfering with the US presidential election in 2016.
