Oh, don't get me wrong here. I am saying Good has never really won, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to be Good or that trying to be Good is pointless.

The way I see it, being Good is all about reducing your losses. You can't revive those that have already been murdered, but by defeating murderers and other evil-doers, you can help to reduce the number of future victims. That's pretty important, even if it isn't a victory.
