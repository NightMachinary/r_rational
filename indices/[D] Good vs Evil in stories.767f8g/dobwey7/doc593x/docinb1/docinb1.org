  Its a lot easier to stop someone stealing food from their fellow tribe members in the ancestral environment then it is to stop Putin from interfering with the US presidential election in 2016.

Well, yes. There's limits to the power of cooperation over competition. One of the big ones being that it's a lot harder to stop someone who's got his own group that he's cooperating with than it is to stop a lone rogue.

And whatever else you may think of Putin, you /really/ can't call him a lone rogue. He has the whole of the Russian government to work with.
