I beg to differ on a fundamental point of your argument.

Harry does /not/ win in HPMOR. Rather, Dumbledore does, making great sacrifice and using superior information to end the threat of Voldemort and ensure that the human race continues. (The fact that Dumbledore ends up trapped in the mirror does detract slightly from his victory, but it does not prevent it from being a victory).

As to whether the good guy wins in the end. I think that there is a point to be considered here - the winner is the one who gets to write the history books. And that will make a big difference. Consider the example of South Africa.

Before 1994, the Apartheid government was in power, and history books spoke mainly of the European settlers and their descendants. The Great Trek featured heavily, and the formation of groups like the ANC was not at all dwelt on.

Post-1994, the Apartheid government was abruptly (but peacefully) replaced. Suddenly, the Great Trek vanished from the history books, and a whole raft of freedom fighters were suddenly important figures in the school syllabus - where they had simply not been mentioned before.

There was a distinct and sudden shift in the most accessible narrative. Researchers inclined to look in depth would still find much the same information - but to the ordinary school student, the definition of the historical 'good guys' had just shifted to someone else.

So, then you also bring up the question of whether or not being good helps you achieve your goals.

To a degree, I think it does, and the reason is this; that a lot of the time, being 'good' involves cooperation, while being 'evil' involves doing things that other people would rather prefer that you didn't do. There are costs to running directly contrary to your neighbour's utility function; for one thing, your neighbour might turn out to be a persistent fellow with a thirst for revenge. On the other hand, an evil neighbour might take advantage if you're feeling cooperative... but if you both cooperate, you can get a lot more done together.
