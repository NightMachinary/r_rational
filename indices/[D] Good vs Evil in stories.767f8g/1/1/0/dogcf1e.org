I agree that this effect works out the way you're talking about /today/. I've personally made friends who started out as fans of my writing, and they're some of my closest friends now because they were self-selected based on liking what I wrote. I put a lot of myself into my writing, so liking my work basically translated to getting along with me. (And for a community "story": Eliezer's wife Brienne started out as an HPMOR fan. Self-selection!)

But I feel like this wouldn't be a powerful-enough effect to be causal for the evolution of the whole behavior in the first place, because

1. most people /don't/ tell stories. It's not a human universal, like language; only [wild-assed guess] 25% of human beings have ever written even a scrap of fiction outside of forced situations like school assignments.

2. the people who /do/ tell stories, in the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness (EEA, for short), were people who already had people there to tell them /to/. Today, when we write stories down, we tell a story to nobody in particular and /then/ we give it out to people, with zero marginal cost for each person the story is shared with. Before writing, you had to have a captive audience who would sit down and listen, someone who either had the potential to---if they were impressed---go out and get more people to come to your /next/ telling of the story; or someone who was willing to memorize the whole thing as you told it, and then help you spread it by telling it themselves as well.

3. again in the EEA, tribes were small (I've heard estimates of ~25-125 members) and mostly constant in membership, other than people marrying in or being exiled out. You already knew everyone in your tribe, and already had established relationships with most of them. There's no need for the sort of self-selection filtering+bonding tool that stories provide in such an environment; anyone you could get to sit down and listen to a story of yours is going to be someone for which you're "preaching to the choir" by telling such stories.

Mostly, I think, in the EEA, stories were told by people who everyone felt /obligated/ to listen to---that is, elders and authority figures. The person who can get everyone to shut up around a fire---and won't be shouted down when they start to tell a story---gets to tell it. (Oddly, I think the pretty-bad movie /The Croods/ got this exactly right. Story-telling is mostly /dads/, annoyed at something one of their children has done, intimidating their families into silence and then couching their paternalistic warnings in narrative.)

But there were definitely more "epic" stories, more rarely told; I think these were less people brute-forcing their way into "holding the mic", and more people who everyone respected enough to be quiet when they talk, e.g. old people who have fought in previous tribal conflicts and remember them. Such stories were probably desired mostly for their /true/ aspects---the parts that "really happened"---but the story-tellers probably wanted to either exaggerate details of them to fix them better in people's minds, or wanted to jam normative details in there (being paternalistic dads themselves once-upon-a-time, or being matronly grandmothers now.)

But in the case of elders telling stories, I would bet that a lot of the time it wasn't so much an elder volunteering a story, as a child /requesting/ to know about something, and the elder trying to find a way to spin a tale that would entertain them. Simplifying things (including the morality of a conflict) to a child's level of understanding, adding action elements that would excite children, and trying to come up---often on the spot---with some normative advice to spin in there, since the child is listening so attentively and it's a good chance to "raise them right" a bit (maybe in a way different to how their own parents are doing.) From there, it's memetic evolution: the stories that, by happenstance, happened to be the most viral, got retold, and mutated to be more viral still. That vitality is mostly to do with what entertains children to hear, but also a bit about what pleases story-tellers (again, probably either intimidating dads or respected elders) to re-tell.

The two forces---deliberate fiction told to communicate a norm, and memory bent toward normativity as a spur-of-the-moment decision---then come together when someone decides it'd be a great idea to combine elements of stories. And thus you get *myth*: tribal elders doing actual, recorded, mundane things, but also throwing lightning and shouting mountains apart, all part of the same story, which always turns out to communicate a carefully-crafted norm even though the historical event did nothing of the sort.
