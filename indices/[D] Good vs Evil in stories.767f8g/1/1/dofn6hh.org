I suspect stories are at least partially a way of signalling. If you expect doing good to help you win, then you'd expect that in your stories good people would win. And if you expect doing good to help you win, you'd do good, so you can win. It's good for other people if they associate with good people, so they associate with people who tell stories about good people winning, since they're more likely to be good people. And since they're associating with you, that's good for you.

Though I suppose being normative is important too. Kids learn what to do based on what they see, so if you tell them stories (which the primitive human mind has trouble distinguishing from things that happened) about people behaving a certain way, they'll think that's normal and behave that way.
