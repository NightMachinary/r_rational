"History is written by the victors."

If you could /retroactively/ make Harry's parents /not have ever been real/, would you do it? Of course you would never want Harry to /know/ you'd done that, because he would want to feel like his parents are real, valuable people. But they died. They didn't win. They /don't get/ to write history. This is a terrible thing. But is there really /nothing/ we can do about it? Or is it just that it's so hard to even think about what we might try, that the whole thing feels pointless?

Do you really believe that there are at least /some/ good people in the world, genuinely trying to act according to what they believe to be right? If confronting what you really believe to be true makes you feel terrible, then you need to seek some comfort from people who you perceive to be good. But don't /take/ it from them; neither you nor they want that. Just observe how you feel, when someone really tries to help you, even if they don't actually /succeed/ in doing so. At least they tried, right? That's something valuable in itself. Or at least I think so.
