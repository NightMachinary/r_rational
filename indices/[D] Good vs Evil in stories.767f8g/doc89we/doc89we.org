*WARNING:* This post may make you depressed. Not as much as I am though.

Good always prevails, Truth in real life because of the anthropic principle.

If evil ever truly wins, then humanity is extinct.

Otherwise, evil victories are only ever temporary. As long as humanity continues to exist, eventually, by sheer random chance, evil will lose and good will win again. At which point everyone can go "oh look Good wins in the end!"

Which is of course, cognitive dissonance at work. We live in a world full of evil and suffering, and no one has found a way to do anything about it. So we have all convinced ourselves into believing that good wins in the end, or that good ever wins at all. I mean, sure, that's technically true, every force of evil will eventually be defeated by sheer random chance. But what has Good actually won here? All that's happened is we have learned to say that the truncheons hitting us on the head are awesome.

It's the same in fiction too. Saying "Oh look Voldemort is dead, GOOD WON!" is self-delusion at its finest. All of the evils wrought by Voldemort have not been righted. Harry's biological parents? Still dead. An entire society of wizards is still scarred and traumatized by the magical war. The truth is, the moment someone is murdered, Evil has already won, for all eternity. Unless you have some kind of resurrection power, that person is dead forever. And even if you somehow resurrect the victims, the damage has already been done. Their lives have been permanently and drastically altered against their will.

If you came from somewhere where good truly wins, where no one is ever murdered/raped/assaulted/etc, you would not call anything that happens in reality or fiction a victory for good.
