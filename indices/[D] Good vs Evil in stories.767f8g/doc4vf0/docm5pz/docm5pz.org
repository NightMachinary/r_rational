I just read some Terry Pratchett. I've never read much of him before, just one book which I can't quite remember the name of. What I remember of the experience was that it was fun and I laughed a lot. So why have I been avoiding him?

I guess I just couldn't see the value in it, ultimately. A lot of his writing is /actually meaningless/, or at least, I have to work too hard to try and understand it. I /want/ to believe, although I don't /feel/ like I believe /right now/, that "blind faith" can be justified. I've said in the past that I /despise/ blind faith. But maybe that's because, without trying to be too specific about what I really mean, in my honest, emotional experience I /feel/ like in order to be a better person I need to have some faith. That a lot of people think faith is good /in and of itself/ should be a clue that it might /actually/ be good. Specifically, that, for at least /some/ things, the most practically effective thing to do /really is/ to /specifically not ever think about too hard about the reasons for why things are the way they are./

There are, as best I can determine making use of my current knowledge, just /Things Man Was Not Meant To Know/. /Wondering/ about these things is absolutely fine. Asking, what if? Isn't that something essentially human? But /sometimes/, the most practically effective way to be who you want to be is to become /less/ self-aware; and have a /less/ specific understanding. I, in essence, /really want/ the Obliviators to come and remove certain knowledge I /think/ I have about the "Masquerade." Why do wizards not more directly help muggles? Wizards seem to have a soul and muggles don't. The things wizards do don't seem to make any sense at all. They're stupid, but I for some reason feel like it's still overall better to be a wizard than a muggle.

I specifically /do not want to think about why this might appear to be the case right now./ "Causally entangling" your beliefs with reality allows you to very effectively take actions that change your actual experience. You don't have to make any particular effort to realise that this is the case. And isn't it /really true/ that no particular person's perspective is ultimately more valuable than any other's? Without digging into /why/, I /want/ to believe this. And so now, I /feel like/ I understand dreaming a little better.

  It's not so much that I don't have a choice. It's more like I am not aware that I have a choice at the time. Lucid dreaming, as far as I can tell (and I haven't ever really bothered with it much) would be mostly about realising, while dreaming, that I have a choice.

  As if I'd willingly suspended disbelief and then willingly forgot about it.

As best I can determine, /having this ability and using it correctly will make you more effective/. To the extent that I think "effectiveness" relates to "good" in some way, I should want to believe, unjustifiably, that /some/ self-delusion is good. But I /don't want to know about it./ I /dislike/ self-delusion. Must there /necessarily/ be no way to live a happy life while honestly attempting to believe true things?

This question is simply /too hard to productively think about/. So I both want, need, and hope, that my experience of reality will help me just /forget about the question,/ trusting that when the time comes to think about it, the world will let me know somehow. There's /no good reason/ to believe this. /It's a willing self-delusion./ But I genuinely believe that some self-delusion does make you more effective over the long term. It helps put some distance between you and things you find painful, when the intensity of your emotions is just too much to deal with.

And so I find that, what I really, honestly /want/ right now, is to sort of, act a bit according to my model of Rapunzel from the movie Tangled. /She/ doesn't know that she's in a Disney movie, that no one is really bad, even the villains, and that because she happens to be in that world, /a necessary consequence is that things will turn out all right for her./ If she /knew this for sure in advance/, wouldn't that make the whole thing a little bit more pointless? She wouldn't feel like she had any choice about the ultimate result of the actions she took. She would just be "acting" afraid, and curious, and trying to fight those she perceives as enemies for no other reason than that /she feels she has to behave that way, given what she knows./ The real, honest best thing to do for her, in that situation, is to /remove any and all knowledge that could convince her to realise, even by complete chance, which world she is actually in/, (which we know, from the outside, happens to be a Disney movie). In short, she should have some /totally unjustified faith/ that things will turn out all right, even if what she really believes at any /particular/ point in time is that they won't. She /shouldn't even try/ to figure out the reason for this feeling until she is actually ready for it. I'm not ready at this time.

And so, I feel like I really just need to slow down, relax, forget about hard questions and have some /fun/. I'm /choosing/ to believe that when the time comes, I'll eventually be able to tackle these questions, /if that's something I turn out to actually want/. But I /might be wrong about what I want./

What I mean by that is, intuitively understanding how "understanding" feels can feel like certainty; that you have a lot of confidence in your understanding which gives the impression that you are quite certain about some things. The important point Daniel Abraham makes in his Dagger and Coin series about "feelings of certainty" is that "spiders" having the ability to "directly, magically create" feelings of certainty /turns out, as best he can determine in the fictional world he created/ to be /really bad./ And yet /despite/ the magical spiders, and only them, who are evil, having this unique, extremely strong ability, /good still turns out to win anyway/. Through bringing people together and genuinely trying to do what you can, in whatever ways large or small, to make the world a better place. But you /really didn't know the result in advance/, before you actually /read/ the story, did you? No matter how much you might, at some particular point, /feel/ that way.

How true is this in our own world? The answer is that /I really don't want to know, and I want to forget I ever asked./ Sometimes fiction /really is just fiction/.

But, on a meta-level, what I /really believe/ is that at any /particular/ time, your /entire understanding of the world can turn out to be wrong,/ even if it's incredibly practically effective and /feels/, from the inside, like you've made some meaningful progress. Maybe you have, but maybe you haven't. You don't, can't ever, and as far as I can tell with my currently available knowledge, /should not even try to accurately figure out/ "precisely" how "true" any /particular/ understanding might be. All you can ever productively do is to /suppose/. Supposing that acting according to this understanding reveals some interesting and useful information to me, what are the /necessary consequences/, if I /were/ to happen to be in /one of/ the /potential/ worlds that /might/ be this way?

I think there's something fundamentally human about the desire to create rational fiction. But /maybe not/. Maybe, although we're genuinely doing what we really want right now, that's /actually bad/. We shouldn't be unjustifiably sure that we /actually/ know what's "right," at any particular point in time. And so increasing your uncertainty, realising the ways in which you /really don't know/, and /really don't even want to think about it right now/, seems to really help with reducing emotional pain.

I believe there are Things Man Was Not Meant To Know. Not /permanently/, like, if it /turns out/ that we actually can deal with this knowledge in a practically effective way, we then have the choice of whether to look into these questions more closely. But /until/ our best judgement determines us to be at that point, we should pay attention to what's sort of vaguely fun and interesting, /specifically without/ thinking too hard about why that might be. And if you, by chance, happen to end up thinking too hard anyway, then you need to do things that help you forget. It's not like Obliviators are actually /real/, after all. They can't /actually/ come and erase your memories, here in the "real world." Harry Potter and all its fanfiction is just a story, which can only affect you in ways you /let/ it.

Somehow I feel...strangely positive. That seems good. I'm really tired, I just haven't slept well in the past few years, even, and what I really want /right now/ is to just go to sleep. After all, some people have made the argument that the "resources" of the "universal computer" are limited; that each person's experience consumes some sort of limited resource. Because this possibility exists, I can feel justified in wanting to go to sleep, if that's what I emotionally need. But I really just want to forget I ever read about that and /do tiring things/.

How does this story make you feel?
