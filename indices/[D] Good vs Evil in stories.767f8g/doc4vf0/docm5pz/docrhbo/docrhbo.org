I'm not sure what Terry Pratchett has to do with valuing blind faith. His books espouse much the opposite really. There is the whole book focusing on religion where the [[#s][tag]] There is also this quote from Unseen Academicals

  The Patrician took a sip of his beer. “I have told this to few people, gentlemen, and I suspect I never will again, but one day when I was a young boy on holiday in Uberwald I was walking along the bank of a stream when I saw a mother otter with her cubs. A very endearing sight, I'm sure you will agree, and even as I watched, the mother otter dived into the water and came up with a plump salmon, which she subdued and dragged on to a half-submerged log. As she ate it, while of course it was still alive, the body split and I remember to this day the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the delight of the baby otters who scrambled over themselves to feed on the delicacy. One of nature's wonders, gentlemen: mother and children dining upon mother and children. And that's when I first learned about evil. It is built into the very nature of the universe. Every world spins in pain. If there is any kind of supreme being, I told myself, it is up to all of us to become his moral superior.”

Blind faith is bad because it is the kind of thing that leads you to jump off bridges, crash planes into towers or act as if the power of your positive thinking will actually do anything for children in Africa.

When you talk about Things Man Was Not Meant To Know I think you underestimate our ability to cope. Nihilism is curable without a blind adherence to an ideology. In my case it happened in highschool when I found that even though I was stressed and freaked out because life had no meaning and nothing had any purpose I still didn't want to fail my assignments. I went meta and discovered that I could and still did care about things. I found that I didn't need to worry about falling into hedonism because I still had the same distaste I had for it before. Of course there was still that little part of me that was obsessed with it and wanted to die but the rest of my self wasn't going to be dragged down with it and got rid of it after a while just by blocking it out. (Admittedly I think I am better at suppressing than the average person. When I did the Pink Elephant exercise I keep trying until I could do it. The trick was just to think about what I normally think about when pink elephants stuff isn't involved)

If you think self-delusion will help you make better decisions you are wrong. The problem isn't with your beliefs it is with your decision processes which are somehow giving you the wrong result when you feed it the right information. By the sounds of it you already know what the right result should be so should just skip the process. (As an aside it is very difficult to consciously lie to your self and if you get better at it then your brain will either adapt to make it harder or make it easier such that you lie to yourself about other things.) Also remember "If we nothing we do matters. All that matters is what we choose to do". In regards to morality I generally favour a blend of Utilitarianism and Stoicism. Stoicism is something I think you should look up because it favours a very intuitive secular view of morality.

I don't understand what you are talking about in regards to a masquerade but you shouldn't be constantly thinking your worldview is likely to be overturned. Beliefs are probabilistic. Generally each time you have an innovation or revolution in an area that means you are less likely to have another one. There is only so far you can go to get to the Truth.

Edit: Another big one is to only feel bad or happy because of stuff your actions (or lack thereof though that can lead to bad spirals) cause. Anything else will cause you issues when you try an adopt a larger perspective.
