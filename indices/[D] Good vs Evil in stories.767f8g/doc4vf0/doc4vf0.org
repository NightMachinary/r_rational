  The almost universal trend is that good wins out in the end.. Why is this?
#+end_quote

Because stories are, first and foremost, normative. The myths and campfire tales that have existed since forever are pretty much universally just hyped-up versions of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goofus_and_Gallant][Goofus and Gallant]].

  You, a small forager-child, sit with your grandfather by the fire. He is in a reflective mood. "There are things you should do, and things you shouldn't," he says.

  "How do I know which is which?" you say.

  "Well, that's easy. Every night, I tell you stories. Stories my grandfather told me. And there's a reason he passed down these stories to me, and a reason I pass them down to you."

  "See, there are two kinds of stories. There are stories about winners, and stories about losers. Someone in the future might call these 'comedies' and 'tragedies.'"

  "A /comedy/ is a story about someone who succeeds. The point of a story like that, is to teach you about what qualities winners have. You learn that winners do this, and winners do that, and then you know that if you want to win, you'll do those things too."

  "I never needed to /tell/ you any of that, though, right?" he says, a wise smile on his face.

  You nod slowly, pondering the stories you've heard. You knew what point a story was trying to make, because a good story makes you like a hero, and so you just want to be like them because you feel like they're your friend. It was never really about winning... was it?

  "But grandpa, why does the hero of the story have to suffer, then? Why don't they just win from the start?"

  "Oh, it's to build empathy, certainly, if that's what you're thinking. But it's also to demonstrate that these principles---these things winners do---don't always work over the short-term. They're only good strategies over the /long/ term. Things like generosity, they might get you in trouble if you come across a sociopath. But they also make you friends and allies that will help you beat up that sociopath. The qualities winners have, the things that make them triumph, are the same things that make them struggle."

  "Ah." you say. It all seems a bit less magical, put like this.

  "And a /tragedy/, well, that's the opposite. The qualities losers have, the things that make them lose in the end---they might work over the short term, but they won't work over the long term. So a tragedy is a story about a person with a flaw, and teaches you the pattern of how having that flaw will play out: it might help them in some ways, but it will end badly. You know all those stories 'bout revenge? You know how everyone in them ends up dead? The point is that wanting revenge doesn't work out in the end. It's a flaw."

  "Stories are just candy that make the medicine go down. The medicine is a lesson about what kind of person it helps to be, or hurts to be. The candy is an entrancing series of events... and the /best/ kind of candy makes you wonder which kind of story this story is going to be. Whether the traits the protagonist has are really good ones or bad ones in this world."

  "You ever heard a bad story?" he says. You nod. Your little brother tells some sour stories. They never go anywhere, and then they're just... over.

  "Well, a bad story is just a story that doesn't leave you wondering that. If every one of the protagonist's qualities is obviously going to be helpful or harmful, and they all add up the same way, and the world in the story seems to already have an interpretation in mind... then there's nothing to be found by listening. It's not exciting to hear about Mary the Good who everyone loves. It's not exciting to hear about Xander the Downtrodden who everyone spits on. But if you've got Xander the Good-at-heart, who gets spit on; or Mary the Egomaniac, who everyone loves /for now/... well, /there's/ a story that's going somewhere. A story that has something to chew on, about what this kind of person will do."

  "Huh..." you sigh. "I don't know if I want to hear your stories any more, grandpa. It's all a bit like... brainwashing, isn't it?"

  "Surely is! Or it tries to be. But even little kids recognize a story that's just reinforcing a moral they've heard before---and they don't want to hear it. Boredom is the best tonic against propaganda. And stories that aren't---stories newly-told, speculative fiction about how people act in situations you've never imagined before---well, just as much as being about who's a winner, they're about inviting you to consider those situations at all. Critical thinking never hurts a good story none; it just gives it children!"

  "So you know what you do, the next time I tell you a story you don't like?"

  "...tell my own?"

  "That's right. And give it a different conclusion. Tell it to me, and see how I like it. That's called /philosophy of ethics/."
