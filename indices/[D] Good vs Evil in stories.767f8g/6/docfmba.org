I think the phenomenon happens a little differently. It's not that the author (necessarily) picks a "good" side and a "bad" side, then makes the good side win. It's that the author picks a side they intend to have win (in regular fiction, through the use of plot conceits. In rational fiction, by messing with the initial conditions), and once that side is picked, the author makes that side sympathetic.

Now, theoretically speaking, any side could have been picked to win (for example, tolkien could have picked mordor, and then made mordor the sympathetic side), but that's when we get into narrative casuality: authors are more interested in writing about characters that fit into particular patterns, which means that most stories that get made feature characters that the authors enjoy making win, which in turn means that characters following the morals of the author win.

Which leads to a rather interesting point: that in many stories, there will be no "good" side (as defined by your morality). But you don't choose to read stories written by, say, neo-nazis, or ISIS, so you're not exposed to the "bad" guys winning.
