It depends on your definitions, of course. Trivial example: if you define "Good" as "has the strongest army" then generally the Good country will win.

A more common definition of Good would be something like "that which promotes human weal and averts human woe, both to the greatest degree feasible". By this definition, Good will still tend to triumph, because:

1) Humans are social creatures who are capable of working together well

2) Working together makes it easier to accomplish more and bigger things

3) In general, humans dislike social defectors (the greedy, the liars, the murderers) and will punish them -- send them to jail, kick them out of office, etc. There's a certain amount of net 'Evil' (i.e., their 'Evil' actions less their 'Good' actions) that an individual can get away with, but if they go beyond that point they will suffer consequences that reduce or eliminate their ability to do 'Evil.'

4) Civilizations that are run by 'Evil' individuals tend to collapse, as too many of the resources are consumed by the leader(s) instead of being devoted to food, irrigation, etc. Also, 'Evil' leaders make other nations nervous, which often hastens their demise.

Given the above, most nations that survive for long periods will be 'Good' and most people within those nations will be 'Good'. Obviously, there are major exceptions, such as nations run by xenophobic lying bigots guilty of sexual harassment, fraud, and collusion with the enemies of their country. Still, those people typically end up ousted eventually.

So, yes. 'Good' does tend to win. You can tell by the fact that the world has been getting better for a long time. I'm obviously generalizing a great deal and there have definitely been major bumps in the upward road, but the road /is/ upward-trending overall.
