Fiction /in general/ follows a sort-of universal model, which Joseph Campbell identified as the monomyth, and Dan Harmon calls the "story circle", but it's also part of the larger (non-fictive*) "comfort zone" model of human states. Most stories are about a person leaving the zone of comfort, which elevates stress and anxiety (and in turn, concentration and focus), and then returning to that zone of comfort, having changed. That's the basic story structure.

* I don't actually know how solid the social science behind this is, but I have a toddler and this is one of the primary models of toddler/child behavior patterns, which I immediately recognized as sharing a lot of similarities with story structure.

*Rational fiction* is still usually attempting to be *good fiction*, and so will lean toward many of the same conventions. This means that the good guys win, detail is conserved, guns introduced in the first act get fired in the third, etc. The /difference/ is that a good writer of rational fiction is aware of how the audience marks all these principles and works to subvert or re-contextualize them, /and/, in making a work rational, will justify why these things are the case, if they happen in-universe. In other words, the good guys win because that usually makes for a more satisfying story, and in rational fiction the good guys don't just win because they're the good guys, they win on their merits, within the logic the story presents.

I think "good guys always win" is only a false trope when taken in the aggregate; it's not unbelievable that the good guys win one story, but it's unbelievable that all the stories we have, with few exceptions, are ones in which the good guys win; it indicates a huge sampling bias. You don't need to worry about that sampling bias when writing one individual story, in my opinion, if the aim is realism.
