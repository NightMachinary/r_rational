I should also point out that women [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_speculative_fiction][are a minority in speculative fiction]], which is the vast majority of what's posted here. So to answer the implied question of "Why is the gender ratio skewed towards male authors in this subreddit?" you'd have to answer the question of "Why is the gender ratio skewed in speculative fiction?"

And the answer to that question is probably the same answer as the question of why women [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_STEM_fields#Gender_imbalance_in_STEM_fields][are underrepresented in STEM disciplines]] - which I am 95% sure comes down to the ways that society has historically discouraged women from those pursuits in various ways.
