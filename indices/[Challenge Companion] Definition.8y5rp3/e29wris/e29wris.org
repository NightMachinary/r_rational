There are no punishments for breaking natural laws, because there are no crimes. You can't defy inertia by arguing for a broader understanding of "at rest". Newton's first law of motion is /explained/ by human language rather than /comprised/ of it.

Human laws, however, are linguistic structures. Arguments over words can and do change whether they affect our social world. For example: [[https://www.greyhound.com/-/media/greyhound/pdf/helpandinfo/110307policyprohibiteditemsupdated43015.pdf][a PDF of Greyhound's baggage rules.]] No tools /and/ no hammers. No liquid fuels /and/ no gasoline. One need not wonder if a sword is a knife as both are prohibited... unless the latter is "plastic cutlery", which is fine.

These are extremely breakable rules, and breaking them has a variety of human consequences.

*Fictional worlds of gods and magics have anthropomorphic natural laws*. One can bargain with reality. Definitions become powerful as laws turn linguistic, even while characters must fear arbitrary punishment for straying too far from standard whys and hows.

Many people who'd make great munchkins in fiction make great lawyers in real life, and vice versa. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vdS-7ib7XbBiEtCYyMFIJjStp7ehThQL8kNLF_wIOlA/edit?usp=sharing][I wrote a challenge entry about that a while back.]]
