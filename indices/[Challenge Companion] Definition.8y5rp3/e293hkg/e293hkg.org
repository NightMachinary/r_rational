I tend to see definitions (in the context of rational fiction) come up mostly in the course of munchkin-ing. The protag comes up with a non central application of a rule (magical or otherwise) that gives them what they want.

I appreciate a good munchkin. My only gripe comes up when it really feels like someone in the world should have thought of that before.
