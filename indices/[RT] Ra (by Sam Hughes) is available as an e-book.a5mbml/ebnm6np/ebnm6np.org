Submission statement: /Ra/ was one of my favorite stories, in part because I love Sam Hughes' writing style (low on the hand-holding, information dense, whip-fast), and in part because I found it inventive, exciting, and /new/ in a way that's pretty rare. It finished ages ago, with a rewrite of the (contentious) ending a few months back, but it's now in e-book form, if you'd like to support the author. Pretty cheap, for being 500 pages.

In terms of plot, magic is real, and it looks a lot like computer programming and engineering. It's approached that way by most of the characters within the work, including the main character, who's studying magic at university. There's more spoilery plot stuff after that.
