You have a couple options.

If you just want to read it with minimal effort, just read the web version. [[https://qntm.org/city][Start here]] and continue by hitting the next page links at the bottom. It might be a little long to read this way but it can be done.

There's the [[https://qntm.org/files/ra/ra6-fixed-2.epub][epub version available here]] for free that you can put on your (android) phone and read with an ereader app or download an ereader app for your computer like Calibre (which also can convert ebook files into different formats).

If you really just want a pdf or another format like mobi, send me a PM with your email address and the format of your choice and I will convert it for you.
