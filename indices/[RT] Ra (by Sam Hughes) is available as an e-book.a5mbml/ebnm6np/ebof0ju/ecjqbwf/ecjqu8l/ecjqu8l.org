No. There are only a limited number of time travel models that make any actual sense, and the one that Branches uses (branching timelines) is one of them. I have an unpublished/unfinished novel (/The Timewise Tales/) that uses the other major model, self-consistency, and a planned novel that uses ripple effect, which would complete the trifecta.

(I also have two mostly abandoned and unpublished fanfics that use [[https://qntm.org/hypertime][hypertime]]; that one definitely has the mechanics taken directly from qntm.)
