This community focuses a lot on consistency and character motivations and character mistakes and stuff, so this isn't said enough.

This story is absolutely amazing. Some stories have great worldbuilding but the author struggles to write... like, actual things that happen in that world and characters who live in it. This isn't one of those stories.

The characters all feel compelling and living and believable, even when the story takes a few easy shortcuts. The confrontation between Ana and Tunnel Vision was really tense and exciting, and the payoff when Ana wakes up and sees a woman in the mirror is just perfect.

A lot of stories have emulated the Wilbow format over the years, and this is easily the best of them (sorry PGtE).
