I'm sad to see Tunnel Vision go. She was an interesting and compelling antagonist, and I was sort of hoping there'd come a point where she and the protagonists were, if not allies, at least not enemies. Ah well. It works well as a conclusion to (this part of) Ana's arc, anyway, in that Ana only got her new body when she was willing to give up on that goal and commit suicide for someone else's sake.

I feel awful for Max though. Not only did her life's work go up in smoke, but she also just lost her best friend and perhaps the only person keeping her sane and grounded. I do hope we see more of her, if only because I don't want to be left with just my imaginings of how miserable she must be right now.

  “Yes,” said Grace. “That is the difference between us. I am an ant. You are a beetle. You have protected yourself and justified it, again and again, even if it meant letting the world crumble.”

  /Is it really that simple?/ I'd stood by Paragon, even when they weren't looking out for me. I'd refused to steal other people's bodies, even after I'd been expelled from Paragon, and after Lorne had lifted the tracer on me.

And this is the thing that's always bothered me about the simplicity of that "ant and the beetle thing," for all that I like the metaphor. Some ants are dumb as hell, and plenty of beetles have convinced ants that sacrificing themselves for the beetle is the ant thing to do. Even if you're doing what is objectively the right thing, not everyone who opposes you is doing so out of selfishness or malice. Selfless people can be misguided or mistaken.

  The Lavender Book sat on the coffee table, unopened, its lock still broken.

  I left it there. /I'll deal with you later./

Oh, you tease.

  /Wes versus Tasia./ I stood up, and blood rushed in my ears. “Why didn't you tell me this earlier?” My throat clenched. “Who won? Who the fuck won?”

Oh, you fucking tease!
