Oh, absolutely. I love how many things this story is able to blend together: a realistic and morally complicated (not to mention very relevant) revolutionary drama, extremely relatable character arcs that make tangible the struggles of marginalized groups, all told in a world that's rich and compelling in both its realistic (the politics, the society, the history, etc.) and fantastical (the magic and background weirdness) elements. It's also unashamedly progressive as a fuck, which is really nice.

I think there was a comment on the last chapter saying that the story would be better if Ana was cut from it, and that absolutely boggled my mind. Ana's the emotional core and basically the thesis statement of the story, and people want to get rid of her? She's one of the big reasons it's as good as it is! Without her, you have a lot less of an emotional connection to the revolutionary plot (and frankly to the world in general), the moral complications of Commonplace vs. Paragon are a lot less apparent and immediately pressing, and you completely lose the examination of how oppressed people can earnestly and selflessly fight FOR their oppressors. I sometimes wonder if people are reading the same story I am.

(I'm a slut for PGtE though, so I'll fight you on that last bit)
