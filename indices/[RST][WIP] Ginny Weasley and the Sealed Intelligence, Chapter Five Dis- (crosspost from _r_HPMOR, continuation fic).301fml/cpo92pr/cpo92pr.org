I'm really enjoying the story so far, but I'm finding the chapter length to be a real issue. It's just my personal preference, obviously, but the writing in general seems rather short and abrupt. Not a lot of exposition or descriptions. Yes, we're all familiar with the story, and its characters, but a little more exposition wouldn't hurt here. Of course, I could be wrong. *Or Voldemort*. Who knows?
