I think the concept of "magical gender" really needs to better defined and elaborated on. What is "magical gender"? And why would it have anything to do with dorm assignments?

Also, how might magical gender actually be related to "mental gender" or "physical gender"? Why is there such a strong correlation, according to Madam Pomfrey? One possible explanation is that "magical gender" isn't really a gender, but rather your "magical style/personality", which determines the kinds of spells you prefer to cast and are good at, and the strong correlation to actual gender is because differences of both "mental gender" and "magical gender" are influenced by the learned and inherited personality differences between people of different genders/sexes. The correlation between "magical gender" and "physical gender" could just be because people with a certain "mental gender" tend to have the corresponding "physical gender".
