Well that settles it: Ginny's another Riddle. (Note to the author: by having Pomfrey /literally say it out loud/, you make it look like you think your readers are idiots. With the revelation of the wards malfunctioning, the foreshadowing was /already/ about as subtle as a punch to the face.)

Was Pomfrey this competent in HPMOR? Her behaviour here strikes me as out-of-character, but I could be wrong. Her brusqueness initially reminded me of Amelia Bones, but I guess it's more likely that this is still polyjuiced Moody.

Also, Lesath. Also, DracoxGinny. This is gonna be interesting.
