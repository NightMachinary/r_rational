Well it seems to follow Naruto canon except for some small changes to make it more rational and make the premise. Many of the rational Naruto fics tend to change things enough that there are rather implausible power leaps very early on whereas all Shikamura has learned is what would be reasonably expected of him in these circumstances if he wasn't lazy.

Basically, the author didn't make him any more intelligent or munchkiny, just more willing to put what he has to good use.
