Huh, I guess I assumed that this story had been linked here before. It's certainly good enough to have been.

Edit: Well, might as well explain it then. The premise it that Shikamaru isn't a lazy ass, and instead turns his sizable intellect towards being a ninja. The writing is proficient and the world seems very consistent. It's solid rational fiction.
