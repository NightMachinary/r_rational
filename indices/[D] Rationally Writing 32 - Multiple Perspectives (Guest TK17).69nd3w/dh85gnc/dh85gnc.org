Okay, I have thought for twenty minutes about the question of "loose" structure as suiting "loose" stories and "serious" structure for "serious" stories and I'm not sure I'm correct. Lots of comedies are strictly structured, but its as a way of moving from one scene to another and giving some bones for the meat to hang on - I probably should have thought about this right away, since a lot of the story structure stuff I most agree with was written by Dan Harmon, who is in the comedy business.

It's a little harder for me to think about serious dramas that lack formal structure to them, in part because I don't tend to like serious dramas, and in part because I don't tend to like stories that lack structure. (Serious dramas that are developed from memoirs or which stick closely to true stories tend to be bereft of structure, because real life is not well-structured, which I think causes a lot of works adapted from real life to be less interesting and/or compelling.)
