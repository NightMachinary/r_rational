As a person who has Ender's Game basically memorized (proved it before on this subreddit), who has read every word in the Ender universe, and who has "What would Ender do?" tattooed on his hand---strong yes to the fact that Ender's Shadow is an enjoyable read, not quite to the claim that the overlapping scenes are faithful, and strong disapproval for how ES made Bean cool in a zero-sum sort of way by stealing a significant portion of the cool from Ender.

I basically view all the other Ender stories as fanfic. Ender In Exile has some transcendentally beautiful moments side-by-side with some crushingly awful "Does OSC not know who Ender /is/???" moments.
