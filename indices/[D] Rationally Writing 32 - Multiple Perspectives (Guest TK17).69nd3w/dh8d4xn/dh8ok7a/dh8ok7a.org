I actually hated those scenes in Ender's Shadow. It felt like they were painfully shoehorned. I seem to recall that after virtually every one of Bean's lines there would be a bit of internal monologue to justify the departure from what we would expect Bean to say.

Something like (no spoilers, not even close to the actual dialogue):

*Ender:* I hate all this responsibility, I wish somebody else could step up to the mantle.

*Bean:* There is no one else.

*Bean, to himself:* Except for me, for though I am even more intelligent than Ender and have surpassed him at every turn, I cannot be a leader.

*Ender:* I know, I just hate it sometimes.

By contrast, the scenes that weren't constrained by existing canon flowed much better.
