  and strong disapproval for how ES made Bean cool in a zero-sum sort of way by stealing a significant portion of the cool from Ender.

Yeah, Bean made Ender look silly and borderline incompetent many times through the reframing of the story. I don't mind the idea of the alternate perspective revealing new information in concept, but it was handled with mixed success in that case, and it's why I like practically every Bean book better than the first one.

  I basically view all the other Ender stories as fanfic. Ender In Exile has some transcendentally beautiful moments side-by-side with some crushingly awful "Does OSC not know who Ender is???" moments.

Ugh, Ender in Exile was so frustrating to read for exactly this reason. OSC broke my heart enough with his political views and some poor writing in his more recent books, but seeing him go back and mess with Ender was hardest to bear.

As someone who has been asking himself "What would Andrew do?" since 6th grade, I think you've finally given me an answer to the question I often get asked and have no response for: "What would you get a tattoo of?"
