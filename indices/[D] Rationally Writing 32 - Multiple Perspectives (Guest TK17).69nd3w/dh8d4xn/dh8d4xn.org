Since the topic of Ender's Game (and its sequels) came up, I'm a bit surprised that the Ender's Shadow parallel series managed to avoid mention. Ender's Shadow retells the events of Ender's Game from Bean's perspective (as well as providing a bit of backstory for Bean and what his life was like back on Earth). There are many scenes in Ender's Shadow that are faithful recreations of scenes we read in Ender's Game in terms of the objective reality that they present (the sequence of events is identical and the dialog is reproduced verbatim), but the book is written in a way that completely recontextualizes many of these scenes, using Bean's perspective to reveal more about what is going on than we saw when reading the book from Ender's perspective. In the interest of avoiding spoilers, I won't get into specific details or examples, but I highly recommend Ender's Shadow to those who have read and enjoyed Ender's Game.
