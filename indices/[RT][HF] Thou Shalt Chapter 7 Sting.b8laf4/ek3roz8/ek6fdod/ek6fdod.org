Really liked the interlude, the goblin has an interesting perspective. In a way, Lrfshmn is more perceptive than Learn. Much more able to see the subtle interplay of relationships and power structures than Learn. I hope that as Learn acclimates we'll see more of that from him. Certainly his analysis in this chapter hints towards that.
