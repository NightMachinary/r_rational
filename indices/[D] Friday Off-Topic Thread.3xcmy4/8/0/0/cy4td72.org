The choice isn't between 'do nothing' and 'only take metformin', but 'take metformin' and 'do other stuff' and 'take metformin and do other stuff too' and 'do nothing'.

(There is no reason you couldn't do metformin in addition to exercise and baby aspirin and - /cough/ good luck with that /cough/ - diet.)

The choice also isn't 'take metformin / have diarrhea the rest of your life / live on average a few months longer (but do you really want to)', but 'take it / the diarrhea goes away soon / live longer', 'take it / the diarrhea doesn't go away / you stop after a month or so', and 'don't take it and die earlier'.
