Hence why I blew you off in my first comment. It sounded as if you were trying to suggest that the field of *psychology* was illegitimate. Based on this comment, it's clear your issue is more with *psychiatry*, a related, but distinct, discipline. Not saying I agree with calling it fake, just saying that I'm much more firmly in the "psychology is a real science" camp than the "psychiatry is a real science" camp, for obvious reasons.
