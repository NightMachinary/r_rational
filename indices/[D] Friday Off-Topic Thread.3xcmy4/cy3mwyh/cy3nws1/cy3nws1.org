I think you ideally give them a name that they can alter for themselves as they grow and change as people. You don't know which name is going to be most advantageous, because you don't know what skills or aptitudes your child is going to be able to leverage. So when trying to find a name, you want to find one that's modifiable, which probably means that it's longer. So, for example, "Theodore" can be "Ted", "Teddy", or "Theo" depending on the circumstances (with none of the difficulty or social stigma of actually changing name).

An alternate consideration is having a name that's unique enough that search algorithms can find them or common enough that they can't, depending on preference. Getting confused with other people that have your same name is a hassle.

And stay away from names that reflect low class or leave unfavorable impressions.
