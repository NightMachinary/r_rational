Let's talk about rationality in regard to names.

Yesterday I heard an expecting couple discussing possible names for their child. They kept saying phrases like, "He doesn't feel like a Nathan."

From a rational standpoint, that's ridiculous. The reason your child doesn't feel like a certain name is because of your own personal biases. In fact, the most rational thing you could when naming a child is to research what name gives them the most advantages in their life. Does the name stand out? Is it memorable? What immediate emotions/thoughts will it illicit in others?

In your opinion, what is the most rational name you can give a child (boy or girl)?
