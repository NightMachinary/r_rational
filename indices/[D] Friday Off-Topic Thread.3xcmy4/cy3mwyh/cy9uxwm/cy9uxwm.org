From what I've read, the actual impact of a name on someone's life is pretty small, and the research is inconclusive. The main effects, if they exist, seem to come from names signaling that one is a member of a specific social group. And there might be an impact from having a really outlandish name.

So I'd argue the rational thing to do is probably to just pick a name that "feels right" for the kid. If you are a utilitarian, the utility benefit to you of being happy with your kids' name is probably going to outweigh any positive or negative impact on his life (provided you aren't set on naming him something like "Streetlamp Le Moose"). It also saves you the time, effort, and mental energy needed to actually do the research, which probably isn't going to provide you good data anyway because this is not a topic that can be easily tested. I mean, even if you discovered that, say, Davids did better than Nathans who were born in the 50's, what guarantee is it that the same would be true today? And I don't think a properly controlled version of that dataset exists in the first place.

So I'd say their method wasn't all that bad, really.
