I know of two issues that might play a role here.

First is the well known phenomenon that people with names that are earlier in the alphabet are more often cited in scientific papers; someone on lesswrong changed their name to aaron aarenson or something because of that.

Second reason for names is signalling; some names or etymological backgrounds for names eg. Kevin or Chantalle (in germany) are very low class; whereas white-collar middle/upper class use greek or latin triple or even quadruple names. (Philipp Alexander Aeneas or I recently heard of a Nike).
