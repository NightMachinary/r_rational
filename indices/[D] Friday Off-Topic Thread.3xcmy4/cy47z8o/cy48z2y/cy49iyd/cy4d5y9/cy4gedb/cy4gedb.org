I'm not talking about making the AGI friendly. I'm talking about making the AGI general and intelligent. And what I'm saying is that I think both of those things go hand in hand with making a being whose desires are worth consideration in moral equations (unlike a video game character or a microbe, to name two relatively uncontroversial examples; I personally think it's safe to also include plants and most animals in the "not worthy of moral consideration" category).
