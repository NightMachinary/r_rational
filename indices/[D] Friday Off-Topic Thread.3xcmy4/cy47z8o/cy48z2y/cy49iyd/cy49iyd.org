What qualities make humans morally relevant? I think an in-depth analysis of those qualities is key to making a good AGI. A lot of statements I see made about AGIs (such as the one you make elsewhere in the thread) seem willfully dense to me for that reason. If you can't make a "master algorithm" that can learn and generically make a good attempt to solve any problem put in front of it, then I think you're saying you can't make an AGI - but that's stupid, because we already have a (non-A)GI, a human.
