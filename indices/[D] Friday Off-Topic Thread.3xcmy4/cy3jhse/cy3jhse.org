WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!

A lot of things came together for me this week, but waking up by 4:00 to Skype into a meeting where the image and sound are grainy and everyone tries to teach each-other Babby's First AIXI while you're mostly still bleary... does not work.

So I now feel somewhat guilty on top of my normal mental and emotional background.

WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!

Edit: New episode of /If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device/ is out today! YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES!
