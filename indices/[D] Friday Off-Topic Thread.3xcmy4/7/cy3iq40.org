I've been replaying some old videogame RPGs in the last few months that I haven't played in 15ish years. The number of little details that I didn't consciously remember that have managed to sneak into my book world is higher than expected. From my Bonesaw/Mengele hybrid having more in common with Alhazad from Wild Arms than with either of them to my spooky frozen in evil miasma city looking like it got struck with a Hex from Breath of Fire IV.
