- The diarrhea goes away? Huh.

- I already actually exercise, at least if weight-lifting counts. I've been meaning, akrasia aside, to add back interval training (which I used to do until I moved and changed gyms).

- While I have an easy time "derping" and breaking a diet, my diet /defaults/ are actually somewhat good: salads when available and such.

- Did you see the comment about heritable irritable bowel syndrome? I don't want a medication that will make worse an uncomfortable problem I only developed as an adult /already/.
