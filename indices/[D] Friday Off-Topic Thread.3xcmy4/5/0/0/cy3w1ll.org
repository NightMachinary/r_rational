I just saw the first episode of the /The Magicians/, another Syfy adaptation. The pacing is markedly faster than the books, and a lot of plot elements are different. However, it's still pretty interesting and technically very well done. I am cautiously optimistic, and at the very least will be trying the next couple of episodes as well.
