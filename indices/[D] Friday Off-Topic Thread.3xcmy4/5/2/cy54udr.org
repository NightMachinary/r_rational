Have now watched expanse 1. Very good stuff in it, captures the 50/60s belter-culture feel that eg. Niven gives. Lots of awesome shots and atmospheric details that establish the world. Will watch more.

Minor nitpick is of course that the worldbuilding is flawed... Shipping the entire Ceres ice to earth/mars, using Ceres as giant earth-style trading port, shipping ice in giant ships etc. is all vestigial stuff that is no longer thought to be practical.
