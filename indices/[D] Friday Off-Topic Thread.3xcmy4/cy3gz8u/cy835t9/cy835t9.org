Agree with what's been said: way above my expectations for SyFy, some worldbuilding glitches. The scarcity of water is exaggerated beyond believability. We now know Mercury has billions of tons of water, as does the moon, at its poles. There is also abundant water in c-type asteroids nearer the sun. Also, is possible to recycle water fairly easily in enclosed living spaces, so it's not a particularly believable way to establish a chokehold over a rebellious colony at a distance. That said, is great that it's hard enough sci-fi that one can criticize that sort of point with a straight face. There's no FTL in the first episode at least, and it does try to give a sense of the scale of the solar system.
