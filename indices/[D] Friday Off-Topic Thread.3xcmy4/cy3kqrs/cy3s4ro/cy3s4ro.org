Alex St. John thinks that we're pursuing AI [[http://www.alexstjohn.com/WP/2015/06/24/no-azimov-ai/][the wrong way]]. He argues, essentially, that while simulating biological processes is possible digitally (per [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Symbolic_Analysis_of_Relay_and_Switching_Circuits][Shannon's proof]]), it's hopelessly inefficient compared to the massively-parallel atomic-level physics tricks than life can pull with organic chemistry.

He proposes that minds, of flatworms or of humans, don't operate like computers at all. Our ability to simulate them in simple or specific situations is, from his perspective, essentially a parlor trick: We're fooling ourselves into believing that computers think like animals, rather than actually creating computers that do so.

Agree or not, it's a thought-provoking read... even if he can't spell Asimov.
