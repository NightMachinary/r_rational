  He proposes that minds, of flatworms or of humans, don't operate like computers at all. Our ability to simulate them in simple or specific situations is, from his perspective, essentially a parlor trick: We're fooling ourselves into believing that computers think like animals, rather than actually creating computers that do so.

I think he really needs to say what kind of "computers" he means. From the theoretical perspective, it's all Turing-complete, which is why that theoretical perspective is largely uninformative.

EDIT: Oh God my head. Why did I click on that link? That was one of the stupidest things I've read in a while. I mean, I've got a friend who claims cognition has to involve infinite-precision real numbers and Lebesgue measures, but that's why he's designing a programming language semantics linked to physics. He's /wrong/, but he at least manages to be wrong without being a /fucking crackpot/ like the guy who simultaneously claims that the real universe uses infinite-precision real numbers (it sure might) /and/ "computes" with them (which is flatly impossible).
