I feel like part of the confusion is that everyone expects "general intelligence" to be a single "master algorithm" (a Google talk actually has this title), whereas I think there actually exists a large space of learning algorithms capable of inducing arbitrary programs (causal structures) with greatly varying degrees of compression/generalization/transfer learning. And even once you've got one of those, you have to hook it up to good perceptual algorithms.

So we should really ask two questions: which algorithms, with what degree of implementation efficiency?
