I have plans for November that aren't exactly NaNoWriMo, but probably close enough for the purposes of this thread. I've been working on a novel for a long time; last year, I finished the fourth first draft of it¹. I'll be trying to rewrite at least the first of three parts of this story for good this November. Once I'm done with that first part, I'd like to try to recruit proofreaders from this subreddit, mostly because I've gotten some very good critiques here in the past.²

As for the story: the first part is going to be half clockpunk dystopia and half board game gambling. If anyone is interested in proofreading, reply to this comment or send me a PM, and I'll notify you when the need for proofreading arises, though I also intend to make a post about it at that time.

You're also welcome to contact me if you want to talk about clockpunk or board game design! Only one of the five games that will be featured in the first part has fully functioning rules at this point, and I'd love to increase that number.

--------------

¹: Yes, the fourth first draft is still a first draft.

²: Stories I've previously posted to this subreddit include /The Library Unpublished/, /On the Continuity of Consciousness/ and a number of short stories for the biweekly challenges.
