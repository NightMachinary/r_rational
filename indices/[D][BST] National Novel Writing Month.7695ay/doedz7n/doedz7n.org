Hm. I've got a couple story ideas bouncing around in my head lately, so I think I'll give nano a try! Now it's just a question of whether to aim for this as something to force me to really put my nose to the grindstone on the idea I've been putting more work into, or whether to focus on the other idea as something self-contained and less important to experiment with over Nano so that I don't rush the first idea...
