I'm planning on writing a sentient dungeon story and I'm hoping to make it a much lighter and happier tone than what I usually write, so I decided to go with a child as the MC. This brought up a problem I didn't really think about at the time...

*How do you write children rationally irrational?*

HPMOR, MoL and Pokemon:OoS all seem to solve this by making the children more mature for their age because of special circumstances. I would like the children in my story to be normal 10 years old. Not stupid, but definitely far from rational.

Any tips or advice on furthering a plot in a rational way with irrational characters? Or how to learn how write irrational characters?
