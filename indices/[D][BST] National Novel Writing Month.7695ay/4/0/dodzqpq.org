1. Children use simpler vocabulary. At ten years old, it /isn't/ uniformly simple, because some longer words will stick in their minds and get used to demonstrate mastery (sometimes to the level of annoyance). Still, it might be good to run dialog through [[https://xkcd.com/simplewriter/][the xkcd Simple Writer]] to check whether you're speaking like a child wouldn't. Children also favor sentences that are less structured, though some of that starts to disappear by age 10.
2. Children know less. Constrain your references and if you find yourself reaching for a bit of knowledge that you possess, think about whether a 10-year-old would have it. It helps to check against what you knew at 10, or maybe ask a 10-year-old if you have one handy.
3. Children experience the same cognitive biases that adults do, but worse (generally speaking). Halo effect, hindsight bias, conformity, typical mind fallacy, etc. are all present in a 10-year-old but usually not corrected for in the ways that an adult might.
4. Kids usually have poor impulse control, which sometimes gets attributed to "stronger" emotions, though I don't know where the social science is on that. It's probably good to think about the imp of the perverse with some frequency.
