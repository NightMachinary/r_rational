November is terrible novel time for me (exams!), but I might try and do a mini version to polish up my supernatural romance novel that I mostly finished in January (that may never get published if my coauthor never gets around to editing it, but I've made peace with that).

Thanks for the story circle method - I'm working out a base plot for my werewolf novel, and it's good to have more ways to think about these things.

Here's a question: I want to write a story about my werewolf, but all the "good ideas" I think of are really about her helping another character go through /his/ own story circle. Which kind of robs her of her agency/primacy in the story in a weird way, since /her story/ ends up being about some other dude. Anyone have tips for how I can move from her being the foil of the non-werewolf to the non-werewolf being her foil, or should I just make peace that my "werewolf novel" is going to be more of a "novel with a werewolf supporting character"?
