Thanks, that's really helpful! I appreciate it especially because it must have taken a long time to write.

At the moment if you put me in a Saw-style torture room and told me to write it, and the sooner it was finished the less limbs I lost, the plot would go like this:

Fiona the lawyer is a werewolf, but she is for all intents and purposes a regular human with a link to the supernatural underworld. Malik, a demon who looks human but for his bat ears, feathery wings, and tail goes to her for help "immigrating" into her city. He wants to rent a shop front and use it to sell specialty demon wares. She agrees to help him. He starts making escalating demands: once the papers are done, he has her help him with his masquerade (basically, advice on socially acceptable hats that cover his ears and appropriately padded shirts), assist in ordering things from human suppliers, and so on.

Then one day Malik phones her and says that the police are snooping around and demanding to enter his shop. She explains about warrants and stuff and then Malik idly wonders if it would have anything to do with the human he killed and ate a few days earlier. Fiona is stuck in between two places: she's trying to get a good reputation with the supernatural creatures she wants to help so badly, but she never really was hit with the ugly reality of /murder/ before, and to be fair she never did tell Malik that cannibalism wasn't on (in retrospect, she reflects that a conversation she had with him about his "preferred diet" could have been interpreted as endorsing cannibalism).

Malik's father is a very powerful, very protective gargoyle who lives in town, so if she tried to kick Malik back to the underworld it would go very badly for her (she probably attempts this at first), so she's kind of forced to continue this.

She realises how frighteningly naive she has been about the supernatural thing, since as a whole werewolves are very loving, kind and nurturing. Maybe she goes to the Werewolf High Council for help (????), but she ultimately manages to get Malik to realise that eating "wild" humans isn't acceptable but reluctantly admits that "farmed" human meat he picks up on the "other side" would be acceptable. Malik probably ends up going to prison on some smallish charge (she has a werewolf who works in that prison keep an eye on him?), and upon his release becomes a "productive" member of society.

The end of the story would probably consist of Malik's father introducing William, his vampire master, to Fiona after Malik's glowing recommendation. Although vampires kill and eat people they tend to do it pretty subtly, and regardless, unlike Malik, William has a lot of social influence in town and this could be her big chance to get noticed by the underworld creatures.

The end result is Fiona probably realises that if she's going to be the supernatural lawyer she always dreamed of, she'd better learn to accept that some supernatural creatures really aren't that nice, or she won't be able to help the nice ones.

.... wow, I was not actually expecting to write it all like that, I was expecting one little piddly paragraph.

I was worried about it becoming Malik's story but I think given the plot beats it does look a lot more like Fiona's, and Malik certainly doesn't come across sympathetically. The big issues with it at the moment are there's probably too much Hollywood Law going on in the above, and the thought of the story being about Fiona abandoning her principles could be fine if the principle was something like "honesty is the best policy" except the principle being abandoned is "hanging out with murderers is a bad thing", which doesn't seem like a great ending. Then again, maybe she just wants to nudge them: perhaps werewolves have been nudging vampires in particular for centuries.
