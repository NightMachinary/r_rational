My first instinct would be to have that "help" blow up in their face, or perhaps just have an unexpected turn. That is, it /starts out/ with trying to help a friend, but it ends up ... doing something else. Presuming that these are already established characters, it's hard to say, but if I were working from a blank slate:

- Protagonist is the proactive friend trying to set her beleaguered pal up on a date (or whatever), and this works ... only for this to be a turning point, because the protag realizes that she's been missing something from her life, maybe the exact thing that that she was trying to help her pal achieve. (And maybe this realization is the end of her story, or maybe that's just the call to adventure.)
- Protagonist is the proactive friend trying to set her beleaguered pal up on a date (or whatever), but it turns out that she's doing this more for her own (social?) benefit than his, and she gets called out on it, which sends her on some soul-searching, and some PLOT happens, after which she has become a better person for it.
- Protagonist is the proactive friend trying to set her beleaguered pal up on a date (or whatever), but around the end of the first act he confesses that really, he's in love with her, and then she needs to grapple with her muddled feelings of attraction, or asexuality, or problems with intimacy, or her messy life that won't allow a boyfriend, or getting her soon-to-be-ex to actually sign the divorce papers, or ... something like that.
- Protagonist is the proactive friend trying to set her beleaguered friend up on a date (or whatever), only to meet the prospective date's counterpart proactive friend. They work together trying to set their mutual friends up, and end up falling for each other, making the "helping friends" plot into the B-plot.

I think the real problem you have isn't so much one of agency, but maybe tension, because your protagonist doesn't have terribly much at stake, and isn't going through their own character development arc. If you follow the story circle, the "zone of comfort" might be "helping a friend with a problem", which is the character's default state, and you need to figure out what's not right about that default state, which isn't necessarily the "helping someone" part, but "too giving" might be a real problem they have to work through, or "too invested in other peoples' lives", or "living vicariously" are reasonable angles you might take.
