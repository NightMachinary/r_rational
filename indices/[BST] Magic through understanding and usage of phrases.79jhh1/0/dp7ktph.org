"In order to pool enough mana in our hands in order to cast the spell, you concentrate and chant col. Depending on how good you are at manapulation, you will always collect enough mana for the spell. An inefficient amount will lead to a smaller spell-output. Yelling helps, "

I don't see a real reason for yelling. It sounds like intent and concentration matter more with, maybe, a sharp end point or the ability to make a sharp distinction between the differing parts of magic.

In that case you could simply have a bell or stomp your foot or do any number of things, none of which would /have/ to be physical or give a tell to your enemies.

This seems supported by what you described as lvl 3 mages. But it also seems like a lvl 3 mage might be able to make up their own spells, just as long as they knew what they wanted. Like making a ball of metal with a fireball inside of it that explodes on a timer.

There is also probably a lot of interesting things in the whole God/Satan thing.

It feels a lot like HPMOR and the whole atlantis thing, although that isn't a bad thing, just something I realized.

Hope you keep on keeping on!
