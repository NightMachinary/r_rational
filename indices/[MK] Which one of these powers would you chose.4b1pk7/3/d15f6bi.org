I would not go for any of the powers that describe themselves as requiring me to visualize something, since I fall pretty far on [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/][the low end of the visual imagery scale]]. I am likewise skeptical of those powers which promise I will develop some sort of "instinctual feel" for using them once I acquire them; my Outside-View experience is that every time in the past I've been told "oh, you'll pick it up with a little practice," that has not been the case.

My first instinct is that Perens Miography (make more of substances) seems like it has a lot of potential.
