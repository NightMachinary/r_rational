If Shitoko Kinismus and Bradium Kinismus synergize properly, meaning phantom limbs count as your skin or a simple tool, then that might be a winner. You can do stealth punch spam without hurting yourself, and then make things explode or fly as a projectile. Phantom limbs only transmit force, so delaying that means no one feels a thing and it doesn't make a sound. If you can't really move without giving away your position, just stack the force from attempted choking and implode their neck. You can fashion grenades/mines and launch them. I think you could even fly/hover by making a scooping motion and catching yourself by the armpits. I wonder if you could delay force on your self. If you could jump, mimic a jump in the air, and have an upside down phantom jump hitting your feet, you might be able to double jump and even store an arbitrary amount of them for later.
