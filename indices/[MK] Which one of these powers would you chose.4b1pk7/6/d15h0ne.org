I'd go for the color changing one. It appears to have no limits, so if you want to, you can turn yourself and the entire island a single color, and just leave your opponents (and your own food stores) easy to pick out. This is probably a bigger advantage than picking a magic power for direct combat - none of them are deadlier than a gun, and most of them aren't even deadlier than a solid tree branch.
