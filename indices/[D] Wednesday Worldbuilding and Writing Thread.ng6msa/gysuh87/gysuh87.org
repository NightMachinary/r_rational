*WIZARDS ON MARS.*

Scenario: the Wizards of Harry Potter universe decide they want to colonise Mars. Wizarding Britain leads the effort, but other Wizarding countries support it. Their goal, have 10 000 wizards living permanently and comfortably on Mars by 2031.

This is long after the events of the latest HP book. Basically present day.

Assuming the Wizards do not want to involve Muggles directly, but are not above stealing scientific and technological information from them, */how could they do it?/*
