- Does magic work on Mars? This is /vitally/ important to know. For the purposes of this post, I shall assume that the answer is 'yes'

- Transport is the first problem. Wizards can go a long way with Apparation, and a longer way with Portkeys; but Mars is a far, far longer way than they've ever gone before, and will be hard to aim at, besides.

It's possible that a sufficiently motivated wizard can get there in an instant - /if/ he has a (specifically enchanted) Target Stone placed there so that he can teleport to "near to the Target Stone". Said stone can be slipped into the next Muggle Mars rover in order to get it there (a few spells and the Muggles will never notice a thing).

Having got there, of course, he's left a second suitably enchanted Target Stone back on Earth; so he can easily /commute/. With time, he will get more used to the travel spells, and can shift back and forth more easily.

The ability to commute back to Earth on a grocery run takes a /lot/ of the danger out of Mars colonisation. In fact - why develop a self-sustaining colony at all? ...I guess it could be draining to go back and forth all the time. Very well, then. They can bring a colony of House Elves along to do the manual labour - the growing of food and so forth. A few sacks of fertilizer, a few breeding pairs of cattle (for steaks and milk)... a few more farming supplies... a couple of Clear Air spells to deal with the lack of oxygen... and a wizarding family can build themselves an estate on Mars, where they can safely do a few experiments with the more, ah, /dangerous/ spells without threatening Earth.

...not the really, /really/ dangerous spells. Just the /mildly/ dangerous spells.
