While it would be useful, I think Goodberry is the real standout as both healing and food, I don't think it would be a world changer. The feat limits you to casting each spell once per day.

It would boost the economy saving lives and saving on materials and time, such as Bonfire creating a large fire for one minute with no fuel, but cantrips and 1st level are too limited as is. If you say they can cast the cantrips unlimited times per day (I think that is how it works in 5e) for the full classes it gets much better.

Too many spells are just combat focused. Fudge the spells so they have better non-combat uses such as use acid ball to acid treat metals or Presdigitation's cleaning also sterilizes would be another great jump forward. With unlimited cantrips this would kick off a revolution, in specific areas.

The real revolution would be having custom made spells that replace specialist knowledge, tools, or materials so they can leap frog development. Improve a microscope/telescope (for 1 minute), condition soil, sterilize equipment, find a particular material, control fire/fire, or control/catalyze a particular chemical reaction for a better or otherwise unmakeable end product.
