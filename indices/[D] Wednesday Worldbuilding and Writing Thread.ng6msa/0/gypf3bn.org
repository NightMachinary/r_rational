A lot of people like to break/build D&D universes looking at the high level stuff (i.e. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1u4de0/the_tippyverse_a_dd_35_campaign_setting_where_the/][Tippyverse]])... but I think this is pretty easy to counter by arguing that the high level stuff is vanishingly rare and gets exponetially rarer the higher level you look.

But what about on the low-end? D&D 5e has the [[http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:magic-initiate][Magic Initiate feat]] with one feat, a person can learn two cantrips and 1 1st level spell from a class. Let's say that most people in this hypothetical universe don't have the equivalent of a PC level, but they can manage with 1-3 years of training learn the equivalent of a feat such as a level of magic prowess equivalent to a Magic Initiate and thus learn 1-2 cantrips and maybe a 1st level spell (or alternatively learn minor [[http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:telekinetic][TK]] or minor [[http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:telepathic][telepathy]] or a[[http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:ritual-caster][few spells as rituals]]). What does the economy look like?

Even with Medieval levels of education and labor specialization (i.e. 80%-90% uneducated farmers), 1-2 cantrips and maybe a 1st level spell in the hands of an artisan middle class (maybe about 1/20 people) could change a lot of things. Shape Water can only temporarily turn water to ice, but with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakhch%C4%81l][little clever engineering]] this could be used to produce normal ice. Or ray of frost might work. With Druidcraft and Goodberry, someone could feed 10 people a day with just a berry bush. And its not RAW, but presumably you could mix the Goodberries into other foods and make them stretch more. And clean fresh water was a major limiting factor but Purify Food and Drink and Create Water both majorly help with this, create Water can do 10 gallons of water a day which is enough for the caster and 9 others. Mold Earth can make ditch digging much faster.

Normal artisans (or other skilled/educated labor) learn a cantrip or two to aid their work. The local tailor might learn Mending to reduce the need for manual sewing. The Laundry man uses prestidigitation. The Town Crier learns Thaumaturgy to make their announcements more easily heard and sound more impressive (and also works as a part time healer). The courtier or judge becomes Telepathic. And so on.

So what economic roles makes sense for a collective magical middle class that knows a cantrip or two per person? What specialized roles or tricks do you get the don't exist in a medieval economy? Anything that breaks the world entirely and makes it no longer medieval? (i.e. Goodberry spam means Druid communes become the dominant social structure). Anything that gradually breaks the world and triggers an industrial/magic revolution or societal shift? (i.e. create water and mold earth irrigation boosts agriculture productivity and mass usage of mending boosts the usage/value of crafted goods enough to shift labor specialization enough to get the equivalent benefits as the industrial revolution)
