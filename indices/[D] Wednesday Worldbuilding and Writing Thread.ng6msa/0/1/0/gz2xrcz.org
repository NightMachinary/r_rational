That is an excellent point... One complicating factor on urbanization is that goodberry is exclusively a Druid spell, so anyone who learns to cast it, even if they are only an initiate, would need to develop (and possibly maintain) a connection to nature. I think the conflicting pressures for nature-attuned Goodberry casters and for urbanization would result in something unique and ahistorical... perhaps nature heavy suburbanization? Or urban areas heavy on green spaces and parks and gardens? Or the image of forest elves with settlement smoothly blended with nature?

As for create food and water... I was thinking that as a 3rd level spell it would be too rare, if higher spell levels get exponentially rarer a caster that can use 3rd level spells might be around 1/400 in rarity.
