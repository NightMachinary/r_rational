The food spells being readily available completely destroy feudal society. A single caster with goodberry can feed 10 people and a single caster with Create Food and Water can feed 15 people.

With just 5% of the population capable of casting one of those you go from 80% farmers->15%. If you had 10% capable of casting it you turn normal food into a luxury/spellcasting/emergency good and could have like 1% farmers.

Almost by definition getting rid of all the farmers would stop you from being a feudal society, and the fact that >90% of the population is probably going to be in cities would make non-city nobles irrelevant at the very least which might very well turn the setting into a collection of city states.

Since you can (arguably) purify all the waste with a few people capable of using Purify Food and Water that means that sewage would no longer be a problem, which in turn means that there is no limit to the size of the city beyond the fact that they would need outside building materials.

Altogether this change would presumably result in massive megacities with mostly empty wilderness outside (with a possible side effect of renaissance and technological advancement over time).
