RAW Floating Disk seems busted. Put a plank with counterweight on it, walk until just under 20ft away from the disk, move. The disk accelerates at whatever speed will prevent you from getting more than 20ft ahead. Given straight roads this should allow very fast transport.

Feather Fall seems like it should allow for massless flight, since it caps /downward/ but not /upward/ velocity. Cast it on small creatures strapped to a wheel, and then spin that wheel as fast as you can. This seems generally useless but was too cool not to mention.

Given that food and water is a solved problem with only a minor fraction of the population taking 1-3 years of training, Unseen Servant and the various healing abilities also seem like staples. With plenty of free time and explosive population growth, I would expect everyone to train up if at all possible.
