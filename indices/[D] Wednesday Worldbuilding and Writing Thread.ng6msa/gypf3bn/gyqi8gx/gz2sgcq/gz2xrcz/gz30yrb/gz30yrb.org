Yeah, I'm daft. I thought Create Food and Water was level 1 for some reason. It being level 3 takes it off the table completely and leaves only goodberry.

That said, there isn't anything in D&D that I can see that actually requires Druids to be around nature at all to stay a druid. They might have to be in nature to learn to be a druid in the first place (which would lead to massive druid schools in the wilderness), but nothing in the rulebook really implies that they can't just be shipped off to the city afterwards.

With only druids capable of supplying food its also possible they would create an artificial monopoly around food production which would result in a significant amount of the population staying farmers which would make the changes far less significant.
