If you have any that really need to be added, split apart, or removed, let me know. I don't have any interest in making the generator more robust in terms of the simple javascript it uses, but adding things to an array is quick and easy. (I'll probably be raiding the Mutants and Masterminds source book to figure out which obvious things I'm missing.)

Edit: Added some more.
