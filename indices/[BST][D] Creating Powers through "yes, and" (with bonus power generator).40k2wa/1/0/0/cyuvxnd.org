Added those (or variants on them). I enjoy the wackiness of Thursday, though I have a feeling that during character generation I'm going to see it too often and drop it. I did add it though. In a world where every character is generated using this generator, there are going to be a whole class of Thursday-based hero and villains.

Edit: Just got this one:

#+begin_quote
  Time travel. Yes, but Thursday.
#+end_quote

I really like that this suggests a whole story all by itself. There's a man who can time travel, but not on (or to) Thursdays. So naturally he waits for every Thursday with a certain sense of dread, knowing that's the one day that he's helpless. And naturally Thursday is always when things go to pot.
