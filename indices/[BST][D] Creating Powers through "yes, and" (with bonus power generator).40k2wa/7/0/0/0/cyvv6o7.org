Oh, come on, don't say that, we're just getting started! The superhuman in question could be a suicidal transhumanist, who designed their first copy as an "heir" with no intention of reverting.

Each copy from then on is intentionally designed with no self-preservation instinct, instead caring only about doing good/saving the world/the plot of the story. Each one only continues until they decide they've outlived their usefulness, then designs a successor to suit the situation and activates their power. Each one is different, either subtly or dramatically, but preserves certain core personality elements from one to the next that gradually evolve over the course of the story. Some might be clever plotters, others suave negotiators, others philosophical grand strategists, and still others dutiful protectors.

...I might write this. I'll probably write this.
