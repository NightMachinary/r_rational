Let's see.

*Healing. Yes, but absorption.*\\
Oooh. I can think of a couple of nasty things with that combo. Everything from "heal your organs by absorbing half their mass" to "heal your cancer/wound by absorbing it into myself" to "healing via drinking blood" to "psychic healing by deleting/absorbing memories".

*Cloning. Yes, and feedback.*\\
You can make unlimited clones! But you get the real-time sensory inputs of all of them at once, plus your own. Or, on a more positive note, you can spin them off into their own lives and re-absorb them later, integrating their memories.

*Shapeshifting. Yes, but self.*\\
Hmm. Most shapeshifting tends to be of the self anyway, so what would be a different interpretation? Perhaps something like the skinwalker/Animorph problem, where if you stay in a different form for too long, you get stuck? Or maybe the longer you stay in a form, the more it affects your mental state and sense of identity? Or possibly you can take on the appearance of other people, but part of their psyche is permanently lodged in the back of your mind, so you go through life with an ever-increasing number of voices in your head?
