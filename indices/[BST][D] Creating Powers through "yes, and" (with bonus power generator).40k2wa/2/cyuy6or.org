Benefits of consecutive yes-ands probably level off after the first thousand or so.

As someone who has done a bit of improv, the best use of "yes, and" I know is for when multiple people have cool ideas that they really want to use, and rather than fighting for whose cool ideas get used, everyone takes the coolest bits of their ideas and yes-ands them together. "Yes, we're going shopping for guns with silly names, and also you have this giant booger hanging out of your nose and I'm trying to be painfully polite about it." This is only a tiny slice of ways to combine concepts, and also only a tiny slice of grammatical uses of "yes, and."

The "I asked you for cough syrup and you came back with a zebra?" line is another good use of saying yes, where the speaker is riffing off the person with the zebra. They didn't come in with the cool idea of needing some cough syrup, it just seemed like a funny place the story could go. This is not yes-and as combining ideas of different origins, it's yes-and as generating apposite ideas to continue what others have started.

One can try to apply these to superpowers. The first "yes, and" would be more like how Sanderson smushed a couple of different ideas for magic systems into Mistborn, or how one might build superheroes with multiple gimmicks out of a bucket of individual gimmicks that you think are cool. "Yes, our protagonist rides a zebra (riding a zebra = cool), and they also can make the zebra they ride super big and strong (making things big and strong = cool), and the zebra can breathe fire (breathing fire = cool)." The second "yes, and" would be calling on your creativity to fill in what creates character, or conflict, or comedy, in concordance with the current creation. "We need someone to be super-strong. Yes, so how about they can only use their super-strength while wearing elegant clothing, and if the clothing gets ruined they lose their powers? Yes, and let's make them totally messy when off the clock."

The prompts from your generator generate results that look more like the results of the second process, because the first part of the prompt is usually cool, and the second part is usually dramatic. But the skills exercised are sort of a mish-mash. If it turns out well, I'm more inclined to attribute it to using yes-and skills /on/ the prompt, rather than putting "yes, and" /in/ the prompt.
