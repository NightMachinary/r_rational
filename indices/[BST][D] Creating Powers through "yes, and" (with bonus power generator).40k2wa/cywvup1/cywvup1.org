I'd replace 'but' with prepositions, either individually or as a string. If additives make for interesting complications, then the subtractive 'but' precludes interesting directions.

For example:

- Earth Manipulation. Yes, with/for/of/by/as/from heat.

Could mean: Earth is manipulated via using thermodynamic currents; constant active manipulation of earth is required for the power user's body to warm itself; only the heat of Earth can be manipulated. The rest have similar meanings - the advantage of a string of prepostitions is one can take the most interesting and run with it.
