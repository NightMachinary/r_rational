  Interacting with any person negates your illusion powers, for a length of time dependent on how meaningful the interaction was. Handing a cashier payment will depower you for minutes, a job interview will depower you for hours, and going on a date will depower you for days.

Sounds like the sort of superpower a social recluse would get, if it's powered by their wish to hide themselves.
