Perhaps instead, when they teleport they absorb anything they've touched into their body, a little like The Fly. The first time they teleported they appeared naked as they had absorbed their clothes and now their skin was cloth-like, their feet rubber and leather.

They end up this patchwork, composite figure; their body a mosaic of different textures and materials. They can't carry equipment as guns and melee weapons are absorbed into them. If this were Worm, they'd look a little like Weld; definitely a case 53. If they don't jump then the soles of their feet absorb the material they were standing on, leaving rough footprint shapes behind. The absorption also grants a limited regeneration effect as the new material is used to replace the damaged skin.

They've never teleported with a person; they don't dare. Being grappled terrifies them, so they teleport rapidly and fight with hit and run attacks. The lack of ranged attacks frustrates them but their mild 'shaker' ability to damage terrain allows them to take advantage of their surroundings: absorbing parts of objects so that they fall, weakening floors, damaging sensitive equipment.

A powerful, flexible teleport and a durable, strong body; yet massively cursed too. Fun :)
