Some equivalent to the Manton effect. Though I've always hated that Worm's answer was just "this was intentionally nerfed" because it seems like a bad cop-out. Right now I'm thinking some kind of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation?from=Main.KiAttacks][ki-based magic]] which would place more natural limits; if teleportation is the result of ki manipulation, then the reason you can't teleport into someone is that at a mechanical level you're fighting against their [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura][Battle Aura]].

(I'm not really opposed to just answering "why not just" with "no reason, go right ahead" and creating a horrifically deadly villain, but it's probably not a power I'd give to a hero and the story would have to be structured right for it.)
