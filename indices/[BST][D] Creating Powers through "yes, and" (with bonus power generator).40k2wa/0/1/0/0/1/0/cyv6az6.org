Only if the telefragger teleports naked or with spandex armor. If they can take bulkier armor with them, they could do something like hide in a cardboard box and chop rectangular chunks out of everything.

Come to think of it, an interesting power would be telefragging using a Terminator-style sphere of disintegration. It'd also make for plot tension when the teleporter couldn't jump into a broom closet, or next to a hostage, without causing serious damage.
