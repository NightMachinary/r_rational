#+begin_quote
  Teleportation. Yes, and absorption.
#+end_quote

Your "leaving" body disappears into nothing, leaving a vacuum. Your "arriving" body is transmuted from the nearest bodyweight-worth of matter, meaning that you arrive in a spherical vacuum, and are instantly hit by the in-rushing air. You need a protective suit and precise targeting to avoid killing people or injuring yourself whenever you teleport.

#+begin_quote
  Illusions. Yes, but isolation.
#+end_quote

Interacting with any person negates your illusion powers, for a length of time dependent on how meaningful the interaction was. Handing a cashier payment will depower you for minutes, a job interview will depower you for hours, and going on a date will depower you for days.

#+begin_quote
  Cloning. Yes, but crowds.
#+end_quote

You can be at most 1/10 of a crowd. If it is you plus 17 other people, you can't clone yourself at all (because 2/19 > 1/10). If there are 18-26 people, you can create one clone of yourself (2/20 to 2/28 <= 1/10). If you are in a crowd of 9999 other people, you can make 1110 clones (1111/11110 = 1/10)

#+begin_quote
  Precognition. Yes, and fear.
#+end_quote

This would be a granted power instead of a personal one. When you touch someone, you /automatically/ give them a precognitive vision of the next disaster that would befall them (if their actions wouldn't have been altered). In addition to granting the vision, you /can/ also give them a more-or-less specific phobia of that thing. Someone would be trapped in a collapsed building in a few years? Bam, claustrophobic. Someone would be bit by a black widow in a few months? Bam, arachnophobic.
