Yeah. Telematt (that's his name) starts every fight by teleporting down into the ground and absorbing stone in order to give himself a shell of armor. Or he teleports into the support beams of whatever structure he's in so that he can bring it to the ground. Or uses the absorbed matter in order to throw up a shield if he can't teleport. I don't know, there's a lot to work with. When he's done with a battle, the area around him looks like Swiss cheese.
