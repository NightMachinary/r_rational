  What if your precognition worked pretty well until about 38 years out, when everything just turned black?

I've seen entire series based on exactly this. Whether the precogs are mutants, psychics, or magic, there's nothing like an inexorably-approaching wall, precipice, or breakpoint to add some tension to a slow-ish plot. Sometimes it's an actual problem that needs addressing, and sometimes it's merely The Monster At The End Of This Book. It can also be a reason for a hero/villain team-up.
