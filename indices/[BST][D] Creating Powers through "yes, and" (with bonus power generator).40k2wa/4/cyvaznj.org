  Probabilty manipulation. Yes, and isolation.
#+end_quote

Control over fate increases as a function of how dissociated from the world one is. The less you care about something, the more you can influence it.

#+begin_quote
  Lasers. Yes, and equivalence.
#+end_quote

Radiation emited = radiation accepted; no storage, too much energy expenditure will literally cause all photon-mediated bonds in user to cease. Buuuuut, if you can shine 27 gigawatts of light on them, they can repurpose that energy in any arbitrarily complex pattern you can describe to them. This power isn't about arbitrary amounts of output, it's about arbitrary control of output.

  Time travel. Yes, but time.
#+end_quote

... Hm. I could put a low-effort joke about the generator and drug use here, but instead, how about this.

Power to travel in any arbitrary temporal direction. Inability to do so automatically. Subject to the contraint of non-replacement - the user's conciousness travels, not their body. So, the user still experiences time flowing, but for them to flow though time, they must remember to swim. If they stop concentrating on moving from one second to the next, they won't. If they don't focus on keeping the pace steady, it will slow down or speed up. If they want a certain outcome, they might just subconciously travel towards it. They are everywhere they are, and everywhen they live. As a consequence of that sovereigntity, everyone and everything else is dead. The limits of who those other people can become is no longer what they strive for; merely the time traveller's creativity. The world is a pattern that can - will - one day be fully extrapolated, and once explored, it will offer nothing more.

Only a series of blind alleys and deaths leading to a time when the world is alive once more, and only - /only/ - because down those paths, the time traveller is dead, and therefore cannot observe it.
