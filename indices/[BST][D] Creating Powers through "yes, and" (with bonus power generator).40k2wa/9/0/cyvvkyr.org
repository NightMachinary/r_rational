"Cloning, but metabolism" could be interpreted as a kind of superpowered mitosis, where the superhuman in question has to give up half their mass to clone themselves. Obviously this only works if something allows the superhuman to /survive/ the loss of half their mass. Anyway, the superhuman would have to eat a whole bunch to restore the mass, meaning prep time is a must.
