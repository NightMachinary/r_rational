It's not that I don't take those lessons, it's that I'm not looking at them right now. This is a post about complexity in magic systems; there's no reason for me to bring anything emotional or character-driven into it, because that's a different part of the master equation.

And I do (halfway) disagree with Sanderson. He says that limitations are good because they force struggle, increase tension, and add depth, which is all true. He explicitly says that complexity is not the point of the limitations though. In my opinion, he's missing part of the underlying principle; complexity is only good when it's emergent. Costs and limitations tend to give emergent complexity, but they're not the only thing that does that.

Take Sanderson's /Alloy of Law/. The primary character, Wax Landrium, has two abilities; one is to increase or decrease his weight, while the other is to push metal away from him. My argument is that this is more compelling and more interesting than him only having /one/ of those abilities, and the reason is that the interaction of these two things adds a pleasing, emergent complexity.

This is as in contrast to a character like Superman, who has two powers like flight and super-strength which provides additional complexity but not /emergent/ complexity. Or (as Sanderson says) having magic require a talisman that every character has all the time and isn't relevant to the plot.

So ... yes, powers should be emotionally resonant or dissonant, or otherwise compel the drama in interesting ways. Powers should be amenable to description within the text. But I consider that orthogonal to the point that I was trying to make and I don't think that this perspective /precludes/ either of those things in the slightest.
