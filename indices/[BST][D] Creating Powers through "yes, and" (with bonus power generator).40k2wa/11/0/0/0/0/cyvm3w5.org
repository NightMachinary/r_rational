  It's not that I don't take those lessons, it's that I'm not looking at them right now. This is a post about complexity in magic systems; there's no reason for me to bring anything emotional or character-driven into it, because that's a different part of the master equation.

Which is an obvious issue to your replies. I am noting things and they are unimportant to you, so you are tackling more interesting points to you that I didn't make. It's not very useful. Why talk to me if you don't want to address my arguments?

Powers are inherently emotional and character driven, and work better when visual. Part of making a good power is considering the factors that make it work well, just as say, part of building a good car is about considering how humans interact with it. Maybe it would be more efficient without seats, but, humans. In Worm and Sanderson's works the powers are inherently connected to emotions and characters due to Shards and Entities.

A better generator might have something like "Sound manipulation. Yes, and charging, yes and surprise, yes and stripes." So, perhaps a sound alteration power that condensed sounds into stripes of higher and lower intensity, drawing streams into points which can be charged up and released in a burst against enemies. They can be stealthy and surprise enemies with bursts of sound. You can easily imagine a sensory result of someone being surprised with a burst of static, or stepping from silence to a suddenly intense stripe of sound.

  Above all, remember the point of this. It is not to simply be more complex. It is to force you, as a writer, to create better stories.

  He explicitly says that complexity is not the point of the limitations though. In my opinion, he's missing part of the underlying principle;

You're misquoting him. He's saying that complexity isn't in and of itself the purpose, writing good stories is the purpose. He's noting that your values shouldn't be "Increase complexity" they should be "Increase story quality" with emergent complexity, if necessary. So you shouldn't judge your generator by "How well have I generated emergent complexity" you should judge it by "How well does my character work in a story." Emergent complexity can certainly worsen a story too.

Sanderson didn't write or care about the number of abilities- he explicitly noted as good lots of magic systems with lots of elements that worked well.

  Every magic has basic limitations, defined simply as the limited scope of the power. If magical glasses can let you see a mile, then the limitation is that they don't let you see farther than that.
#+end_quote

He has no issue with magic systems that have a limitation like "We just control glass and sound". Or "We can just teleport and use local telekinesis after we teleport" That's a non point to him, just a boundary. His point is more that your power will make a good story or not based on how well or poorly it interacts with the world and characters and your actual plot. Your current system precludes this in consideration of power generation.

I suggested a modification above to consider these in power generation- add an emotion and a visual effect. It's a practical criticism.

Please, if you reply, try to address my argument, not another unrelated one.
