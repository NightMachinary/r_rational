  I've seen this a lot in the sort of stories people write- they focus on creating some new and slightly different power but don't think much of the very human element of why people should actually care about your characters or be interested in them. They don't think about how it would actually look and how people would imagine it. They don't focus on how it would feel to the character and those around them.

Yes, and ... this would have to be the subject for a different blog post. I agree with you about Worm being an emotional story and I think one of the things it did well was to link people to their powers in ways that went beyond the surface.

I'm just taking one piece of a story and examining it in isolation. I also think that there are a lot of people who just enjoy the powers of Worm by themselves rather than the characters those powers are tied to; I see that a fair amount on the [[/r/Parahumans]] subreddit.

You might make the argument that people wouldn't care about the powers if they didn't find the characters compelling, but I'm not sure that's true either. If it is true, then most people seem to be blind to what it is that they really like (which isn't a hypothesis I'm willing to entirely discard, but I find it suspect).

At any rate, this isn't about characters, or about why they're compelling, or even about whether to contrast or complement powers with characters, or use powers as a source of tension. This is just about making powers /by themselves/ interesting through add complexity.
