Worm is a very emotional story. It starts with Taylor trying to escape a life of bullying by becoming a superhero. It ends with Taylor bullying her enemy to death as a superhero.

Burnscar was the embodiment of an insane pyromaniac. The more she controlled her environment through fire the more powerful she was, the more she could escape problems and throw others into fire. But, she became increasingly insane and unhinged the more she burnt things down.

Battery was a police detective's daughter, one who believed that crime had consequences and who was trying to counteract another villain who controlled kinetic motion. Her power lets her charge up her powers to give herself great speed, electromagnetic powers, strength, in return for herself paying the consequences. And in the end, her mastery of the consequences means that she has to live her life close to the villain whom she got her powers to stop. And face the consequences of allying with cauldron.

Yes and is great for novice improv people, but it so often goes very wrong. At a basic level it works to knit the awesome ideas that two people have together, but it often goes poorly.

Sanderson's notes why limitations tend to be more interesting than new powers- because they add to the human element and make the person more interesting as a person to others.

Now, onto the weaknesses of yes and.

For a start, you don't have to say yes. This is a common error people make. Someone ties themselves up on a mock railway, cries "Free me, you scoundrel!". Do you have to free them? No, what you have to do is consider the emotional context of what they said, they are a helpless damsel who has been tied up by you, a scoundrel, and react accordingly, perhaps by doing a mad laugh and looming over them and announcing your plan.

This shows the big problem of a lot of yes ands. A person says something in a certain tone, in a certain position, with a certain facial expression, moving in a particular direction, using particular props. Your reaction should depend on all of them, but very often most of those are lost and one or two ideas you care about are kept while you continue with your thing.

I've seen this a lot in the sort of stories people write- they focus on creating some new and slightly different power but don't think much of the very human element of why people should actually care about your characters or be interested in them. They don't think about how it would actually look and how people would imagine it. They don't focus on how it would feel to the character and those around them.

This is a comedy sketch. Notice the conflict in it.

A man sees a note in the rain and he wants to get it. He tries to get it with his umbrella, fails, tries to yank it out, fails. He tries to push the car away, fails. He then reads his newspaper for a bit and looks for the driver. He sits down at a nearby cafe, orders some tea. He watches with interest as various people walk by and almost but don't pick it up. Then he sees the driver return, and gets up... along with everyone else in the store, who apparently were also waiting for the note.

A good story has tension. One of the most powerful story elements is when someone has a strong point of view which they keep through a story till some great and terrible event relieves the tension. Limitations work better to foster that, generally. Saying no to certain things works to foster that. That's an advanced lesson for comedy students. Everything that's said has to go into your inventory, yes, but a lot of the drama comes from opposing viewpoints that people hold onto stubbornly, from people not being able to act and do things till something relieves the pressure. If you want more than constant absurdity you need to learn when to say no.
