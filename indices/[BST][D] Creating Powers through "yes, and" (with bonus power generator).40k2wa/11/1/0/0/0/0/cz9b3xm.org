I don't quite understand how you're relating emotion to power. It appeared you were arguing for power-derived emotions being a necessary component for interesting, powered characters, e.g. Burnscar's insanity, Taylor's need for control, Grue's emotional distance, and Imp's need for attention. But your above reply implies it's the emotions each power inspires in others; I can think of disorientation and nausea for Vista, and perhaps temporal confusion for Clockblocker, but I don't quite understand how those feelings would pique reader interest.

I asked about Tattletale because I don't think her confidence is a necessary component of her power, nor do I think she has much of a visual effect. Thus I would disagree that emotions and visual effects are the essential building blocks of interesting powered characters. I would rather argue that to make interesting powered characters, one must as an author consider how each power might influence the personality and emotional state of their characters, given each character's background. Consideration regarding how visual effects of power use affect other characters is an issue unrelated to making interesting powered characters; it's more so a unique element of superpowered worlds that authors need to keep in mind during character interaction.

However, I may be misunderstanding your point; that's why I began with the questions.
