  It appeared you were arguing for power-derived emotions being a necessary component for interesting, powered characters, e.g. Burnscar's insanity, Taylor's need for control, Grue's emotional distance, and Imp's need for attention.
#+end_quote

Not really, I never said anything like that. I'm fine with people being written with no powers, simple powers, complex powers, emotional powers, unemotional powers. I said that visual and emotional components (and how people feel) make them more interesting, not that they are mandatory for every power ever.

  It dawned on me how badly that could have fucked us. Bitch's dogs would have attacked the person they thought was Aegis, and gotten tagged by Clockblocker instead. In one fell swoop, we would have lost the majority of our offensive power.

That's the emotion he's intended to supply. If you make a wrong move suddenly you lose a team mate and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. The fear of loss. It makes him badass to the reader, adds threat as anyone could be disabled at any time and destroyed.

  As I watched, that view distorted, as if I was looking into a funhouse mirror, or through a drop of water. The street, including the area with the darkness covering it, began swelling, broadening, and widening until the two sidewalks on either side of the street were more like semicircles than straight lines. It hurt my head to think too much about how Vista's powers worked.

That's what Vista's power's do, disorient you and hurt your head trying to work out what's going on.

Although then, the main focus was how badass Taylor's bug power was and how it made people's skin crawl and how she defeated these people. They didn't really put much focus on clockbuster or Vista.

  “Right. And when a fucking Endbringer is your precedent, people get spooked, just like you're spooked right now, at the idea that there's someone standing in front of you who can find your deepest darkest secrets and tell the world.”

She's a super emotional hero, who relies heavily on the emotions she can inspire. Comments like-

  TT's powers friggin' scare the crap out of me.

And

  Wow. from the “bullied” to the bully. Taylor holding a girl hostage while TT more or less taunted her. It was eerily like when Emma and Sophia were at her in school.

On visual and emotional elements- they generally get lots of comments if they work well, and people like them and read more when they're interesting. Not every power has to have some element of it, but they tend to be one of the major things that people comment on, emotions especially.
