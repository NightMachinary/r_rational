You're somewhat evading my point through saying I was implying that people can't find powers interesting. I never actually said anything like "People wouldn't care about the powers if they didn't find the characters compelling."

Yes, some transient enjoyment can certainly come out thinking about powers for certain personality types, and rating and classifying the nuances of each power. It doesn't tend to last long, but it certainly appeals to the sort of personality who likes making small snippets of worldbuilding and moving on.

For longer stories people care less about individual powers. The appeal sharply falls off. They like comparing powers, seeing them in odd situations, and seeing new interactions and applications. Some stories try the DBZ/ Naruto approach with continual new powers and increasing escalation, which sometimes works.

However, that's unrelated to my actual point. My point was that you were taking poor lessons from the sources you found. You didn't take the lesson from Sanderson that more visual powers work better. You didn't take the lesson from Sanderson and Worm that limitations add emotional subtext. You didn't note the common weakness of yes and, that it leads to escalating absurdity (dbz style) and the value of context.

Sanderson spelled it out fairly clearly in his essay. You may agree or disagree with that, but he was fairly clear. In ignoring those points you are making powers, by themselves, less interesting. You're misusing a beginner lesson from improv in a way that often encourages rather poor stories.

You may agree or disagree with this point, but this point shouldn't be discarded- major authors think they're important reasons why magical powers are more interesting, beyond simple complexity. If you want to try out a new system, the value of visual and emotional components to powers should be considered as well, I feel.
