You said lots of things I disagreed with. As I've repeatedly been noting I disagree with you, and saying emotions and visual effects=powers. As such, you shouldn't agree with me, and you doing so is a sign of you again not addressing the actual things I am saying.

  This is a post about complexity in magic systems; there's no reason for me to bring anything emotional or character-driven into it, because that's a different part of the master equation.

  In my opinion, he's missing part of the underlying principle; complexity is only good when it's emergent.

  My argument is that this is more compelling and more interesting than him only having one of those abilities

  This is as in contrast to a character like Superman, who has two powers like flight and super-strength which provides additional complexity but not emergent complexity.

And why I disagree with them-

Emotion is part of the equation of power. Part of Burnscar's power is that it makes her insane. Part of Wax's power is that it causes him to want to preserve things. Better stories take emotion of powers into account.

Visual and auditory effects are part of the equation of power. Powers need to interact with other things and will make sounds and colours when they do. Better stories take visuals of powers into account.

The goodness is in writing good stories. Complexity, emergent complexity, and simplicity are all good. In Mistborn say, some people have all the powers, some people have some, some people have none. Emergent complexity on its own isn't a good terminal goal.

If you continue to mischaracterize me as saying "Emotions are entirely unconnected to powers and visual effects are and alexanderwales is wrong because he's not modelling that." Then, of course, you can continue to refute me, but I've never actually said anything like that. I'm saying emotions and visual effects=powers.
