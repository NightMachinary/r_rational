This has made for some fun characters next time my gaming group feel up for a super heroes game.\\
:\\
*Head Trip - Emotional Manipulation, and movement*\\
You can generate bursts of emotion in others, the intensity of these bursts increases based on the difference in relative speed between you. If both of you are standing still it's barely noticable, if you're traveling at high speed relative to them it's hugely powerful.\\
*Press Gang - Summoning, but crowds*\\
When in physical contact with someone you can use your power to cause them to trade places with one of your minions, these minions take the form of burly humanoid figures loyal only to you. The target of your power remains suspended unhurt in a pocket dimension until such time as you choose to dismiss your minion or said minion is destroyed. The target returns to the same location and in the same physical state it left in.\\
*Tag Along - Telekinesis, but velocity*\\
You have telekinetic control over yourself and one object, you can only move yourself when also moving your target object and you cannot move the two individually.\\
*Stonefish - Earth manipulation and metabolism*\\
Your geokinesis lets you raise walls of earth, launch stone spikes and swim through stone, your biology is uniquely adapted to this and indeed rather than food your body needs stone for nourishment.\\
*Dwarf Star - regeneration but mass*\\
You can regenerate from any wound, literally anything up to and including decapitation and anti tank rounds to the face. Problem is you don't have access to wolverine's meat dimension, most cuts or abrasions don't cost much but a big wound will trim a few inches off your height.\\
*Bug Zapper - electric manipulation but isolation*\\
You have an always on electrical charge running through your body, you can vary the intensity up to lethal levels and with a push extend the range up to ten feet however you can never lower the intensity on contact below the level of discomfort for anyone touching you.\\
*Jump Scare - portals and fear*\\
You instinctively know the location of anyone who is experiencing fear and can teleport to them. Your power's range is tied to the intensity of fear felt, mild worry can get you across the room, Outright screaming terror will get you across the city. Fear of you personally can be detected at a far greater range.\\
*Lead Belly - Regeneration, and theft*\\
Pressing any solid substance against a wound causes you to absorb the material healing and taking on it's properties, over time the material will reshape to more closely resemble your original features.
