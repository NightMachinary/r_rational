In most stories an infinite wish engine would end everything very quickly and boringly. In this one I'm expecting it to just release more danger from the other side. I'm guessing different magics/worlds cancel each other out, so she can't just wish aslan away. Hmm I wonder if the belief of the people currently living and in the area has an effect

Also great to see the general's internal perspective. Makes him much more sympathetic and nuanced
