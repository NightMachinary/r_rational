It's that time again. A few things to cover this week:

- Between RR and AO3 we've hit 5,000 views in a little over 1 month since this started going up. That's crazy! So glad you all are following along, thank you.
- The finalized cover from RHL_Shen is here and it's /beautiful./ [[https://i.imgur.com/tyc9Z1O.jpg][Check it out]], and [[https://www.instagram.com/rhl_shen/][check her instagram out]] for more good stuff.
- We're getting into a very short timeskip today, so [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gXYHaERqFlBl1iuEDvTM5tepfjdUYjvcKAMVNXn9G5U/edit?usp=sharing][here's the next character sheet for Haley]], already kind of obsolete by this Thursday.
