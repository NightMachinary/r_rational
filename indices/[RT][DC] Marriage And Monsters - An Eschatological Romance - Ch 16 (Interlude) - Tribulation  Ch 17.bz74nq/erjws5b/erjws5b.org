So, I'm afraid you've mistaken some rules here.

[[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/master-craftsman/]]

Benefit: Choose one Craft or Profession skill in which you possess at least 5 ranks. You receive a +2 bonus on your chosen Craft or Profession skill. *Ranks in your chosen skill count as your caster level* for the purposes of qualifying for the Craft Magic Arms and Armor and Craft Wondrous Item feats.

Your caster level is equal only to the *ranks* in your chosen skill, not the final bonus which would be laughably broken for the reasons you set out here. Ranks are limited by HD, and no other bonus increases them.

However, you don't actually need caster level to craft items, as that's just the suggestion. The only real limits are for constructs. The rest can be avoided by adding 5 to the DC, so I think she can still get the candle working.
