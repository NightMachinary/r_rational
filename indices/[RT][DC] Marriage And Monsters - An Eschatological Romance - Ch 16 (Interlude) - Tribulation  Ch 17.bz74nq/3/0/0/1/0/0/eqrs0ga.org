My understanding is that the example monsters are just that- pre-generated examples. I've never heard it suggested that all monsters of a type conform to the one example listed in the wiki- especially in their optional areas, like spells known! That would be exceptionally restrictive. Look up any existing Pathfinder module and you will find that the encounters are full of monsters that don't conform to those templates.
