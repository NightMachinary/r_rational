Hmm, I'm not sure where you're getting the idea of a Monster Manual spell list? I'm unfamiliar with it, but it would be a major plan changer if it exists- link me and I'll dig into it. If that /was/ the case it would be... problematic for her later build.

There are no house rules (unless you count a dragon PC as a house rule, I certainly would). Just certain bits going unspoken because they're tedious to track, as both an author and a reader. The "Rules As Written" claim is a promise of fairness and reproducibility to the reader, as far as I'm concerned. I.E. "You could argue that a PF character could do this with your GM and they'd have to use fiat to block it." It doesn't mean I'm going to bog the story down with Haley collecting bat guano or whatever, but I /did/ plan to ensure that she has a source- on that front, can't say more.

In this particular example I am offering a cheeky non-canon response because I honestly forgot to look at the component cost of a level one spell. Silly me for assuming a low level PF spell wouldn't have something dumb in it! If she were to hit a high level and try to cast Wish directly the material cost would be prohibitive, but an Efreet has Wish as a SLA with no material cost. Lucky!

Sean would /absolutely/ risk eternal damnation to get castable fast-healing. One human afterlife for, potentially, multiple lives saved per day, for the rest of Haley's existence? Sure, easy trade.
