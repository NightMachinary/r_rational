Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary pg 108 "A gold dragon can cast cleric spells as arcane spells". Feel free to grab any good cleric spell, like breath of life.

Also dragons spells come from pseudo sorcerer levels, so you can choose any spell on the sorcerer or cleric list everytime her age category increases. On page 91: "Spells: A dragon knows and casts arcane spells as a sorcerer of the level indicated in its specific description. Its caster level depends on its age, as shown for each type".
