I don't know if I'm strange, but having never played Pathfinder simply meant that I looked up every single keyword that appeared in the story. I also read Figg's Wikipedia page and looked up the names of the Narnia protagonists.

I knew nothing about DC lore either before reading With this Ring, while now I have wiki-binged enough trivia to have in detail conversations with fans. And I almost always read fanfic with the relevant wiki page open.
