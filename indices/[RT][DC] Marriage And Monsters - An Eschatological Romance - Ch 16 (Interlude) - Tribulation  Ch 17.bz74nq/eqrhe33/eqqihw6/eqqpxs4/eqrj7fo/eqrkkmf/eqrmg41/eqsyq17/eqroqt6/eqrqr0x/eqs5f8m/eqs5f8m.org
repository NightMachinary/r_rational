  Sean would absolutely risk eternal damnation to get castable fast-healing. One human afterlife for, potentially, multiple lives saved per day, for the rest of Haley's existence? Sure, easy trade.

Is it though? Not only is eternity a few orders of magnitude higher than average human life expectancy, but Haley would have learned Cure Moderate Wounds the moment she hit Young Adult.

Also, if the component is Pathfinder Unholy Water, as opposed to being mere water that a Left Hand Path preacher spit on or something, then it needs the necromantic Curse Water spell specifically.
