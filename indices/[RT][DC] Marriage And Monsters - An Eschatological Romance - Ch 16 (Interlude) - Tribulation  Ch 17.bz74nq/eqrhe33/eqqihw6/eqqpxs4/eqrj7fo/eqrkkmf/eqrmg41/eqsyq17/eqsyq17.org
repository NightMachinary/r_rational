Pathfinder is the same as DND 3.5 where they get effective sorcerer levels from increasing in age category. They can pick from any spell on the sorcerer/wizard spell list for their spells known, and official modules released by WotC and Paizo do so when implementing dragons.

As for cleric spells both gold and silver dragons add those as arcane spells to the list of sorcerer spells to choose from.
