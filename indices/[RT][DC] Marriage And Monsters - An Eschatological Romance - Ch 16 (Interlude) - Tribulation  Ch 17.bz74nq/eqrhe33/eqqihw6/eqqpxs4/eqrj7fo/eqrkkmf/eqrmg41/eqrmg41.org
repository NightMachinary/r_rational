I don't know if Gold Dragons have access to /any/ spell list according to RAW. They get full access to specific spells, like certain casters do. There's definitely precedent. Do you have any examples of specific Dragons (of any color) in Pathfinder that cast spells outside of their specific Monster Manual list? Because that would be proof that Dragons actually learn spells like sorcerers do as opposed to just having what they have.

Of course. Most everyone plays that way. They also usually disallow infinite wishes tough. And much of the other various broken RAW things. But you have repeatedly mentioned in your story that Sean and Haley are so lucky because they have no DM limiting or houseruling anything. If now it turns out that there is some houseruling going on, but only to their benefit, well, what would the story implications of that be?

Also, ordaining Sean to the Church of Satan is not really possible without working internet or communications. You would have to found your own unholy church. And if we're going by D&D, there would probably have to be some power behind the ordainment (see [[https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Unholy_water]]), while if it is based on some other narrative rules from your world I would expect either some actual rules when it comes to founding a religion in a way that makes stories acknowledge it, or consequences for officially devoting oneself to a random evil deity.

Would Sean really risk that just to squeeze out a few additional hit points from a level 1 spell slot?
