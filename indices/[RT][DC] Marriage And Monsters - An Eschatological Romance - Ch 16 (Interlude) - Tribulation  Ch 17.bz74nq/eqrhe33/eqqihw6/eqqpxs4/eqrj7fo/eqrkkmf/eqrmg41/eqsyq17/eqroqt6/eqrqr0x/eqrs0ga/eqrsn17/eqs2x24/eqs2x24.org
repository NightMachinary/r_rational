I guess giving dragons a full sorcerer spell list plus whatever is directly printed on their sheet is fair. Lots of settings flavor sorcerers as being able to sorcerize due to limited amounts of dragon blood in their veins.

But in general RAW means that if you can't find any rules printed in official sources then it isn't possible. To five an example: 3.5 Monks would be unproficient in unarmed combat according to RAW. Yes, I know that's dumb.

My point is that if nothing details how Gold Dragons acquire their spells or what their choices are, then typical RAW reading says that there isn't anything.
