I don't quite understand what spell list Haley is using. Like, can she just select any level-appropriate spell from the whole Wizard/Sorcerer spell list or something? Because Infernal Healing seems like a strange fit for a Gold Dragon otherwise.

Also, do dragons have some kind of general exemption from material component requirements for casting? Fleece is easy to get, but where did Haley scrounge up multiple vials of Unholy Water?

I know that many DMs ignore that stuff, but if RAW can be applied in ludicrously favorable ways then IMO the same should be true to all the stupidly annoying limitations that pure RAW introduces.
