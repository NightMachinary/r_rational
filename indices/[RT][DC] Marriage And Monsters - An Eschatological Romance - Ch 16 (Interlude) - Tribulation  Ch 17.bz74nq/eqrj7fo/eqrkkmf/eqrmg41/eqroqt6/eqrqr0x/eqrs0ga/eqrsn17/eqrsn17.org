Interesting! I've never played Pathfinder, but in 5e the idea seems to be that a monster of a given type will always have the same spells. For instance, a rusalka will always have magic related to charming and entangling, a sphinx will always have informational and defensive spells, etc. Obviously a DM can alter or add whatever they want, but I agree with [[/u/Bowbreaker]] that "we are specifically playing RAW Pathfinder" feels a bit at odds with "I can pick whatever spells I want."

Maybe a little discussion between Haley & Shawn to clear that up? Or not, anyone who's not intimately familiar with Pathfinder dragons probably won't notice any discrepancy at all :P
