I think what [[/u/Bowbreaker]] means by "Monster Manual list" is the spells listed on the [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon/metallic-gold/young-gold-dragon/][Young Gold Dragon MM page]]. It does rather specifically state "Spells Known," and I generally agree that monsters (even extremely powerful and intelligent ones) don't get the flexibility that humanoid casters have. I just assumed that Infernal Healing was for some reason a default Gold Dragon ability.

That said, I'm sure there's some feat or craftable item in Pathfinder that grants access to spells outside one's normal range, like the Magic Initiate feat in 5e.

EDIT: Or Haley is a Gold Dragon PC with caster levels! That's even more broken.
