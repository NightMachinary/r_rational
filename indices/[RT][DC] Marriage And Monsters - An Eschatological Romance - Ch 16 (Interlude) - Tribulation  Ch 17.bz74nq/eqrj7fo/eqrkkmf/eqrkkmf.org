Gold Dragons /technically/ have access to the divine spell list as well, if you look at some of the pre-gen monsters, but that rule isn't specified anywhere that I have found so I'm trying to be good and limit her immediate access to the wizard spell list. She's allowed to pick what she wants though, and infernal healing is a great source of HP, despite the icky "Evil" flavor text. She's being very practical.

Also, re: components. I think I'm part of the camp that has never, ever, even once in my life paid attention to components. I think they're fun flavor but holy hell do I not want to have to come up with a drop of devil's blood or whatever, every time a character needs to cast a level 1 spell in a tabletop game or in a story. For the peace of mind of the true rules-sticklers we can assume that they are pulling stupid party tricks like ordaining Sean in the Church of Satan and having him bless a vial of water for Haley for the healing. If they get into spells that /really/ need to be rate limited, well- I guess we will see what she comes up with to get around high component costs.
