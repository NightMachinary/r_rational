Wow, great post, thank you.

Upfront I'll say that this whole post (the top level one) is basically market research to see if it's worth it for me to spend time planning the story. So, everything I'm about to say should be considered alpha-version and likely to change. As a result, I'm considering it not spoilers.

My initial thoughts would be:

- Do you mean they are all fighting each other as well as Earth?

More or less. Probably not a fully connected graph, but certainly many different fronts among different pantheons.

- Are we fighting the "bad" sides of the world's religions, the bad and neutral, or all aspects? How would we stand a chance at all, if so, and if not how close are potential "allies" working with humanity?

The trite answer would be "everyone we're fighting is the bad guys by definition," but no. We'd be fighting various factions from various religions. For example, there might be factions within Christian Hell that are willing to ally with us in order to gain an advantage over over hell-factions. Valhalla (viking heaven) would certainly be making war on someone.

- If not active participants in the war, where are the various heavens and positive/passive afterlives in all this? What about pantheons with neutral gods and other supernatural forces that have no afterlife components?

There would definitely be factions on our side and it seems likely that the majority of those factions would come from the positive side of things. On the other hand, many gods would just not want to be involved -- the Christian god being a prime example. He's stood back for several thousand years now, I don't see him wanting to break that streak. (Also, from a Doylist perspective, having an omnipotent being show up on either side makes the story pretty short.)

- What about shamanists?

I've had some interesting ideas about animisim; between them and the idea of totem animals I can think of a lot of cool places to go.

- What about reincarnation?

My current understanding of reincarnation is that you don't remember your prior lives, so you can't pass on intelligence or skills gained in a previous +time loop+ incarnation. The only difference from a warfighting perspective is that your soul is not available to the enemy for interrogation.

- Is Earth simply a battleground or a target? Is attacking a side what determines if they pay attention at all to humanity? Are they actively recruiting living humans?

I'm waffling on this one. I've had several backstory concepts including (a) the "gods need prayer" trope that I used in 2YE, and (b) there's an infinite collection of worlds and the ongoing war shifts from one to the next; it just happens to have finally gotten to Earth.

Some factions probably would reach out to humans, yes. Most likely the weaker factions who are desperate for allies.

- Which aferlives would automatically get the most souls from dead civilians? Soldiers? Which gets the least?
- Who gets which souls, the forces that make the kill or the victim's personal fath's?

I see it as personal faith determining where you go. Christian devils are going to want to focus on countries with a high Christian population, Hindu asuras will focus on India, etc. Under this model South America would take a pasting from Lucifer's armies, because there is a high percentage of Christianity and insufficiently large economies to have major militaries.

- If really bad things happen very often (i.e. going to hell) to people based on what they believe, why is anyone religious anymore (or at least that type)?

One of the first things that governments would start doing once they really understood what was going on would be to tell their citizens "okay, everyone needs to switch to [religion] because they are the ones who are supporting us!" Which would go down about as well as you'd expect.

- If there is a good chance at a "good" afterlife, why would anyone still be an atheist?

They wouldn't. I'm already imagining a scene where Richard Dawkins says "okay, fine, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mmskXXetcg][I was wrong]]"...and then goes on to choose a religion based on pragmatic grounds and munchkins his skepticism and rationality in order to extract the most benefit from his new god(s|dess(es)?)?

- Other than possible intelligence on Earth resistance, what purpose do souls have?

My first thought would be that they are either a powersource or can be interrogated and then transformed into soldiers in that faction's army.

- Which afterlife would have the strongest human resistance movements (i.e. the strongest souls, the most canon chances to escape, the weakest guards, etc.)?

I'll get back to you.

- Can you tell if someone is going to a hell or a heaven before they die?

More or less, yes. The process is basically "What religion are you? Okay, we had some experts go through and boil your holy books down into a checklist. Tick all the relevant boxes, we'll tally them up and tell you your current destination...ooh, not good. Okay, here's what you need to do to fix it...."

Of course, the first thing that would happen is that the Pope would start handing out plenary indulgences like candy, and probably speak /ex cathedra/ to say that any Catholic who dies on a day ending in a 'Y' receives an implicit indulgence at the moment of death. And then other religions would start doing the same.

- Does that mean those who are less likely to go to a hell (righteous or "good" religious people) are moved into sensitive or command positions? Or are heavens a threat as well, and atheists are the only people who run no risk of hitting an afterlife because they simply disappear?

Some heavens would definitely be a risk. Valhalla, for one, repurposes the souls of everyone who goes there as soldiers in its army.
