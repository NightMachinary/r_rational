This is interesting, but I'm worried about some of the corollaries here breaking the story world. Making all (or even most) religions have bits that are "real" in some aspects results in some tricky things emerging.

- Do you mean they are all fighting /each other/ as well as Earth?
- Are we fighting the "bad" sides of the world's religions, the bad and neutral, or all aspects? How would we stand a chance at all, if so, and if not how close are potential "allies" working with humanity?
- If not active participants in the war, where are the various heavens and positive/passive afterlives in all this? What about pantheons with neutral gods and other supernatural forces that have no afterlife components?
- What about shamanists?
- What about reincarnation?
- Is Earth simply a battleground or a target? Is attacking a side what determines if they pay attention at all to humanity? Are they actively recruiting living humans?
- Which afterlife would have the objectively worst forces and powers with which to attack Earth? The weakest? What determines which is how numerous and strong compared to the others?
- Which aferlives would automatically get the most souls from dead civilians? Soldiers? Which gets the least?
- Who gets which souls, the forces that make the kill or the victim's personal fath's?

  - If really bad things happen very often (i.e. going to hell) to people based on what they believe, why is anyone religious anymore (or at least that type)?
  - If there is a good chance at a "good" afterlife, why would anyone still be an atheist?
  - If some forces send you to a horrible hell by killing you, does that mean they are more horrible to fight?
  - What happens if a "good" afterlife combatant kills you? Do you go to a heaven...to be tortured for information?

- Other than possible intelligence on Earth resistance, what purpose do souls have?
- Which afterlife would have the strongest human resistance movements (i.e. the strongest souls, the most canon chances to escape, the weakest guards, etc.)?
- Can you tell if someone is going to a hell or a heaven before they die? Does that mean those who are less likely to go to a hell (righteous or "good" religious people) are moved into sensitive or command positions? Or are heavens a threat as well, and atheists are the only people who run no risk of hitting an afterlife because they simply disappear?

Obviously, some of these are going to be plot important spoilers. But it would help to know if there were some sort of plans to deal with them. You said a lot about what the other book was about, but not as much on how your story would handle what are some pretty politically sensitive and functionally challenging ideas.
