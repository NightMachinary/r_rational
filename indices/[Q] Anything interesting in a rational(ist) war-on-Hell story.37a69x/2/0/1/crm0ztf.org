  I'm already imagining a scene where Richard Dawkins says "okay, fine, I was wrong[1]  "...and then goes on to choose a religion based on pragmatic grounds and munchkins his skepticism and rationality in order to extract the most benefit from his new god(s|dess(es)?)?

A Richard Dawkins analog doing that would be worth the price of admission alone. I'm thinking some Australian aboriginal Dreamtime (which seems to come with almost limitless power and knowledge) would be a good pick.

  ...in "Dreamtime" an individual's entire ancestry exists as one, culminating in the idea that all worldly knowledge is accumulated through one's ancestors.

Ehh? Yeah? All worldly knowledge?

I thought so.

Get your still living siblings and children to get high as fuck to meditate and broadcast back the skinny once you cross over. And it doesn't say anything about /your ancestors/ having to have been part of your chosen religion, either. You can just get that knowledge, because that's how reality works for you now.

The rest sounds like a good basis for the conflict and establishing their various actors and their goals, as well. But that other bit made my day.
