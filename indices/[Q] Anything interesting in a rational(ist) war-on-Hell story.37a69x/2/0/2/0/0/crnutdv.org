What fun is that? Wouldn't it be more fun to have humanity give Yaweh a spanking? :)

Actually, there's an idea I've sort of been toying with: In Judaism, the story for why "Israel" is called that due to the whole bit with Yaakov fighting the angel. The word literally translates to something like "he who overcame god"

What if we take that story and run with it... the torah was a corruption, hiding the truth that at some point someone managed to figure out a way to fight back, to protect humanity from divine evil. And that the method needs to be reconstructed/rediscovered.

Seems like some story along those lines, or a story that incorporated that would be fun. I mean, I've never heard of any stories that actually ran with that idea, but it seems like the sort of thing that in some form would be an obvious idea to play with.
