The trouble is, why would a benevolent omniscient omnipotent being be passive in a less than perfect world?

They clearly wouldn't.

They would fix everything instantly.

If you want there to be a story at all, then you need to change YHWH. Give him alien values. Say Lucifer's rebellion suceeded and he's a shadow of his former self and can't solve all problems forever. Say he's not omniscient but in fact retarded and doesn't /know/ how to wipe your plot from existence.

Anything!

But YHWH with canon powers in a universe that makes internal sense breaks the story completely.

If you don't want him to intervene then you need to find a way to make him not intervene. You can't just handwave something on this scale.
