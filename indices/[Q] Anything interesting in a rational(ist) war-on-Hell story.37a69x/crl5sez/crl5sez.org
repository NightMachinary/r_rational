I remember being really disappointed that /The Salvation War/ wasn't, y'know, good. It's a cool premise.

I'd join the call to use Christian myths only, and go with something preexisting and reasonably well-defined - Dante is good, as are Medieval-European ideas of witchcraft/vampirism, modern superstition/conspiracy theories (satanic D&D, all that), classic Bible-period Jewish myths ... there's a lot to choose from, actually, so I'd go with whatever you think you could do something really cool with.
