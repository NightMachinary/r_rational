  If you want all the religions to exist, there's going to be the problem of deciding how much you can learn about all of them. There are some really fantastic characters out there, and some really cool worlds.

It's true. And yes, "all the things!" might be a bad plan here. Just doing Christianity justice would be challenging enough.

I suppose one approach would be "yes, they're all real, but most of them are fighting on other levels and haven't made it to Earth yet.

I've always had a soft spot for the Norse gods; I find them more interesting as characters than the Greek/Roman ones, and much less bogus than Christianity. This could be the whole Ragnarok / Judgement Day / whatever other cataclysmic end-of-the-world thing other religions have mixed together.

One thing that would definitely be interesting would be the distinction between Christianity and Judaism. The Jews seem to see Yahweh as someone who can be bargained with (cf destruction of Sodom) and feel that rules lawyering is okay (cf shabbos goy and the [[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/496883/jewish/Is-it-really-necessary-to-have-leaven-removed-from-ones-property.htm][sale of chametz]] for Passover.
