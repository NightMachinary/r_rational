  most furry authours I'm acquainted with tend to under-charge for their work.

This might or might not apply to the stories you're talking about but, if this is furry smut, then they probably /can/ afford to charge less. Smut is ridiculously easy to crank out; it requires very little foreshadowing and much less plot, dialogue, and characterization than non-erotica, so it can be written quickly and therefore needs less . It also pays relatively well. And yes, that's not a guess.
