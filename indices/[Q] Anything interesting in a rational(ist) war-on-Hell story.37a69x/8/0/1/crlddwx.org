  For reference, chapter 10 of Team Anko was 3600 words and chapter 1 was 9200. The average paperback novel has something like 300 words on it. (Very rough estimate, varies a lot.)

I'm not sure what you're trying to say here, but the average length for an adult fiction novel is between 80,000 and 120,000 words, somewhat depending on genre, with 100,000 words being considered the "cap" for first-time authors (beyond which publishers are really unlikely to look at your work).
