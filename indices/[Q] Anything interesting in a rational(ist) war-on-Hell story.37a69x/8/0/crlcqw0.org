If it were a major focus I could crank a short chapter (~5k words) every couple of days. Right now I'm actually finishing up a 5k story that I started late evening yesterday. I've been pretty unproductive today or it would be done already.

Alternatively, it could be a longer chapter once a week -- say, 8-10k words.

Not to be crass, but "major focus" is very closely related to "profitable", so it would need to be funded somehow. Personally, the way I would love to do it is to take feedback from the audience, shape the story around that feedback, get paid for it, and then Creative Commons it. It would surprise me if that were feasible though; if I were cranking chapters that fast it would be pretty much my full time job.

For reference, chapter 10 of Team Anko was 3600 words and chapter 1 was 9200. The average page of a paperback novel has something like 300 words on it. (Very rough estimate, varies a lot.)
