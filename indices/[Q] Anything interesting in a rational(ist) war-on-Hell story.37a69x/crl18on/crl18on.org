I recommend reading [[http://www.amazon.com/bang-apocalypse-Mason-Tailsteak-Williams/dp/1453806466][/Bang/]] by Tailsteak, the guy who creates the webcomic [[http://leftoversoup.com/][/Leftover Soup/]] (so you know he's good). It's a very good look at what things would be like if Christianity is right and the implications of everything it entails. It's pretty good at showing how the people in the Christian hell would act even if the story is not totally rationalist. Trevor is definitely a Level 1 character though.
