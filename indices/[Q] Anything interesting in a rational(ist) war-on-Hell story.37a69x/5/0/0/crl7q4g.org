Sorry not militarily, Also ther spin-off series that follows some of Dream's other siblings gets a bit more into how the whole 'multi-world' works. For hell stuff I'd recommend the Lucifer spin-off because it gets into that a bit. but because of the protagonist of that series the whole thing ends up a bit less "all myths are true" then Gaiman writes and more "christian mythology has the most epic super hero myth man and thus can pwn all other myths" that series is still a fun read though.

For military heaven vs hell stuff I heartily recommend the kaiju angels from this [[http://turbofanatic.deviantart.com/art/Raquiel-188484506][picture]]
