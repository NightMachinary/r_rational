I've been rereading Dante's Divine Comedy recently, and I found myself wishing there was something like what you are describing using his hell. It's got everything from little humanoid demons who torture people to giants and monsters of every kind. And various... /unlikely/ climates and terrains that should be very munchkinable. The inhabitants include some definitely-not-real people too, like Mordred and Helen of Troy. If you want to use lots of afterlife worlds then there might have to be some changes (Heresy wouldn't be quite so popular, I imagine, nor would the Noble Pagans sit around in Hell-lite when they had their own paradises to go to). So the short answer is yes, I would love it if someone wrote a rational take on Afterlifes-are-real, and I highly recommend giving Dante a go to see if you want to use anything from his Inferno (Purgatory would also make an interesting place to invade...). Or Milton's Paradise Lost if you want Lucifer to be in charge, though Milton's hell isn't really fleshed out beyond "And then the fallen angels made El Dorado but with lots of added brimstone".

If you want all the religions to exist, there's going to be the problem of deciding how much you can learn about all of them. There are some really fantastic characters out there, and some really cool worlds.
