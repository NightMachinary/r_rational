You know, I just had a vision of JÃ¶rmungandr popping out of the ocean next to a fishing boat / battleship / something and saying (in a very British accent, while wearing a monocle) "I say old boy, there's going to be a spot of bother around here soon. Those thugs over in the Christian Hell have decided to invade, you know. Probably be here in about a week. Just thought I'd let you know. Pip pip!"
