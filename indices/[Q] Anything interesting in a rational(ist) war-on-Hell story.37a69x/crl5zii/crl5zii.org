This pretty much is how it works in Neil gaiman's Sandman.

No one is fighting per say though.

But a lot of munchkining is going on.

Also some interesting psychology.

I recommend reading that graphic novel if your wanting to go into the business of multi-pantheon clash shenanigans.

Neil Gaiman is the present master author of that style of story telling.
