I've read Sandman up through The Wake which AFAIK is the end. (At least, if I'm remembering the sequence right. Yes, amazing story, Gaiman is a top-shelf genius.

Is there more after the Wake? Because there was nothing in there about demons from Hell physically invading Earth in a military fashion.
