I'm afraid that's a tad out of my price range. (And, possibly, I've just been hit by the logical fallacy involving pegging prices to the first ones seen, as most furry authours I'm acquainted with tend to under-charge for their work.)

That's certainly an option worth investigating. As I suspect you already know, one of the hard parts would be to find the sweet spot that draws in enough readers/funders to make it worth your while, and picking a topic narrow enough to be worth your readers' while - something they couldn't get by picking up the latest extruded fantasy product from their local giftshop-that-still-also-sells-books. I'm afraid that my writing chops aren't nearly strong enough to offer any good advice on that score.
