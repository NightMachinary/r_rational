I would definitely go the Just For Fun route -- I have no interest in writing an author tract about why religion (singular or plural) is bad, I just want to write a fun story. As to the research, most likely I would choose to go the "well, the legends are basically right, but some things got lost in translation so not every detail of the religion as we know it is correct." Which is a great handwave for any details I get wrong or choose to change. A bit of a cheat, but a forgivable one.
