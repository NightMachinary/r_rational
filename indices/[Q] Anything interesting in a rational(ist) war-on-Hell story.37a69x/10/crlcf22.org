Here's a quick summary of what I've seen, to help gauge what's taboo:

- Fun stories involving multiple pantheons, such as Greek and Norse, occasionally Chinese and Japanese. Many of these /avoid/ including Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.

- Hollywood-style, focusing on Christianity-inspired Hell, taking artistic liberties

- Parody, such as South Park

As I see it, you have 3 general takes:

- the Just For Fun take: set the tone of the story from the outset as "this is an adventurous, fun, action thriller, with some humor and fun references to mythology" - this can allow you hollywood-like license to manipulate things to make a fun story. Requires less research, but you can't make moral judgements on any existing religions.

- "I have a moral point to deliver" (as was the case in Two Year Emperor): if it's at all controversial, you better well do your research. If people notice flaws in a criticism, it'll undermine the message, and make it much less fun to read.

- "I'm going to get hate mail anyway": anything goes. Personally, I probably wouldn't read this version, but I'm sure you'd still find a reader base.

There are a couple of stories like that have fun mixing up pantheons, though mostly focused on conflicting pantheons, not specifically the afterlives. For recs: American Gods is well known, the Iron Druid chronicles is basically Harry Dresden if Harry was an ancient druid coming to blows with celtic gods. (It's better than early dresden files books, not as good as the later ones). The graphic novel series "Pantheon High" involves at one point a bunch of demigods trekking through various afterlives, trying to get to Hades - the story's blah, but has quite a lot fun with the mythology: Hades' son's ability is to inflict Poetic Justice upon people.
