I think that the comments above were caused by a certain genre shift.

In the first few chapters, the story seemed more like a thriller, with exciting window escapes and car chases. After that, it shifted into a metaphorical sea journey, which relies more on worldbuilding than a traditional narrative.

Personally, I quite liked the exploration of a post-scarcity society. Nectar fills physiological needs, the Hall offers safety, and Lyra risked both to seek love/belonging on Earth. In a sense, Lyra could be taken as a metaphor for AI - she was created to fill the main character's desires and want for nothing but his happiness, and then she brings him to a utopia.

Also, the magic system is intriguing.
