I could have hijacked a Nara as chiaroscuro did, but then I wouldn't be able to make references to Akria and Pinky and the Brain. Which is obviously vitally important.

It's not so much a matter of recognising in this case, it's the delay between recognising the illusion and breaking out of it. Much like a martial art, if you practice enough you can have the reaction become automatic and save valuable time. Which is pretty important since knocking someone out for 2 whole seconds should be /plenty/ of time for a ninja to plant a blade in their throat.
