I answered elsewhere already but since this is a dedicated topic I'll expand on that.

First, while I think the fact that adding "the Door" was too simplistic on its own to be a complete solution to the problem of the Good Place, I also think it /was/ a needed addition. Not because it was the only way to give people meaning, but because being trapped in any place without literally no way out is imprisonment. Even if it's a really awesome place. A free being /must/ have the option to walk out. Every good immortality wish comes with an opt-out clause, just in case.

Second, the idea that the Good Place "turned people's brain to mush" is certainly deeply rooted in our knowledge of the /corporeal/ nature of humans - so needn't necessarily apply to immortal disembodied souls, who might always be at their mental best regardless of how dulled a mortal would have been by unending decadence. However, let's say that they work exactly like humans, which after all is needed for the show to be relatable at all. I think the idea that eternity would get boring underestimates the capacity of the human mind for focusing on the short term. In other words, the solution to their problem would simply be to restore some of the mildest forms of earthly strife; have people struggle for some things, and not experience endless pleasure all the time. In such a scenario, I think it'd probably be possible to continue on existing basically forever, as it would be impossible to remember more than a few thousands years worth anyway.

Third, agree about combinatorics, though a fair word of warning, /infinity/ means literally so much time every combination possible will be exhausted anyway. Every chess and go game played and every book in the Library of Babel written. Whether the human mind could also continue to expand in such a manner that it would be able to fill in that infinity faster than it passes is anyone's guess. It'd probably require these souls to become /super/human at some point, though.

Fourth, about the fact that Eleanor has no new friends and other potential plot holes: see these as simplifications necessary to keep the story within a scope we can understand and appreciate. If one wanted to be accurate, it's not just the friends. Hypatia uses modern clothes and slangs, so why aren't Eleanor & co. by the end using clothes and slang from whatever future era of humanity they got to witness, but live in an endless 21st century? But to do so would only make the situation more alien to us, without altering its fundamental emotional core - Eleanor might not lose /all/ her friends, but she loses her oldest and dearest ones, the ones with which she shared a fight against the injustice of the universe itself, and she loses her lover. It'd still be lonely for her; Chidi, Tahani and Jason are effectively family to her.

That said, the show /does/ show us immortals who are very human in feeling and who do not need self-extinction to feel happy or content. Tahani goes on to become an architect and may live forever. Janet transcends space and time itself, but she's also very human for all purposes that matter. Derek is and always will be. And so on, so forth.

So, yeah, while I don't agree with the philosophical notion that /only/ death and finiteness can possibly giving meaning to life (realistically, how much of what we do in the day-to-day needs to harken back to the thought of death to feel meaningful?), I definitely agree that it's entirely possible that some people would want that option, in a hypothetical afterlife, and should be given it. Just like I don't agree with forcefully keeping alive people who desire euthanasia in real life.
