I generally agree with you, but what we don't know is how much time really passed for them (Jeremy Bearimy, baby). Maybe they did spend billions of years there.

The finale actually made me think about what the optimal outcome would be for immortal beings. The conclusion I came to is that eventually you have to rewire your mind to not grow bored or despondent even after an arbitrarily large amount of time. My gut feeling is that if you didn't do that you'd eventually despise life, regardless of the amount of novelty you'd still have to experience.
