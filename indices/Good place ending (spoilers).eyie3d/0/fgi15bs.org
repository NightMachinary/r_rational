Not to be too Doylist here, but stories need endings, and having a satisfying ending strongly limits your solution space even if you're trying to do something novel.

Not only that, but we specifically need to see the characters we've watched have their ending. After a million years, they're not going to be the same people anymore, and the audience will have stopped caring. Thus, ending it earlier than what was realistically possible.
