This also bugged me. I was annoyed when they presented their "moving on" solution. By the end of the episode, though, I was more or less fine with it, and afterwards I thought a couple things about it:

- One, I take it to be established that in the Good Place the universe is actually deathist. There is something transcendental or spiritual about fulfilling your desires, expectations, whatever, and then moving on and transcending existence.

- It's quite unrealistic that after an eternity of after-living they would be more or less the same people. They seemed to explore so little, or rather so constrained by who they were in life. (This actually bugged me more than the dying part).

From a doyist, narrative perspective, it's unsatisfying to show that the characters end up being completely different people that the ones we're attached to (in this story! In some other kind of story it would be interesting to explore); and sad too, as you could think that the original characters are dead, in a way.

In universe, I just assume there is some essence to souls that hardly changes in afterlife, or that maybe changes more slowly than values are satisfied. Whatever.

In any case, I don't think a perfect ending to this show exists. This ended the story in a nice, emotional way that allowed me to say goodbye to the characters.
