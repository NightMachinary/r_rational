The "bored immortal" is a common trope. I think they were fair with it- it doesn't seem like many people have used the door, but some have.

I think the way they did it with Chidi, Tahani, and Jason all made sense. Especially Tahani realizing oh, actually, there's this whole other category of stuff she wants to do!

Eleanor never got that "suddenly she just /knew/" moment, though . It really ended up feeling like she was just depressed because no more Chidi, which, blah.

I agree with you about the infinite novelty thing. I always thought the show was a bit too tame with its depiction of a paradise where you can do anything. Like, great, you can play Madden a lot, but have you ever become the God of your own universe? And then the God of a completely different universe? And then a warrior monk, in a reality where those two universes fought each other?
