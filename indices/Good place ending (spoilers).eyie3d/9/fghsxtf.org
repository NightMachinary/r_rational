The afterlife that they structured is supposed to move you from being a mortal with limited abilities and questionable decision-making skills to being okay with your real death. It isn't about "doing" everything, it's about feeling the contentment with a life you have built and choosing to end your story.

Other people talked about how we don't know how long a Jeremy Beremy is, but that's not the point, it's that when you're a virtuous person (described by their apparently absolutist virtues that they structured most of the universe after) in a land of plenty, eventually, you will be comfortable enough to pass from it.

It is also, arguably, not suicide, since they're already dead. Nothing that we would define as life is applicable to them. It's recognising that a wave is a shape that the water in the ocean takes for a little bit.

Tahani and Janet also get to spend as many Jeremy Beremies together as they want so my ship is still alive, until Tahani eventually finds peace too.
