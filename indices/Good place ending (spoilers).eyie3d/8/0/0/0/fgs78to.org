I have ambivalent feelings about it too. The idea of freeing yourself from pain by freeing yourself from wants seems good on principle; however as a person who /does/ tend to have very weak and minimal wants I must say it has a dark side. It tends to disconnect you from other people - who often have stronger wants, and who can't relate to you (nor can you to them) - and kills drive in general. I have large swaths of time during which I feel apathetic or unable to strive for anything special and it alienates me. I suppose if I did not want human connection either that wouldn't be a problem, but are you even human any more at that point? Or are you rather just killing yourself while you're still biologically alive?
