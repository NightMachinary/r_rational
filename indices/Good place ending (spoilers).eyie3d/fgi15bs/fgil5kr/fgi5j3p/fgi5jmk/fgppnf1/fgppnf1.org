  There is something transcendental or spiritual about fulfilling your desires, expectations, whatever, and then moving on and transcending existence.

The final shot also implies that somehow by passing through the door souls dissolve in those sparks that then inspired a good action on Earth (the guy bringing the letter to Michael), I suppose specifically in that case because Eleanor had become altruist, so her soul inspires actions of altruism. This ties into the panpsychic viewpoint Chidi suggested - "the wave comes back to the ocean". In this perspective individual souls would only be facets of a greater, single soul-stuff, and individuality an illusion of sorts. Passing through the door certifies that one has finished satisfying their individual, particular cravings, and returns to the whole.
