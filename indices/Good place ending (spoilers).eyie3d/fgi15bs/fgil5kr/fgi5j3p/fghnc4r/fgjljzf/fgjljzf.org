Yeah I've had a lot of the same issues with the shows ending. The fact people don't seem to have any option to increase their own intelligence is pretty sad when you consider how many fewer experiences that allows someone like Jason to appreciate (especially since it's established that Jason has Lissencephaly). Also if you could increase your intelligence then you'd never run out of novel experiences to have, since each increase in intelligence would open up many new experiences you wouldn't have been able to appreciate with lower intelligence.

Additionally it's pretty scary that there's no good Janets whose job it is to remind people of how many enjoyable experiences they're missing out on before they decide to off themselves. Since in the case of Jason and Cheeti both characters seem to decide to "pass on" once they personally can't think of any more experiences they want to have.
