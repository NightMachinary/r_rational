  they could try reincarnation, but there are legitimate objections to that solution, i.e. Buddhism

The testing system is in practice reincarnation already, though in an illusory manner of sorts. It's designed to elevate and purify the soul. In fact, the whole show /is/ absolutely Buddhist in all but name. Four enlightened Bodhisattvas pursue the salvation of all humanity instead of only their own; they make it so that humans can elevate their souls through a cycle of lives and trials that teach them to shed their desires, and ultimately achieve completeness and inner emptiness, thus being ready to step out through the door to self-annihilation - to Nirvana.

And then they make it super blatant and on the nose with both the "wave returns to the ocean" maxim and with Jason spending eons in the forest, walking, waiting for Janet, in a state of perfect emptiness, like the monk he pretended to be at the beginning of the story.

I actually found this one of the funniest things about the show. Someone produced and managed to air, in the USA, four seasons of a show whose core message is basically "hey, you know Christian morality and afterlife? That shit's completely fucked up and straight up evil. You know what's not? BUDDHISM". This is like, a new world record of Getting the Crap Past the Radar.
