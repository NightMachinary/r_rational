Taking yourself away from your loved ones and from there ability to think, feel, and act ever again out of a feeling like "I don't want to have to experience anything ever again" is definitely suicide.

Death is when you don't do stuff anymore. If there's an afterlife where you can do stuff, it's really just more life.
