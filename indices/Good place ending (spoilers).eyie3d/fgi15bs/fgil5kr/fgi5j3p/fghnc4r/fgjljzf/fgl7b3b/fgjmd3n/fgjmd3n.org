Scanlon's meta-ethics are a bit more complex than that; iirc the idea is that humans, as a class, have a desire to explain our actions in terms that are /justifiable/ to other humans. The book used in the show, "What We Owe to Each Other" is an analysis of what sorts of explanations will be accepted by (all) other (reasonable) humans.
