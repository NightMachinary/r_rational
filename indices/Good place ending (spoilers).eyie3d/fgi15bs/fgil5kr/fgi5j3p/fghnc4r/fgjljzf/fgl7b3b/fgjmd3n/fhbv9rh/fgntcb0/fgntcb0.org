A couple points:

- They present a legitimate problem. If you are forced to be somewhere forever it's imprisonment and eventual torture. All living things need stimuli. There are a couple ways they could solve this problem: they could mind-wipe the individuals every so often, but that's almost replacing murder for suicide; they could try reincarnation, but there are legitimate objections to that solution, i.e. Buddhism; you could try creating some steady set of problems, but that would suffer from a power-treadmill; there could be some sort of transmutation to a different form of being; you could make people orgasm constantly, thus destroying them in another way; and finally you could offer the voluntary death door.

- I think you're underestimating infinity. Any activity with a limited time approaches zero as a fraction of infinity. I also find it hard to believe that there would be infinite unique ideas or creative works. Take books. There's a finite number of books that can possibly be made in English: [[https://futurism.com/meet-the-digital-library-of-babel-a-complete-combination-of-every-possible-combination-of-letters-ever][10^2,000,000]]. The same is true of other languages. And most of them would be gibberish, like the Infinite Library. Yes, you could be occupied for a very long time, but not eternity.

- Also, setting aside how weird "mastering" people is as a concept, most human beings, especially those in the Good Place, would be more alike than different. Eventually meeting each new person is creating decreasing marginal stimuli gains for the effort.

In a roundabout way, the whole thing reminded me of the Isaac Asimov story about God saving scientists from oblivion so the scientists could develop a way to kill God.
