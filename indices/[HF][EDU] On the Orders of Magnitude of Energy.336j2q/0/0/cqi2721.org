Yeah, if what you want is classical D&D magic, you can't really do the orders of magnitude stuff without adding in a whole bunch of rules that make things inelegant (and the more you have to explain your rules, the worse your story generally is for it).

You /can/ make magic systems that respect certain levels of power - for example, a magic system that mostly involves information or mental magic would be pretty uniformly low energy - but I'm not sure how much of a benefit there is to that.

Mostly I think that it's fine to just accept that magic is thumbing its nose at conventional physics, so long as the rules are internally consistent.
