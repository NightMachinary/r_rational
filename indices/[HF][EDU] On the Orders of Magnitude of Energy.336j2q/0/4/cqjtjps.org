Eragon? AFAICT that magic system is "You can manipulate matter, but the energy cost for that comes directly from your own body's metabolism". Lifting a pebble magically takes the same amount of energy as lifting it mundanely, and that's if you're an experienced magician - it usually takes much /more/ energy.

The characters definitely /cared/ about energetic efficiency and Eragon almost died from the energy cost of making a fireball when he was first starting. The best way to kill a person is to drain all their life energy, and the /second/ best way is to magically damage the carotid artery. The only time you'd kill a person in any other way is when you were fighting another magician who had shields and countermeasures, and even then I don't think anyone was casually throwing large Area of Effect spells around. As far as I know there is no matter creation - the closest thing to it is shaping the direction of growth of living things.

(But it only applied to humans. "Wild" magic which could still break the conservation rules. Dragons can breath fire without paying the full energy cost, for example.)

I didn't read past the first book, so this may be violated later, but from what I recall magic usage was very sensible and conservative.
