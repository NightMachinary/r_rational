One idea - allow magic to manipulate any random variable, that is observable by the mage, and haven't been resolved yet.

The cost in MANA is the integral of the difference between the original and changed random distribution of that variable over the whole domain of the random variable.

Power of the magician is the maximum mana hen can handle in one spell.

Additional difficulty - you don't know what is the original probability distribution, so you can overload yourself if you miscalculate. The best wizards are the best predictors.

And you can estimate probabilities of events by trying to change them and overload on purpose. That's how clairvoyance works, and it makes the wizards doing this mad after a while from all that strain.

Now just to figure out where to get that mana from, so that you can't make infinite feedback loop creating infinite free mana.
