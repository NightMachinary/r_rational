That's an awesome post. There is a problem though.

Can anybody think of a genuinely cool and magicky-feeling magical system where energy is used efficiently like this? I'm not convinced it's possible to design one, and I think Rule of Cool necessarily must be applied in order to have a satisfying magic system that would be recognized by the reader as a magic system that does /magic/. It seems impossible to not run up against this issue and have to handwave it for flavour reasons.
