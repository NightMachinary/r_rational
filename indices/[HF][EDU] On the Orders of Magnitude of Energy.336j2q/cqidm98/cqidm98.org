A lot of this is about the time it takes to release that energy.

For example the energy of fuel in 9 Airbuses A380 is higher than the energy of the atomic bomb that was thrown on Hiroshima.

But it takes a long time to release the energy in airbuses fuel, so it's not devastating. If you made fuel-air bomb with that much fuel I bet the effects would be similary spectacular, maybe more (because not much energy would be lost on radioactivity instead of heat and shock wave).

Actually now I'd like to know what would be the effect of such fuel-air bomb.

BTW it's also the energy of annihilation of 1 gram of matter :/
