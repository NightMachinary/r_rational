I'm tinkering about such magic systems, and the usual trouble is that they give even novice mages too much combat power. There are several ways around it, like making less precise magic more powerful, and vice versa (this allows both fireball and mind magic). Still, mage combat is either throwing sharp objects or ripping arteries (based on available range), and both seems too easy and mundane. Also, deflection fields are also too easy and readily available.
