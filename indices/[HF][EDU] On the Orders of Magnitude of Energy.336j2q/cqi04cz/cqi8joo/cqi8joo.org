The Kingkiller Chronicles - the art of Sympathy, which is essentially an entire magic system devoted to doing energy transformations. At one point, the main character tries to conjure a breeze by binding the motion of the air to the motion of his lungs.

It goes about as well as you'd expect. However, there are some other nifty tricks that work better - plates of metal that simply move thermal energy from one end to the other, lanterns powered by the ambient heat of your hand, etc.
