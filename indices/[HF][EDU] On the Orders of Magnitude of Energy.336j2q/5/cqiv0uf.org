This is actually the entire point of one of my settings coming up in a few years.

The breakdown is ALL MAGIC is merely access to effectively infinite energy.

The actual mechanics of getting that energy to be coherent enough to be useful for anything but blowing up your own brain is the tricky part.

Magic 'caster types' are then further broken down by what degree of agency and automation they 'get' built into their magic. The majority get instinctive or completely automatic magic that they have no agency or control over.
