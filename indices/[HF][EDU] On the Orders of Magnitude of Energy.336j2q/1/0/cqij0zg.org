It's my natural tendency to view magic as a user making function calls instead of a programmer writing code. So it makes total sense that you would have =Fireball()=, =LightningBolt()=, and =Rabbit.Create()= but not be able to specify all that much beyond that, even if they have totally different energy requirements.
