Because there are mechanical limits to how fast you can run. You could use a machine to bypass those limits. For example, turn a crank to lift heavy weights. Then release the weights, connected to something like an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_catapult][aircraft catapult]].

You could also feed animals and get them to pull heavy machinery, to plow fields or whatever tractors do. People might have even converted biological energy like that in the past.

(On a vaguely related note I am still amazed that there are cars/planes/etc. that aren't fly-by-wire. Mechanical linkages seem so strange.)
