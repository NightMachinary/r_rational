What I perceive as a stronger version of the argument isn't always what others will. For example, I might replace emotional fluff with more functional but analogous claims, and be rebuffed for it. The impression of arrogance or putting words in someone else's mouth can also occur - even if no tricks based on wording are planned, trust in that may not exist.

Phrasing summaries as questions can somewhat mitigate the problem, but it risks the same failures. If they think you're treating their answers as obvious or perfunctory, they may be offended. If you use language that's either vague or overly particular in unanticipated ways, it can arouse suspicion. So genuine questions should be interleaved between confirmatory ones - but it's sometimes difficult to ask genuine questions without veering away from the main point, itself potentially irritating.
