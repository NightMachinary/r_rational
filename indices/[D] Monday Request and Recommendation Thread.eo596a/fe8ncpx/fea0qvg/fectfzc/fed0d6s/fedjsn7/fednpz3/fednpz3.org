I agree with you!

I probably made (and will make) all those mistakes. Still, I never experienced people being angry because of it.

Maybe it works for me because I don't do it only when disagreeing with someone, but also when I want to understand them (make sure I do what they expect me to do, get to know them etc.)

Or perhaps some of the other techniques I mentioned (like having a learning conversation instead of a disagreement) offset the (potential) negative effect.
