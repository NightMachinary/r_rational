It's one of the better "restart" (limited to just one battle memory and feelings of regret) light novels/webcomics/manga story.

It's a restart story, so you can expect the common tropes. The world itself is interesting, some quirky characters, nothing extremely out of character yet that has taken me out of the experience, it also has some mystery for the reader to take some guesses at.
