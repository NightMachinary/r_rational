I've had luck with the "nudging by explaining" thing, but only if it's just me and one or two other people and with much time.

re: asking a questions the focus on the work rather than the author. That's VERY helpful! I do a lot of beta-reading/critiquing, and I'm always worried I'm pissing off the author when I say I don't like their work.

I have added the Intel book to my list! Thank you!
