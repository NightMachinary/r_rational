I'm glad you found it helpful :)

I can't take credit for the technique because I've taken it from [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oPEWyxJjRo4oKHzMu/the-3-books-technique-for-learning-a-new-skilll][The 3 Books Technique for Learning a New Skilll]]. It just so happens that it works well for recommendations.
