*Why*: [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11324722-the-righteous-mind][The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion]] by Jonathan Haidt - although it's mostly about disagreement in politics/religion it provides useful models. Intuition comes first, reasoning follows. His metaphor: the elephant (Kahneman's System 1) is the intuition that the driver (System 2) tries to control. We can't persuade anyone without understanding how they think first. Reasons are no match for intuition, so trigger the right intuitions (talk to the elephant).

*How*: I have two books on my shelf that I've read more than 10 years ago. Both on the pop-psychology/self-help side so there are probably better alternatives now.

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15014.Crucial_Conversations][Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High]]

Insights I remember (but can't tell the books apart):

Show that you understand:

- Listen and ask relevant questions.

- Always restate the other person point of view (better than they did if you can - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning][steelmanning]]).

Identify their goal (a coworker on the same project may have a different goal then a higher up) and frame you disagreement within it (as a way to achieve it).

Don't share judgements ("it's naive") but facts ("we tried it, it failed").

The goal is to have *learning conversations*, not disagreements.

I don't have a good *what* (reference) book. Buster Benson of the [[https://medium.com/better-humans/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18][Cognitive bias cheat sheet]] (Medium warning, try [[https://busterbenson.com/piles/cognitive-biases/][his site]] or [[https://pocket-biases.glideapp.io][app]]) fame has a book out [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44279111-why-are-we-yelling][Why Are We Yelling?: The Art of Productive Disagreement]] but I haven't read it yet.

Bonus:

- Tyler Cowen and Robin Hanson on [[https://mason.gmu.edu/%7Erhanson/deceive.pdf][Are Disagreements Honest?]] (PDF) Spoiler: no ;P

- John Nerst tries to jump-start [[https://everythingstudies.com/2016/01/12/erisology/][Erisology]] - the study of disagreement.

- Paul Graham on moving up the [[http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html][disagreement hierarchy]].
