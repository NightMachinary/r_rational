Oh I very much like your "How" "Why" and "what" break-down. I'll use it the next time I give recommendations. I read Crucial Conversations about a year ago and it still holds up! I got a lot of use out of it. Difficult Conversations I haven't read though. I put it on my list :) "Identify the goal" must be from Difficult Conversations. Or else I forgot it. But it seems like good advice :) And thanks for the Bonus papers. They're all new to me. I especially like the word "erisology."
