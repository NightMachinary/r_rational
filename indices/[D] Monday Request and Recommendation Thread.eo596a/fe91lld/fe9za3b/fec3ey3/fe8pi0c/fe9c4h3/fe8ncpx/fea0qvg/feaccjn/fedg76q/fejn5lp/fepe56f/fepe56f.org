On the topic of working together...

If you'd be interested in sources other than books, Wikipedia actually has an assortment of helpful meta articles in their conduct guidelines for editors. As you might expect, the largest and longest running online collaborative project has amassed a wealth of experience with interpersonal conflict and disagreeing productively.

For example, here are few guidelines which have been helpful to me in the past:

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Civility][Wikipedia:Civility]]

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith][Wikipedia:Assume good faith]]

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_the_assumption_of_good_faith][Wikipedia:Assume the assumption of good faith]]
