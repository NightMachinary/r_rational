"High output management", maybe. He doesn't explain it explicitly, but more hints at it by explaining how he talks with his managers and acts in meetings. The most he gets into it is explaining that you mostly nudge people's views by explaining your point of view.

In this specific example I'd ask a question that implies the work isn't good enough without implying the person is to blame for it.

ex. A had to write an article, but it's too short, B asks: Was the research material we gathered not enough ? Could you maybe squeeze a couple thousand more words out of it or do we need to get more research material? I don't think X (authority figure, boss, audience etc) would be ok with us publishing it with this many words..

But hey read intel's CEOs book. The first chapter is gold, he'll explain how to run a massive manufacturing business using making breakfast as an analogy.
