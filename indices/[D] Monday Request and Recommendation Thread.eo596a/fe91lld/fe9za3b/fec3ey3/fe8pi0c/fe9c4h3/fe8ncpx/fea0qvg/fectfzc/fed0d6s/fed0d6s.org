Interesting, any idea why or what is a better way of showing that one understands?

Maybe it depends on how one does it (I'm assuming the other person wasn't angry/frustrated before restating). As Ozy observes in [[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/the-highest-form-of-disagreement/531597/][Against Steelmanning]] don't strawman someone's views only to use their actual views as a steelman and don't steelman without understanding their argument at all.

Steelmanning is hard, but I'm yet to make someone angry by honestly restating their views ("Help me understand, do you think that...").

Here is Daniel Dennett on [[https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/03/28/daniel-dennett-rapoport-rules-criticism/][How to Criticize with Kindness]] :

  1. You should attempt to re-express your target's position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, â€œThanks, I wish I'd thought of putting it that way.

  2. You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).

  3. You should mention anything you have learned from your target.

  4. Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.
