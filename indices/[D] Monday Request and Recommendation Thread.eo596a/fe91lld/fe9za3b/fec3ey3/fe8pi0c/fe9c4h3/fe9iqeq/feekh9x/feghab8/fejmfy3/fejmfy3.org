Oh man I hope somebody does recommend something in the same vein as Dichronauts. I haven't seen anything that comes close, but there are:

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/866402.The_Planiverse][The Planiverse]] by A.K. Dewdney (a very thin story stretched over an exploration of a 2D world)

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/186689.Orphans_of_Chaos?from_search=true&qid=tZIxmKPGeg&rank=1][Orphans of Chaos]] by John C. Wright (a rather good story with a few interesting explorations of higher dimensions)

Guy Haley's [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12244342-champion-of-mars?from_search=true&qid=2wrVdxkHtW&rank=1][Champion of Mars]] has just a tiny bit of geometrical shenanigans...

And of course there's [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.8144][Possible Bubbles of Spacetime Curvature in the South Pacific]]

I'd love to see some other reccs along these lines.
