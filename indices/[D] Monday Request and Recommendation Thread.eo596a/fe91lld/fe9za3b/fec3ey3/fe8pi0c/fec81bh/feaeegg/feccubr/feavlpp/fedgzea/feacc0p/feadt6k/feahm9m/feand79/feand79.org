Oh...well then do you have any recommendations for me? Lol. I've read Defiance of the Fall up to current, and found [[https://forum.novelupdates.com/threads/something-similar-to-azarinth-healer-and-delve-on-rr.91420/][this post]] that had several recs. The few that I tried on it weren't anything special, and I wasn't jonesing enough to stick to them but if you're desperate (and haven't finished all of those) it might be worth checking into. I did read Azarinth Healer to current. The writing is very rough to begin with (for a pretty decent chunk of the story) but it does get better by the end. Not sure if I would really recommend it though, the late writing is fine, but the first parts are really kind of a slog.
