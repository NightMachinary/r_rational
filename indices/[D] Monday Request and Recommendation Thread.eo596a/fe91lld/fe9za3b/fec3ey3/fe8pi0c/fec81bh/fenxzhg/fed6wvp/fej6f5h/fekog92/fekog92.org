It's a xianxia novel written by an American author. Xianxia as a category is generally about achieving enlightenment through violence, with ever-escalating degrees of violence needing higher levels of enlightenment. Should a xianxia series go on for long enough, a main character will inevitably punch out Cthulhu (or some other deity level entity).

The entire genre bears a striking resemblance to LitRPGs, because the different levels of enlightenment are rigidly stratified and it's generally a bad idea to fight someone at a different "level" from yourself (because you'll definitely lose if they're higher, and fighting someone at a lower level is like punching a puppy)

Cradle, specifically, is one of the better xianxia series; the author has put a lot of thought into the basis of the various paths so every fight is different and makes a lot of sense. He's also spent some time deconstructing and reconstructing a world in which pretty much everyone is some sort of superhero, from the lowliest janitor to the local nobility.
