I want to recommend the game Socrates Jones: Pro Philosopher. It's this weird indie game about moral philosophy (2-3 hours long) where you play as an accountant who is sent to the underworld where in order to return to life he has to debate a series of (real historical) philosophers about their theories. It's structured like Phoenix Wright where the gameplay consists primarily of dictating the conversation and questioning the moral philosophers. The cool thing about it is that the game uses applicable (though admittedly relatively low level) conversation strategies for productive debate like asking for backup or questioning the relevance of a point and having a credibility bar which decreases if you challenge the other party meaninglessly without good backup.

I'm not sure that it is fully rational but it most likes would qualify as rationalist
