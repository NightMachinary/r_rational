(edited for length) I'm sequestering my negative comments in a separate reply, so people can more easily ignore them.

I started Haidt but put it down when I noticed a blind spot in the moral disgust studies he conducted (the stories about eating roadkill, burning a flag, etc.). He claims that the farther away you get from educated liberal westerners, the more moral disgust separates from any rational moral basis (the example I remember is the widowed woman eating fish, which was considered disgusting in India). This seems to support the hypothesis either that either only western liberals are /really/ moral, or else that rational morality is a mirage, and there is no objective difference between what disgusts one culture and another.

I disagree with both analyses. I think the problem is that Haidt's team didn't write stories that would get them in trouble in academia, so they're missing the stories that would irrationally disgust educated westerners.

I also had a lot of trouble with Benson. "Why are We Yelling" ruined my day when I tried to read it, which is part of the reason I'm asking these questions now. The problem is that he seems to suggest that certain conversations are impossible until one side makes ritual obeisance to the values of the other (the side that Benson happens to agree with).

Which isn't to say that Benson's strategies aren't useful in and of themselves. Strategies (like Steelmanning) can be useful or not depending on what you do with them. Steven Covey ([[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36072.The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People][The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People]] - much recommended) calls them "surface techniques" which need moral principles behind them if they are to do good.
