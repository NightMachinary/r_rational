And here's a theory that I've evolved this past week: what if debate is the wrong way to approach disagreement? What if negotiation is better? Rather than say "here is why I think you should abandon your ideas and switch to mine" you say "here is what we need to do in order to work together."

Which suggests I should look up some books on negotiation...
