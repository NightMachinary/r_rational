- [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KMMT9TX][New Game Minus]] is one of the better LitRPGs IMO - it's particularly good at pointing out the inhumanity of reducing people to numbers.
- [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KS2HQQV][Irrelevant Jack]] is another one of those neat LitRPGs that really examines what it would be like to live in a weird game world
- [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078NXCKZ4][The City and the Dungeon]] is the same thing, except this time it's a rogue-like mashup (there's references to everything from NetHack to ADOM)
- [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZQMLMS6][The Dream Trilogy]] is (IMO) particularly good - it's about a bunch of retired Iraq grunts who get Isekai'd into a different world and break things until they get out.
- Xianxia is basically LitRPG, and [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076G8DVN6][Cradle]] is one of the better western Xianxia novels
