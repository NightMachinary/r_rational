I tried out Irrelevant Jack, not a huge fan. The way he got to the game world was not my cup of tea, but that part is easily skimmed over. The side characters don't act in a realistic way (but that could be because they are NPCs) and the main character just holds the idiot ball throughout the whole book. The "romance" is bad, really bad. But reviews on goodreads seemed to be positive, so maybe it's just me.

I liked The City and the Dungeon better, but it became repetitive and lacked a plot to get me invested in the book. I stopped reading about 70% of the way through.
