The side characters in Irrelevant Jack are literally NPCs (and I don't think that's a spoiler). The thing is that they /look/ human, so Jack assumes they're going to act like people - which is what causes a lot of friction in the first book.

Convincing them to be proactive and to treat their world as a place they can control is a major theme of the novels, especially once Jack gets his feet under him.
