It's likely you're already following it, but just in case (since you only mentioned Elemental Arena when talking about this sub specifically), [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249][Worth The Candle]] is a litrpg. Its system is more in the style of a TTRPG, and isn't universally applied as is commonly seen elsewhere, but the protagonist still has stats and levels and whatnot.
