Do you mind Book recommendations? As in, not webnovels. Because I got one or two that I liked:

Euphoria Online (Trilogy) and; Forever Fantasy Online (Another Trilogy)

They are both pretty decent.

Euphoria: A Hyper realistic D&D-Style VR Multiplayer RPG created by the world's first True AI. It costs thousands of dollars to log in for a week's session, but each week is 6 months time while in the game due to Time perception/dilation shenanigans. It includes a mode that players can choose called "Death March" which I'm sure you can guess what it entails.

Forever Fantasy Online: Another VR MMORPG, but this time shit turns /real/ real, with NPCs turning sapient, menus/HUD disappearing and death becoming permanent. The change happens while people are playing and things turn for the worse. In my opinion, it depicts MMOs and the people who play them more realistically than many other stories i've watched/read (looking at you SAO). From the way they talk to how shitty some gamers can be.

If nothing else, read FFO for the dude who played as a big-breasted Catgirl for the lulz and now has to deal with people creeping on him. It's quite fun.
