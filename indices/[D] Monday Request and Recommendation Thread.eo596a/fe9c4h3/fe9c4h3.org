I've spent my free time for the past week rereading the Orthogonal trilogy, reading the supplements on the author's website, buying and reading some of his other works like Dichronauts and playing the video game Antichamber, before reading some of Ted Chiang's short stories. Can anybody recommend some other good stuff in settings with logically consistent changes to geometry, topology or spacetime?
