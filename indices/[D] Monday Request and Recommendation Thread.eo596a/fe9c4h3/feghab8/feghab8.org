It is not strictly speaking what you're looking for but the short story collection /The Fifth Science/ by Exurb1a (the YouTuber) scratched many of the same itches as Ted Chiang's stuff. Also /The Study of Anglophysics/ by Scott Alexander is a comedic sci fi short story about a world where the lowest level of reality is linguistics instead of maths. Come to think of it, /Unsong/ by the same has the premise that the machine that causes the universe to run on math has broken, reverting it to the primordial state of running on kabbalah.
