I'd recommend the /Gentleman Bastards/ series, which is about a gang of thieves in a renaissance Italy styled fantasy world performing various heists. The dialogue is exceptionally funny, although a bit coarse.

Some relevant excerpts:

"I'm sure we can communicate. I speak fluent hatchet."

"It was strange, how readily authority could be conjured with nothing but a bit of strutting jackassery."

“I suspect that drink has made you impulsive.“ “Drink makes me see funny; the gods made me impulsive.“
