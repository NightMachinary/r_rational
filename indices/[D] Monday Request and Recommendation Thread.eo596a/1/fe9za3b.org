I'd like to recommend 'The book of the Ancestors' trilogy by Mark Lawrence. Not necessarily rational but a really good example of great writing and worldbuilding.

​

The author is a master at showing not telling, his worldbuilding is incredible and very creative, the combat is fantastic and I'm really picky about this, and the plot is out of this world. A female main character that's very powerful but also very much not a Mary Sue..

​

There's not much I can say without spoiling things, but it's that kind of book that makes you want to tell your non reader friends about the worldbuilding and think in the shower about how to best explain it so they'll appreciate it as much as you do..
