Interesting in the beginning, but got very frustrating towards the second half. At several points it felt like I was trying guess what the creator was thinking instead finding a valid counter-argument.

I know they can't think up every counter-point people could make, but at least there should have been some relevant text for the more coherent but incorrect argument combinations instead of the generic "your argument made no sense" text.
