[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve][Delve]] is good and somehow hits a lot of notes for my ratfic obsession while not qctually being very rational.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests][Everybody Loves Large Chests]] is a comedy with lots of good misleads and some smut. Author is still updating occasionally but has admitted to being burnt out on the story. That being said, it's long and almost finished.

[[https://wanderinginn.com/][The Wandering Inn]] is a very popular LitRPG... but it's not on RR.
