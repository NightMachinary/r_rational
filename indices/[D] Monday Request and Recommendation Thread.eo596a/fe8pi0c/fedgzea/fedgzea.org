I just enjoyed the first few chapters of the webtoon "[[https://mangakakalot.com/manga/ra921707][Survival Story of a Sword King In A Fantasy World]]". Changes up some boring tropes, has a good sense of humor.

And since you're already reading the stuff that's on this sub, you've probably read [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-daring-synthesis-worm-the-gamer.607375/reader/?page=4][a daring synthesis]], but just in case I should plug it.
