I don't think this is the best or particularly rational, but I've really been enjoying [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25878/wake-of-the-ravager][Wake of the Ravager]]. It starts pretty generic, and the system has some strange caveats, but I eventually started enjoying the character banter, realized that the 'romance/harem' aspects were comedy, and the world was fairly unique.

Main character is perhaps too well perched to dominate, but I can't say I'm not enjoying the process. It's an munchkin main character done fairly well.
