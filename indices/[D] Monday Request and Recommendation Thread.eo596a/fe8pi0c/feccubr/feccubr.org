I'm gonna be recommending litrpg-adjacent stuff, like progression fantasy, fantasy with stats, etc.

Reborn: Apocalypse is a litrpg/xianxia hybrid with lots of planning and action, although the planning is more like Death Note than Worth the Candle. Still, it's very addictive if you can get into it.

The Scourged Earth is like litrpg horror almost. There are stats but they don't mean much, and humanity is beset by space viruses, except these viruses can be hive-mind soldiers, literal fungus, space warping hands, giant redwood trees, etc. Great creature design and variety, and the plotlines are pretty consistent.

Defiance of the Fall is another litrpg/xianxia hybrid with a barbarian main character. It's pretty standard fare in terms of story but at least no one holds the idiot ball too much.

The Zombie Knight Saga has the undead fight amongst each other with elemental powers and science! Death is also only a small setback here, so you have battles where the actual people are broken piles of mush or dismembered torsos, just flitting around.

He Who Fights Against Monsters has pretty good humor, although I find the protagonist to be kinda asshole-ish. Pretty good.
