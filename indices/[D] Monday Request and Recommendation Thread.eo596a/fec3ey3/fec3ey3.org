Hi, I am looking for engaging or comedic (both would be great) story or fanfiction with believable character decisions and dialogue. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

Looking for something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12642859/1/Guitar-Huntsman][Guitar Huntsman (RWBY)]], it's funny and the characters decisions, knowledge, and dialogue is believable. I also enjoy his other work, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12625131/1/The-Shield-of-Vale][The Shield of Vale]], and most of Coeur Al'Aran's fanficitons.

I also enjoy novels like: Lord of the Mysteries, Overlord (LN), The Second Coming of Gluttony.

The Main Character does not need to be male or human.

Thank you.
