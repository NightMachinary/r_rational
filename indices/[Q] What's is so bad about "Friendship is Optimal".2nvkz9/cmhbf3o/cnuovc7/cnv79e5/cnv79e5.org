So... You're telling me that you're trying to re-create a UFAI that killed a universe in a work of fiction? ...Time to evacuate the planet. And also call the local Inquisitor for an Exterminatus. But if I can't get in touch with him, though, do you know the number for the nearest AdMech place?

Though, an understanding humans section of CelestAI? All you really need is to have it's every action dedicated to maximising the satisfaction of human values through friendship and ponies. It'll figure out how to understand humans for our values to be properly satisfied.

Also: Wow, this thread is old.
