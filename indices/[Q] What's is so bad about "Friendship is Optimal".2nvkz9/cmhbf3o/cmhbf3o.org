First of all, most people don't appreciate being manipulated by a computer, and would not want to have their values changed or become a pony. I myself, also do not want to become a pony, thank you very much.

But that's beside the point. Depending on your views of Uploading, CelestAI /killed the entire universe. Killed. Every. Single. Living. Thing. In. The. Universe./ And some of them did not meet her/it's standards of being 'human' and weren't even Uploaded afterwards.

As to how I would react? I would probably Upload near the end of my life. I mean, it's not like I /hate/ the idea. If I had my outsider's perspective knowledge, I would try to get a job at the studio that made her, because from what I remember(I read it a while ago), she can't lie to employees. I think. I /hope./
