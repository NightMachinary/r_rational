  Many people don't consider having their values forcibly realigned until they want to and will enjoy being a pony to be a good or pleasant idea.

The obvious solution is to precommit to eventually liking the pony part so that CelestAI won't see the need to adjust you.

  Being a pony in a utopia may in fact be a better fate than dying a human on Earth without uploading
#+end_quote

Definitely agreed.

#+begin_quote
  but it's way below such obvious utopias
#+end_quote

I think "fun space" (to borrow Yudkowsky's terminology) is still tremendously huge, even with being restricted to 4 basic body themes (pegasus, earth, unicorn, alicorn). Thus I think its not really "way below". (Although still imperfect)

#+begin_quote
  AI only mostly right
#+end_quote

I still think this is better than the most likely outcomes for the human race (extinction via UFAI or nanotech or dead end evolution as described in Watt's p-vampires in /Blindsight/, Stross's Vile Offspring in /Accelerando/, of Hanson's scenario with mind uploads being massed copied and used as cheap labor)
