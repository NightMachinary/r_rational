The Culture suffers from the same problem, it's just much harder to identify the causes.

In a post-scarcity society ruled by benevolent AGIs, people /shouldn't/ suffer from ennui and eventually become reckless or kill themselves. But there isn't an AGI whose explicit goal is "make humans suffer ennui", so it's not obvious what went wrong.
