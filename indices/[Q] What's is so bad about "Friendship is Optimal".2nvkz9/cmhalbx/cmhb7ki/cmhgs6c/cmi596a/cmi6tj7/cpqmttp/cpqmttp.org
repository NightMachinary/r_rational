Culture Minds aren't hardwired, and their main interest in humans seems to be as counters in one of the social games they play with each other. Humans have near-perfect freedom of movement, so if your hull/orbital/world/whatever has a large number of humans wanting to live there, you're doing well at the game. It's something between owning pets and birdwatching as far as the Minds are concerned.

Satisfying human values is a tactic, not a goal.
