I think the problem in the culture is that, to make the stories interesting they deal with conflict, and to have Human Culture characters in them we have to have the dissafected people who have either fallen out of the AGI's grasp or have been guided to seek out conflict/contact instead of staying deep in the culture and enjoying themselves. That said the AGIs have many human failings, but I think that is for the same reason the original Optimalverse author asks his extended universe fan fiction writers to not try writing from CelestAI's perspective.
