The whole pony thing basically does several things:

- make the change take place slower, with fewer and slower human adopters and more resistance and therefore more humans dying and being lost forever unnecessarily. Basically, it means that people who are old and ill and likely to die soon and be forever lost from the human race are way more likely not to be uploaded to live forever. I have living grandparents who might upload before dying if the tech existed today, but won't because it doesn't; persuading them to do it as ponies would take a lot more work than persuading them to upload as humans, and increasing the chance that they die of old age so I never see them again in the digital utopia of the future so that a /insane AI can have ponies/ is totally ****ed.

- make humans slightly less optimally happy - I mean, I currently think that if I was uploaded I might want to spend time as a pony, sure... but I'd also like to spend time as a woman, and as a man, and as a dolphin, and as a goose and a whale and a arctic fox ... and as a bunch of things I haven't even imagined yet. It'd be totally amazing and satisfying a bunch of my values to be able to do that, but all of that sort of thing are outlawed by the whole "ponies" proscription.

Yes, having a weird utopia full of ponies is way better than what we have now. However, it's not like the utopia /has to necessarily have downsides/. And choosing to prefer the utopia /without/ bizarre pony-related downsides that will /permanently kill some significant fraction of old people currently alive/ and will /restrict your options in the digital utopia of the future/ is totally consistent with preferring the Friendship Is Optimal world's upsides even with pony-related downsides to the present state of the world.
