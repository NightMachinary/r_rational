  However, *it's not like the utopia has to necessarily have downsides*. And choosing to prefer the utopia without bizarre pony-related downsides that will permanently kill some significant fraction of old people currently alive and will restrict your options in the digital utopia of the future is totally consistent with preferring the Friendship Is Optimal world's upsides even with pony-related downsides to the present state of the world.

There aren't enough upvotes in the world for this, especially the part I bolded at the start. One of the things about living in a /True Neutral/ universe is that once you get the power to make it do what /you/ want, there can be /no downsides whatsoever/.

Also, as someone who really quite likes MLP and sugar-bowl settings in general, and who probably would have just gone quietly and voluntarily (with immense embarrassment) should that story have happened in real life, why does it never go through anyone's heads that the whole force, manipulation, enslavement, and omnicide deal /just isn't the sweet, nice, friendship-y thing to do/?

The thought ought to occur that our adorable posthuman descendants with lives full of fun, sunshine, and warmth /wouldn't want to be born from an act of universal-scale genocide./
