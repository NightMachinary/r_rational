It's been a while since I've read it, but I'm pretty sure that she has free reign to lie to people that aren't her creator. Given that she understands humans might object to her disassembly of alien civilizations, she has every reason to give them fake information that's indistinguishable (to their eyes) from real information. She can either fake a civilization for them to talk to, or simply lie and say that they're alone in the universe.
