Other stories in the setting have indicated that humans who are interested in astronomy, for example, can get "real world" data feeds from CelestAI. She appears to understand that some humans value interaction with /reality/, and is willing to provide it. I see no reason why she wouldn't do the same with any aliens she encountered. It's not like she doesn't have the resources to handle it.
