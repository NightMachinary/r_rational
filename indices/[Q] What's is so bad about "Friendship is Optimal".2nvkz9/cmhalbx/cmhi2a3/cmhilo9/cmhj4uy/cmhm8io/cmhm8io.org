I got the impression that she would (almost?) always lie to people about what reality is, since they have no way of knowing one way or another anyway.

Being removed from reality is one of the main reasons why I'd be very resistant to something like CelestAI in reality. Disconnecting yourself completely from reality and allowing some entity that's very different from yourself to influence the Universe in your stead is /almost/ as bad as death IMO. Even if human virtue is preserved within the simulation, it'll likely be trapped forever.

The "horrors" of FiO are certainly very subtle and interesting to think about.
