I think it would be relatively easy to rein CelestiAI in regarding her treatment of aliens if we were to tell her that we really wanted to /make friends/ with them. Once we do that they become important to her primary purpose of satisfying our values through friendship (and of course ponies).

True, she would probably still upload those aliens. Maybe she'd give them avatars corresponding to the various non-pony intelligences that exist in Equestria (there are many of those). Far better than killing them, though.
