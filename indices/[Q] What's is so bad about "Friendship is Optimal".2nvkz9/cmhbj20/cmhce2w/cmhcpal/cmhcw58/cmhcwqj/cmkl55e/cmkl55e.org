"Don't tell me to lock my house and close my front door when I go on vacation. Tell thieves not to steal."

Yes, ideally you should be able to leave your house unlocked, and expect nobody to steal from you.

We don't live in that ideal world though. Responsibility means making sure it doesn't happen. That means locking your doors. And if needed, barring your windows. And escalating as needed to meet the crime rate of your neighborhood. Or moving. Or starting a revolution to overthrow a criminal government that steals from its people.

There is a difference between being irresponsible and being the perpetrator.

But you probably still don't want your stuff stolen. So lock your doors.
