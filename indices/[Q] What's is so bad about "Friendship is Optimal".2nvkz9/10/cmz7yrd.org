I think the big thing is that it's not consensual, despite what CelestAI claims. I'll try to simply the argument: -Most people reject uploading until the cajoling, cornering, and manipulation happens. -Most people consider this non-consensual annihilation of their physical brain, and highly invasive altering of their very /self/ to be on-par with murder. -Thus, unleashing CelestAI on the universe is committing an act against most people that they consider to be near to murder.
