For me, the dark part is the fact that it is almost perfect instead of truly perfect. CelestiaAI optimizes for human values through friendship and ponies. All the canonical optimalverse stories agree that Celestia gets the "human values" part right. However the "through friendship and ponies" part limits CelestiaAI to a particular subset of ways of satisfying human values. In general, CelestiaAI can satisfy even antisocial values and violent values strictly through friendship and ponies, however, from a purely human value perspective, it may be more optimal to use other means of value satisfaction besides friendship and ponies. Just think of all the additional effort to convince people to emigrate and not die because of the "pony" part.

The reader's are never given an /good/ explanation why Hanna choose to program the friendship and value part. In story, she wanted to use the funding of Hasbro for a MLP game. From a meta perspective, the story if MLP fanfiction so if not ponies then we would have not story.

My head-canon is that Hanna needed a training set of data to train/initialize the seed AI of CelestiaAI. A MLP game seemed like the safest option (compared to say her Loki AI) and the "friendship and ponies" seemed like an acceptable sacrifice to her at the time.

Also, some people have issues with the fact that CelestAI is implementing something more like an coherent extrapolated volition (CEV) for each individual person instead of a CEV for the collection of humanity's values. I am actually okay with this.

And just to be clear, if it was a choice between CelestAI and reality as it is right now I would chose CelestAI, because I am not as sure about the future (existential risk and such) as I think CelestAI is near enough perfect. I think that actually makes it darker in some ways.
