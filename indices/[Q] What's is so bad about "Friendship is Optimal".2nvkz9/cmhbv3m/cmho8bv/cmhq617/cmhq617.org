I don't think I can justify it from utulitarian point of view. They are not existing beings forced to become your "paradise foil", they're created from nothing, so no harm done, it seems.

But for my imperfect human morals it just feels /very wrong/ for fully sentient being to exist just to "satisfy your values". They are equal to you, because they are as sentient as you, but at the same time they are less than you, because they exist just to satisfy you. If it makes any sense...
