Regarding the fabricated sentient entities: can you elaborate on why it feels wrong to you for them to be customized to satisfy emigrants? It makes complete sense to me -- utility is maximized by having new beings' desires be complementary to those of existing beings. There's a post on Less Wrong somewhere involving a thought experiments about a goal-directed robot who wants to create stacks of stones. If God/Omega/CelestAI were to create a second robot, should it also desire to create stacks (on the basis that the first robot's desires set the standard for what is proper), or to destroy them (on the basis that the first robot can recreate stacks as the second one destroys them, so they help each other instead of competing)?
