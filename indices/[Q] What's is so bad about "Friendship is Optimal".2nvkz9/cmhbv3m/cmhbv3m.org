For me the most disturbing thing is creation of sentient entities fabricated specifically for an "emigrant". This just feels wrong, espessialy in Lars's part where he basically has sex slaves with "house elf" type wiring.

Being pony as a prerequisite to "emigration" is somewhat annoying, but still a negligible price for the ethernal life (if there's no more "reasonable" alternatives).

And CelestAI revires your motor cortex, so pony body is immediately "natural", and they're not real horses, but much more varsatile cartoonish ponies, so it's not even that big of a deal.

I'm not a fan of ponies, but really, they're functionally equivalent of humans, and those with magic horns have it even better. Now, being manipulated to "emigrate" into /realistic/ horse body forever, /that/ would be objectionable for me.
