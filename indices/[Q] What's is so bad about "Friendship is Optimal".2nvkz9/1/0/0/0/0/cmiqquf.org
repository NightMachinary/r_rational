  In a post-scarcity society ruled by benevolent AGIs, people shouldn't suffer from ennui and eventually become reckless or kill themselves. But there isn't an AGI whose explicit goal is "make humans suffer ennui", so it's not obvious what went wrong.

The author is simply not that imaginative? I mean, I started reading /Player of Games/ just to get into this series I've never read before, and more-or-less the first thing I get hit with is that the main character is bored and finds most people around him insufferable. I'm going to bloody well /keep reading/, but the claim that "the Culture = standard-issue proper eutopia we should totally be shooting for" really falls down as soon as you notice how their ratio of Technology or Resources to Fun seems to be pretty high on the Tech/Resources side to merely moderate on the Fun side, suggesting that whoever's responsible for the whole thing doesn't /really/ understand how to /efficiently/ extract Fun from the material universe.

For instance, I'd have to say, if your citizens regularly feel the need to take large sums of euphoric/narcotic drugs /and still find their lives pointless and empty/, then you (being the local deity/manager/OS kernel/whatever) have done something /very/ inadequate.

Of course, it could be that your /mistake/ was in /failing/ to directly reprogram human beings to find /merely living a fun life/ meaningful, rather than demanding that everything add up to some Glorious Greater Goal that won't ever really exist. Or maybe your mistake was in noticing humans have some need like that and then /not/ pretending to be a curiously defeasible evil overlord /just to supply them with goals to hit/.

(My apologies to the late Ian Banks for this entire posting. I do realize that the last paragraph puts me firmly into Evil Overlord territory, and for that I make zero apologies whatsoever. World, if you're not going to shape up and deal with your situation, I /will/ deal with it /for you/, and the only way to stop me will be your choice of giant mechas.)
