I think that the problem with the Culture is that while the Minds are hard-wired to be vaguely benevolent, they don't care /that/ much about satisfying human values. It seems to me that they mostly care about what humans and other Minds /think/ about how they're taking care of their humans, and not so much about whether the humans under their care are /actually/ receiving maximum life satisfaction.
