  So maybe instead of sitting on your butt going, "Gosh the future's going to be pretty awful!" you should do something about it.

I am, I just finished multiple grad school applications over thanksgiving. I want to research neuromorphic hardware/software. Every time I am tempted to just get a job, I remember that I have the potential to make a marginal contribution to the overall development of AI by mankind, and I should make the most use of that potential possible.

My main source of pessimism is that I think Friendly AI (or any AI with stable goals as it self improves) as described by MIRI is going to be a lot harder than just general AI (which I think can be achieved faster by techniques like imitating/copying existing biological intelligence).
