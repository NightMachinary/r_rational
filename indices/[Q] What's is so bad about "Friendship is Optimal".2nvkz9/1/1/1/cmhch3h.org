  I still think this is better than the most likely outcomes for the human race (extinction via UFAI or nanotech or dead end evolution as described in Watt's p-vampires in Blindsight, Stross's Vile Offspring in Accelerando, of Hanson's scenario with mind uploads being massed copied and used as cheap labor)

Speaking of precommitment, the /actual most likely outcome/ is usually the one we're putting the most active effort into creating, /not/ the one written in science fiction novels by people who think they can predict without creating. So maybe instead of sitting on your butt going, "Gosh the future's going to be pretty awful!" you should /do something about it/.
