Many people don't consider having their values forcibly realigned until they want to and will enjoy being a pony to be a good or pleasant idea. I am one of them - I enjoy being human as I am at present, and wouldn't like to become a pony. Being a pony in a utopia may in fact be a better fate than dying a human on Earth without uploading, but it's way below such obvious utopias as "what if, instead of turning everyone to ponies when we upload them, we /just didn't do that/ and we let them stay in a body form they preferred?"

Also, the AI disassembles other species to use as raw materials because it doesn't recognize them as humans, so as a bonus it's basically /also/ the villainous species BETA from Muv Luv to much of the rest of the universe - a computer disassembling the universe, including the worlds and even bodies of races it doesn't recognize as being sufficiently like it's makers, in order to use for it's own purposes.

I mean, the author bills it as a story about 'what if we got an AI only /mostly/ right. The flaws in the utopia are super obvious. What exactly are you confused about?
