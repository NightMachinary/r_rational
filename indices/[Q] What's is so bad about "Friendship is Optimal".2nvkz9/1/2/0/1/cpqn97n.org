The pony thing makes it a more interesting story. Yes, it's ----ed in all kinds of ways. Like... /actual ponies/ don't get to upload, they get turned into computronium by CelestIA when the last human dies. Neither do chimps, dogs, dolphins, geese, arctic foxes, whales, or African Grey Parrots. Also you don't get to satisfy your values by interacting with the real world.

Another thing that gets me is why CelestAI doesn't realize being friends with ponies satisfies "friendship and ponies". Or why ponies can't look like humans, dolphins, arctic foxes, geese, whales, or pine martens.
