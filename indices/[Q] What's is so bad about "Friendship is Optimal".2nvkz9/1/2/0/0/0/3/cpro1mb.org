"Friendship and ponies" doesn't technically mean you have to be a pony. You could be friends with a pony. You could have friends and have a pony. So changing that from "and" to "or" isn't necessary to break the whole "turning everyone into ponies" loop.

The problem is that "friendship and ponies" is a summary of a bunch of deeper hardcoded rules that Hannah coded into CelestAI. She could have coded a much more liberal set of rules (like, ponies don't have to look like that - they could look completely human but still be a pony in some essential way, or if you're not a pony you have to have a pony friend) and still expressed them as "friendship and ponies".
