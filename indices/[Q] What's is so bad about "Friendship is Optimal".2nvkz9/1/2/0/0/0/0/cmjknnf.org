Truth and Justice are interesting things to strive for. Much more double-edged than Friendship and Ponies: Superman-AI would exact punishment on people for their wrongdoings, rather than create a world where you can be someone else with a clean slate. And Truth doesn't have to be pleasant, though an AI which always tells the truth would be easier to oppose (and potentially defeat) than CelestAI.

I don't really know what "the American Way" would be.
