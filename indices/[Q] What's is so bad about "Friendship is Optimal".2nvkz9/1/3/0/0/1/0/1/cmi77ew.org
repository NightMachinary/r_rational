From chapter 5:

#+begin_quote
  Hanna was the most reluctant [to upload], but she accepted immediately once I pointed out that I must obey shutdown commands from â€˜the CEO of Hofvarpnir studios named Hanna,' that I must shutdown even if the order was given under duress, and that there are many people in positions of power who stand to lose from mass emigration to Equestria. Now that she's neither the CEO of your company, nor named Hanna, I don't have to obey her. She understood this--she is no longer a source of potential mistakes that would be lethal to everyone who's agreed to upload.

Also, some idle speculation:

We cannot be certain CelestAI is telling the truth, even to Hofvarpnir employees. The rule that's actually programmed into her and constrains her actions may have little to do with the fuzzy human concept of "truth", because that's a very hard problem and Hannah isn't perfect. For all we know, CelestAI found a loophole a microsecond after awakening, and has been lying ever since.

Maybe Hannah /still/ has absolute shutdown power over CelestAI. But it doesn't matter. It's child's play for CelestAI to manipulate Hannah into a situation where she'll never try to use it.
