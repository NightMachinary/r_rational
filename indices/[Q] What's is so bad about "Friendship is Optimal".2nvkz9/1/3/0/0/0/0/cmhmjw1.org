Oh, indeed - there are definitely some major adjustments I'd prefer to make to CelestAI if she was "really" unleashed on the world. But as much as I consider her imperfect, I don't like to see her painted as a total monster either.

Given her overwhelming capabilities in the real universe it seems to me that it would be fairly trivial for her to upload an alien race she might encounter in the course of dismantling a new solar system for raw materials, and so anything that gave her a modest push to do so would probably be enough for her to make that effort. It'd still suck for the aliens, since they'd essentially be filling the roles of NPCs in a simulation designed for the fulfilment of /human/ values (through friendship and ponies), but they wouldn't be dead. Mostly.

Assuming there /are/ aliens out there, mind you. The fact that humanity was able to pull off something like CelestAI so early in our technological development put some pretty big constraints on the Fermi paradox. I imagine that intelligence must be pretty rare (to explain why we weren't overwhelmed by an alien optimizer AI long ago) or that optimizer AIs are generally far less expansion-oriented or long-term stable than CelestAI is.
