If someone could dig up the quote, I'll explain the moment it became a horror IMO:

The creator has an assistant, who doesn't want to go. CelestAI engineers him into a corner forcing him to emigrate, then engineers a miserable life around him until he begs to be reprogrammed to want to be there.

Free will is changed so as to create consent. That's fucked up!
