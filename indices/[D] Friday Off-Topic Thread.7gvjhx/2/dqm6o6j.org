What (if any) opinions do you have on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiden_and_married_names#English-speaking_world][changing]] of names upon marriage?\\
- Neither spouse changes his last name\\
- One spouse assumes the other's last name...\\
- - ...and abandons his original last name\\
- - ...and replaces his original middle name with his original last name\\
- Hyphenation:\\
- - One spouse's name goes first for both participants\\
- - Each spouse puts his name first and the other's name second\\
- - Each spouse puts his name second and the other's name first\\
- - What about the next generation?\\
- Both spouses amalgamate their last names

I'm inclined to think that the simplest option is the best option, since changing one's name incurs a risk of mistakes (e. g., on credit reports) and makes filling out forms a hassle ("Have you ever worked under a name different from your current name? If so, list all other names."). I was quite surprised when, some months ago, I [[https://i.imgur.com/4tBgZk8.png][saw]] that the wife of Prophet Yudkowsky (pbuh) had assumed his last name.

I recently had the pleasure of penning a short [[https://toakraka.nfshost.com/000018.html][piece]] of furry shota scat porn at the [[http://archive.is/64zi9#selection-9847.0-9847.90][behest]] of some people on 4chan's /trash/ board.

Having gotten halfway through of /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13496][A Game of Thrones]]/ (without having seen any of the television series), I have to say that, so far, it's seeming to be just another piece of [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Medieval_European_Fantasy][generic medieval fantasy]] rather than something particularly impressive. I definitely prefer /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144127][The Runelords]]/ (discussed [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ket47][here]] and [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3t143r][here]]).

(I really should get around to reading the first four books of [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/41322][the /Runelords/ series]] for a second time, and maybe even finally reading the second four books for the first time. On the other hand, I /still/ haven't bothered to finish cleaning up the hideous formatting of my [[http://www.baen.com/baenebooks][DRM-free]] copies of the last three books of [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40821][the /Belisarius/ series]], which have been sitting on my hard drive for /literally/ a year! And I haven't re-read /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ in something like a year, either, so I probably should either get started on a seventh reading or finally complete the thorough editing job that I've been too lazy to do for /several/ years. /So/ many choices...)

Scrolling through image-heavy threads in Discord is /significantly/ less tiresome if you use [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en][Stylus]] to shrink the thumbnails---e. g., to a height of 125 pixels, which is the size that 4chan uses: =img.image{max-height:125px;width:auto;}=

Still, as I've [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/62lpoc/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dfnkwc5][explained]] previously, I definitely prefer 4chan to Discord.
