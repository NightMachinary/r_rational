I got the list of subscriptions, but at 107 subscriptions was too long to post, [[https://pastebin.com/4EEj8QpJ][here's a pastebin.]] It's a hodgepodge and changes mostly when I see a subreddit pop up that I either like or have had enough of. My filters are even longer, because there's a lot of NSFW stuff on there, a lot of gaming subs that I don't play, and a huge number of political subreddits, which seem to multiply out of control.

The addition of [[/r/popular]] has helped a lot, since it cuts out a lot of the stuff I had manually cut.
