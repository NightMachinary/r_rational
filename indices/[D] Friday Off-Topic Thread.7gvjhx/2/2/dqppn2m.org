As someone with a hyphenated name, it's pretty annoying. My name never fits on forms with a limited amount of space, I have to tell them about the hyphenation every time or it will be put into systems wrong, and it's just a hassle to write the whole thing out. On top of that, I have a middle name as well, which makes matters even more complicated.
