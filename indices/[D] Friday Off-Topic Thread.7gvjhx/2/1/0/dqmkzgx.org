This. Exactly this. So wrong in every respect. /I have strong opinions about names./ If the "implicit loss of individuality" bothers you, you problem shouldn't be forming a family. If asymmetry bothers you, pick a new name (you mentioned that blending was reasonable). If you want to keep publishing under your original names, keep doing so. Names exist for convenience in distinguishing people in conversation and written text. Surnames exist to help identify familial units (with more or less success).

Breaking social conventions for the sake of breaking social conventions is a bad idea, and you should feel bad.
