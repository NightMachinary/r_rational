Of course you didn't. The benefit is never to the individual.

  We didn't do this.

According to what you've said, you did. And then, like everyone else who breaks social convention, you rationalized it.

As another example, you have been consistently using the term "partner". This is not a proper term, and using it violates social convention. It sounds like you're trying to force a PC convention in place of the existing norm. I find that offensive.
