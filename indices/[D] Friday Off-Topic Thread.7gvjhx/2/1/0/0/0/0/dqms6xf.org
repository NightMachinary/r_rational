  As another example, you have been consistently using the term "partner". This is not a proper term, and using it violates social convention. It sounds like you're trying to force a PC convention in place of the existing norm. I find that offensive.

Marriage is meaningless. Using the term =romantic partner= rather than =spouse= is an accurate reflection of the modern, enlightened* state of affairs. You shouldn't be offended by the truth.

*I use this word here without sarcasm, bee-tee-dubs, though you apparently would not do so.
