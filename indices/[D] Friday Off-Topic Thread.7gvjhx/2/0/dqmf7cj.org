A Game of Thrones was notable back in the day, for being Medieval Fantasy, with realistic people and realistic consequences. There aren't Big Damn Heroes, the protagonist doesn't give you plot armour, etc.

You've got to remember... that was twenty years ago! It's very much an Original Sin type series. There've been tons of derivative works since, and the context in which it arose is no longer accessible. So it seems generic now, but it wasn't back then.
