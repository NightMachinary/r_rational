  The Runelords is a pretty interesting example of a high fantasy series with a whole bunch of "what-if" in its magic system

From my recollection, that's somewhat backwards. The magic of endowments in /The Runelords/ exists precisely to justify classic fantasy tropes. A hero (or villain) really is as strong as ten or a thousand men. It's as though the author said, "I want to use these fantasy and heroic tropes, now how do I construct the magic system to justify them?"
