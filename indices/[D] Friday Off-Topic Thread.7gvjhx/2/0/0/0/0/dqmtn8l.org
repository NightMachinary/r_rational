  [I]t's odd to make the comparison to Redwall, since Redwall specifically has all the heroic tropes that AGoT eschews.

Well, I haven't read any of the books in years, so maybe I'm misremembering.

  I will admit to unfamiliarity with /Vicomte/. Would you recommend it?

Even I, a non-Francophone, can tell that Project Gutenberg's translation of /Vicomte/'s four volumes (an index is available [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2609][here]]) leaves a lot to be desired. Still, I found the book tolerable, though not nearly as fun as /The Three Musketeers/.
