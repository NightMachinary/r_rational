  You've got to remember... that was twenty years ago! It's very much an Original Sin type series. There've been tons of derivative works since, and the context in which it arose is no longer accessible. So it seems generic now, but it wasn't back then.

[[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Seinfeld_Is_Unfunny][This is a trope.]] With that said, however, when I call AGoT merely "generic", I'm thinking of books that are as old as, or older than, AGoT: /Redwall/, /Ivanhoe/, and /The Vicomte de Bragelonne/ stand out most prominently. I don't think I've read much medieval fantasy newer than AGoT. (/Vicomte/ includes some pretty major character death, you know!)
