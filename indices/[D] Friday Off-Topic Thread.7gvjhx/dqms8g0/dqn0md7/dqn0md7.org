Tips for players:

- Don't ask too many questions about irrelevant things, unless you think the DM has an answer prepared. My least favorite part of a session is when I get put on the spot and asked what a minor, one-off character's name is. (I have a long list printed out that I pull from at random for this, but it's still annoying and usually doesn't add much to the session.)
- Don't thumb your nose at the offered quests. Having to scrap a bunch of work because people have hidden goals that aren't aligned with what I've prepared is a bummer, and ends up with a mostly improvised session, which newer DMs usually aren't good at.
- Describe what you're attempting to do, rather than the results of your actions, especially in combat. It's not for you to say that you cut someone's head off, you say that you /try/ to do that and then the DM narrates the action. It does help if you add that flavor yourself though, because that relieves some of the mental load on the DM (especially since it can be hard to remember what everyone's attack/weapon is).
- Make sure at least one person is keeping track of loot, and at least one person is keeping track of names and quest notes. Offloading this onto the DM makes more work, and the DM already has a lot of work to do. (The DM knows the names, and the quest details, but having to ask the DM for a refresher every fifteen minutes is bad.) Make sure that at least one person is keeping the game moving forward, rather than stalled out on digressions, especially if you have a timid DM.
- It's your responsibility to make a character that can be part of the game. One of the common things that I've seen people do wrong is make their character a weird, anti-social loner, and then play them like a weird, antisocial loner, and then when that gums up the works, complain that they were "just playing their character". That's why you don't bring characters like that to the table in the first place.
