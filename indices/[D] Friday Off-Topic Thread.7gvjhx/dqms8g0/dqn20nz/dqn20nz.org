Pick a tone for the adventure and set expectations before you start. Something like: 'this arc is fast-paced swashbuckling', 'we're running an intrigue and mystery game', or 'this is an old-school puzzle-dungeon'.

This gives players a sense of what to expect. And it gives them queues on how they should respond to the world around them.

Give players clues about where they can dictate details of the world.

Before my current campaign, I asked my players to tell me about their home cities, and about the backstory-adventure where they met another member of the party.

During the game, I'll say things like, "that attack hits. Dragon's at 0 hit points. It's defeated. What happens?" And then I'll let the player fill in the epic details of how their character lands the final blow.

But, my biggest piece of DM advice is that you're playing to lose. Plan your loss so that characters seem huge and competent and heroic. Everything exists to serve that goal.

Is the Big Bad an evil wizard? Then he's not just evil. He's smugly, sneeringly evil. Have him gloat about his victory halfway through the session. Let him escape halfway through the arc. Let him grandstand in front of his army in the final battle.

Set things up right and, when the story reaches his climax, the characters will be narrating some truly epic death-scenes as they heroically crush their hated foe.
