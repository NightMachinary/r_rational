Some of you have run or played campaigns in DnD, right? I'll be playing my first ever game soon, and I'm looking for advice on how to ensure a first time DM has an excellent time first-time-DMing. Experienced DMs -- are there any things you wish your players did more or less of, especially when you first started DMing? Anything you wish they kept in mind? Common pitfalls? Once we really get rolling I'll make or commission some drawings or 3D prints of our characters, which I reckon will go over well, but I want more day-to-day tips (more details [[https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7eommp][here]], as well as some answers from posters on [[/r/DnD]]).
