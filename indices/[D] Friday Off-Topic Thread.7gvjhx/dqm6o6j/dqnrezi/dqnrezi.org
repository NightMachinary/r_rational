Hyphenating names is the worst possible solution, to my mind. It's a short-sighted have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too strategy with little to recommend it.

While there are a lot of good reasons for the bride to keep her own name, at least there's a societal framework for maiden-vs.-married names. The groom has all the same reasons to keep his, plus the lack of societal framework.

I don't think there's any real need to faff about with name changes, except for the trickiness surrounding name inheritance, or if one spouse doesn't like their name.

Unfortunately, neither I nor my SO particularly like our surnames. She's pretty intent on taking mine, which I guess is as good a solution as any.
