Well yes, it is a trope, but that doesn't make it untrue. But it's odd to make the comparison to Redwall, since Redwall specifically has all the heroic tropes that AGoT eschews. The setting is, so far as I can see, meant to be medieval fantasy specifically to play up the lack up the usual heroic tropes.

After all, the heroes always win in Redwall even if they suffer along the way. (Martin is my favourite, though I'm partial to the badgers in Salamandastron too). Everybody has tremendous virtue, it's really a different atmosphere entirely.

I will admit to unfamiliarity with /Vicomte/. Would you recommend it?

The Runelords is a pretty interesting example of a high fantasy series with a whole bunch of "what-if" in its magic system, but I'd almost call that an entirely separate genre. In fact I much preferred it over AGoT just for the lower level of grittiness.
