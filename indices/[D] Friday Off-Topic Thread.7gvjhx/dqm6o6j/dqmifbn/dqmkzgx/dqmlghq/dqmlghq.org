  If the "implicit loss of individuality" bothers you, you problem shouldn't be forming a family.
#+end_quote

What if we wish to retain some given level of individuality, but still form a family? Or are OK with some loss of individuality, but not total loss of individuality? We're certainly happy and willing to lose /some/ individuality (in our choice of dinner, pursuit of hobbies, career relocation options, etc.), but didn't see the benefits of a single surname to be worth the costs (I can easily imagine additional examples where this could be the case: maybe a person can only eat when their partner eats, or sit when their partner sits, or poop when their partner poops. All of these involve some subjugation of one partner to another, but at very little benefit, unless it's the couple's kink or something).

  If asymmetry bothers you, pick a new name (you mentioned that blending was reasonable).
#+end_quote

We obviously considered this, but liked our current surnames, and thought it too much trouble to change completely to a different surname. Swapping middle names satisfied our desire for symbolic/nominal unity while minimizing other costs.

  If you want to keep publishing under your original names, keep doing so.

Yes, as we've been doing.

  Surnames exist to help identify familial units (with more or less success).
#+end_quote

That's one of their functions, sure. I think their more important function -- in my life/social context -- is to distinguish individuals at a greater resolution than just the given name (e.g. at the community level). Surnames can also indicate occupation, geographic location, your mother's/father's given name, etc. but I'm not changing my surname to any of those, either. I can see the benefit of having a single family surname in the case of e.g. picking up children from daycare, or visiting in the hospital, and so on, but those seem easy enough to work around, especially in the era of record digitization. Where else would it be helpful to implicitly identify family units where you can't just say "yes, Bob Smith and John Doe are married with children, they constitute a nuclear family"? There /might/ also be some slight psychological effect on the child if they have a different surname than they parents, but I imagine no more than, say, their having a different given name (it being fairly common for a male lineage to all share the same given name).

  Breaking social conventions for the sake of breaking social conventions is a bad idea
#+end_quote

We didn't do this.

  and you should feel bad

ahaha I don't :]
