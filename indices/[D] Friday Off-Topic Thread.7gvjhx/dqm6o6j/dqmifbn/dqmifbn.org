  What (if any) opinions do you have on the changing of names upon marriage?

My partner and I decided to keep our surnames (we'd both published under them, and also liked them esthetically, and also didn't like the implicit subsumation/loss of individuality and asymmetry of keeping only one surname), and we found hyphenation clunky, but we still wanted some sort of symbolic name-y union, so we adopted each other's surnames as our middle names.

We haven't decided on the children-naming course of action yet, in part since that's far enough away, but we might either give each (of two anticipated) children one of our surnames, or give them both a blended surname (there are some combinations that look and sound pretty neat and natural imo). IDK how inconvenient this would be though.
