  You pretend to have the position that changing names upon marriage is irrational. Your actual position is that marriage is irrational.

I didn't say that marriage was /irrational/. I said that it was /meaningless/. (More specifically, I meant that I considered marriage to be devoid of social meaning---/i. e./, to no longer imply a strong and lasting social bond.) For example, if getting married would result in a reduction of the taxes owed by the participants, then that reduction is one rational reason in favor of marriage. Other such reasons for marriage obviously exist (e. g., immigration shenanigans).
