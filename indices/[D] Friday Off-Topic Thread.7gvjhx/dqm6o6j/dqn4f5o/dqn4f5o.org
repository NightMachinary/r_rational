Hearts of Iron IV is a WWII grand strategy game. Kaiserreich is a HOI4 alternate history mod set in a timeline where the Central Powers won the Great War. Fuhrerreich is /another/ mod inspired by the first, a "Double-Blind What-If" set in a timeline where the Entente won the Great War, but written as though it were being created in the Kaiserreich timeline.

I don't care much whether I or my spouse gets a name change (on the one hand, I'm already publishing under my last name, but on the other, it'd be nice to have a name that people know how to spell and pronounce), but I do have Opinions about how the name gets changed. I would prefer that the names be combined, but I am against hyphenation because (1) it gets unwieldy if there are more than two people involved and (2) it must either abandoned by the next generation or become unwieldy, and I am about sustainable practices. An amalgamation seems better.

I would also be in favor of each of us switching our names.

I've gotten the same impression of Game of Thrones, but that's just through osmosis, not personal experience.
