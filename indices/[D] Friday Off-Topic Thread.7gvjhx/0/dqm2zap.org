Weekly update on the [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QAh61C8gsL-5KbdIy5zx3IN6bv_E9UkHjwMLVQ7LHg/edit?usp=sharing][hopefully rational]] roguelike [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbyTOAlhRHk][immersive sim]] Pokemon Renegade, as well as the associated engine and tools.

Apologies for not updating last week; Thanksgiving took up a decent chunk of my time in preparation, and there wasn't much to update on besides.  This week is no better, and this is just a ping to ensure I don't let this project get too far off my radar.

At least this week I had an excuse that I'm actually excited about: I finally [[https://pcpartpicker.com/user/ketura/saved/DQ9FTW][pulled the trigger on a  new PC rig]].  I've been trying to upgrade for two years now or so, but it just wasn't in the cards until now.

Mostly-completed build taking up most of my desk: [[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/196309529850281984/386040258829221889/20171201_002510.jpg][image]]

But you can't really see how massive this shit is, so here's an xbox controller for scale: [[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/196309529850281984/386040643732111362/JPEG_20171201_002639.jpg][image]]

Incredibly appropriate wallpaper: [[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/196309529850281984/386075535446638592/JPEG_20171201_024557.jpg][image]]

So I'm likely to continue tinkering with this over the weekend and then drooling over frame rates and the like, but I'm /also/ curious to see what Visual Studio makes of 16 threads, so who knows, maybe I'll stumble my way to productivity once more.
