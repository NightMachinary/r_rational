Most ceramics have a lot of aluminum in them. Meerschaum is one of very few that do not. Aluminum does exist on Nirvana, but in tiny amounts. There are some deposits of other clays on Nirvana, but they are extremely rare. Ceramic engines are definitely doable if you have the materials, and I'm sure some exist in universities and perhaps the occasional major industrial facility, being used to compress air, or drive machines that require precision power output for things like nylon, rayon, or latex industries.

If the production costs of making ceramic engines is high now, with our current tech base, with Earth's resource base of plentiful aluminum-content clays, it will be several orders of magnitude higher on Nirvana.

Someone even mentioned elsewhere the possibility of attracting and crushing insects in vast quantities and extracting metal content from their remains in order to make metallic clay. That might be cheaper to implement than finding and collecting clay with aluminum in it, even if you consider dealing with the need to isolate the metals from the rest of the organic chemicals.
