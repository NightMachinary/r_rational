Iron oxide is the catalyst, and you don't need much (really a few 100g would be enough) if you have Mamilian life then the blood of a couple oxen would be enough for a huge amount of Ammonia. Well mabee not quite. But there is 1-5kg which could be used for 100 years of prosperous farming.

I just looked up the catalyst lifetime, it is about 5-10 years, and is still mostly available for recycling after this, with careful management, the loss rate should be manageable and easily offset by productivity elsewhere.
