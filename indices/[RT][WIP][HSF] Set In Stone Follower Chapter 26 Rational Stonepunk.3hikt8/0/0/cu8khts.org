Thanks!

Writing rationally is exhausting compared to writing non-rationally. I've written 20k+ words in a single day on non-rational original work.

That being said, things really bogged down for me after Albert appeared. The original intent was that Albert would never take a direct hand. Then I realized one day that a potato cannon would, in fact, be possible without metal. I also realized that moderately effective close-range rockets would be possible without metal. Various nasty explosive devices made of glass would also be highly effective in a world without metal armor. Even some crude chemical weapons could be formulated. That allowed me to create a rational insertion point for Albert, and dramatically changed the evolution of late Act II and Early Act III.

While there is no more or less physical fighting in this version as opposed to the original ideas, there is a lot more conflict.

I hope to finish things up for this book within three chapters. Perhaps two. Maybe four.
