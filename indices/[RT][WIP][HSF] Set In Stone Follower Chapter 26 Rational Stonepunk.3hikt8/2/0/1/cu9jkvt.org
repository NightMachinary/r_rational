I love this stuff! Steam engines are possible, yes, but they are a lot harder to maintain than animals for *most* applications. When pneumatic power or regulated power is required, steam engines are generally used to create compression if there is no flowing water source nearby.

Steam cranes are basically a very crude steam engine - a large cylinder with a block and tackle arrangement.
