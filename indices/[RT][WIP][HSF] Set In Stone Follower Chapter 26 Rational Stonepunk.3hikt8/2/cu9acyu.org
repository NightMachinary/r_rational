I was wondering how you get to there being no metals on the planet, as

a) metallurgical silicon would probably work for most things,

b) if you have any orthoclase ic minerals, then using charcoal you would be able to relitively easily produce aluminium. Any world without orthoclastic minerals seems unlikely. You also have brick houses, thus clay and aluminium.

C) even without clay and aluminium you still have Flint tools, these can make really high quality knives, and there are Aztec swords made out of them. Flint can be scary sharp.

D) there is obviously sodium in relitive abundance in this world. Which while difficult to use is a reasonable metal to use for some things if no other solution were available.
