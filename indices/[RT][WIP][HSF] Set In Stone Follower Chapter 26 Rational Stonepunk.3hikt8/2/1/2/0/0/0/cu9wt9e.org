I could imagine the production of small amounts of ammonia for use in fertilizer from the Haber process. I don't think that obtaining the hydrogen would be possible for large production. Hydrogen creates strong bonds. It can be separated from water using electrolysis, which requires electricity in significant quantities, or hydrocarbons, which do not exist naturally on Nirvana. It may be possible to generate a biodiesel hydrocarbon, but that process requires very high pressures and temperatures.

In an agrarian society where machines are mostly powered by animals, there is an easy local source of ammonia - animal urine.

Rotating crops with clover and alfalfa is also very viable for nitrogen fixing in the soil.

A large reason why ancient agriculture was inefficient was because they didn't understand soil management.

But in the end, Nirvana has proportionately huge oceans and small land masses as compared to Earth. Sodium Nitrate deposits on Earth are not created by a biological process. There will be significant deposits of this natural fertilizer on Nirvana.

In the end, I grant you that Nirvanans will have a far better agricultural system than preindustrial societies on Earth, but Earth was deep into the industrial age before the farm population began to shrink significantly.
