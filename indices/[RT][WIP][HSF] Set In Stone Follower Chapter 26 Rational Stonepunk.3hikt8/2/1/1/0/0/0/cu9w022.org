Sure, the Nirvanans could create carbon fiber wires before Albert took technology away. But if we can't produce it cheaply now, in any appreciable quantity, the Nirvanans aren't going to have any hope of doing so in an agrarian society.

If the devolution of technology had been gradual, maybe a technique might have been devised, but it wasn't. Albert took away all computing and industrial technology in the space of a single day.

If you want to imagine new industries on Nirvana, you have to imagine them from the ground up, not from prior technology down.
