Hrm, lampblack, coke, and sugar syrup at high temperature and pressure can make a fairly pure carbon electrode. Interesting.

Graphite is naturally formed by sedimentary action on Earth. It's a biological by-product. That process will never have existed on Nirvana.

Graphite can be reduced from silicon carbide, and silicon carbide can be made from carbon and molten silicon, which we discussed earlier as barely possible with organic combustible materials.

So we can get the graphite, but I do not know how it would be shaped into wires. My Google-Fu is failing me on this right now. Can you link to a process for changing graphite dust into wire?
