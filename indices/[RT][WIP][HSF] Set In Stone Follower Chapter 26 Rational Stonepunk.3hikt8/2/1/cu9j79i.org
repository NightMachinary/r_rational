Good Stuff here!

A) It is barely theoretically possible to get metallurgical grade silicon without having electrical power and pure carbon electrodes for an electrical arc furnace in large quantities. Most organic fuels will not burn at temperatures above around 1950C under perfect conditions. Metallurgical grade silicon requires 1900C.

B) Aluminum-bearing stone and clay exists, but it is rare. The bricks used in home construction are either made of glass, concrete, or concrete reinforced with blown glass.

C) Flint is, indeed, a material used in our world for a lot of things. It's also a result of biological processes for the most part. Processes that Nirvana never had. I won't say that it doesn't exist on Nirvana from non-biological geological processes, but if it does, it's going to be highly rare. Between tempered glass blades and stone tools, most of the uses for flint are covered.

D) Sodium definitely has it's uses, and can be synthesized in a pure metallic form in several ways. However, metallic sodium is also reactive with water, so most of those uses are going to be restricted to very protected environments.

The bigger problem that one runs into when considering the more esoteric metals requiring a lot of resources and/or high purity is labor. An agricultural society devotes practically all of it's labor to food production, storage, and distribution. On Nirvana, farmers are a lot more productive than they were on Earth before industry, but a lot less than they were before internal combustion. This allows some of the workforce to be devoted to industry, arts, and education. Industry tends to be focused around glass and stone, but there are several smaller industries as well. Gunpowder and nitrocellulose production, Nylon production, Latex production. Steam and pneumatic power does exist, but it is low pressure, and high maintenance.

Innovation is possible, and with sufficient resources, some interesting results can be had, but how many people can you afford to remove from the agricultural labor pool when the most efficient practices have already been determined by 4500 years of educated farmers?
