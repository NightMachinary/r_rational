Rayon is doable, yes. Pyrolysis of Rayon is also doable, but will the resulting material be suitable for creating long wires that are flexible and capable of carrying current? It looks as if Mitsubishi manufactures some carbon fiber products by pyrolysis of Rayon, but are the processes they use repeatable in a primitive tech base, with no computers and no metals? Possibly.

I will grant that it may be possible to create a carbon fiber wound motor, but how much labor will be required? If it takes a hundred thousand man hours of labor to wind a single small motor, you have to feed those people, and the people doing the labor are coming out of the rest of the labor pool. Nirvana does not have slave labor, which is how a lot of early industrial processes were made affordable on Earth.

Even in situations where things are possible, they are not always plausible, except as proofs of concept.
