For a stone-punk electrical generator, we use a fibreglass spun rotor wih carbon fibre-windings for the field coil, there is a carbon slip ring into the binding. The rotor spins on ceramic ball bearings.

Rayon, polyethyline, PVC, Polypropylene, teflon, HFCs, etc, are all producible with relative ease.

High temperature materials are not readily available. However there is no reason why completely plastic automobiles couldn't be constructed (proofs of concepts existed in the 80s). The main thing lacking is computers and electronics, however none of that is really required to have a highly productive society, food scarcity really should not be a thing.

Love the story btw. Albert is meddling quite significanly though.
