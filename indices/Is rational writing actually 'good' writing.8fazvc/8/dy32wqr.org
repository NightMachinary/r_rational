What about in terms of technical proficiency and diction and description and such? I think most of the stories I've read from this sub are perfectly readable compared to e.g. the overwhelming majority of fanfiction, but whenever I've tried recommending them to friends a common response is that they're too long-winded or stilted or amateur or in dire need of an editor or utterly unable to kill their darlings or whatever. My partner, for example, likened some of the fics to novels and short-stories she wrote in her early-mid teens, but maybe that's not much of a criticism insofar as a lot of the stories posted here are indeed written by teenagers? She's gotten through some of the stories I've shoved on her through extensive skimming, in the sense of skipping overly rambling paragraphs and pages, which might also be why I'm not as bothered by technical failings (I also tend to skim tons and usually read while multitasking, too). And I've read tons of ugrad essays that are much poorer written than many of the pubs here, so maybe my standards are lower. Where do works from this sub fall wrt all y'all's writing quality standards?
