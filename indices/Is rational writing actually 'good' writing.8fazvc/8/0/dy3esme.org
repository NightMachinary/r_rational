The fiction here tends to be what you can expect from a group of amateur storytellers who most likely get most of their writing experience from undergrad essays. It's fine, the writing works and gets across the information it needs to get across. All the grammar bits and pieces are in the right places. But they tend to lack a distinct voice or sense that the language itself is being used to tell a story.

Also word count bloat is a major issue, but that's more to do with online platforms that enable the worst most long winded instincts in writing because there's no accepted standard or enforced limit to entries in a WordPress blog like there is with a book.
