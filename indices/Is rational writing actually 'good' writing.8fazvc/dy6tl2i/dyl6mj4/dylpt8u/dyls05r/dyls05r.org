I'd say it's also about values and goals. HPMOR makes a big deal out of Rational!Harry being fixated on defeating death, whereas other wizards like Dumbledore just sort of roll with it. His distinctive feature is that being a rationalist makes him think about magic in a different way also because he has different things he wants to accomplish (which in fact most people around him consider Dark).

Anyway even some classics could be made more fun with a rational re-writing. I really think what rational fics are in that sense is a form of parody/deconstruction: you lampshade the tropes by showing how they would disappear by simply injecting some common sense into the setting. I'm thinking of for example "The Betrothed", a seminal Italian historical novel that's centred around the adventures of two betrothed young people who are separated by the whim of an arrogant noble who wants to seduce the girl. Being a plot-driven work, it's possible that it could be funny to highlight when that plot is furthered by unjustified stupidity (though thinking about it, I can't think of any specific example in there - I think its plot is relatively tight, if taking into account the flaws of the specific characters, like the priest being a coward, the boy kind of a simpleton, etc.). But character driven stuff is different, because usually the problem of stupidity-advanced plot doesn't really present itself at all.
