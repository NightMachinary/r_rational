I feel like such a joke kinda misses the point of rationality, though. It's not about setting your values or goals, it's about effective ways to reach existing goals.

I can't really speak with much authority on that sort of thing, though, because I generally find classics and really lit fic in general to be pretty boring, so I wouldn't know how much rational elements would change/improve/hurt their quality.
