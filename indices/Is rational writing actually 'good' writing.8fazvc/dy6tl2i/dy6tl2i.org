I guess I'm gonna play devil's advocate here, at least to some extent.

Speaking on rational fiction rather than rational/ist/, I do think that it could be more or less equivalent to "good".

Consider this absurdly dumb hypothetical. We have two different stories. In almost every way, they are equivalent - they've got as much "cool stuff" as one another, they're equally well written, with equally interesting plots. But one has characters acting consistently according to their values in a world with well-understood and inviolable rules, and the other has characters that behave unpredictably in a world where the rules are violated in each chapter, but not in a self-aware kinda way.

Obviously there are no two such works, and the idea of two stories having "equivalent" whatever is dumb and silly because you can't quantify these things in a meaningful way. But I think the point still stands, that the more a work skews towards the rational, the better it becomes.

I think the main counterpoint is that it's possible that in certain works, the rational aspect might come with a trade-off in some other aspect of the fiction, but that doesn't mean that the rational stuff becomes bad, it just can't be used in those situations.

In other words, the elements that make a piece of fiction rational are also aspects that improve its quality. But they don't ensure that it lives up to some standard of "good".

-edit-

So I was thinking, take the example of Zombie Knight. It's really great, I love it, and I think Frost has done a great job on it overall. But it doesn't feel like the world is terribly consistent. As a reader, it feels a bit like at certain points the author was like "oh man, it'd be cool if /this/ was part of how the world works," and so it became that way.

But if it was just a little bit more rational, it would go from like a 98% of perfect to a 99%. And that's what I'm talking about.
