All ancient literature at some level has scholarship attached to it, if only for its historical value. When documents are scarce, every bit matters! But my point about the Bible was that, while its historical value is undeniable, its literary value is more questionable. Of course some people will enjoy it on its own, but in our world it's really hard to separate the literary interest from the cultural and religious one. People sweat to interpret it because first and foremost they /assume/ it has some hidden truths and it's actually some incredibly complex metaphor for multiple layers of meaning, but that's because of its significance. No one thinks the same of the Code of Hammurabi, yet Leviticus is pretty much as straightforward. Of course there are sections of the Bible that are more literary, even poetic, like the Psalms, so it varies from book to book really.

As for making sense, I don't think it makes any less sense than other mythologies, including the Greek one. There's contradictions and incoherences but those are everywhere in ancient literature - to cut them some slack, these were works often stratified across centuries, through oral tradition, written by different authors, and so on. If you took Greek myths as a guide for life they would be as incoherent and inconsistent as the Bible, but no one does that, so it's not an issue. The difference of course is though that Greek myths are simply more /fun/ and interesting because they involve a lot of different flawed gods and heroes all busy doing very human things and being awesome rather than a single lord of all who spouts judgement on his subjects from high in heaven.
