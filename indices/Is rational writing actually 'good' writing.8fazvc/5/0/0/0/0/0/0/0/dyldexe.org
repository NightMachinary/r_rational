From what I know, the Iliad for example is very inconsistent in its timeline. Since it was pieced together by oral tradition, it uses formulaic expressions and even entire sections. I remember reading that there's one night during which the heroes have /three/ extremely similar banquets for no discernible reason. Sometimes the same people get killed twice. Basically, it's a collection of big events tied together by filler material that the poets would use to just bridge the gaps - consider they were reciting this stuff by memory, so it was a useful tool to simply take time while remembering the next important bit.

In general, a lot of myths have different versions depending on whose work you read. I'm saying across the entire corpus of Greek literature, of course, not just Homer, which complicates matters, as that involves different peoples and cultures across a span of centuries. But then, that's basically how the Bible was born too.
