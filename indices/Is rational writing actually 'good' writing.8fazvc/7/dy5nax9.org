I'm seeing some pretty good analysis in this thread that I won't repeat, so let me just add something that I don't think has been stressed enough: Writing good rationalist fiction is /really hard/. It's very definitely a case of you deliberately making things more difficult for yourself, though the end result can definitely be worth it.

You can see a story as an optimization problem: Given the story's concepts, how do you maximize for awesome? In the case of regular fiction, you can simply maximise for excitement and drama and other aspects of good writing. When writing rationalist fiction, you still have to do that AND ALSO have it make perfect sense.

For example, to create drama you'll want your MC to interact with the villain, but then he's not allowed to capture the bad guy in act one, while the bad guy also has to fail to kill your main character. In regular fiction this can be handwaved, but if your MC is rational and smart, it's really hard to come up with convincing contrivances to let this happen. Even more difficult is putting your characters in dangerous (and therefore interesting) situations in the first place. With rationalist fiction, you have to ask yourself what you would do in your character's shoes, and the answer is almost never 'put myself in mortal danger'. And yet, that's precisely what has to happen for the story.

Remember the Wave Arc in NTBS, if you read it. Zabuza KNOWS that he is weaker than Kakashi, and yet still has to end up fighting him. Kakashi KNOWS that fighting would put his students in needless danger, and yet it still has to happen. So I had to set everything up so that the only logical outcome was for multiple rational characters to put themselves in danger, fighting evenly matched battles (which rational ninjas would never want to do!) not just once but multiple times in a row! Plotting all of that out took ten times more time than actually writing it.

You have the exact same problem when it comes to worldbuilding. Regular authors get to optimize for fun worldbuilding. But in a rationalist story, the MC has to ask all of the questions that you as the reader would also ask, and that can be really repetitive and dull. For example, The Waves Arisen is amazingly written and has great plot progression, EXCEPT for the parts where Naruto stops and does math for several pages. I would classify that as Objectively Awesome(tm), though EY might disagree.

In summary: Yes, rationalist writing is objectively /better/ in the sense that it prevents suspension of disbelief from being broken for certain readers, but you also still have to follow all of the usual rules of writing at the same time, and that makes it objectively harder to write as well.
