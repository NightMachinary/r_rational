Huh. But in making every ninja character rational, aren't you stripping away their personalities and just making them all the same character at core, as in they'd all make the same rational choice when confronted with a problem? Won't this make the characters thus feel unoriginal and unvaried? Furthermore, if you have to force the characters to do things for the sake of plot, aren't you making it plot driven as opposed to character driven?
