Nah. There are many different types of rational characters, each with their own qualities. For example, Naruto has the rationalist quality of looking past the popular wisdom (Or as Feynman would say it, [[http://creativethinking.net/the-most-important-lesson-nobel-laureate-physicist-richard-feynman-learned-about-creativity/#sthash.TjBw90QW.dpbs][Disregard!]], though this has the disadvantage of making him socially clumsy. Sakura has the book smarts and conscientiousness, Sasuke has the iron will and sheer /need to win/.. etc.

Also, it's not that I'm forcing characters to do things for the sake of plot (that would be cheating, and bad writing), it's that I'm changing the given situation until the characters' realistic reaction to that situation would result in a good story.
