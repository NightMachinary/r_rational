Some characters written to fit rationalist fiction aren't good characters.

Some feel always like mouthpieces for the author. I think it is worse when it is only sometimes. Because in those cases they act against there own (fanfic) characterization. And some explanations of concepts could be done much better without pandering too rationalists/lesswrong community. (Like explaining tabooing in pokemon the origin of species for absol's bad luck, compared too just saying: Hey, we use different definitions for luck, that's really confusing for me, could we/you describe what we/you mean instead of the word luck for this discussion? )

Also, humans are generally portrayed too rational. Not even rationalists are that rational.

That said, I absolutely hate it, when the travel time is obviously unrealistic. (Like in Stranger Thing or Star Wars, while I liked the spaceship chase idea, the execution was horrible) And the original scenes should have been rewritten to not have those (perceived) plot holes. That would make it more enjoyable for me. Subtle irrational stuff doesn't bother me that much, even if I notice. (Like people not calling the cops. Or truckers/car drivers not breaking if someone runs on the car roof.)

So back to your question: rewriting irrational stories into rationalist ones removes the conflict. For example, Star Wars spaceship chase would be conflict less. (Telling the plan would make the whole plot change. Having rational travel options would make the casino visit impossible.) The rewritten story (plot & character) changes that much, that it can't be compared. If that is not the case, the story was already rational(ist) and got only rewritten. And of course, stories can still be enjoyable (=good), even if they are irrational (Like stranger thing's travel problem)
