Rationalist writing is a genre. Or a parasitic genre attached to other genres. There can be bad writing and good writing.

Non-rationalist writing constitutes almost the entire literature canon. It is not automatically bad, though is some cases, in particular the egregious ones, it is responsible for or contributory to its being bad. See: idiot plot.
