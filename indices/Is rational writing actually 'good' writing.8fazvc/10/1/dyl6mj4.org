IMHO though that just applies to certain types of novels - sci-fi and fantasy especially. And that's fair, those genres usually benefit from being rational, but mostly because they're written to be very plot-driven anyway, by authors whose prose isn't that great, so they can only rely on the story to keep you thrilled and on the edge. But a good character-driven novel for example would suffer from being rationalised too much - the world is probably just ours, and doesn't matter much, and the characters' flaws and irrationalities /are the whole point/. Wasn't there a joke about rational Moby Dick in HPMOR? Achab decides it's not worth it pursuing revenge against a whale and lets the whole thing go, end of story.
