  I doubt many would bother with it.

Many people don't but then there are bible scholars and bible study and multiple revisions, retranslations and reinterpretations of the book and whole separate religions have been founded on those different versions (from what I understand). I'd figure if people cared about the book's symbolic value more than its contents, the above would be less likely to happen and would be less pronounced because everyone would just agree that the bible is great without bothering to read it.

Though you're right in that it's hard to say whether the above exist because those things would exist for any book that's equally fervently promoted or the above happens separately from the promotion. It's hard to say how much the promotion encourages the study when they're so intertwined.

  Even from antiquity, Greek mythological texts, like Homer's poems, trump it in every respect.

I think a good story pretty much transcends time since peoples' fundamental values -- bravery, adventure, etc. -- didn't change too much even over thousands of years. But yeah of course the greek texts trump the bible -- they make sense. I was talking about books that manage to stay popular /despite/ not making much sense and/or contradicting themselves.
