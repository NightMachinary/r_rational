I think it is possible for a story that is written as a rational fiction can still be afflicted with poor writing, though it seems to be rarer than with other forms of literature.

Yes, stories that don't have strong rational elements can still be good. This is particularly true if you mean good to be enjoyable. Example: LotR.
