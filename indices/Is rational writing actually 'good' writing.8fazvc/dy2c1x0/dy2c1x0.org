As far as I remember, there are four major components to a story: the theme, the setting, the plot, and the characters. There's also the technical component of how well the language is used, but unless you're Tolkien or Shakespeare, that doesn't play much into the overall quality (assuming you have a decent editor).

Rational writing is orthogonal to both theme and setting. You can write a story where the characters act completely irrationally, which speaks meaningfully to some point your are trying to make, or you can write a story where everyone's actions make perfect sense, but there's no larger point to be made at all. Similarly, you can have characters behaving rationally in an irrational world, or vice versa.

What rationality /can/ affect is your characters and your plot. For the most part, if your already have a relatable character, having that character act for rational reasons will make the story better, and, if you have a compelling plot, having the plot proceed logically from the consequences of the characters' actions will also make the story better. However, a rational character will not always be a relatable one, and a rational plot will not always be an interesting one, and those play more directly into the overall quality of the work than rationality does.

So, given a good story being written by a good author, yes, writing the plot and the characters to be more rational will probably make it even better. However, it probably won't do much of anything at all for a story that was never going to be any good in the first place.
