I feel like Brust's /Cool Stuff Theory/ could use an amendment:

Good writing can convince people to agree with the author's sense of cool. So you don't like "full-plate armor and great big honking greatswords"? And then someone whose sense of cool is very like your own comes along and writes about them, and now they're cool.

An author doesn't just write cool stuff for an audience who already thinks it's cool, he needs to convince the audience that it really is cool.
