I think that the whole point of Escapement post was to point out that people have different tastes and what good means is subjective.

What you might think is a 'good' character might differ from what someone else thinks is a 'good' character. So if someone added your version of a 'good' character to a story that makes the story worse for someone else.

That is using 'good' as meaning enjoyable though. If you think about good as meaning beneficial for society at large then I would argue that making universes rational improves critical thinking and minimizes bullshit tollerance, and thus makes society better.
