This is an excellent analysis, and Brust's Cool Stuff Theory ought to be the starting point of every non-pretentious analysis of enjoyable literature.

To it I only want to add one major point that, it seems to me, has been responsible for a lot of confusion: Specific elements of Cool Stuff are often diametrically opposed to specific elements of almost-universally-almost-objectively Awful Writing.

For example, the fact that Niven, Pournelle, and Dan Alderson worked out pages and pages of math for the Alderson Drive in "The Mote in God's Eye" is Cool Stuff. Under Brust's theory, that doesn't say you have to find it cool; it says that there's a kind of person who finds it cool and will be glad that "The Mote in God's Eye" contains this cool stuff.

There's also a kind of Awful Writing in which the FTL drive is established to behave a certain way, and then treated /inconsistently/ in order to drive a plot event. That is, it's not just that that the author has an FTL drive in the background which neither they or you are supposed to be thinking about very hard. It's that the FTL drive is established to not be able to do X, and then, without any foreshadowing, at a key point of the story the FTL drive does X; or very nearly as bad, the climax of the story is resolved by the FTL drive doing X without any active foreshadowing that it could. At this extreme we have something close to objectively Awful Writing, though many of us will find it to be Bleah Stuff to different degrees; if you think the Alderson Drive is Cool you are likely to find this particular bit of Awful Writing to be especially Bleah.

Some of the work that goes into hardening the Alderson Drive is a kind of mental labor that draws on more universal skills and methods of good writing. "Consistency" is an underlying cognitive skill of keeping track of things; and a method of making events and people more legible to the reader, thereby heightening their impact; and a method of heightening tension, through a visible guarantee that there will not be a cheating way out of dilemmas.

This doesn't mean an Alderson Drive with pages of math is mandatory Good Writing as opposed to optional Cool Stuff, or that its absence is Bad Writing. There can be good works of science fiction that aren't focused on the particular Cool Stuff of an FTL drive that's hardened to the point where the author is calculating equations.

What we do have is that well-executed hard SF is incompatible with a certain extreme of Awful Writing; and that hard SF draws on the particular exercise of a skill of good writing that has more general applications.

To disclaim and be clear, there are no simple properties of a text that are absolutely and universally Awful Writing. Not even bad spelling; the end paragraphs in /Flowers for Algernon/ involve some misspellings. Somebody who thinks a certain sort of narrative realism is Cool Stuff might enjoy a narrative with many more misspellings. I probably wouldn't read it because that's not my Cool Stuff and I consider misspellings pretty Bleah Stuff, but it could still be done artfully. With that said, there is still a lot of Awful Writing out there which is not the result of deliberately executed skill; although different people will still find it Bleah to different degrees.

It's in this light that we should consider the kind of Cool Stuff that goes into rational(ist) fiction. Lots of it is opposed to an extreme of Awful Writing; lots of it draws on a particular application of a skill that can be used more generally in good writing. This doesn't change its status from Cool Stuff to almost-always-mandatory Good Writing.

For example, one kind of Cool Stuff I like is bad guys who have their own coherent psychologically realistic outlook in which they are the good guys, without that actually placing them on the same moral level or reducing the story to gray-vs-grey. Executing this draws on a universal writing skill of perspective-taking and being able to imagine what the world looks like in the eyes of a person who isn't exactly like you. It's opposed to an opposite extreme of awful writing in which villains have no consistent psychology, or will act against their previously-established goals in order to drive the plot. But this is not a particular kind of Cool Stuff that appears in Tolkien, and that's fine.

I'm not going to rewrite [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][everything I've already said about intelligent characters]] here, but the same theory applies. It's a kind of Cool Stuff; executing it requires more universal skills specifically applied; it's opposed to some extremes of Awful Writing; and none of that makes it merely universally Good Writing.
