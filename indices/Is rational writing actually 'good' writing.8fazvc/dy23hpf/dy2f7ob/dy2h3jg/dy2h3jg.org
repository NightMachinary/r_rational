Sure, you could have medics on standby with potions ready, and a witches and wizard for every player with wands in hand standing around the field ready to cast lifesaving charms, shifting off in rotations every hour if the game goes long to keep themselves fresh. They could also have portkeys set up to go directly to St. Mungo's equivalent of surgery, and they could even be fast enough or magical enough to fix someone who got hit by a flying cannonball in the wrong place and broke their spine or whatever. Describing all these things that weren't mentioned at all in the novels but would make the sport make much more sense is basically writing the 2000 word essay mentioned in my comment, that would make Quidditch make more sense but would destroy the flow of the novel and it's pacing, and would hurt the attempt at tension in the game by diminishing the apparant possibility of serious injury or death.
