  The casino visit wasn't bad, it just didn't make sense at all with the plot

I'd also say it was boring. Besides that, the political commentary was really in-your-face and cringey. "Oh, look, these rich dudes sell weapons and are evil!" - yeah, that's really an in-depth analysis of the problems of the military-industrial complex. "At least we hurt them" - dudes, you, like, broke a couple of shop windows. Tomorrow slaves will have fixed all of it, cursing you for the overtime they'll have to do because of it, and most customers won't have even realised. Only edgy teens who think smashing random stuff is "going against the system" would speak like that. It's so shallow it'd have been much better if they said nothing.
