Gurren lagann is (arguably) the most irrational story ever, and despite my love of rationality, I fucking love it. To be fair it's basically parody-ing the anime mecha genre, but it's just so fun and epic.

I say arguably because it never really breaks the rules of its own universe, though the rules are nearly non-existent to begin with.
