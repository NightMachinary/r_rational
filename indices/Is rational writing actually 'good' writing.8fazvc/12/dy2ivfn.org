Please keep in mind that rational fiction is a much broader category than rational/ist/ fiction, as mentioned in the sidebar. I think that the rational fiction approach generally improves a work, barring a work that's trying to be, eg, surrealist.

Rationalist fiction is a pretty narrow category and an author doesn't have to write it unless that's their personal taste.
