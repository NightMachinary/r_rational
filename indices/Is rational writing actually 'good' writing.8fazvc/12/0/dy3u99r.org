This is actually a really good set of definitions.

Making something rational seeks to either adjust the world in question to actually live up to its standards and rules... or defines those rules further so that they permit said work to exist in the first place. It usually results in a better, more cohesive work in general because it closes the glaringly obvious logical loopholes and explains how things /work/.

"Rationalist" fiction can do the above, but ideally carries the world and its rules to some extreme whilst also trying to "teach" rationalist beliefs and techniques of thought. When the latter become more important than the world or the story, things tend to go downhill.
