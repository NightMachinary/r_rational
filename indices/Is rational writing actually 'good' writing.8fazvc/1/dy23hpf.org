I feel like your whole comment is hopelessly confused by my standards - we are really far apart in terms of philosophy of art.

I think it'd be helpful to consider an example to clarify matters. That said - let's look at Harry Potter and Quidditch.

I feel like Quidditch workswell on the Doylist level, especially for the first few HP books where it is part of an explicitly children's novel series - Quidditch is intended to be a parody of the worst of sports, especially e.g. Cricket with it's strange rules and scoring, written by someone who is not really into sports for an audience that by and large was also not into sports, and was written to allow Harry to play a central role in a team's victory in an easily explained way that would nevertheless be dramatic and allow for direct contrast and conflict with his foil Draco, and also emphasize the magic in the setting, and finally add elements of danger to raise tension. For all these narrative purposes the rules of the game clearly work well and are extremely good. It's one of the most clearly 'designed for the sake of the plot' sports of all time, but for the purposes of that design (at the storycrafting level) it accomplishes most every goal Rowling could have had for it nearly flawless - the only real problem is suffering from plot holes if you think about it a lot more than 99% of the children that were the target audience for the books when it was initially created.

On a Watsonian level, it makes very little sense at all when examined closely by an adult reader. The fact that the match could last for several days or several minutes is very spectator unfriendly, just for a start - games where things could go for between twenty minutes to an hour+ are already hell for scheduling, and Quidditch increases that variance by a couple orders of magnitude. A team could easily be stuck in a lame-duck situation where they are 'playing the game' but are several hundred points behind and are stuck playing the game out anyways. There are things explicitly trying to concuss / kill / injure etc. players onfield, and it's played up in the sky with no net or other safety device!

So this story element is very irrational, yet if we removed it from the story wholesale the story as a whole would have a lot of problems, and trying to modify it to become more rational is ... difficult. You could come up with something justifying the existence of quidditch, and put into Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone a 2000 word treatise explaining and justifying every seeming inconsistency in quidditch - but taking up a huge amount of wordcount for this sort of thing, while 'rational', would also bore the target audience of children and wreck the fast pacing that was a great strength of the first few Harry Potter books. Would that make them 'better'?

--------------

Of course, this whole discussion glosses over the elephant in the room: what exactly is your theory of aesthetics, such that you think that 'better' (or for that matter 'worse') is a clear and clean primitive description of a work without reference to a specific purpose or audience?

I personally think a subjective theory of aesthetics makes the most sense to me. It's colourfully described as follows by writer Steven Brust:

#+begin_quote
  “The Cool Stuff Theory of Literature is as follows: All literature consists of whatever the writer thinks is cool. The reader will like the book to the degree that he agrees with the writer about what's cool. And that works all the way from the external trappings to the level of metaphor, subtext, and the way one uses words. In other words, I happen not to think that full-plate armor and great big honking greatswords are cool. I don't like 'em. I like cloaks and rapiers. So I write stories with a lot of cloaks and rapiers in 'em, 'cause that's cool. Guys who like military hardware, who think advanced military hardware is cool, are not gonna jump all over my books, because they have other ideas about what's cool.

  The novel should be understood as a structure built to accommodate the greatest possible amount of cool stuff.”

The loose collection of tropes and tendencies we call rational fiction are, to use Brust's phrasing, very cool in my opinion. But other people have differing ideas about what's cool, and are happier with a book that has lots of whatever they find cool instead. Rational books are sometimes thought to be cool by a lot of other people - there has been some mainstream success with e.g. The Martian and Ted Chiang's works making it as far as full movies - but by and large a lot of the works that maximize their 'rational' qualities do so at the expense of other qualities that other people might find cooler. Rewriting something to be rationalist often makes it cooler in the opinion of the sorts of people who think rationalist stuff is cool (i.e. me and probably you if you're reading this) - but it can sometimes loses the virtues that make the original work cool in the eyes of other people.

A story can have be completely irrational and still be very cool, by my standards of coolness. There's lots of elements of a story that I can like besides 'does the plot make a ton of sense when examined carefully and rigourously' - things like colourful and compelling characters, a unique and interesting setting, or good use of language and writing ability can each individually be enough to make a work stand out as very cool even if the plot and 'rationality' elements are garbage. But that's just in my opinion of what's cool, and other people have different opinions of what's cool.

edit: thanks for the gold!
