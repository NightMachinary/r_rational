  universally good in the same way as the addition of good characters, pacing and setting

You're kind of letting the word "good" do the work for you in making those things axiomatic improvements. Of course "good characters" are "good" - you just stipulated that they're "good". But what actually constitutes /good/ characters, pacing and setting are relative to the work in which they're found.

Take any inarguably 'good' character and transplant them into a different work in a different genre, or with different themes and goals, and all their good-character-ness won't cover for the fact that they're fundamentally out of place; unless the author has specifically and deliberately chosen a pairing that /does/ work.

Take a fast pace or a meandering pace or a varying pace; either can be 'good' if it fits the author's intent for what they're trying to write. Take a long and careful exploration of the human psyche and try to push it along at action-blockbuster pace and you'll ruin it... and vice versa.

Similarly, if we can think of "rationality" coming in degrees, the strictness and extent of the rationality in a story is then a variable that ought to be set according to what best fits with what the author is trying to accomplish. Not every story is /trying/ to be a scrupulously realistic description of events as they would actually unfold, or to have its characters rigorously follow some internal logic.

I suspect there's almost nothing that would (truly universally, in every possible case) /always/ improve a work of fiction. That almost everything that might be identified as 'bad' could conceivably be used to deliberate effect to accomplish some worthy goal.
