Various tools that rational writing relies upon can be considered good modern writing techniques (like consistent worldbuilding, intelligent characters, etc.), not all of it is. For instance, the sidebar says "characters solve problems," but a story can be good [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/899492.The_Tell_Tale_Heart][without characters who solve problems]], let alone in an intelligent manner.

And of course, there are works that tend toward the absurdist end of the spectrum, where rationalism would upend everything they're about.
