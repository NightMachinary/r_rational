Well, what I was trying to ask was, is rationalism as indispensable like pacing and characters, where if you add rationality to a story, it automatically improves, and good stories that aren't rationalist suffer because of it. Tldr: is the addition of rationality universally good in the same way as the addition of good characters, pacing and setting?
