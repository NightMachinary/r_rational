  Would you say that rationalist writing directly translates to good story telling?
#+end_quote

No. I would say it's an artistic current, so to speak. It follows certain rules and objectives; it avoids certain tropes, but has tropes of its own. It's certainly more satisfying (when well done) if you're looking for a story that works like a puzzle, more brain teaser than emotional journey. I think it's a style that fits me to /write/, for example, but I would be bored writing only in it too.

  By rewriting something to be rationalist, do we make it a 'better' story?
#+end_quote

Depends on the story. Some stories set themselves to be the kind of story that requires consistent logic and worldbuilding - and then fail. In that case, yes, they probably will be made better. I would argue "Luminosity" is easily better than "Twilight", because it makes full use of its premise instead of meandering about with it. However, some stories do not care for logic, nor focus on it, and make it clear from the very beginning. A typical example would be "Alice in Wonderland", which couldn't be rational-ised without becoming awful (in fact, Tim Burton's movie was sort of an attempt at doing this, introducing some sort of consistent logic into Alice's lack of it, and it was terrible). Other stories just aren't concerned with that very much, and focus more on themes and metaphors which would be lost if they treated their subject matter too rigorously.

  And lastly, can a story be irrational, but still good?
#+end_quote

Of course. Ranging from explicitly irrational/surreal stories, to stories that just have other priorities. The important thing is that an author knows what story they're going to write, and manages the reader's expectations consequently. What's frustrating is reading the sort of story that usually relies on logic and rationality to work, and then seeing that forgotten out of laziness or incompetence. For example, reading a mystery novel where at the end it turns out the murder was committed by never before mentioned magic would be infuriating. That's the sort of story that can't be good without being also rational. It isn't about being rational or not, it's about consistency.
