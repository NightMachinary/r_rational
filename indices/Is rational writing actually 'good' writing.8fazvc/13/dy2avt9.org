No. It's merely one element of storytelling. It can contribute to good writing, but there are many such rules, and for any writing rule one can think of, there's likely a successful book that's an exception.

It really depends on the book and what you're trying to do. A lot of excellent works I can think of that dramatically violate customary standards do so with a sound understanding of what those standards are. So, a wildly irrational story could work, but the author would be well served to consider rationality, and why irrationality is important to his work. Perhaps it's a tale centering on unreliable narrators, and the irrationality informs us of important aspects of that character(s). That'd make perfect sense, and is only one of many potential reasons why you'd structure a story in that way.

Or perhaps it's a morality play, and you WANT a structure of "everything becomes illogical and disjointed, because humans screw everything up". God HAS to fix it in the end, because humans can't. Such a tale would be particularly similar to ol' greek plays, and the entire origin of Deus Ex Machina. Rational? Nah. But it presents a strong and consistent theme, so it can work.
