  So, given a good story being written by a good author, yes, writing the plot and the characters to be more rational will probably make it even better.

The problem with that is that writing them to be more rational might be straight at odds with the aim of the story itself. Someone here mentioned Gabriel Garcia Marquez; Isabel Allende is another (magical realism in general), but also Lewis Carroll, for example. As an example of a very good rationalist writer instead I'd suggest Nobel laureate Jos√© Saramago - who literally said that he wrote novels by choosing /one/ outlandish premise, and then seeing how things proceeded logically from it, and who wrote "The Gospel according to Jesus Christ", which could arguably be described as a beautiful rational retelling of the gospels. So I think a good author will simply know what best fits both their story, themes, and ability. It's mostly the average ones who are more likely to bite more than they can chew; knowing one's limits is one of the true marks of mastery.
