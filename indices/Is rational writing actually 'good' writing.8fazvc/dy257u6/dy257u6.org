I'd consider them orthogonal. Good writing is good writing; rationality doesn't come into it. Likewise, a rational story isn't necessarily going to be well-written just because it's rational.

There may be some bias because throwing rationality into a story makes it harder to write and write well. Thus, fewer tend to get written, and the few which are completed tend to be by authors who have significant determination and/or are good enough to be able to make a serious attempt in the first place. On top of that, the better examples of rational fiction tend to be lauded and spread around, while the ones which are... less so... are more likely to wither on the vine; there aren't so many rational-story fans that authors can get away with writing crap as long as it appeals to 0.1% of the fanbase.
