  Would you say that rationalist writing directly translates to good story telling?
#+end_quote

No. I could follow the four basic rules on the sidebar, and still be a terrible storyteller. My characters could be bland and monotonous, my worldbuilding simplistic, and my plot disjointed and ultimately unfulfilling.

That said, following those rules does mean you'll (hopefully) avoid some common tropes that often ruin many stories, like deus ex machinas, Mary Sue characters, etc.

  By rewriting something to be rationalist, do we make it a 'better' story?
#+end_quote

Not necessarily... I think it makes it an inherently /different/ story, but "better" is pretty much a matter of taste and preference. I loved HPMOR, but my SO would /hate/ it, because to her the best part of the HP series is the child-like whimsy of magic and the interactions and growth of the canon characters.

And for some stories I think it would just make it terrible. Imagine trying to make /One Hundred Years of Solitude,/ which revolves around [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism][magical realism]], into a rational story. I think it could be done... but I bet hardly anyone would consider it better than the original unless they hate the often dream-like logic of magical realism.

  And lastly, can a story be irrational, but still good ?
#+end_quote

Absolutely. See the examples I've mentioned already. And many of the recommendations we post on the sub don't always stick to all the rational characteristics on the sidebar. There can also be deconstructions of those characteristics too - /A Practical Guide to Evil/ deconstructs "good" and "evil" motivations as part of its meta narrative, /Unsong/ was all about a setting where the consistent rules of the universe are breaking down, and /The Erogamer/ has a meta structure where things happen explicitly because the plot requires it (or because the commenters vote to make it happen).

Knowing a genre and its characteristics, and then /playing with them,/ is something I enjoy reading even more than the rationality itself.

*Edit:* I realized after coming back and rereading that your title referenced "rational" but the body of your post specified "rationalist." I think all my points above stand for rationalist works as well - perhaps even moreso. Rationalist writing tends to have characters who skew extremely high in intelligence and low in emotional intelligence. As a result, the author ends up with a character who acts too unrealistically and thus is unrelatable. Compounding that is the problem that the characters can only be as smart as the writer. A lot of weak or inexperienced rationalist writers end up making Mary Sue/Marty Stu characters that are cringe-worthy. They often show basic misunderstandings of the very techniques they attempt to use, and the author ends up coming off as someone worthy of [[/r/iamverysmart]]. The rationalist works that show up on this sub tend to be pretty good, thankfully.
