So this is a bit of a tangent but duels seem ridiculously unsafe.

In Utsu's duel with Nef there are multiple occasions where Utsu says a screw-up would have led to a discharge and probable serious injury. It also says that Nef is pushing things because she knows that Utsu can handle it, but even still in both duels we've seen there was a flubbed incantation. That's with students that are among the best that healing academia has to offer, so a dueling culture among healers in general seems dangerous. But hey if you're going to get injured in a duel, being surrounded by other healers is a good place to do it.

Maybe I've overblowing it... shields are a thing, and less skilled healers could use better shields to cover for any mistakes.

Anyway, Fang coming in almost immediately after Utsu had finished confirming the number of people around was hilarious. So that's 22 people, not counting the logic engines, golems, extra bodies, corpses, or Everblossom? Think that's everyone, but since Fang got in there's always room for another person X.

...erm, I can't find it in the story and I never wrote it down- did the Order specifically invite ten students to the conclave? As in, the top ten students? In my head I've always thought it was lucky for Utsu and Ran that Ran got in, since she was 11th and Fang decided they didn't want to go. I was wondering why Fang did this last minute thing, and thought a possible reason might be to make sure Ran gets to go to do her a solid. But now that I think about it I'm not sure if this trip being specifically for the top ten students was a thing that was established.

eta: Ah, nevermind, think I see it. The entire class was invited, and it's just a class of eleven since it's a special class. I think the rankings from the profile cards made me think that they were there because of being at the top, but their class is already exemplary.
