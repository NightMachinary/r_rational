In the first duel, Neferuaten pushes Su, but the recent one is a lot less intense even when it gets more out of hand - they mostly use very simple incantations without too much energy, so it's not particularly dangerous. Backlash happens when you leave eris unaccounted for in an incantation, so if there's not much going into begin with, it's relatively safe.

  ...erm, I can't find it in the story and I never wrote it down- did the Order specifically invite ten students to the conclave?

The order originally invited the whole class, which is 11 students. The class was originally /intended/ to be 12 people, but one person dropped out, which will be discussed much later on.
