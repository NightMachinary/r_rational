This is sort of amazing as a story, and just really a good read. Many horror elements. Bills itself as irrationalfic, for extremely obvious reasons if you read it. Writing quality is astounding. Story is amazing, thought provoking.

Found this while reading Nostalgebraist's tumblr, originally posted by tumblr user somnilogical. Edit for clarity: The author of this story is Benedict_SC, I just was mentioning the chain of users I found out about the story from.
