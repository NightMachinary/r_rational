If you use a strict enough definition, it is very easy to intentionally avoid thinking of an elephant. Generally, my first thought when I hear the phrase "don't think of an elephant" is to recognize that the phrase is a trope. My second thought is to imagine a cartoon Dumbo. My third thought is to imagine an online photograph of an elephant. My fourth thought is, "it is very easy to intentionally avoid thinking of an elephant". If the phrase "don't think of an elephant" is interpreted to mean "don't think of any particular elephant", I have it very easy, since I don't actually know any elephants, and so I am perfectly safe from memetic infection. Naturally, this is the interpretation I favor.
