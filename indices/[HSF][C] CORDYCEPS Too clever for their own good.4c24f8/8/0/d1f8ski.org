I didn't really think of it on that level, actually- it was kind of in the back of my mind, but since the scenario was contrived to make it such that acquiring useful knowledge and reaching correct conclusions is a /bad/ thing, I'm not sure it would have helped if they'd used specific rationality techniques (hence the "Irrationalfic" tag.)

(I did write the two main characters to be /smart/, and some of that's going to be informed by my having read the Sequences, but I didn't actively work to double-check their logic and make sure they were really behaving optimally.)
