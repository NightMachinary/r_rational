I can't quite tell if this fic is rational or not... On one hand, both characters do actually take the time to think, something I see a lot in rational fics. And, when the perspective shifts, each character is shown to not only have distinctive personalities, but also distinctive minds (they think differently, and this is explored quite well), something I also see quite often in good rational fics. But I don't know enough about rationality to actually know if the characters (the main characters or the doctors) were acting rationally, or if they just thought they were... Anybody want to clear this up for me?
