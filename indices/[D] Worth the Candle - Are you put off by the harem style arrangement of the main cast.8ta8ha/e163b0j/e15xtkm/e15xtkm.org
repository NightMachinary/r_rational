In cases where the leading male character is surrounded by many women, for the purposes of titillating a male audience, I find it extremely off-putting.

Regarding "Worth the Candle", I find it similar to watching Chris Tucker in films. In /Rush Hour/, I cannot stand his character. He is loud, obnoxious, and his sense of humor does not match mine. In /The Fifth Element/, I love his character. He is loud, obnoxious, and his sense of humor does not match mine. The difference is that in /The Fifth Element/, everybody surrounding Chris Tucker has the same reaction to him as I do, being incredibly annoyed at him. This changes the joke into a meta-joke, with his character being the setup for a joke, rather than the punchline.

In "Worth the Candle", the social dynamics have not at all seemed like those of a catch-them-all style harem story. Joon is shown to be in conflict with the game-layer wherever he has moral qualms with it. Frequently when he has a heart-to-heart and sees a message that a loyalty score increased, his reaction is one of disgust. The intrinsic motivation for getting to know his friends resulted in an extrinsic reward, cheapening the experience. Similarly, Joon's anger at the achievement [[#s][]] shows the main feature is not one of Joon being in a harem story, but his disgust at being treated like a self-insert male protagonist into a harem story.

Add to that the parallels between Joon and Arthur, and Joon's worry/dismay on hearing of [[#s][]]: Joon is worried about what sort of a person the game-layer and narrative is trying to force him to be, and is trying to avoid being a self-insert protagonist in a harem story.
