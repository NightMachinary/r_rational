  There are some things that I find outright distasteful like Joon's early claim that he finds it easier to care about the safety/well-being of females than males but which as far as I've seen went unremarked upon in the community. It completely changed the way I relate to the character since.

Really? I mostly found that admission an admirable display of self-awareness. I think most heterosexual men find it easier to care about the safety & well-being of attractive females in their immediate social vicinity. That's just biology. Being aware of it doesn't make it worse.
