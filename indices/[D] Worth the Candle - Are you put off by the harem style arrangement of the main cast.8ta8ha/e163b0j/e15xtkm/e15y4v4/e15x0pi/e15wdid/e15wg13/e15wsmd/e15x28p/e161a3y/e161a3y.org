If this is so important to you that you felt the need to make a post about it then can you say you like the story in general? If you find such a central element of the story so off putting why are you even reading? If your only reason for reading is because this is one of the most popular stories in this subreddit then I suggest you stop. This is one of the most popular stories in this subreddit and thus you can assume that the general audience is not put off by such a big element of it.

When I read something that takes a wrong turn I simply stop reading, I don't see the point in making a post about why I don't like it. I find such discussions bad in general, it doesn't help the author, it doesn't help the readers who are fond of the story. It only "helps" the few who dislike it and by help I mean you create an echo chamber of negative emotion which isn't helpful to anyone.
