I think most people didn't really find it odd that Joon admitted that because it's an incredibly normal thing for most young men to think. Not to say that it's healthy, or that the culture that produces that state of mind shouldn't be changed, of course. But the culture does exist, and the mindset it produces is so common as to be considered the default.

But another part of it is how much you appreciate the meta of the situation. Everything Joon is encountering is, to some degree, orchestrated by the DM. So we have that additional layer of separation between the events of the story and the author, and we can talk about what the DM was thinking instead of what the author is thinking. And that sort of thing is definitely not everyone's cup of tea.
