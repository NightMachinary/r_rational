I will freely admit to having no idea what a blue tribe is, but /noticing that sexism exists in our culture/ is not a belief about sexism. It's the reality. Your decision to associate my ability to notice aspects of our culture with politics you disagree with is on you, not me.

  I don't think it's overly dramatic at all. Saying that you care more about the physical well-being of one group than another is pretty extreme. In many social groups you'd be obstracised for far less and we definitely see the impact from that kind of thing (in this very specific context of favoring the safety of women over men) everywhere around us, every day.

Ah, I understand your perspective far better after reading this. I suppose, if you're willing to sequester yourself hard enough from the mainstream, it wouldn't appear overdramatic.
