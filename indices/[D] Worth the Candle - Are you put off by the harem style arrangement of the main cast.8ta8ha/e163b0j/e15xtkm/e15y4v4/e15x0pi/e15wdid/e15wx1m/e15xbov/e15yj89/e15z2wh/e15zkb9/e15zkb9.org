Your beliefs about sexism are extremely political, in the sense that they're typical blue tribe beliefs. Obviously my beliefs are political too, hence why I said I don't agree with your stated politics.

I don't think it's overly dramatic at all. Saying that you care more about the physical well-being of one group than another is pretty extreme. In many social groups you'd be obstracised for far less and we definitely see the impact from that kind of thing (in this very specific context of favoring the safety of women over men) everywhere around us, every day.
