  I would bet a not insubstantial amount of money that if Joon had claimed that he cared more about the well-being of men than women there would have been negative comments about it from the community.

If there were negative comments they would have been about how that doesn't make sense for his character, not for him being sexist. Because, as I said, we live in a world where some degree of chauvinist masculinity is the norm.

  I've seen no one note that Joon might be a misandrist. After all, just because something is ubiquitous doesn't mean it's not prejudiced; infact prejudice is often so.

Well, that's because that would be a weird, huge leap of logic that doesn't make any sense. Joon is definitely a little sexist, but that's more of the "women are fragile, precious things that need to be protected" sort of sexism.

  I understand the metal levels in the story---I'm not saying the author is some kind of man hater. Just communicating how I don't like the current cast arrangement and reaching out to see if anyone else had the same reaction.

I mean sure, but you wrote that whole thing about the 'weird coincidences' of Fallewhatever being a soulfucker and Grak having a nonhuman gender and sexuality, so I thought I'd comment on why that is.
