Hm. I suppose I can't deny that I did imply that. I disagree that there's friction there, though. I think of both those interpretations as two sides of the same coin, inseparable from one another. The only difference is where one focuses their attention. And since Joon is focusing his attention on protecting girls instead of treating men as disposable, that's where the reader's attention is also focused. The idea that those two aspects of sexism in modern culture somehow can't coexist and be acknowledged simultaneously seems pretty absurd.

But yeah, maybe next time instead of just assuming someone's politics and saying you disagree with them without any explanation until repeatedly prompted, you might want to consider leading with some more open-ended questions to clarify the situation? I mean this submission alone has already had one comment thread about the importance of clarity and not making assumptions on the internet, yeah? Food for thought.
