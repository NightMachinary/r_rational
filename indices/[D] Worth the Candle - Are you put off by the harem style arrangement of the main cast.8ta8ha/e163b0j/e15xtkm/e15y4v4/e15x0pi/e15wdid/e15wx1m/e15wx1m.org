I would bet a not insubstantial amount of money that if Joon had claimed that he cared more about the well-being of men than women there would have been negative comments about it from the community.

I'm not wondering at what anyone was not surprised that Joon holds potentially misandrist beliefs/values but rather the fact that I've seen no one note that Joon might be a misandrist. After all, just because something is ubiquitous doesn't mean it's not prejudiced; infact prejudice is often so.

I understand the metal levels in the story---I'm not saying the author is some kind of man hater. Just communicating how I don't like the current cast arrangement and reaching out to see if anyone else had the same reaction.
