"Tonedeaf" is pretty arbitrary and we only have so much control of how what we communicate will be received.

Some things simply can't be discussed in a particular community without creating pushback regardless of well politely or gently it is brought up. It takes two to tango; posters are always going to be particularly hostile and nitpicky to an opinion that they disagree with instead of being generous and charitable.

Only one person that has replied so far has even attempted to steelman my post or interpret it in the best possible light. That reflects badly upon you too.
