This post should be marked as containing spoilers. I also suggest moving it to be a comment on one of the WtC posts, instead of a post itself, which would target it more at people who read the story. (This isn't the WtC subreddit after all.)

(I also feel this way about the other recent post of this nature, but it's more of a gray area as that post is also about the nature of rational fiction in general.)
