This post was removed by Automoderator after having passed a threshold for number of reports. I was going to reapprove it (and possibly wait for one of the other mods to come make a decision, because I have conflicts of interest), but it's been deleted.

Generally speaking, I think discussion of works falls well within the purview of this subreddit, though I'd prefer if it were somewhat rare, especially since the web serials already have so much more of a presence than shorter works, and they're the ones that will tend to dominate discussion. I also tend to hold these discussion topics to a higher standard than I do posts about fiction, since it would be easy for this subreddit to be swamped by low-effort discussion posts; the less thought and effort you're going to put into criticism or commentary, the more likely it should go into some other thread, especially for the web serials, which have threads posted at regular intervals. (And don't forget to be mindful of spoilers, since not everyone reads or has read whatever you might be posting about.)
