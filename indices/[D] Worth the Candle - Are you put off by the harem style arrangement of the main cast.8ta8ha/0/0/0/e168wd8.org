I didn't find this post to be particularly valuable to me, but I also don't think that it was /meant/ for me. It also falls a little too much in the "this is a thing I didn't like" rather than being "let's talk about the themes and messages of this work" (though this is subjective, and I can't reread the post to see how much of that might be me projecting).

If /I/ were going to make a post about a work, especially one meant to stand on its own, it would be something along the lines of "What are the sexual politics of /Worth the Candle/?" with a bunch of citations from the text, reading of sub-text, etc., and I would find /that/ valuable, because understanding how people read a work is an important part of getting better at writing, especially if it gives you a chance to see where people have misread things. And if it were for a work other than my own, I would probably also find it valuable as a reader, because I'm into that sort of analysis.
