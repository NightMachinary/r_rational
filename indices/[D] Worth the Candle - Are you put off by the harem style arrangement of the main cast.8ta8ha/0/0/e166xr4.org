Why do you find discussions like this valuable after a work is beyond a certain threshold of popularity? If this really was an issue it would've been echoed long before in each chapter's thread.

I could see how this would be valuable in an attempt to figure out why a story failed to gain popularity but otherwise..?

You as an author shouldn't feel the need to satisfy or even give much thought to this minority point of view because if you did then you would make the story worse for your main readership and make yourself feel bad because you might feel you were wrong to write it the way you did. Which you were not.
