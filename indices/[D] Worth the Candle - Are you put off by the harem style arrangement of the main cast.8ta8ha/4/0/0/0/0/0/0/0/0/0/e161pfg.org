Your interpretation of what was sexist about Joon's comment and what sexism is and entails is at odds with mine.

The fact that you see that comment as /primarily/ sexism against women (white knighting, damsel in distress) as opposed to male disposability, hyperagency and a sign of the pervasive empathy gap I our society is an obvious sign of political friction.
