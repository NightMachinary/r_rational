I mean, in Fifth Element Ruby Rhod is a character who makes perfect sense in both from a Watsonian and Doylist perspective. In universe Ruby is a flamboyant media personality who serves as a microcosm of how weird and exaggerated the future is, so his behaviour makes sense for his character. From a narrative perspective his comic relief is contextualized by him being a fish out of water mixed up in events against his will or consent, so his presence in the story feels more natural.

The presence Chris Tucker in Rush Hour by contrast is bizarre on both. From a narrative perspective he serves no other purpose other than comic relief to back up Jackie Chan's Wu Shu heroism with "comedy" (which is unnecessary because Jackie is a perfectly viable comedic actor) without brining anything to the table to resolve the story. From an in universe perspective you have to wonder how the hell Tucker *made it through the academy* let along became a Detective acting the way he does, his existence in the narrative is pure fiat and he's only there because Chris Tucker is a popular comedian with a distinctive voice who will help get butts in seats.

So it's pretty easy to see why a viewer or reader might react negatively to certain story elements in some context and not in others if it a. fails to make sense from an in-universe standpoint to the reader and b. fails to justify why it needs to be a part of the story to the reader.
