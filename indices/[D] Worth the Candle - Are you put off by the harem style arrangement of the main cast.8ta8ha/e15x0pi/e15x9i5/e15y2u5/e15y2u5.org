The issue is twofold. First, a community which cares about a work does not want to see their community spaces become ones which are hypercritical of the work. Second, my personal empathy and socialization make me really uncomfortable with purely critical negativity mines being left in author-reader dialogue spaces, and authors and other content creators often express a strong negative impact from comments unhealthily critical or hostile to their work. In light of this being the second non-main-chapter-discussion post on WtC I can think of, and also within a few days of the last one, which also read as critical but which at least generated some other discussion, I am particularly inclined to pushback.

Had your post included any of your other comments in this thread, that you love WtC enough to donate, that

  It's a niggling thought I've been having while reading the story and wanted to hear from other readers to see if they're having the same experience.

etc., then the tone of your post would have been different. It would not have read as a request for people to complain about WtC and, e.g., fall into the "X and Y are bad about the protagonist, therefore they are bad about the work as a whole and about the author" attractor which so much complaining about authors' works often does. What you did post, however, in light of your other comments, I now read as tonedeaf. It is for that tonedeafness, I think, that you're receiving this response from myself and a few others.
