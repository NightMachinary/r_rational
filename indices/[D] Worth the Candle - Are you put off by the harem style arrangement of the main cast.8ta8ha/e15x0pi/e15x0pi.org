This sounds a whole lot like "I dislike this and this, find that distasteful, I'm salty because X - anyone else?" Which is to say, this sounds a whole lot like posting to the sub at large to bitch about WtC.

I see nothing redeeming in your post, nothing constructively critical, nothing even actionable by the author or interesting to the reader. Aside from being rude to the author, I don't think this is really on-topic for this subreddit.
