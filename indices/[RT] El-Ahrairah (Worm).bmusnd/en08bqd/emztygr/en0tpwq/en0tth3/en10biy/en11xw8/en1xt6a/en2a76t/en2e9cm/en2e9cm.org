Please consider the amount of effort you've put into resisting adding a spoiler tag to a top level comment that spoils the entire plot of the parent media and then consider how much effort adding one will take. Posting a spoiler like that is one thing, but then refusing to spoiler it and arguing that “it's okay because it spoils the fanfic I'm shilling so obviously it's supposed to spoil Worm” is not only absurd but also disingenuous. If you're spoiling two works then that means the spoiler tag is even more important, not less. Please make it clear that your comment contains significant spoilers for Worm and tag it with the spoiler tag, the tag added solely for this purpose. It's incredibly telling and disrespectful not to.
