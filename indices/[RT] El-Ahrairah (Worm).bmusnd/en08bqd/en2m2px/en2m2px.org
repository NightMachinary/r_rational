I find that El-Ahrairah has highly inconsistent quality. All stories have their strengths and weaknesses, of course, but the range between them is normally pretty small. El-Ahrairah is an oddity because it has parts that I think are quite fantastic, and parts that I think are quite terrible, and almost nothing in between.

It certainly gets points for originality in terms of plot structure, and the spelling and grammar are pretty good, but the characterization is weird and the prose at times is just plain bad, especially in certain fight scenes.
