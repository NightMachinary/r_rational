  I mentioned that it would spoil Worm in the comment.

No, you didn't. You wrote:

  I can't believe I've overlooked this fic for so long. A quick, spoilery summary is that [...]
#+end_quote

... which, given that you linked a fanfic rather than Worm, could only reasonably be interpreted as referring to spoilers for the fanfic rather than Worm itself.

To be fair, I don't know why someone who would be interested in reading Worm but hadn't already done so would be in this thread, but since it's apparently meant for those people you should really clarify and tag the spoilers.
