That does bring up a great idea, though. If any of us readers /do/ write fanfic involving Sean, he'll be able to enter those worlds and use whatever powers we give him access to.

Obviously it's up to Sasparilla which ones Sean enters, and the M&M storyverse is different from the "real" storyverse as evidenced by the fact that [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22922848-dragon-wife][/Dragon Wife/]] is unfortunately not about Sean and Haley. But it's still fun to think about.
