I don't know, dumbledore seems pretty woke, even for a metafanfictional peek behind the curtain. For my crack theory, snap decides to honor lily instead of spite james, and decides to prepare harry the best way he knows how: potions.

"Stirring Cauldrons" therefore has multiple meanings: the literal one, and "stirring shit up". After all, it's clear that dumbledore is trying to repress magical knowledge, and potions are a doozy. Look at all of the trouble the twins could have gotten into, just when they were interested in pranks!
