There's one realistic way to avoid this scenario. Maybe in the real world decent human brain copies will be too resource-intensive to be widespread and weak AI can take up the slack that most people would use them for. Or at least it'll remain too resource-intensive for long enough that we can get a good ethical framework to be widespread.
