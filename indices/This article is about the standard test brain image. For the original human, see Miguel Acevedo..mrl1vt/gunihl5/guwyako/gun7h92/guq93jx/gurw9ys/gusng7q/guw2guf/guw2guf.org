Yeah, I feel like once/if we ever have the ability to simulate an entire human brain, couldn't we also modify that brain in order to fit its function? Using an entire human in order to run menial tasks seems like a waste of resources. This is entirely speculative but I feel like if we are capable of uploading consciousness we could also alter it according to its usage, removing personality, emotions, and general self-awareness. Obviously this kind of "AI-lobotomy" has its own ethical issues, but is not quite the straight-up horror that the article describes (and which has been used in /Black Mirror/ and other media as well, surely)
