"All AI must be ethical" is silly, but, I still believe in the ethics of humans when collectively in an environment where all the scarcity factors that pit us against each other are gone.

But that isn't my actual objection, my actual objection is that there is no way that it turns out the /cheapest/ way to get an algorithm to do labor is to make it simulate an /entire human/, who is /unwilling/ and then /force/ it to do the labor within a simulated environment, rather than just training a specific purpose machine to do it. What task can you imagine where that is the cheapest solution? It would imply that we can't replace human general intelligence even for incredibly rote tasks that no one wants to voluntarily do but that we /can/ simulate an entire human.
