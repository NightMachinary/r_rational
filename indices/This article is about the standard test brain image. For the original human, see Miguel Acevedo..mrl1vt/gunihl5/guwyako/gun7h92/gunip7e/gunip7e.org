I think some people interpreted the tone of your statement as suggesting that this is a "dup", i.e. a kind of "we just talked about this" / "we don't need to see this again so soon" / "you should stop giving OP your internet points, they're just reposting things they saw yesterday" vibe. Which, coupled with the fact that the original post was from months ago, would be wrong-headed if that /was/ what you meant.

But, of course, that's /not/ what you intended to mean.

You have to be very careful with tone when making succinct Internet comments, if there's a conventional/memetic "every thread has this type of post" comment, that your comment could be misconstrued as attempting to evoke.

People like the moderators on Hacker News, the posters on [[/r/AskHistorians]], etc., try to avoid this association by phrasing the pointer to previous conversations very deferentially to the current conversation. I think the well-known format for [[/r/AskHistorians]] goes something like "There's certainly always more that can be said on this topic, but there was a previous excellent discussion [here]."
