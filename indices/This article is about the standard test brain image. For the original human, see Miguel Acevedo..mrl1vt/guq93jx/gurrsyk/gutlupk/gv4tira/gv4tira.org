  But we don't want to invest/research into that direction, because where else will the masses get their pay?

I believe that this live is already something of a simulation. It fits in with my religious beliefs. But the point of life is not to test is, it's to change us. So where does my personality need to change? How can I become a better person?

Now I've seen myself, during the pandemic or whatever, and I perhaps don't spend my spare time constructively enough. I mean, if I get a month to myself, do I blow it on 24/7 Netflix? What if I get a year? Am I really being the best me that I can be?

Now I'm nowhere near rich enough to retire. I still have 8,824 days to go. But will retiring actually be a net benefit for me or will I just become a sloth?

Now I don't want people to live on the edge, to live with food insecurity. But I do feel that some amount of work should be necessary. UBI should require at least a few hours a week or something, in my opinion. Anyway, I think we should be looking into how to reduce required hours of work but I don't want it to go down to zero as I think most people are like me and wouldn't necessarily benefit from being able to 24/7 Netflix for the rest of their lives.
