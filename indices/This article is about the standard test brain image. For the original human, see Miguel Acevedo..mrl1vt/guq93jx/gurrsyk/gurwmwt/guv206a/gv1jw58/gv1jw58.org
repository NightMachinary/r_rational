  But that isn't my actual objection, my actual objection is that there is no way that it turns out the cheapest way to get an algorithm to do labor is to make it simulate an entire human, who is unwilling and then force it to do the labor within a simulated environment, rather than just training a specific purpose machine to do it. What task can you imagine where that is the cheapest solution?

Meanwhile in real software development, we not only don't bother optimizing our software, we go so far as to make apps in Javascript and run them in what's basically a whole web browser rather than just coding for the platform, because "developer time" is seen as so valuable and "compute" can be had in bulk. Why bother coding for a task when you could just repeatedly simulate one person known to be a good worker?
