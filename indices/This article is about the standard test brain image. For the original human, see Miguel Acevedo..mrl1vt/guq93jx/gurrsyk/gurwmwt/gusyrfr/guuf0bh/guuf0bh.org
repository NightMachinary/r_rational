Agreed it's all possible, and nice to be optimistic. I was responding to the assertion that there's "no way" ems could be used this way. Given that we have ample historical and modern examples of slavery and poor working conditions for living humans, and given that markets appear to be a pretty entrenched system, I would argue it cannot be ruled out as a possibility that emulated minds would be used for work.
