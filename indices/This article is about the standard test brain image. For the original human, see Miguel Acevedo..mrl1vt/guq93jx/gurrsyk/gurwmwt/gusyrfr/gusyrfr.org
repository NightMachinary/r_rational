Not all nice things are unlikely. Theres lots of ways the future could unfold, and lots of arguments why there wouldn't be a great amount of enslaved human minds.

Wanting cheap labour doesn't mean we live in a world of ubicuous slavery, at least in the developed world so it's not a sufficient condition.

Civilization is not maximally horrible, people care about other people and treating other humans badly has other consecueces. It would be hard to have enslaved ems work on longterm wide reaching stuff for example, and if some of them manage to basically "get out of the box" you could have a movie style ai revolution only it makes more sense cause the "humans in robot suits" are actually humans.

Plus personaly I think that it would be cheaper to have non-human AI do the work.

And yeah that doesn't guarantee there won't be ems suffering despite of all that but it's certainly not obious it's going to happen or that most ems will be slaves.

And you can try to influence the future so it's less likely to be bad.
