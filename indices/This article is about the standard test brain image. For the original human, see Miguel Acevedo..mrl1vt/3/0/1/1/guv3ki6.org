We are not even close, our AI can't so much as deliver a package up a flight of unfamiliar stairs yet. We /just/ got self driving cars and delivery drones for tiny packages, and i think that's pretty much the state if the art. The rich would do it if they could, paying people is expensive. It'll be at least a few decades i think, if not way more.
