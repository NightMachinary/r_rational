Yes. The critique here presupposes that we would have non-emulated AI and thus be in a post-scarcity world, or that post-scarcity is a precondition for developing uploading. I think it's quite possible that rare things like cognition in general and especially cognition from individuals will continue to be valuable. I'm not saying it's the obvious or most likely future, but it's not unlikely, at least from what we know.

I honestly think optimism here is somewhat unwarranted. AI will arise in a a framework that optimizes for making money, not for well-bring. It's fine to say "advocate for the good ending," but I have no significant power to make an impact here, and others do, and are incentivized to use ems, if they are developed, to create more wealth and capital.

If faced with a coin flip between infinite heavens and infinite hells, I'd prefer to take my chances with oblivion.
