This does make me wonder about the possibility of transferring data between saves, a la Time Braid.

If all you get to bring with you are memories, and you don't have access to mind/body magic, any body upgrades are out. What about digital files? One could conceivably jump back and forth between saves, memorizing as many bytes as possible, then copying them in the other save, repeat ad fini. But that seems tedious and error-prone and would sleep deprivation add up across saves?

Is there anything short of trying to improve one's memorization and mental compression algorithms that would make transferring large files practical? (Heck, when you're copying by hand, anything bigger than a few kilobytes starts to sound like something you should get paid for. Hm, if there are multiple protagonists that can jump between each other's saves like this, I can see data transfer forming the new stable economy, what with normal economies being shot all to hell.)
