Have either of you read [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime][Wheel of Time]]? It's one of my favourite fantasy series, and it's incredibly prophecy heavy. I'm not sure there's a prophecy trope it doesn't use in some way. Dozens of PoV characters, and by the later books they're all being influenced by one or many prophecies, which they may or may not be interpreting correctly.
