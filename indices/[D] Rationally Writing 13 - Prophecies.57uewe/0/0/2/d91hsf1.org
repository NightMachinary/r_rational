Haven't read SoT, certainly have positive nostalgia bias for WoT, but trying to consider it objectively...

#+begin_quote
  the plot itself will eventually become a twisted and convoluted mess
#+end_quote

This happens. I found that each plot thread, and the relations between them, remains relatively straightforward and intelligible; the problem is mainly that there are too many threads and progress on each is painfully slow.

#+begin_quote
  the characters will become caricatures of themselves
#+end_quote

This also happens at various points with most of the main cast. The girls have it especially bad.

Both of these issues are worst in books 6-10, and are fixed by end of book 11 or so. (By the end of the series, only one character felt like a caricature, and there were extenuating circumstances.) So yes, the middle books are definitely a slog. But the end is a great success that fulfills the promise of the beginning, rather than being a huge disappointment.

On the comparison between the two, I've heard it said that (to paraphrase) SoT was good when Terry Goodkind was ripping off Robert Jordan, got bad when he stopped, and then got better but more controversial when he started making everyone Objectivists. This was and remains an obviously uncharitable summary. However, if there's any truth in it, I suspect that you won't enjoy WoT quite as much for having read SoT first. A lot of Jordan's strength is in worldbuilding and in incorporating a lot of more subtle mythological cues into the story, making parts feel like familiar things you never knew you knew. It's my understanding that he was among the first to do this well, and it's my belief that he was the best to do it at all[1], but he certainly isn't the only one to have done it. I've heard from some well-read friends that it doesn't do a lot new, which leads me to expect that there is a Seinfield Is Unfunny effect here, an inverse relationship between [Has read lots of high fantasy published since The Eye of the World's release] and [appreciates Wheel of Time on a first read]. Though I can't speak to the effect size, it's possible that having read/enjoyed Sword of Truth has an outsize effect, due to similar tropes appearing in both stories.

[1]: I think Catherine Valente actually does it even better in /Deathless/, but that's a bit different because 1), it's set in the real world, 2), it's in the tradition of magical realism, not high fantasy, and 3), it has more of a folklore vibe than a mythic one.
