A note: This description has very mild spoilers of the type "Book X has a climax." I didn't feel those were worth spoiler tagging, but I thought I'd mention it here because I have a friend who dislikes even that pauce info.

I've read it 2-3 times. Personally, I think it starts getting good around the last third of book 1, around the time [[#s][very mild spoilers]] The book 6-10 stretch is rough; about 80% of books 6-9 is very slow without much happening. The last time through, I tried the audiobooks, which I highly recommend in general (the readers are excellent) but especially for this stretch. They are slower than reading, but it's easy to tune out and tune back in when something happens.

Books 6 and 10 are probably the worst. To be honest, so little happens in book 10 that I usually recommend skipping it in favor of the plot summary on TarValon.net. There's only 3 or so scenes in it that are worth reading. 6 is just as bad for most of the way, but the book's climax nearly makes up for it.

Books 1-5 and 11-14, though, I found to range from good to excellent. I really appreciate the incorporation and re-working of elements and themes from so many mythologies, as well as the themes of stories that change in the telling ("legend becomes myth, and even myth is long forgotten..") that pervade the whole work, so YMMV if you aren't as into this. 11 is where things start picking up again, but they've been so slow for so long at that point that it's almost hard to notice. Sanderson picks up the pace when he takes over, which is greatly appreciated. His writing style is noticeably different, but everyone I've talked with agrees it's satisfactory. I don't like his quirks as much as Jordan's, but he did a good job: The end of book 12 was one of my moments in the series, and the series climax, which I expected to be kind of a letdown, was ~200 pages of sheer delight.
