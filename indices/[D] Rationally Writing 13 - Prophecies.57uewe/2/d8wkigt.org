From a story structure perspective, what about prophecies that are resolved towards the beginning of the story, as the inciting incident? For example, a post-apocalyptic story where there was a prophecy in the backstory about what would set off the apocalypse? In this case, the prophecy doesn't so much drive the plot directly as it establishes the legitimacy of the source.
