Ahh, I see, so you've basically got some doomsayers that turned out to be right lording it over everyone else and getting converts and followers because of it?

In such a case there's really no reason to make it explicit that the prophecy really existed, unless you /want/ that faction to be seen as the obviously-correct-and-sensible-group, which kind of feels like cheating, but if it's supposed to be part of some bigger twist I guess it can work.

If you /don't/ plan on having that faction actually be right about everything, then just have them talk about the prophecy but don't make it clear that it actually happened exactly as they said it would. Leave it up to speculation, make them seem like maybe they just got lucky to a critical thinker in the story.

It really depends what kind of story it is. Without more details it's hard for me to judge, but I feel like using a magically ineffable source of knowledge to establish the legitimacy of some higher power or faction's goodness/rightness is, again, cheating :)
