I got about halfway through the first book and then stopped. Most of the analysis I'd heard about the series was that it really started getting good around book four, then there was a stretch from book 6-10 where nothing much happens.

I wanted to read the series mostly because it's one of the big ones, but I have a fairly strict "drop it if I'm not having fun" policy on longer series (i.e. don't throw good money after bad). The prospect of suffering through somewhere between four and seven books that I wouldn't really be enjoying just to get fantasy reader completion credit didn't seem worth it.
