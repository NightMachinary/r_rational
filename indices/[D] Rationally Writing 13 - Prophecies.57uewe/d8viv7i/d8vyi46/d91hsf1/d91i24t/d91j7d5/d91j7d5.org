No; no people or groups have anything resembling rationality advice (or dealing-with-people advice) in Wheel of Time. Not that I recall, anyway. A socially aware reader may learn from the characters' mistakes, but this is true of nearly any story.

Wheel of Time is fairly traditional fantasy that plays all the big tropes pretty straight. There are a few interesting quirks in the magic I suppose, but it's mostly worth reading because it's same old stuff done bigger and better than anywhere else. I love it dearly, but extrapolating your taste from your comments on the podcast, I suspect you may not enjoy it enough to be worth the time/effort.

One further note...

  I can see why that might be offputting for some and enjoyable for others

This seems to make the (afaik accurate) observation that Wheel of Time is more polarizing than most series. I suspect this is mostly due to his portrayal of gender. Jordan is a gender essentialist. He isn't malicious or hateful or otherwise negative about it. As far as he's concerned, that's just the way the world is, so it's the way his fantasy world is, too. That would be fairly minor/typical, but the big thing is it's reflected in the structure of the world's metaphysics and magic. Many people, even those who hold different views of gender, are not bothered by this. However, it does put some people off very strongly.
