Thanks for the writeup, I can see why that might be offputting for some and enjoyable for others.

  I've heard from some well-read friends that it doesn't do a lot new, which leads me to expect that there is a Seinfield Is Unfunny effect here, an inverse relationship between [Has read lots of high fantasy published since The Eye of the World's release] and [appreciates Wheel of Time on a first read]. Though I can't speak to the effect size, it's possible that having read/enjoyed Sword of Truth has an outsize effect, due to similar tropes appearing in both stories.

Yeah, this is mostly what I'm thinking.

Goodkind did some interesting things in that his stories were pseudo-rationalist: the first book is called Wizard's First Rule, which is, paraphrased, People are Stupid (and can be made to believe anything if they want them to be true enough or are afraid they might be) and each book sort-of explores a different Rule that wizards have to help them understand people and avoid problems interacting with them.

Besides the mostly enjoyable setting and characters of the early books, I enjoyed that aspect of it a lot for obvious reasons, even if I've mostly forgotten the other Rules and doubt many of them would hold up now that I've gotten older and hopefully wiser. Is there anything similar in the WoT series?
