I don't know if [[/u/alexanderwales]] has, but I haven't. Keep hearing a lot about it, but it's not all good, so I've been prioritizing other things :) I think I'm concerned that it will basically be another Sword of Truth, in that I'll enjoy the early books and characters, but the plot itself will eventually become a twisted and convoluted mess, and the characters will become caricatures of themselves.

Has anyone read both series and can compare them a bit for me, without spoilers?
