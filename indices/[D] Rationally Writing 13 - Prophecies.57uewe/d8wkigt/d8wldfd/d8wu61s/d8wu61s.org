"Doesn't its very existence bring up a whole bunch of new questions that need to be addressed?" is exactly what I'm getting at. Include the prophecy /only/ to point at the power that went into making it, and put the prophecy's realization in the story's past to avoid comparatively been-there-done-that not-as-clever-as-the-author-thinks questions like "what does the prophecy mean" and "is the prophecy infallible". Its narrative purpose is to give the faction that already trusted the prophecy a "told you so" quality.
