Sure, that's less egregious in that it affects less things, but again, what's the point of it being there at all? Why even include a prophecy that would fortell of the apocalypse if you're going to just start the story after it already happened? Doesn't its very existence bring up a whole bunch of new questions that need to be addressed? Why not just have the cataclysmic event occur without the prophecy?
