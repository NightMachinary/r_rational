I saw in your linked post that you said:

  Almost every single story that has a prophecy or any kind of "precognition" in it could remain exactly the same, or be improved, by the clean removal of them.

I think there is one prophecy that falls out of that category, the one from the Lego Movie. It's unique for a specific reason: it's complete ########. To quote the guy the seer: "I made it all up." What are your thoughts on it? I'm not trying to nit-pick your views or anything, I would just like to hear your thoughts on it.

Edit: Just saw [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2z5ooe/d_goddamn_do_i_hate_prophecies/cpfzsjv][this comment]] you made which answers my question. Sorry about that.
