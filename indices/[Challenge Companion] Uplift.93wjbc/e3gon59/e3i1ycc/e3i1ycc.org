  ...uplifted into walking, talking, sentient beings.

- Walking: Bipedal with hands free for carrying tools and for their fine-motor manipulation.
- Talking: Language, and its ability to express a point of view. Experience becomes story.
- Sentient: Surely the author means "sapient"?

Practically by the definition of animal, all are sentient to some degree during some part of their life cycle. Their perception is as simple as their nervous system, clumped into a brain or no, but they all sense in one way or another and they all act on those sensations. Sentience is an extremely low bar to clear.

Sapience, however, implies judgement and reason. The merely sentient can react, but the sapient can /decide/. Sapience also varies by nervous system complexity. Which way should I go? What should I eat? Fight or flight? Friend or foe? There a few animals of high cunning, quick and clever, but examples with enough reason to be capable of puzzle solving and long-term learning exist in most branches of the evolutionary tree.

The big trick to uplift, so far as I'm concerned, is language: a mental map for assigning words (or descriptions, groups of words) to objects and activities and ideas. Arms and hands might even be a biomechanical engineering problem rather a genetic engineering one, and sapience is probably just a matter of increased encephalization. In much the same way that we underestimated the difficulty of implementing natural language processing in AI, I think we underestimate how weird and complex language processing would be in uplifted animals.
