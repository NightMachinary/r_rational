Software based - everyone's got computer interfaces in their brains, and some bright soul decided to hook up a hormone-regulation system with hard limits to make using it lethally very difficult. Think the glands in the Culture. This is mostly used by people on themselves, but there's a hack that can grant some measure of control over the system to another person within the scope of a short-range broadcast. Your main character has a background process running in his skull that exploits the hack automatically on the people around him, making them feel happier, more agreeable, etc.
