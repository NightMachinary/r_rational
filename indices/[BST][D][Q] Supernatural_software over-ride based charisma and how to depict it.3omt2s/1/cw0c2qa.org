Start by having someone explicitly, and self-evidently dull having people hang on their every word, or let someone self-evidently socially awkward's speeches, insipid and bland material, stick in a characters mind despite this. In other words, have them demonstrate success without competence, or even with incompetence, and the sooner the better.

Maybe let the character have little, niggling feelings something is wrong, or something similar, when it's present, or just mention how "it felt so right" afterwards. little things that show the hijacking, without the character realizing it.

i presume someone sufficiently self-aware can analyze their thoughts in retrospect, right? If so, your character could realize far too late to do anything about it.
