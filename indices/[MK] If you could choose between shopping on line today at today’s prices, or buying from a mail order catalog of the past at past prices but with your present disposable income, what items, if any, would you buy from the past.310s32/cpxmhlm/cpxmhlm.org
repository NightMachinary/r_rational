1937 Sears Christmas Book. 90% cotton, 10% wool full body long underwear. $2.49 per three suits ($0.83 each).

From Amazon: [[http://www.amazon.com/Indera-Mills-Classic-Union-865us/dp/B000V5CQKG/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1427874009&sr=8-6&keywords=long+underwear+cotton+men+suit][here]] 100% cotton full body long underwear. $18.70 minimum per each.

I will happily take the arbitrage from buying $0.83 full body long underwear suits and reselling them for $18.70. 2253% gross return is rather more than acceptable.
