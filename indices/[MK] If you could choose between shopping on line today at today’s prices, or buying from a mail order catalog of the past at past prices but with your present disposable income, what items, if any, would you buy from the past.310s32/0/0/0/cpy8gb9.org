Without doing a real dig through the catalogs, I'd probably turn my head towards gold jewelry next. Gold prices in 1985 were around 317 dollars US per ounce. Right now they are at 1200 or so dollars per ounce. Clearly 14kt jewelry wouldn't be the best way to take advantage of the arbitrage in gold values, but the Sears 1985 catalog indicates that their jewelry is 14kt.

A jeweler that knows the jargon for gold jewelry, and knows what is selling well right now, could probably turn a tidy profit. Some jewelry styles are timeless. If I wanted to do it entirely by myself, I'd have to spend some time learning about jewelry.

EDIT Also note that there are a HUGE number of shops that will buy jewelry directly, with few questions asked. You could conceivably make a substantial profit doing this and never be noticed.
