Have you tried selling used goods in small quantities? Unless you're a killer salesman, or you have a lot of goods, you're lucky to get anything like wholesale... you're buying at 1985 retail prices and selling at 2015 garage-sale prices.

With only a 3x price difference, and no way of establishing bona fides, you're more likely to lose than profit.

If you already have a store that you can sell this stuff through, then it'd be a nice extra low-price supplier for good condition retro goods. Otherwise, I wouldn't touch the 1985 catalog for anything I wanted to shift. I might want to pick some stuff up for nostalgia value, though.
