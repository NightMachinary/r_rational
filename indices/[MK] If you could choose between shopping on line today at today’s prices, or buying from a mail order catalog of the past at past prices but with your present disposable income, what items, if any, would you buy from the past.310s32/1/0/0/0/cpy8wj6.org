3x price differences are huge. Buy boots from Sears 1985 and go to a local flea market and resell at your own table, near another clothing seller. Remember that everyone else in that facility is buying at today's prices. If you advertise a price less than what the nearby clothing seller could buy similar boots at, bam, they will probably simply walk over and buy you out right there.

Start creating a network of flea market vendors, pawn shops, and retro clothes shops that sell used goods. Remember that these boots are going to look and smell new, because they are new. A person that knows used clothing will recognize them as being valuable, and you'll be able to get a reasonable price for them.

Sure, some people will try to rip you off. The grey market's like that. You won't lose money though, unless you get the attention of the black market. Which is likely, over time. Then things would get a bit scary. Which, incidentally, would potentially make a quite interesting piece of fiction, like the original post indicates.
