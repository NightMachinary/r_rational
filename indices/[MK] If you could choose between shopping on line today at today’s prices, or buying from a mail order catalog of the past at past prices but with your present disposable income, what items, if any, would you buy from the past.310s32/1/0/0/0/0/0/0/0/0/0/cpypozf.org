Hrm, and here I thought supply and demand drove prices. This is definitely not the place to have that conversation though.

EDIT I have to say this. Wages are an expense and therefore would impact pricing/inflation. In that, you are correct. However other things impact pricing too. Fuel cost. Other materials costs. Taxes & regulations. Automation. New processes. To link wages directly to inflation is a bit of a fragile connection. In some industries, wages are linked more strongly than others.
