At the risk of starting a side argument, how is inflation a good thing? If you assume that wage-payers will also increase wages to match inflation, maybe, but I think it's safe to say that's not likely. Unless you are a top tier wage-earner. If you have a very long term investment like a house, again, that is only good if your wages increase with inflation, otherwise, the expenses of other things will make it impossible for you to maintain the long term investment.
