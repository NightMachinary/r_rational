Oh, I missed where that was added into the conversation in this thread. Somewhat odd. Why would you limit yourself to $10-$20 per day when the OP says nothing about limits other than you don't have an infinite amount of money?

If I had to be limited to $10 to $20 per day, it would then become a hunt for collectables. Action figures and other toys, shipped to me in perfect condition, in their original packaging, and then turned around on Ebay.
