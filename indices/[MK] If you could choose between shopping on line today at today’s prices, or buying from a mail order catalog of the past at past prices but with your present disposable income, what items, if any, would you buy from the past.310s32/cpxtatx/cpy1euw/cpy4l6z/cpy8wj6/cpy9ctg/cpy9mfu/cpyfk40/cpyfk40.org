Anyway, my original point is that inflation since 1980 has really been amazingly low^{*,} especially for the kind of stuff in Sears catalogs in 1985. If you could buy cars or houses or groceries, that would be a much bigger deal. That's why an earlier catalog would be much more interesting, even if it wasn't THAT much earlier than 1985.

Note: ^{*} And this is not a good thing.
