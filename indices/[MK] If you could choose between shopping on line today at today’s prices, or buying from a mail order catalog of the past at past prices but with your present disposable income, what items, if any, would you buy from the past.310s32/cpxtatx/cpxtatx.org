Leather boots from Sears seem to have gone up by a factor of three or more since 1985. Other durable clothing (jackets, coats) seem to have a similar ratio. The problem with 1985 is that inflation has been unusually low since then, with post-Reagan policies holding it low and increasing inequality instead (inflation is good for equality because it targets money capital).
