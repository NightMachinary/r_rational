One basic criteria to measure how saved and/or eutopian the posited world is "Is DataPacRat going to be alive n years from now, for n > 0?", or, if you need a finer-grained measurement, "What is the likelihood DataPacRat is going to be alive n years from now?" (especially as the first question ceases to be answered 'no' for all n > 100, and the second question continues increasing for ever-larger values of n).

Reasonably easy to calculate compared to most ways of measuring whether the world is saved or not, possesses a certain amount philosophical justification (and that's without even getting into the semantic arguments about everyone's existence being within 'their' world), and I obviously have a certain amount of incentive to promote this particular standard. :)
