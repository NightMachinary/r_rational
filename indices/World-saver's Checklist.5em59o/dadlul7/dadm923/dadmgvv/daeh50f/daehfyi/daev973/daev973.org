I liked the idea of your document. It made me think about what a person could do to increase the odds of their revival after cryopreservation. Specifically, I was imagining scenarios where revival was experimental and the revivers were looking for optimal candidates, or where revival was very expensive and a priority queue was formed. What are your thoughts on any of the following ideas:

-Depositing material resources that will be rare in the future and memorizing their locations.

-Holding useful information about the present or past hostage (e.g. doing useful, niche research and failing to publish it. This example is vague because it was hard to imagine what that research could be.)

-Increasing the likelihood of cryopreservation being a success by having everyone cryopreserved do one of the above and thereby artificially increasing the social value of reviving people.

If you've seen the above points discussed somewhere before, I'd be interested in a link to that as well.

Cheers.
