I'm going to admit, my task was somewhat simplified by the fact that without a continuous human organization to refill the liquid nitrogen tanks, I'll end up warm-and-dead and there'll be no point to the letter at all. Otherwise I'd be spending a bit more time on coming up with ways to communicate with future folk who don't have any language in common than I'm spending on minor translations such as [[http://www.datapacrat.com/ice/ice-chit.html][this]]. :)

Oh, and I suspect you'd enjoy the MLP fanfiction story [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/42409/the-writing-on-the-wall][The Writing on the Wall]], if you haven't already seen it.
