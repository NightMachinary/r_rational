I hadn't, and thankyou, it was a really good read though I obviously worked out the twist from the part about the spikes! The doc done by the "let's work out how to make a Message" think-tank had a few "hypothetical situations" to show how different Messages could be interpreted by different future cultures, so seeing the Message being interpreted by a cartoon pony is of course excellent.
