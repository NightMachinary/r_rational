In terms of what we can do today- most diseases which can be annihilated are (diseases being horrific to intellect, social development, and happiness) most humans can live happy, fulfilling lives, environmental damage is minimized, most humans can enjoy clean food and water, have shoes, have clothes, jobs or basic income available to all, cheap treatment of all cheap conditions, full funding of mental healthcare and housing for all, and extensive scientific research.

In terms of the near future, more use of automated software to reduce accidents, genetic engineering and stem cells to fix conditions and reduce ageing, lazarus technology to revive the dead.
