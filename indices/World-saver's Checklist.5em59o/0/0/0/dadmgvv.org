It's an interesting question, with a few different approaches. For example, I could say that "In order to survive for one second, I'll need the general mass of my body to stay intact; to survive for a few minutes, I'll need air to breathe; to survive for a few days, I'll need water to drink", which then seems to work through most of Maslow's hierarchy of needs in order to get the civilization required for stable life-saving organizations such as the supply-chains which hospitals depend on. But as we start getting to more than ~50 years from now, then we start getting into the odder options; for example, I'm a fully-fledged real-world cryonicist, and not too long ago wrote up a revival-request document which I hope increases my odds of being alive at some future n even if I'm dead during some intermediate n's. :)

Probably the biggest items needing change, in order to handle high n's, are better biomedical techniques so my own body doesn't kill me of old age (and/or I can be fixed up if it does), and better large-scale-organizational strategies that so that my civilization can handle existential risks.
