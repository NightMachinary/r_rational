I know of at least one cryonicist who is planning on something close to burying rare coins at an unmarked but memorable location; and there has been some discussion about using "brainwallets" to hold onto some number of Bitcoin.

In the novel "Tomorrow and Tomorrow", the protagonist interviews musicians, publishes some of the results, and strongly hints that he had lots of unpublished info before cryopreserving himself.

Cryonicists are diverse enough in varied ways that even trying to make such a requirement would result in the opening of a new cryo organization that lacked such a rule.
