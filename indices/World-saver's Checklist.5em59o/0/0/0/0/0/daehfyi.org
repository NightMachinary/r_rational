As far as I've been able to tell, I'm the first and so-far-only person to have publicly discussed making such a document, so it's almost certain that you're remembering me. :) I've sent my final draft off to my cryo provider, and also keep a copy online [[https://www.datapacrat.com/temp/cryo-revive-1.txt][here]].

If you know of any other such texts, I'd like to read them, too. :)
