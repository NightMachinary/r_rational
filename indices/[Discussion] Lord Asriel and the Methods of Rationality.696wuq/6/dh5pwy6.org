Yeah, it's definitely a problem with HDM that I only really noticed after I started my journey toward Transhumanism.

Rational!Golden Compass would be really interesting, to me, and I'd love to see Lyra as a rationalist, where Asriel and Coulter represent two potential failure modes of rationality and the anti-death value is included as well as the anti-God one. But the biggest hurdle is the titular Golden Compass itself... when you have a device (and by extension, sentient all-knowing magic particles) that can answer any question you pose to them, a rational protagonist has the potential for explosive munchkinry unless some major parts of the lore/world are altered from canon.
