  you think r!Lyra wouldn't be able to use it instinctively from the beginning?

I think it depends on how rational Lyra is, and why. Rationality, if one is fully committed, has a certain ruthlessness about it that seems fundamentally incompatible with innocence. It's hard to imagine, for example, anyone "childlike" [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/ur/crisis_of_faith/][deliberately provoking a crisis of faith]] just to make sure they held empirically true beliefs. Then again, it's not too hard to imagine a precocious child who thinks they know everything about rationality, but who hasn't ever been in a situation where they needed to apply it.

It would be very moving, I think, if Lyra had a shock (maybe the death of the boy at the end of the first book) that required her to apply all her rationalist art, and thereby lost the ability to read the alethiometer much earlier than in the source material. Or, maybe even better, if the alethiometer itself told her she had to use rational thinking to prevent some bad thing, and as a result she lost access to its answers. It's narrative necessity, I think, that rational!Lyra's childhood end suddenly and traumatically. Which is a real shame when you consider how nicely and gently source Lyra's did.
