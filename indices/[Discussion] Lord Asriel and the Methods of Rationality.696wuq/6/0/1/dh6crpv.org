Hmm. I remember her losing the ability to use it at the end of the series, but you think r!Lyra wouldn't be able to use it instinctively from the beginning?

Also I forget, was it ever cleared up whether ANY child could use it that way, and everyone was just ignorant of that until Lyra picked one up, or if it was something special about her as well as the fact that she was a child?
