In defense of HDM...just because death is bad doesn't mean that someone can't be considered hubristic or even evil for their own particular, flawed implementation. While immortality is a goal and a prize, that doesn't mean that any steps taken toward that goal are justified. The difficulty of implementation and high stakes also mean that more corners are likely to be cut in some kind of direct A to B search for immortality than there would in some large but better scoped goal, such as implementing universal health care.
