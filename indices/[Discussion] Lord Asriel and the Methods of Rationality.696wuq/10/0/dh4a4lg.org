Rationalism is a /meta/epistemology. Transhumanism isn't a part of rationalism per se, rationalists just happen to usually be transhumanist because transhumanism is right. If death was a good thing and living longer could only make us suffer, then there would be more rationalists who weren't transhumanists.

Just like how if biological evolution was a hoax, there wouldn't be so many scientists who believe it's real.
