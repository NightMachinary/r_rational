Lol. Right, like there aren't any hidden biases or confounding variables between rationalism and transhumanism. It's not like Eliezer Yudkowsky, the person whose fictional story led, albeit indirectly, to the creation of this subreddit, is an avowed transhumanist or anything. No, you figured it out from first principles, because being a rationalist makes you infallible, and you are a transhumanist, and therefore transhumanism is correct.

That's a good one. Tell me another.
