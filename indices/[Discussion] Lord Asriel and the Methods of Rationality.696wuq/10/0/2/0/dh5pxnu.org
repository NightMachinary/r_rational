Let's keep this civil please.

Obviously I'm not saying I'm infallible. But you don't need to be infallible to be right about something that's blatantly obvious in retrospect which most people are totally wrong about. Case in point, most people are religious and think that faith is a good thing. And just because I didn't figure this one out on my own doesn't mean that I'm just blindly agreeing with EY. Some things really are obvious once someone is thinking critically about them instead of blindly accepting common wisdom.
