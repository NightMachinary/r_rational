That's great, but you completely missed or avoided the central point of my argument. I'll rewrite the relevant portions, so there's no misunderstanding:

There are hidden biases and confounding variables between rationalism and transhumanism. Eliezer Yudkowsky, the person whose fictional story led, albeit indirectly, to the creation of this subreddit, is an avowed transhumanist. Trying to pretend otherwise ("transhumanists just happen to usually be rationalists") is factually incorrect.

Additionally, I'm rather concerned that you're taking an opinion and treating it as fact. "Transhumanism is right" is exactly as defensible as "feminism is right" or "social democracy is right", or "patriotism is right".

On top of that, you're basically using majority consensus to prop up your argument, with a dash of appeal to authority. "A lot of smart people believe it, therefore it must be true."

Between this and the heavy [[/r/rational/comments/5as909/spoilers_doctor_strange_is_the_antirational_movie/d9jc7we/][hero-worship of EY]], I'm quite disappointed with this community of so-called rational thinkers.
