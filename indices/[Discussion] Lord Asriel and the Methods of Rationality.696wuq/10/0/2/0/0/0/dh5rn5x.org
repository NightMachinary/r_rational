When a bunch of smart people believe something that doesn't automatically make it true but it does make it more likely.

Also there are some facts that are so completely obvious that people think they need more justification than is actually necessary because they've deceived themselves into believing something else, or they've been indoctrinated into it. If almost everyone you'd ever known always told you the sky is made of rainbow sprinkles ever since you were a child you'd probably believe it even if it was really obvious that it wasn't if you just looked. Likewise, if everyone you'd ever known always told you that death was a good thing and it was inherently morally wrong not to die at some point and that letting people live as long as they want to if possible was evil ever since you were a child, then you'd probably believe that too.

Just because EY was the first person I observed pointing out how silly those claims are doesn't mean that I only agree with him because he says it.

What specific biases do you think are being exhibited in rationalism and transhumanism, and how?
