I'm not convinced that a rationalists necessarily have to be a transhumanist. I am a transhumanist, but I see that as a rational implication of my values rather than my heuristics. Transhumanism is a logical consequence of utilitarian humanism, but I don't know of any requirement that you must be a utilitarian humanist to be a rationalist. It's a moral philosophy that I believe is good, but I don't think it's fair to say you can't be considered rational if you don't subscribe to it.
