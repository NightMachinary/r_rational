You underestimate the power of a cultural shift. I think it would be sufficient.

"Several highly trained people" and "it's quick" means that cryonics is about as hard to implement as the most minor of surgical procedures that require anesthesia, or comparable to the level of medical care that people receive /in the ambulance on the way to the hospital/. Medical teams in the OR and ER learn many such procedures, and, if much of our entire society where deeply interested in cryonics (such that, when someone died in a hospital and wasn't frozen, their relatives would write an angry op-ed and the papers would publish it - a sequence of events that might happen at the 5-10% sign-up level) they'd learn that one too.

With 5-10% of the population signed up with the idea that cryonics is worth trying, you get near-universal /availability/ of the procedure over the entire west and much of China and India. At 70%, it has become the dominant belief about death, causality, and the afterlife in those regions of sub-sahara Africa currently torn apart by religious struggles, and they start trying to save people with automotive antifreeze, old bike tires, and $5 dewars distributed by charity groups.
