Yeah, that's a billion dollars to store every head of every dead person...for one year. Then you need another billion dollars to store next year's heads, and another plot of land to drop them on, and, and...

And the reason you need specifically a dialysis machine is perfusion. Draining all blood from the major arteries and veins is pretty easy: cut someone's jugular and their own heart will do a significant fraction of the work for you. But we aren't trying to do that. We're trying to preserve the most complicated neural networking computer currently known to exist, and in order to do that, the antifreeze absolutely /must/ go everywhere. Every vein and artery, every microscopic capillary, every single fragment of the maze that is the circulatory system must be flushed, if you fail the patient gets numerous clots in the brain, which at the very least would significantly cut down on the number of options for revival, and at worst could make it impossible if they didn't know about those clots as the attempt proceeded. The only way to do this is slowly and carefully. Additional pressure just ruptures the capillaries and gives your patient countless tiny aneyurisms, you can't accelerate the process. Dialysis machines clean all of the blood, and therefore they are designed to carefully pull blood out and put it back in at exactly the pressures that the body's systems can withstand, no more and no less.

So unfortunately, there's no way to simplify the process.

By the way, would you happen to be an engineer?

Edit: Actually, I'm remembering this wrong. It's not a dialysis machine you need, it's a heart - lung bypass machine. Some /hospitals/ don't have those, mostly smaller rural ones who expect to air evac anyone who might need them. A heart - lung bypass machine is the one which can perfuse fluids through the entire circulatory system without a functioning heart. These machines are...not really simplifiable. You could remove the 'lung' part, but the heart part is the toughest bit.
