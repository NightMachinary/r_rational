A billion of dollars per year isn't that munch money for the world and de are already buriying a important part of this people, the amount of money and Solace neccesary is big but we are already spending a smaller but not multiple orders of magnitude smaller amount of money and space in funerals , buriying people , caring for terminally ill people.I expect cryonics to become way cheaper if it becomes mainstream and big companies start offering cryonics services and spending millions in research and development .I'm sure the world is spending absurdly bigger amounts of money on sillier things than potentially saving the life's of a big percentage of the people that die, and if most people actually wanted cryonics I think our current economy Is perfectly capable to eventually giving them cryonics like it was perfectly capable of gradually giving most of them other things.
