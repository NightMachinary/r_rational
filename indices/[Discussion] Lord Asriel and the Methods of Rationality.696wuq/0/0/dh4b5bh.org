I'd like to know how long a life is too long. They don't have to be specific about it, I'd be fine with a ballpark figure.

But how long is too long? 100 years? 200? 1,000? 10,000? 1,000,000? Can these pro-death people pick any finite time and say, "Yep, this is definitely far too long to live."?

When I was younger, I couldn't imagine being old. Mind you, I only recently turned 28, but 10 years ago the idea of being 100 and still wanting to live flummoxed me. Why would anyone want to live when they were old and frail and needed help toileting, eating, etc.?

Well, turns out that when you're in that situation you don't suddenly start wanting to die (though untreated depression is distressingly common in the elderly). And that's with our current quality of aged life. Imagine if you didn't lose mobility, dexterity, and cognition as you aged. Would a fit and healthy 200 year old beg for death? What if they were 1,000, 10,000, or 1,000,000? When would such a person decide they wanted to die?

And what if they never made that decision, if they just went on and on until the heat death of the universe, or even beyond? Would that somehow be a terrible thing? I've never seen a good argument that it would be.

Humanists who oppose immortality annoy me so much, because they're /so close/ to the revelation. Ask them if they're happy about any specific unwilling death. With such an example, figure out what their problem is.

Was the person "evil"? Well, what if that person was rehabilitated?

Were they in pain or otherwise hurting? What if they were treated?

Were they significantly impaired, unable to do the things they wanted to do? What if we fixed their bodies/minds, or provided alternate means?

Point is, eventually you'll figure out that their criterion for the acceptability of a death isn't really related to age. It may be things that are related to age (like infirmity and senility), but age on its own is scarcely relevant.

But they don't seem to make that leap themselves, to tease apart their feelings about age from their feelings about death. That frustrates me, especially when otherwise moral people seem to be totally okay with somebody dying.
