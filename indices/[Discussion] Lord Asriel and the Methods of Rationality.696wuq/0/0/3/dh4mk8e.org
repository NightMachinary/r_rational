Beyond the heat death of the universe?

Gotta love how these discussions always hit the point where godlike powers are invoked. This is also missing the point.

If a being has the power of a god, then I would hope that immortality is okay. Presumably, they also have the wisdom to use it (and all the accompanying powers) responsibly. And if they don't, our little discussion isn't likely to matter to them.

On the other hand, lacking the powers of a god, mortality is assured. The "pro-death" crowd, as you call them, generally aren't arguing that people should die, or that old people need to die; rather, it's a belief that we should come to accept death when the inevitability is upon us rather than rage against it. This should never be a value judgement for other people, but a way to assess our own morals.

The fundamental question is how far someone should go to extend their existence?

And for bonus points, in what circumstances should we violate the "Do Not Resuscitate" wishes of patients?
