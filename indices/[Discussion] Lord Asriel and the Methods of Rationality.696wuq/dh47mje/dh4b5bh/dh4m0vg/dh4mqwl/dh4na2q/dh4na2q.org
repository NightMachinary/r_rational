I doubt that's possible just from a logistical perspective. Cryonics on death requires several highly trained people to perform specific actions within less than a minute to work properly, and those people have to be already there when you die. This means they are either waiting for you to die, or you are chosing euthanasia. There isn't really a way to get enough people trained to perform the procedures for absolutely every person dying even in a nursing home or hospital, much less in accidents or at home.

Barring some insane-to-expect cultural, economic, and technological advances, we can't realistically attempt to save everyone this way.
