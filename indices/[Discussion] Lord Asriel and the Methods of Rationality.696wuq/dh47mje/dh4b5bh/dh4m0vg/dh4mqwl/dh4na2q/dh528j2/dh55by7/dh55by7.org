  the level of medical care that people receive /on the ambulance on the way to the hospital./

Heh, no. I'm an EMT, and the procedure required for proper vitrifaction of a human brain is /far/ more involved and requires far more expensive equipment than currently exists in the EMS sphere. Cycling all the blood out of the body and replacing it with antifreeze requires a dialysis machine, and even with current technology those things are large, bulky, and very finicky to move and operate safely. In addition, the trucks which actually transport a prepared body to be stored in liquid nitrogen are equipped almost nothing at all like ambulances.

Also, the fact of the matter is that human bodies take up a ton of space. You know how the catacombs of Paris are a labyrinthine boneyard? Imagine that but every body is fully intact and must be kept under liquid nitrogen at all times, and the nitrogen must be refilled at a constant rate that increases for each additional bit of volume the crypt comprises. It would be a /gargantuan/ engineering challenge to create enough space to store even ten people per minute worldwide. That's over 5.25 /million/ bodies per year, and that's only saving 10% of people.

And all of this is ignoring the fact that /we have no idea if this will even work./ Which tends to discourage people from spending thousands of dollars on life insurance to hand over to a cryogenic freezing charity.
