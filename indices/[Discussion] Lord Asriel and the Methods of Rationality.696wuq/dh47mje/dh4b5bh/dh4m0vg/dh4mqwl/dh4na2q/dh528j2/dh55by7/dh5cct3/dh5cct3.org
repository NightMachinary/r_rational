Sorry for the poor assumption Re: Cryonics and EMS. It is not offered in my area, so I had not read about the implementation details...

Which is just as well. I sincerely doubt that contemporary cryonics is using very efficient tools. For instance, it would seem that for /replacing/ blood rather than filtering it, a dialysis machine is the wrong tool, and if we had a market for a million of these operations per year, you'd get a simpler and cheaper purpose-built tool. Perhaps an open loop injection machine.

As for the cryocrypt: tunnels are for transit; tanks are for storage. 52 million heads fit in 30 or so medium sized (IE, 20m tall x 20m dia) insulated tanks, kept cold with maybe 50 megawatts of electricity. An unusual chemical installation, to be sure, being focused on storage rather than production... but probably less that a billion dollars to construct. Call it 5 billion to fund future maintenance and... well, it's still a tiny amount of money.
