This is absolutely true, and I see way too much of that at work. However, that is for the most part by choice. People scrabble for every chance at survival no matter what, no matter the pain, not even considering for an instant that death might be preferable. Maybe because they know that they /don't want to die/, no matter their protestations that immortality would be terrible.

You are completely correct that everyone wants to be immortal and just won't admit it to themselves. And I don't think we should deny people that. Usually there is no hope of course, we overtreat the stage four cancer or amputate the last limb of the diabetic, but that doesn't mean people should be forced into a position where there's no hope at all. I do think choice is valuable.

And sometimes, people choose pain before death. I can't begrudge them that.
