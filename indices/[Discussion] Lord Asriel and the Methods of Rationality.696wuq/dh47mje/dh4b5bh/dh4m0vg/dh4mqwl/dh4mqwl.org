Well, there is cryonics. But i suppose that isn't actually possible for most people, not even considering how many people could do it but won't.

Actually, has anyone ever done or seen an estimate of how many people we could hypothetically put through cryonics given a 100% willing humanity? Could we theoretically save everyone in that scenario?
