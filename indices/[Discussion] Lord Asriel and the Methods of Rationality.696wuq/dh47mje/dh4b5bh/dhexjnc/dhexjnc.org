Reasons not to want to live forever: 1) being alone (obviously if immortality was large-scale this is mitigated) 2) infirmity (as we age so does our body, and they aren't really designed to last even 100 years at present, although they can... I guess this would be solved if someone managed to crack eternal youth or something) 3) overpopulation 4) lack of resources (both of these solvable by terraforming...I guess? to be honest though, resource distribution already sucks with the current number of people on the planet, I couldn't see it being more equal if more people were vying for it) 5) lack of societal change. Can you imagine if people from 500 years ago were still alive today? We already have enough problems with generational political shifts, aka old people being in favour of more traditionalist values while young people are generally more liberal/ left-wing. There would be more of a problem of horrible old fashioned values sticking around (based on my country: views on women, people of colour, people of other religions including the 'wrong' strain of christianity, slavery, war, medicine, philosophy...) How could we overcome this barrier? 6) related to the above: sometimes dictatorial regimes only end with the old-age death of the dictator (cf: Franco in Spain). Immortality = the people under Franco would have been stuck under Franco. Indefinitely.
