I'd argue that when available, cryonic suspension (basically reversible death) is strictly preferable to death no matter what, since you get all the benefits that death would provide, plus the possibility of revival later on.

Of course, there are some situations in which this might conceivably lead to a worse outcome, such as the "hell" scenario where your torturers revive you in order to inflict more pain on you--but in such cases you're unlikely to have the option of cryonic suspension available in the first place. Hence, the "when available" qualifier I placed at the beginning of this comment. (Not to mention the fact that outright death probably /also/ won't be available to you as an option in such situations, making the point a mostly moot one.)
