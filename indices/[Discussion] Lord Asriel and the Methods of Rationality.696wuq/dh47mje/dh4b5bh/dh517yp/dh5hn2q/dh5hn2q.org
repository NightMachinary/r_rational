I think it only really makes sense when you predict that the future is expected to hold net negative utility for you.

E.g. if the "fire and brimstone" hell was real and you ended up in it, any satisfaction you derive from life would probably be heavily outweighed by all the torment.

In a more practical example, suicide makes sense as a desire for people who are depressed. That's not to say it's a good idea; depression is frequently treatable, and if you haven't given treatment a genuine attempt because you believe it won't work, any prediction about the future is unfounded.

So while I'd say suicidal ideation is almost always a poor solution, the error of logic is the lack of other attempted solutions, not the desire to die in the face of an expected lifetime of agony.
