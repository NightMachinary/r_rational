It makes no sense to me to wish for oblivion/nonexistence. If that's what you expect after death, then death is unquestionably the worst thing that could happen to you.

Even the Bible is not a fan of death. Right back at the beginning, Adam and Eve are told not to eat the fruit because why? /They'll die if they do/. The most positive thing the book says about death is that it has been defeated and is therefore less scary. Indeed, Paul indicated that if it weren't for the hope of resurrection - in other words, eternal life with perfect health, as you say - then Christians would be the most miserable people on earth.
