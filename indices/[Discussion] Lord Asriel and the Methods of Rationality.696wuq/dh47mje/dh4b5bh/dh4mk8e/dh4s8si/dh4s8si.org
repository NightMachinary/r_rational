  Beyond the heat death of the universe?

  Gotta love how these discussions always hit the point where godlike powers are invoked.
#+end_quote

I'm not presupposing the existence of such an outcome. I included the possibility for completeness.

  The "pro-death" crowd, as you call them, generally aren't arguing that people should die, or that old people need to die;
#+end_quote

In the linked video, Stephen Fry said that an infinite life would have no meaning. Assuming he thinks that meaning is a good thing for a life to have, he would appear to be arguing that death is good as a concept.

  rather, it's a belief that we should come to accept death when the inevitability is upon us rather than rage against it.
#+end_quote

I agree. That doesn't mean that we shouldn't take steps to delay that stage for as many people as possible. If we could push that date back to hundreds or thousands of years, should we then complain that humans are simply living too long?

#+begin_quote
  The fundamental question is how far someone should go to extend their existence?
#+end_quote

As far as they can without impeding on the ability of others to do the same, or until the point at which they do not wish to go on. This is what humans currently do, and have been doing for a hundred thousand years, only we've been limited to decades for most of that time.

#+begin_quote
  And for bonus points, in what circumstances should we violate the "Do Not Resuscitate" wishes of patients?
#+end_quote

When those wishes were not made in sound mind. What would qualify for that situation is a question for psychologists and lawyers, but in general if somebody has an untreated mental illness or is being coerced, the DNR shouldn't be accepted.

The issue gets murkier if somebody has a mental illness and has been offered and informed of treatment, but declined. Even if you accept their refusal of treatment, you may not want to grant their request for euthanasia. Again, this is probably a question for the experts.
