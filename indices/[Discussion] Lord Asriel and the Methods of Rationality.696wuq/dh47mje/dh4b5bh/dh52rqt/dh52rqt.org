I think I have a very precise answer for you!

"Eternal life" gets either boring or disturbing when it passes the functional Busy Beaver number for universe simulations containing everything in our Hubble Sphere. There exists an amount of time where the universe itself must end or enter a loop (probably a boring loop like everything being so far from everything else there is no meaningful interaction). I'm not sure if that is a close enough ballpark for you, but, while the busy beaver number is incomputable in general, it is computable for specific numbers, one of which I've supplied (essentially). Or (for those of you more interested in complex loops) when all usable energy I could possibly interact with has been exhausted and there is some maximal entropy state for my hubble sphere. Since that is likely the longest we could get this machine to go, it is assuredly a boring fate.

Certainly at that point I, as a constituent element of the universe, would not have any particular time preference -- more time would by definition go unnoticed by me (as the noticing part of my brain would be in a loop as well), and I cannot fathom how I would prefer an unchanged and unnoticed loop over an end.
