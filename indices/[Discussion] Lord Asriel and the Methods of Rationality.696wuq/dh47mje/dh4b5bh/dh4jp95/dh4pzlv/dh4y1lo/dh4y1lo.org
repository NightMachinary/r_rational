Actually that figure indicates the number of connections possible between the neurons in the brain. So 2^{{#} ^{of} ^{neurons} ^{in} ^{the} ^{brain}} indicates the number of every possible brain that can ever exist which is a vastly larger space than the space of all possible human minds in every possible environment.

Just to make it clear how that figure was reached, let's say that you have 2 neurons, then there is only two ways the neuron can connect to each other (there is a connection or no connection). Add one for 3 neurons, then there are 8 different connections (8 different groups with unique ways to connect or not connect the neurons). Continuing the pattern leads to 4 neurons-16 connections, 5 neurons-32 connections. According to this pattern, the group of possible brain states apparently doubles for every neuron added.

EDIT: I made a mathematical mistake earlier with the numbers and did a little editing.
