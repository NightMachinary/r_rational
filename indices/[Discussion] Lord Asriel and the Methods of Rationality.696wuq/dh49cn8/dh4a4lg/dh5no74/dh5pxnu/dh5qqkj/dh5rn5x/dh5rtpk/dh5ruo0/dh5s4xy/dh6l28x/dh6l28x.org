In some sense you can say that transhumanism is "true" if you are talking about people that have the same preferences , if two persons have the same values (and most people do have similar values )one can be wrong about how much a future state of the universe rates in their "utility function" (yes human preferences aren't consistent whit any utility function but you know what I mean) especially because of things like cognitive dissonance , some people maybe have different values (but at least things like the death is bad part of transhumanism seem to be based in values that are common in most humans , otherwise they wouldn't invent religion ) and things like transhumanism aren't the kind of things people normally use the word true for, so what Sailor Vulcan said does sound kind of weird( but I'm not sure if I understand or agree whith the distintion you are making between "facts" and "opinion") , and yes its true that the argument that something is more likely to be true because one group of people believes in it its only valid if you think that group of people is less biased than the other side of the discussion, and i think that its reasonable that you don't think that's the case with rationalists and transhumanism. But I do have a problem with you apparently judging a whole community based on (apparently) almost no evidence. Also saying "And you're still not hearing me" is clearly not helpful if you think someone isn't understanding something about your argument you tell them what you think they aren't understanding.
