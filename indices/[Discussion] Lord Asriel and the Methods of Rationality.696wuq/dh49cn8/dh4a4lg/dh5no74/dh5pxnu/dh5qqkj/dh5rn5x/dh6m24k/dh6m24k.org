So I think the issue under contention is that there are a lot more possible explanations for a correlation between tranhumanism (philosophy encouraging directed evolution) and rationalism (set of heuristics which are slower but more rigorous than our evolution-granted heuristics) than just "rationalist techniques encourage transhumanist beliefs". For example:\\
- transhumanist beliefs encourage use of rationalist techniques\\
- transhumanists who don't use rationalist techniques don't participate in [[/r/rational][r/rational]]\\
- rationalists who don't share transhumanist beliefs don't participate in [[/r/rational][r/rational]]\\
- participation in [[/r/rational][r/rational]] encourages use of rationalist techniques and transhumanist beliefs

Given my light participation in this subreddit, I am in no place to make meaningful observations about which if any of the above possible factors are actually in play.
