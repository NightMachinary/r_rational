I still think it's about values. In general, I've found rationality very good at arguing over ways to optimize values, but utterly useless at changing the values people wish to optimize. For instance, I intrinsically value human autonomy so I oppose requiring all cars to be self-driving even though I want people to always use the safer option and know that allowing them not to will put people at greater risk than it would otherwise.

I have a fundamental philosophical view on what the relationship between humans and technology should be and aim to optimize that belief since I consider it morally right. I know all the completely rational reasons people have to believe otherwise, but I still believe in what I do. I've seen the same thing happen in arguments over religion. People do not change what they see as right and wrong, only how they serve their morals.

I think anyone who became a utilitarian humanist is someone who never intrinsically valued anything except reducing human suffering in the first place. Meanwhile, people like me who intrinsically value other things and get accused of being poser rationalists. I don't think that's a useful worldview since evidence, as catalogued in /The Righteous Mind/ by Jonathan Haidt, indicates that rationality can't change someone's values.
