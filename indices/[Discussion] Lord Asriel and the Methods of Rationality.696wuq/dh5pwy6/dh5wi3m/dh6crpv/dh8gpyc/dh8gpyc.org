I honestly don't know. Supposedly it was the onset of puberty that removed Lyra's ability to intuitively use the alethiometer. She was a very intelligent, cunning girl even in canon, so it's not like her ability came from naivety or innocence.

Also, I remember there being an Effulgence arc set in the HDM-universe, so if you haven't, maybe look at that as something relevant?
