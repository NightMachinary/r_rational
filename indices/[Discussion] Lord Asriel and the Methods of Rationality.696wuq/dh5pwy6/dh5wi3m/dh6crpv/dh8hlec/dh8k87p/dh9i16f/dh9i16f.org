Yeah. I can't think of any really great ideas for Will, just a bunch of okay ones.

Their roles could be reversed, with Will being the emotional one and moral compass. I kind of like the idea of Lyra as the ruthless goal-achiever and Will as the voice of restraint. But I think running with this too far would uninteresting. You'd end up with Will as a passive conscience for Lyra, and he was definitely more than that.

Will could mentor Lyra, since his world has more advanced science than hers. This seems like a better fit for their relationship in the source material, but I'm not sure it would be all that useful. Lyra's world already has the scientific method, so her mind's in the right place, and ~1850s or so level technology, iirc. Apart from teaching her about germ theory and washing her hands, maybe some basic chemistry, I'm not sure there's a ton of knowledge that Will would have that Lyra wouldn't that two fleeing children without infrastructure could take advantage of. Then again, Lyra wouldn't have learned the best knowledge available to her world. If her training skewed more toward philosophy or the humanities, and Will had attended a science school or something, then she could teach him about rationality and thinking and he could teach her about empiricism and experimentation. That could be a fruitful relationship, I think.

It would be important to make sure Will couldn't read the compass, unless the story is just the two of them munchkining their way through everything. I don't remember if he could in the books--I think he was a few years older than Lyra, so maybe not?--but either way, he needs to be worldly enough that this isn't possible for him.
