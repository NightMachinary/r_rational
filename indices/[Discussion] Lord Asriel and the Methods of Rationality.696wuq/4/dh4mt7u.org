Honestly the thing that always bothered me about His Dark Materials is that it's /so/ much the anti-Narnia that it kind of feels like it falls into the same traps to me? Like, it's definitely nowhere near as bad as Narnia's shouting "THE LION IS JESUS" in your ear every five seconds, but it still kind of feels to me like it's more allegorical than it needs to be to tell a good story. :/
