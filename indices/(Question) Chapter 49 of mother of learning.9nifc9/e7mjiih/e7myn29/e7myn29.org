From chapter 26,

The matriarch told Zach that she could bring people into the loop, and Red Robe read Zach's mind. This was a lie that was meant to trick Red Robe. You can tell that the trick worked and that he really is concerned about it, because of his line, "But I'm not as violent and unreasonable as I might first appear, you know? If you tell me the names of other people the aranea have brought into the time loop, I promise I will leave you alone"
