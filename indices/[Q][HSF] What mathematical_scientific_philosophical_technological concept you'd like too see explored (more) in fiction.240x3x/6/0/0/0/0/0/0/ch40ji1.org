  This is the kind of threat that I spend my life thinking about

Are you Nick Bostrom?

  Luckily there's nothing standing in the way of option #1 but most governments and the richest industries in history! With such feeble opposition, we actually stand a chance...

Ah. Ha. Ha.

I mean, on the /upside/, we /can/ beat the industries and governments into at least /partially/ pricing ecological hazards into the markets, just by getting /subsidies/ to damaging activities /stopped/, and even doing that has, in a lot of places, led to rapid adoption of Earth-friendlier things like renewable energy, efficiency measures, etc.

But yeah, this kind of consideration is why I'm clandestinely studying stuff off the MIRI curriculum in hope of helping to hurry the fuck up and make an FAI /before/ the nasty consequences of the status-up hit the fan, let alone grey goo or UFAI.

Because goddamnit, I have had /quite enough/ of hearing from all the Very Serious People that the world is going to end within my lifetime, all the real decisions were made before I was born, and there's jack-shit I can do about it. Oh, and that even if I /wanted/ to do something, there's no jobs.

Disregard collapse; acquire utopia.
