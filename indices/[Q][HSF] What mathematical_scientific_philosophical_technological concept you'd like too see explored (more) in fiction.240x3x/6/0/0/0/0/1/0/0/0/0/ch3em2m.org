So clearly the welfare of non-human animals is not your primary concern. Now apply whatever justification you use to eat any meat to justify getting ourselves off this rock and into space. If you want to keep Earth's biosphere as a pet, you can do it on your own time. I'd rather change myself to not be reliant on it. The big smashy rock is coming, and we need to be gone by then either way.

As a separate issue: Domesticated meat animals have a pretty sweet gig. In principle, they don't live in fear of starving when they can't find food, getting infested with parasites, dying of illness, dying of hypothermia or dehydration, going extinct, competing for mates, being ripped open and eaten alive by large predatory animals, getting injured and slowly lingering to death over weeks... in principle they get to live full risk-free lives free of pain and suffering up until the point the gem in their palms turns red and they immediately die, again without suffering, in an instant.

In practice of course, businesses need to make a profit, and the physical welfare of animals who lack the capacity to suffer in many of the ways that humans do, is not a significant concern. So they get jammed into tiny cages, and yes I would prefer even animals not to suffer, so if I have a choice between two meat companies, one who causes more animal suffering than the other, I will choose the company whose meat has less suffering. To argue that all meat eating should be stopped on some kind of ethical grounds is to suggest that an entire species should be neglected to death, or worse returned to the wild, which is an extinction event in either case. Leaving animals at the cruel whims of nature rather than caring for them and using them to feed humans, is the /least/ ethical choice being considered.
