You may enjoy the anime series /Spice & Wolf/, as well as its spiritual successor (whose name I can't remember), in which a (rather busty, be warned of fanservice) demon queen undergoes an arranged marriage to a JRPG hero in order to bring an end to the war between demons and humans... by forging political alliances, spreading education, improving technology, and helping the economy in ways that act to shut down the sociopolitical interests benefiting from war.

EDIT: To clarify, their basically both, "THEY DID THEIR RESEARCH! The series!"
