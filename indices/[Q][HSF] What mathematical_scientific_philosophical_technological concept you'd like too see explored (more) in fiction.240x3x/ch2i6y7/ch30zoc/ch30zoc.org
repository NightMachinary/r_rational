I'm curious what you think would be interesting to read about that. Is it the description of space travel, how they prepare and talk about it working, how they deal with and predict potential problems, or something else entirely?

To me, it seems unlikely to make a story more interesting unless it was simple mentioning the ideas worked into the plot somehow to make it more realistic, rather than tons of detail someone might need to know if they were actually involved in it. But then again, I'm not hugely into the technical details of things like that.
