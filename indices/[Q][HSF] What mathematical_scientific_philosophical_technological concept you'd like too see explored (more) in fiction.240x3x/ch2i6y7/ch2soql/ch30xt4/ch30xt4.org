The magic doesn't quite work like that. Every person is sheathed in an Array which is basically just a "hands-off, no instakillz" plot device, so the 4D fights are about movement and positioning in 4D. The battlefield is 4D, not the characters. Don't worry, Arrays break down in extremely high levels of power, so there are fights like the one you described as well.
