Actual complex messed of truly convoluted decision theory and related concepts, but just bite-size scenarios illustrating specific problems, and with experts-by-repeated-experience exploiting the hell out of it, not highly intelligent amateurs discovering it and trying to isolate the mess in order to be able to use it.

If you've read it, something that is to newcomb's problem and the "do not mess with time" incident as David Brin's "kiln people" is to the generic single teleporter non-deletion plot. Except rationalist.

Or; time travel as complex as in Homestuck, but it's all very strictly realistic timelike curves, and everyone actually makes good munchkinn-y use of it.
