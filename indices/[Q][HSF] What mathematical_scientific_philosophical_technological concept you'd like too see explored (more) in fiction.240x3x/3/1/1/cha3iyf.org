Yep, definitely Greg Egan, from what I've heard. /Orthogonal/ has been on my list for a while, but I haven't started it. The chief concept behind the universe there is that spacetime has a (1,1,1,1) metric instead of (-1,1,1,1). Check out the website [[http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/ORTHOGONAL/ORTHOGONAL.html][here]]. There, Egan basically re-derives all of undergraduate physics in this new system to lay out what the universe is like.

Some highlights:

- If you actualize the same setup for the Twin Paradox in our universe, the traveling "twin" ages more quickly, not more slowly. [[#s][Slight premise spoilers I've gleaned from Egan's site:]]
- Two charged particles (regardless of sign) have multiple (countably infinitely many) points of equilibrium at nonzero distances. And these equilibria are /stable/. Contrast with our universe, in which two particles either repel forever or attract forever (well, until they collide). This seems to make for interesting electron lattice structures in electronics, though of course I'm fuzzing on the details.
- The speed of light is not A) a universal speed limit or B) constant for different frequencies of light. Because of B), stars look like rainbow smears instead of white pinpricks: When the star moves from point A to B, the slower frequencies emitted at point A reach us simultaneously with faster frequencies emitted from point B.

Basically, the world sounds cool as fuck. It's on my reading list for this summer.
