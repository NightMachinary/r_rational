Stephen Baxter tends to be fairly hard. Hard enough that supersymmetry is a major plot point in some of his Xeelee stuff.

But I'm also going to second the recommendation for Greg Egan for brutally hard SF.

First read Incandescence by Greg Egan.

Then read the Orthogonal Trilogy. (Well, the third book isn't out yet, but...)
