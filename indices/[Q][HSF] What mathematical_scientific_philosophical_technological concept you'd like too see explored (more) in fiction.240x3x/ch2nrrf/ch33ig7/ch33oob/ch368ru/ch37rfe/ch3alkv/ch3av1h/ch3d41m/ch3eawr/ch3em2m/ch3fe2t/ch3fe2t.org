  Now apply whatever justification you use to eat any meat to justify getting ourselves off this rock and into space.

YES, I MOTHERFUCKING AGREE WE NEED TO GET OFF THIS ROCK. CAPSLOCK FOR YELLING! IF I COULD HAVE BUILT A SPACE COLONY I WOULD HAVE DONE SO LAST YEAR!

  As a separate issue: Domesticated meat animals have a pretty sweet gig. In principle, they don't live in fear of starving when they can't find food, getting infested with parasites, dying of illness, dying of hypothermia or dehydration, going extinct, competing for mates, being ripped open and eaten alive by large predatory animals, getting injured and slowly lingering to death over weeks... in principle they get to live full risk-free lives free of pain and suffering up until the point the gem in their palms turns red and they immediately die, again without suffering, in an instant.

  In practice of course, businesses need to make a profit, and the physical welfare of animals who lack the capacity to suffer in many of the ways that humans do, is not a significant concern. So they get jammed into tiny cages, and yes I would prefer even animals not to suffer, so if I have a choice between two meat companies, one who causes more animal suffering than the other, I will choose the company whose meat has less suffering. To argue that all meat eating should be stopped on some kind of ethical grounds is to suggest that an entire species should be neglected to death, or worse returned to the wild, which is an extinction event in either case. Leaving animals at the cruel whims of nature rather than caring for them and using them to feed humans, is the least ethical choice being considered.

And these arguments are why, given that kashrut already forbids hunting /wild/ animals, I feel /ethically uncertain/ about meat-eating. It's a bit like house-elves, except that we completely and utterly mistreat the poor creatures even more than house-elves.

It's not just a matter of /less suffering/, it's a matter of the fact that the animals don't actually enjoy themselves at all. I don't support shoving /people/ into tiny cubicles and extracting maximum productivity from them, so why /should/ I support doing to animals what I won't even do to people? And logically, if I want /people/ to live nice eudaimonic lives, then at least as long as I eat meat at all instead of /destroying/ the Subspecies Who Should Never Have Been, then I should probably be eating free-range meat, too, except that I can't actually afford that on a grad-student's budget.

We could just give them nice lives /without/ eating them, but then somehow people feel like there's something wrong because /we're/ not getting anything out of it, and those darned animals are so /different/ from us that this is somehow unacceptable.
