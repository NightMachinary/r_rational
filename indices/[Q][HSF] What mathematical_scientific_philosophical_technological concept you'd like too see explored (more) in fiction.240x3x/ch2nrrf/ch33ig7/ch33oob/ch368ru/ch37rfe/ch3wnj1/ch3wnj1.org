I actually think this is usually an overblown assertion - most ecological disasters could be catastrophic (like, reset the past ~20,000 years of human progress), but they're not an existential threat on the level of grey goo or UFAI.

This is the kind of threat that I spend my life thinking about, and the best options are (1) avert disaster; (2) see 1 as it will continue to get worse; (3) resilience; or (4) run away. The problem is that as you go along each option loses more of what's valuable, so best is to have dealt with environmental problems as we learn about them. If not, at least avoid irreversible tipping points. Or at least try to have a resilient system of, say, Von Neuman repraps so you can restart from 1990 instead of 20K BCE. Failing that, hope that the problems are limited to earth and we have self-sufficient colonies elsewhere (not really an option).

Luckily there's nothing standing in the way of option #1 but most governments and the richest industries in history! With such feeble opposition, we actually stand a chance...
