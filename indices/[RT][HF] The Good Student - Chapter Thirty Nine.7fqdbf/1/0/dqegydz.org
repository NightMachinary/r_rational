I feel similarly. There were many hints regarding this: how she managed to evade the Secret Service agent in [[http://gravitytales.com/novel/the-good-student/tgs-chapter-25][Chapter 25]], her mysterious agelessness, the hidden room. The revelation that there were two demons in the world left us with only two reasonable guesses regarding who she is: a demon, or Winnum Roke, and the latter was jossed in Simole's second chapter.

But her act was pretty good. Almost HPMoR!Quirrel-level.
