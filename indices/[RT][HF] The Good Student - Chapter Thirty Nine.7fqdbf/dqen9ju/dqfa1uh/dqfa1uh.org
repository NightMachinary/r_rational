Well, Nic was extremely confident that the demon would never guess it, /and/ he researched demons' mental blindspots. In particular, [[http://gravitytales.com/novel/the-good-student/tgs-chapter-31][Chapter 31]] has the following passages:

#+begin_quote
  Demons saw humans as fragile and unstable. They found it entertaining. It made them feel superior. <...> What Nic had started to see was not a better understanding of demons, but a realisation of how poorly demons understood humans. <...> Their view of what frailty meant was incorrect, in his opinion. They couldn't grasp that even though a craftsman working with inferior materials might never produce anything of value, if he did, it would only be possible by developing skills far superior to those of someone gifted with the ideal training and tools.

  *Nic:* Some problems require extreme solutions. Short term ones.

  *Mr. Delcroix:* Nic, it never hurts to know more. Even if it doesn't help you, it can help others. The great advantage of a cooperative society like ours is the ability to combine small advances into big ones.

  *Nic:* The demons don't think like that. They place no value in individual achievements. Everything is already as advanced as it can be, they just distribute it to the best available exponent.

I'm not quite sure how it could be applied to Nic's story, though. Perhaps you have any ideas?
