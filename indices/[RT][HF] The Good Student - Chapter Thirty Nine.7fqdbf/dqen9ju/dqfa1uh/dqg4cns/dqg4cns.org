Hm. If I assume that the demon couldn't guess because the demon in the story was doing something that a real demon would never do (but wouldn't that break the story? If it didn't, why wouldn't the demon be able to predict it?), then perhaps the demon was practicing causing 'ripples' (Darth Traya coming to mind), experimenting at getting big effects from the smallest possible changes, just to get better at it. Hm.

Edit: Further thoughts. Perhaps it's the distinction beteen what demons 'are now' and what demons 'could be'. Representative of a 'future path for demons' different from their past, in which case it could be explainable that the answer is narratively withheld now, to be revealed at a later time when Nic formally proposes it to others. The real demon things that [X] can't be the case, because there wouldn't be truth to the story in [X] being the case for a demon, and [X] cannot be the case for a demon. Nic understands and believes that [X] /can/ be the case for a demon. Perhaps for the demon to be capable of conceiving that [X] could be the case for a demon, the demon would have to already understand and belive in that, and if that were already understood and believed the demon would inherently prefer that, and already be an ally and help Nic without any need for weakening... though if that were the case, then one could think Nic could show the demon its truth directly, so maybe it's just that Nic has seen a future path for demons that current demons can't conceive of, but perhaps a demon who hasn't already willingly stepped on that path (or been coerced into it?) might scorn. Reminded of a No Game No Life volume in which a suicidal godlike creature has most of her power stripped from her, and finds to her amazement that it's actually really /fun/ working one's way up from the weakest position with everything being extraordinarily challenging (though not despair-inducingly so).
