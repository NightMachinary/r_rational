Hm. Other idea: perhaps the in-story demon isn't that different from real demons, but Nic has some perspective on its true motivations that neither demon has? That is, the actual demon (Irridinhart? we never did get a confirmation that it's its name) was clearly inclined to see the Green Demon's actions positively. Perhaps some of what actual!demon proposed /is/ what story!demon /thinks/ it is doing, but Nic has a truer answer: that it demonstrates^{1} demons' biases/flaws/etc. It answers the question of why Nic can't just tell actual!demon what story!demon knows that it doesn't: actual!demon wouldn't be willing to accept this truth, would scorn, as you've said. I'm not sure what it demonstrates, though.

Relatedly: we can't be sure that Nic intended for the Green Demon to be in the right.
