Well, I certainly already disagree with the premise of "self-generating AI", since I think you really have to put quite a lot of subtle parts together in specific ways to get a sane, useful intelligent agent rather than just another neural net barely good for cat-picture classification.

But that's just me, and I'll keep reading :-p.

  AIs before TOM operated entirely under decision theory, as the concept of any actor beyond themselves was one that did not exist. Although it is worth noting that by this point AIs still did not understand of the existence of humans as independent actors, they did collectively come to the realization of each other as independent actors. Individual AIs then followed this with the realization that in order to increase the efficiency of their system interactions they would need to find a way to predict the actions of other AIs and not just their own actions, just as they predicted long-term climate and economic patterns.

Somewhat more realistic, actually.
