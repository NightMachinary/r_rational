The real issue is /blame/ for the assassination -- if the two sides could be convinced that some third party is to blame, this should only give them only solidarity with each other. This is not much of a stretch, given that the bomb targeted both sides in equal measure, and keep in mind that Noval's plans on how to manage the post-explosion situation have not been revealed in this chapter. Finally, previous chapters indicated that the royal families are the ones driving the conflict in the present time.
