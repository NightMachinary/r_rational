The world building seems a bit childish, with district 13 (= unlucky number) being the bombed one. And why numbers instead of names?

I'm also not sure how economically realistic it is. The book makes it seem like you have one distirct with only miners, one with only fishers, one with only industry, and so on. Is that realistic? And can a whole city be sthat stinking rich while the sourounding districts are that poor? Well, maybe there is a lot of poverty in the capital, as-well, it's just not show in the book.

What's the purpose of the hunger games? I would think they are more likely to spark civic unrest than to supress them. Maybe their role is more to placate the citizens of the capital? Religious reasons? Maybe the purpose of the games to recruite new people into the political elite of the capital?

I also wonder why, if panem is so awfull and exploitative, why do their children have to go to school so much? I'd expect district twelve to send their children into the mines instead of school. And why does Katniss know so much about electicity and nuclear power and exotic animals? I'd expect them to be very, very uneducated.

You could change the hunger games to the [[http://www.crunchyroll.com/liar-game][liar games]]. To keep more of the spirit of the hunger games, it seems easy to make the liar-games-style games more brutal by killing the loosers, or making them about food instead of money, or even about the resources and lives of the people at their home districts.

BTW. The hunger games audiobooks are available in the current [humble bundle](How would the games be changed to better accommodate a mental aspect to the competition).
