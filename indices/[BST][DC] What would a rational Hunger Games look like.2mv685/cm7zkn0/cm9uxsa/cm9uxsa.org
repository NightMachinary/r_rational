  the Capitol not oppressing the Districts and slaughtering children every year(pretty bad method of stopping them from rebelling again, in my opinion)

This is my #1 problem with the entire Hunger Games universe. The theory that the games somehow quells and oppress the population instead of actually encouraging massive and frequent uprisings gets disproven right there in the actual work.

I'll admit to being a filthy casual who only saw the movie... but the scene where one of the kids is dramatically killed and that district IMMEDIATELY goes into uprising mode, overwhelming the guards and destroying equipment and generally being very effective and successful at venting their rage and utterly dominating the supposedly superior forces sent to stop this sort of thing from happening...? Is that in the books?
