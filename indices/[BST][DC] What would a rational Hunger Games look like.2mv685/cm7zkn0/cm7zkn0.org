Well, other than my top idea of the Capitol not oppressing the Districts and slaughtering children every year(pretty bad method of stopping them from rebelling again, in my opinion), I suppose the Games could be made more intelligent by having it, rather than, say, a forest, a dungeon full of traps where you have to be very careful and use terrain to your advantage. Like, an endless Philosopher's Stone dungeon, or something like the Oubliette from Malice.

Fill it with traps, hints, and odd stuff. Make it a Horror Story/Film as well as or rather than a Gladiator Deathmatch.
