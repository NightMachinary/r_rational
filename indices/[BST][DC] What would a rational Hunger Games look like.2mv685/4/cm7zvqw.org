I can't see Katniss doing much better in the first book than she did in canon. There's just very little opportunity for it. Maybe in the second and third book, but even though it's been a while I don't recall any blatant stupidity there. The Capitol could probably utilize its resources better, but the war fought against them seemed fairly competent to my untrained eyes.

Once you get away from rules-lawyering the technology of that world, which is often more like poking holes in the story than actually planning things out intelligently, there doesn't seem to be that much room for improvement.

One thing does immediately come to mind though. The Capitol shouldn't specialize each district so much. If each individual district is more or less solely responsible for a certain product, then as soon as they rebel or are nuked to oblivion, you no longer have that product.
