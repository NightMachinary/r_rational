You could have a character go on the lam in the countryside, and explore how everyday people deal with this dystopian government, looking at things like grey and black markets in the USSR for inspiration. I'm imagining an unauthorized vegetable garden in a mining village, that has to be planted all mixed together to avoid showing up on satellite.

Another idea might be to give people more goals. How about giving more characters political aspirations from the get-go? Ties to different resistance groups, etc.

Rationality tie-in: the Robber's cave experiment, the psychology of soldiers, etc. How could someone who knew what was going on in peoples' heads try, not merely to not die, but to stop all the killing? How could you force or convince people to work together against some outside faction?

You could also go the Lord of Light (novel by zelazny) route, and up the importance of the Capitol's technology level. Then the big external goal is not political action, but 'stealing fire from the gods' and disseminating it.
