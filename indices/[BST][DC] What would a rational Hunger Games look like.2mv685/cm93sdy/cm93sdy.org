  First, are there any huge problems with the way Collins set up her civilization?

Her father doesn't factor into the story at all. I'd choose her mother instead -- she was brilliant and rational until she suffered a head injury, resulting in her demeanor and overall usefulness matching canon and forcing Katniss to grow up.

#+end_quote

Not a lot. It comes after, when deciding how to help the districts.
