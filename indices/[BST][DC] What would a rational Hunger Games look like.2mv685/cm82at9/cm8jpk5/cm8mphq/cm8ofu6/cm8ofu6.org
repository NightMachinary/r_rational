Well he's definitely evil. But it's implied that keeping the districts quelled is only half the point of the Hunger Games, with the other half being keeping the /Capital/ quelled. The Hunger Games are a huge event, and every Arena is turned into a tourist attraction after the fact. The Hunger Games are popular in the Capital, and keeping them running distracts from any problems that the Capital might have, or the risk of political instability from within.

The Capital doesn't really doubt its ability to put down the Districts, and if it /does/ have to put down the Districts, that only solidifies the place of the powers that be in the Capital. Putting down a scapegoat is a time-honored method of keeping control.

(I believe that this is roughly as presented in the books.)
