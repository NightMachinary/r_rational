Disclaimer: it's been a while since I read the books or saw the movies, so I may be wrong about some parts.

In a rational!Hunger Games, there wouldn't be most of the problems present in the novel, especially if the technological advancements present in the movies were applied intelligently. I have trouble imagining a society that can for public entertainment/intimidation create what must be a multimillion--- if not billion dollar Mega Death Arena of Doooom would have trouble feeding it's populace. President Snow would be a Machiavellian politician; the unrest the develops over the first few books would never have happened in this AU, because the evil for the sake of evil oppression wouldn't happen. Take real life for an example. If gladiator battles fought with children were an effective means of controlling the masses, we would be seeing them every Sunday on the sports channel after the football game, in at least one or two of the various dictatorships IRL.

It would also be interesting to incorporate more of the technology shown into every day life. It's obvious the Capital has the capital (heh) to invest in various technologies; industrial mining and the like.
