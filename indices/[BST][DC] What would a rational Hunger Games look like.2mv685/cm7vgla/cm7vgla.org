To be fair, besides HPMoR, which is in another realm, it's seems that it's usually easier to make rational fanfiction from fiction that is heavily irrational to start with. That way you start by solving the obvious holes and run with that... An example iwould be Luminosity wich, despite having some extra rationality, has a lot of fixing the stupidities of the original story.

Also: No, the Capitol would not like to see the participants getting creative except in certain ways. Actually, one possible rational 'solution' would possibly be subverting the Capitol from within the rules of the games, being creative but with such a compelling narrative that they can't take you out of the games, etc. Slytherin-likerather than Ranvenclaw-like rationality, if you will. So, more or less what happens already but being counciouss of what they are doing...
