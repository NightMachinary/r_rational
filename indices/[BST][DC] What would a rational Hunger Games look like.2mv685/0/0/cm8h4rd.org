  I suppose the Games could be made more intelligent by having it, rather than, say, a forest, a dungeon full of traps where you have to be very careful and use terrain to your advantage. Like, an endless Philosopher's Stone dungeon, or something like the Oubliette from Malice.

The problem with that is that I don't think the Capitol would be happy with the contestants demonstrating too much ingenuity. The canon games were as much about being stuck in the arena with no way out as they were about the contestants killing eachother.
