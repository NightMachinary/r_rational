The moment that bothers me the /most/ about The Hunger Games, is when she has a bow an arrow in her hand but the judges are ignoring her, and she /shoots the apple the mouth of the pig's they are eating/ in order to get them to pay attention to her.

Not the assorted collection of important politicians and game-controlling people who are responsible for her predicament. The /apple/. With that level of accuracy, she could have taken out anywhere from 2-6 of them.

It's not like she was /about to enter a game involving an extremely high probability of dying and therefore has nothing to lose/ or anything.
