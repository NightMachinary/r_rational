Well if it's a herb, it can probably be found naturally. Perhaps it's usually quite poisonous and the powers granted by the non-domesticated strain are generally weak enough that the few people crazy enough to eat it don't notice, but for whatever reason he mistook it for another plant, ate it, and it happened to be either a mutant of the non-domesticated variety (if you want to grant him aberrant powers), or simply an isolated patch of the domesticated variety, the result of a long-ago cultivation effort that failed and was improperly cleaned up.
