Plants get everywhere. If they are growing the herb, its going to show up outside the secret gardens.

Any peasants who manage to get accidentally exposed can easily be assumed to be some nobles byblow, possibly even a generation or two back. "Yes, old sir Reg, got around, yes he did".

The real problem is that you need most of the nobility to not actually know the truth either, or you are violating entirely basic tenets of information control. You cant have an entire social class keep a secret and not have it leak. I mean, sure, you get secret jews, and the like, but people damn well knew there /were/ secret jews, even if they did not know the list of names.

Simplest is to have a religious or civil rite when the children of nobility are inducted into the school and put it in the ritual wine.
