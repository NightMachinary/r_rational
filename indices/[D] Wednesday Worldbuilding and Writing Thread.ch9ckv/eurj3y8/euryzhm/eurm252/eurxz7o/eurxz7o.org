- The MC finds a centuries-old book on herbology that survived the information purge about the herb.
- The herb is dangerous and carries a risk of adverse reactions in addition to superpowers; the MC works as a gravedigger and notices the odd smell of the herb on the corpses of several noble children, all at the same age, and decides to investigate.
- The MC moonlights as a smuggler or courier and is tasked with delivering a dose of the herb; he is accosted by city guards or bandits respectively and eats the herb to destroy the evidence. Now the MC has to work out what happened and deal with both the sender and receiver of the herb being disappointed.
- A local noble was testing different strains of the herb on kidnapped local peasants, mostly with lethal effects, and the MC was lucky enough to both survive and then escape. Now the MC has at least one enemy, and his first ally is only interested in the MC's use as blackmail material against the noble.
- A noble is mortally wounded protecting the MC from monsters and chooses to give the MC a dose of the herb so that he can survive the next wave of monsters, on the condition that he maintains the secret and enters the service of the noble's family.
- A local figure is secretly a noble who was exiled or faked their death and acts as a paternal figure to the MC; they decide to give the MC both the herb and their desire for revenge.
- There are indicators for one's affinity to the herb and the MC is an extreme outlier; consequently a noble chooses to adopt the MC and pass him off as a full-blooded son of the family.
