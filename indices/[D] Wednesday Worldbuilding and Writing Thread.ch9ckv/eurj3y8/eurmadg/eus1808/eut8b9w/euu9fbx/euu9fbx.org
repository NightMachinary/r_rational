Probably the easiest way to do this would be to have some sort of red herring. One of my favorite "red herring" approaches is to disguise solutions/boons as problems/ailments.

Something like: protag eats herb, gets sick. Showing up for the first day of field training with dysentery doesn't escape the notice of the health officer/medic/whoever is responsible for such things; the doc gives protag a tonic to assist with his recovery. Since the doc isn't quite sure what's causing the ailment, and protag seems to be suffering (almost to the point where he might be fatally sick), doc decides to go with a drug cocktail, mixing a dozen of his most potent remedies.

After 24 hours of bedridden night terrors and cold sweats, protag wakes up and over the coming days discovers that he has some new magical powers. Now, which conclusion seems more logical: a) the green thing that made me terribly sick also gave me powers, or b) gee, doc must have put some powerful stuff in that drug cocktail.

This could potentially send protag (or others) on a chase, trying to discover the cause of his new powers: which of the 12 ingredients in the drug cocktail gave him these powers? Given that all 12 ingredients have been used without any recorded instance of the recipient receiving powers, it's likely that it wasn't any /one/ drug, but a combination of drugs interacting in unexpected ways...cue someone creating a chart and trying to figure out all of the possible combinations of ingredients. Someone (protag, or his friends, or doc) might take to experimenting in his off-time, trying to re-create whatever it was that gave him his powers.
