It's a plant, so it must be grown outdoors or in greenhouses. A mouse eats some and eacapes the field or greenhouse long enough to be captured by an owl, who flies off to a handy perch and eats the mouse. The seeds of this plant being unusually hardy, they pass through the owl's digestive tract without harm. (The nobles use nutcrackers rather than acids.) The bird poops the seeds in thos peasant's garden, and he eats the plant that grows there, because it looks like a varietal of something he has been trying to grow in his garden.

That can all be explained in a prologue.

Now, the real question is: does it require repeated doses, or is one dose enough? If repeat doses are required, where does he get them?
