How does the attention/fame part work? Do you get "points" for fame and infamy or only the former? Could a villain send out a heinous tweet (or the AU alternative) the night before enacting their master plan and receive a power boost from the increased media attention? If so, I could see this generating something like the reverse of "virtue signaling" in the villain community, with all sorts of interesting consequences throughout society. If this move was used too often people would begin to see everything capes do as mere posturing. It would also likely incentivize villains to be as odious as possible and would put the media in a particularly bad situation were covering the content would help their ratings but they would literally be supporting the criminals they covered and potentially liable for future crimes as a result. A consequence of this is that the media may refuse to give platforms to capes, which could drive capes into the arms of governments since social media would have been one of their best options for making money independently (this is especially true for heroes). A company willing to produce a neutral platform for both heroes and villains with an untraceable way of paying their content creators would likely be in very high demand as a reaction to government gaining more power over capes. I can also see an industry forming around high quality (perhaps by drones) footage of cape fights.

I'm looking forward to your story, this sounds fascinating on multiple levels.
