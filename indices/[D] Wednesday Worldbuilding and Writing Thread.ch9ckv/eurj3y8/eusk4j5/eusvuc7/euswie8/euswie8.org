Strength is hard to quantify for such a wide variety of abilities, but generally powers are always at least somewhat useful and always have some kind of limitation or blindspot. For every defense there's an offense capable of penetrating it and vice versa, if a power is harder to block or more devastating it generally acts on a smaller scale or has some kind of limitation or set-up, for every extra-sensory ability there's another capable of hiding from or disrupting it. There are also powers that effect powers or allow the granting of minor, temporary abilities.

​

Essentially a sort of balance is achieved by there being no single winning strategy, regardless of how much raw power you have.

​

Edit: Something to note is that if an allohuman doesn't bother cultivating their power at all through fame or by pleasing their divine fragment it will slowly lose its potency over time until it's only a tiny fraction of its original strength as it's forced to rely on only your soul for power.
