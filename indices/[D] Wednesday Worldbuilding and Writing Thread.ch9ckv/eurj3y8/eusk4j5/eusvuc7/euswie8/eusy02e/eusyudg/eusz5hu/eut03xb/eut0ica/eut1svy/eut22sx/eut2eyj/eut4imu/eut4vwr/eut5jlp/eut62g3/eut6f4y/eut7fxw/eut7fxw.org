Generally you need to get your power tested, verified and registered with AAMS if you want to use it commercially. A lot of powers really aren't suited for civilian use, whether they're too destructive, too hard to control, or just too esoteric. On the other hand businesses are willing to pay mind-boggling sums of money to anyone with informational powers relevant to increasing their bottom line, so there's a lot of pressure from powerful sectors against heavy restrictions on allohumans commercializing their powers.

The courts haven't quite caught up with the existence of allohumans and all the implications thereof, so enforcement tends to be uneven and focused on scary powers like mind control.
