Something I want to emphasize is that like, there will always be people genuinely striving to be heroic regardless of their circumstances. It's performative without necessarily being insincere, part of embodying the role of a superhero that provides people with hope and wonder.

Also it's just fun to be really hammy and say one-liners, if it actually makes them more effective that's a nice bonus.
