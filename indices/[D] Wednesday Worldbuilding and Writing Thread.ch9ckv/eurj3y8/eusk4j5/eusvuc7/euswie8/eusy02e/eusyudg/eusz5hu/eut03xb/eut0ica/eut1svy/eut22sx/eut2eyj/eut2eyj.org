AAMS was created in reaction to superheroes, not the other way around. People who get powers generally want to use them, the whole point of granting the powers is for them to advance the divine fragment's goals and their candidates are carefully chosen with that in mind.

The whole superhero paradigm is also naturally encouraged by the mechanics of powers. Capes that are flashier, more memorable, or just generally have a shit given about them are stronger. Wearing plain body armor with a featureless mask might be practical, but it's not going to help you develop your powers much.
