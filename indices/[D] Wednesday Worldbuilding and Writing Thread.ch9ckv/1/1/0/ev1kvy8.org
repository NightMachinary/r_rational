There isn't really any distinction made between fame and infamy, attention is attention. It should be noted however that insincerity is a weakness, if you create a heroic(or villainous) persona and someone else comes along and more truly embodies it they'll be able to siphon off your own narrative power.

Once people realize the connection between a cape's strength and their fame there's going to be all sorts of consequences, though I suspect trying to keep people from talking about a really interesting villain is like trying to bottle smoke.
