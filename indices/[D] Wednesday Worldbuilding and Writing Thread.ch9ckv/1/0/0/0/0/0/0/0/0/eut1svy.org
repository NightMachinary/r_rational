Pretty much every government has tried and in some cases partially or largely succeeded in integrating allohumans into their militaries. On the whole they tend to be eclectic and difficult to control or predict, with their own goals and quirks not necessarily compatible with their governments'. In America specifically, the Agency for Allohuman Management and Support or AAMS works to register and monitor active allohumans, generally voluntarily if possible. Signing up with them isn't like signing up with the military or anything, it's essentially a deal to follow certain guidelines in exchange for resources and occasional legal assistance. AAMS has a number of allohumans working for it, though they tend to be a great deal subtler than most.

If a villain gets arrested AAMS is the agency that makes certain they're safely held and brought to trial, and they're also the ones who investigate reports of cape brutality among heroes.
