Alright, so there's definitely going to be some sort of organization so that there will be allohumans at the ready to help if more monsters attack. On the flip side of that, do any governments recruit allohumans into the military?

Btw, if there's something specific about allohumans and society, just say so. Most of the time I just figure it can be a lot more natural to develop a setting if you have to answer questions.
