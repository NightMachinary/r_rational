  Simplest is to have a religious or civil rite when the children of nobility are inducted into the school and put it in the ritual wine.

This gets suspicious if everyone is gaining their powers at around the same time right after drinking the wine, whether they're good or bad students, and despite nearly a year of age difference between the oldest and youngest.

A better way to do it would be to make it an individualized ritual that is supposedly a celebration of each students' development of powers. For example, after completing some minimum education, students continue their schooling but begin to be tested on a daily basis. The test consists of an interviewer rolling six six-sided dice behind a screen. The student is asked to meditate and draw upon their knowledge of the unknowable to say each of the six numbers that came up. Though that may sound quite difficult, it's actually just 1/462 probability, and there's a 55% chance of getting it right within a year or less.

When the student passes this test, it is believed that they have begun to develop their powers, but it is not certain. Very rarely, we are told, pure random chance will cause students to pass the dice test when they are still unprepared for the dangers and rigors of magical training. To ensure the accuracy of the test, each month there will be a gathering of the students who have passed at the institute of magical studies. They will line up in order of age, with the oldest at the front, and go before the headmaster. The headmaster will ask each prospective student to drink a glass of poison to prove their readiness. In people with these magical powers, we are told, the poison will cause them no harm at all. In those who are not ready, the poison will make them sick but generally will not kill them.

In the background, the headmaster's office receives copies of records on the behavior and performance of each student from the noble schools on a monthly basis. When a student passes the dice test, the headmaster reviews their records to see if they really should be getting magical powers. If they've been getting disciplined for bullying or aggressive behavior, they could become a danger to others if they had magical powers. If they're doing poorly in their classes and demonstrating slow mental development, they could be a danger to themselves with magical powers. In either case, the poor candidates will get a low dose of foxglove while the good candidates will get a dose of the magic herb.

With this approach, it makes it seem like there's probably some amount of intrinsic power in each student before we involve consuming any substances, and the only substance that people consume is a poison which does seem to sicken some students while leaving the truly magically-gifted students unharmed.
