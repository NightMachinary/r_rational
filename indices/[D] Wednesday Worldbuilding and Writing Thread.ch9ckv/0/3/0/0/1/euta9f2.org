Oh, you definitely could. How much you want to foreshadow it is up to you, but if you wanted relatively little foreshadowing, you would probably open with the herb being gathered in a way that's incidental to the scene as a whole, then the transformation and/or gaining of power looking (from a narrative standpoint) as though it's just the normal inciting incident that everyone expects.

Why /those/ herbs at /that/ time is an interesting question for our protagonist, who was ... taking a longer path in their foraging than usual? Being unusually experimental in what they put in their stew? Watched an animal eat the herb? Ended up starving right next to the rotted out cart? But that's nothing insurmountable. How much attention you draw to the herb determines how much the reveal gets foreshadowed.
