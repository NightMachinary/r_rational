I'm trying to work out the inciting incident of a novel idea.

In this high fantasy world, many of the nobles are given magical superpowers by ingesting an herb. They have used these powers for centuries to fight off monsters in order to allow civilization to develop. The commoners are kept in the dark about the existence of the herb and led to believe that the powers are genetic in order to keep the nobility in power.

The MC is a peasant who, through some occurence, eats or otherwise ingests this herb and gains powers. Then the bulk of the plot happens while he goes to magic military school.

How could this happen? All of the noble families would have some access to the herb, but they'd probably have it locked up tight. I have an idea where the MC would have a friend who is in the nobility but still, I'm not sure how he'd get the herb, because even the kids wouldn't readily have it since it's so valuable.
