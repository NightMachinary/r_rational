I'm currently working on an urban fantasy/superhero setting I'm tentatively calling the Mythosverse, which I'll probably have to change to something more distinctive at some point. Its mechanics are inspired by quite a few different works, most notably the Parahumans series, Pact, Shadows of the Limelight, and Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere setting.

​

The essential premise is that perception is a force, with thoughts, beliefs, intentions, and perceptions being reflected in a sort of 'psychic plane' called the Narrative. As more and more complex social intelligences evolved, the beings inhabiting it became more and more complex in turn. With the dawn of humanity came an entire ecosystem of narrative patterns, colloquially referred to as the Fae. The most powerful of the Fae are the gods, demons, spirits, heroes and monsters that we all love, hate, worship or fear. Broad, vague concepts are spread too thin and drawn from by too many beings to have any real agency of their own. More specific narratives concentrated the power and could have personalities of their own, projected onto them by their believers.

​

The vast majority of Fae have little influence on physical reality, able to mess with perceptions a little and move small objects but not much else. They essentially only think if they are perceived to think, and the bottom rungs of thinking Fae are made up of abandoned imaginary friends, toys, characters from books that were never written, distorted caricatures of people and the like. Fae feed off of the perceptions and attention of living beings much like plants feed off of sunlight. Every person is reflected in the narrative, since even if we never talk to anyone we still perceive ourselves. Our own perceptions of ourselves could be called a soul, a living record of every thought and feeling we've ever had making up the core of our narrative pattern. Unlike Fae, living creatures can always avoid being swept up in the tides of the narrative regardless of how they're perceived, but this comes at the cost of losing the power those perceptions granted them.

​

As more and more narrative power is concentrated in one pattern they are increasingly able to effect the world, the ability to affect perceptions gradually pushing more and more towards directly warping reality; it should be noted that this directly burns up their very beings as fuel and can only be used in thematically appropriate ways. Before the dawn of human history there was a vast and terrible war between the gods that threatened to destroy the Earth and all its children. In a last act of desperation the cooler headed among them enacted a plan to seal those unwilling to cooperate in a prison outside of reality where nothing existed and nothing could exist. They created a veil between reality and the narrative, preventing all but a tiny few from perceiving or interacting with the Fae and punishing those Fae that threatened to reveal the existence of the Narrative to the remnants of humanity. The gods then retreated to other worlds or pocket realities of their own creation, bringing or creating living beings to worship them and preventing all out war with treaties and careful doling out of power to trusted subordinates.

​

Earth was left fallow and humanity slowly began to rebuild, almost entirely unaware of what they had lost. The Fae that remained were left in the margins, forced to seek out attention in subtler ways lest the Veil devour them and erase the evidence of their meddling. From there history goes along as it did in our world, Earth's population increasing exponentially as technology advanced. It wasn't meant to last.

​

On January 1, 2000, people began to spontaneously develop powers in moments of life-altering trauma, loss, change, or triumph. Eventually dubbed 'Allohumans' by science, and 'Abhumans' by their detractors, these extraordinary people have slowly begun breaking down the Veil by opening the public's eyes to the extraordinary. Unbeknownst to them, the source of their abilities was none other than the Forgotten Gods long sealed away by their kin. A foolish, greedy trickster opened just a crack in their prison in the hopes of accessing the vast power hidden within, but that was all it took for them to burst forth and wreak terrible vengeance on those that imprisoned them. They were mad, broken, driven to horrific extremes by millennia of endless, pointless conflict and struggle with one another, desperate beyond all else to affect the world again and fulfill the purposes instilled in them by their believers.

​

The Veil stood strong against their attempts to warp the world directly, made easier by their utter inability to cooperate or coordinate with each other in any meaningful way. But some among them were clever enough to find a workaround, realizing that the gods had left an allowance for empowering their followers. They sought out people with circumstances and temperaments compatible with their goals, waiting for just the right moment to reach out and connect with them. Not merely granting Narrative power, but partially merging with them and carving channels into their mind, body, and reality itself in order to facilitate specific abilities normally beyond the reach of any but the most powerful Fae or wielders of Fae magic. Allohumans have two paths for growing their powers, either pursuing the purpose of their divine fragment and being rewarded for it or by receiving attention and belief from people directly. No matter how famous you get you're not going to spontaneously develop new, unrelated powers, just get better at the ones you already have.

​

The story starts in 2016, right when the first second-generation allohumans are starting to come on the scene. The Veil hasn't broken down completely yet, but the existence of many things once thought mythological have come to light like the existence of Atlantis or the presence of a Martian civilization. My question is essentially just how society would try to adapt to the existence of allohumans, and how the incentives inherent in how powers work might shape Cape culture and society at large. I should note that there's no direct equivalent to the Parahuman's series 'conflict drive', so there's nothing preventing allohumans from using their power to build infrastructure or heal people if it's good for that sort of thing. They tend to get into conflict regardless, as the goals their powers reward them for pursuing are almost universally incompatible with each other in at least some small way.
