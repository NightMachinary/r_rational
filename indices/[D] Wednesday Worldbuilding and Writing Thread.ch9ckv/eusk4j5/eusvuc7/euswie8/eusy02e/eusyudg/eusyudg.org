The first allohuman that really became famous is a Brazilian man that goes by Zenith. He's essentially the setting's superman expy, with flight, a light-based tactile-telekinesis, and a vision-based danger sense that lets him know where he's needed most and anticipate attacks. His actions and influence have strongly affected people's perceptions of allohumans.

Not long after a woman going by Professor Silica popped up, with the ability to enhance herself through technology and create energy weapons. She's all about embodying the corny silver-age villain aesthetic to the point where it's basically a pathology. She's the type of person to try and steal the Eiffel Tower by shrinking it or other such nonsense. To be clear, she's still willing to straight up murder people in cold blood if they're not willing to play along with the game.

The two of them and their conflicts sort of established the hero vs. villain dynamic that dominates people's perceptions of allohumans.
