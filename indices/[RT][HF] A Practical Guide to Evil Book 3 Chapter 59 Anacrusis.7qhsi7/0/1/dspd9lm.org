I still don't expect this to end well at all for our protagonists. My current working theory is that they will win this battle after a difficult struggle, only to discover that Diabolist is already gone. She turns the weapon she creates not on Callow, but on Malicia herself. Thus plunging the empire into chaos on the eve of a Procer crusade.
