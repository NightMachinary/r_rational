Well, Erratic said somewhere in the comments he doesn't really go in for that G.R.R shit where everybody you love dies for the drama. So we can probably rest easy that Hakram will live.

Probably.

Though if I find it hard to imagine that Akua doesn't see how central Hakram is to the 15th operations. Her spies would have undoubtedly found that information out and ferreted it back to her. I don't think he'll die, but I do think he's going to get Nauked.
