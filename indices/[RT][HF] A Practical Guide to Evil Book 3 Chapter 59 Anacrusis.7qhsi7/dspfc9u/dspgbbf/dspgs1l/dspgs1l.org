You're right in that Akua definitely plans to control Cat (why else gauge her power as a fae?) however it feels more like her opening hand rather than something that she expects to work. Basically everyone knows it's Cat's big weakness so I would expect a ton of contingencies on her part and a lot of other schemes on the part of Diabolist.

This is a wild prediction but I think Black is planning to die in this battle. He's made a heroic speech, his successor is ready to pick up where he left off and dying here would make him a martyr for the cause. Perhaps most importantly though, if he died fighting Akua the Calamities wouldn't focus on Cat but rather on her nemesis - or maybe even on Wasteland nobility at large.
