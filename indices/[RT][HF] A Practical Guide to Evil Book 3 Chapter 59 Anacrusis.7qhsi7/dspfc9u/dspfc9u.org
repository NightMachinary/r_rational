Fuck, that opening scene... that's the sort of stuff that makes this a great story rather than just a good one. Cat literally putting on a mantle of the queen. It seems like pulling out the sword from the stone is finally catching up to her.

I can't help but think everything is going too smoothly for the protagonists. On paper, it seems like they can't possibly lose, especially if you include Black and Warlock but I think Diabolist is playing a completely different game to what everyone expects. I predict that this will either be a defeat or a very costly victory for Cat.
