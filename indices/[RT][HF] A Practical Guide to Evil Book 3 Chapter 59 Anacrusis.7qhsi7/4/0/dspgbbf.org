I gave my main prediction elsewhere in this thread, but here's another alternate that comes to mind:

At a crucial point in the battle, Diabolist will take control of Cat and force her to kill Black.

In a contest between Names, much depends on the weight of narrative and convention. When the story is set correctly, events have a way of bending to get the "correct" result. It is far from absolute, Black has spent much of his career carefully defying and manipulating this effect, but it does skew the odds heavily. And right now, narrative convention says that Squire should betray the Black Knight and usurp his place.

This isn't new, it has been commented on by a number of characters, Black included. We feel somewhat safe because we know Cat, and can see that she has zero desire to betray her mentor.

Diabolist, on the other hand, has no such compunction. We have seen her control even true fae princess before, and here Cat is with an explicit vulnerability to soul manipulation. There is a very real chance that this serves as forshadowing for this forced "betrayal".
