I could definitely see this being the shape of the full novel, if one were to exist. Vimes takes over as Patrician and holds it just long enough to let the people choose his replacement. Nobby runs alongside a few other humorous choices like the Troll crime lord (cannot remember that name for the life of me right now). There's send-ups of debates, empty campaign promises, even the very concept of voting. All sorts of hijinx ensue. In the end, Moist Von Lipwig, who didn't even run, is elected in a landslide. The next book covers Ankh-Morpork's first president assembling a cabinet and getting down to the business of actually running the city.
