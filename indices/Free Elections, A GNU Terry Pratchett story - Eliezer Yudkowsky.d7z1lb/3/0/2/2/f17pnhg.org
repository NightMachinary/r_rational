  What kind of afterlife unscrupulous monsters get? Slaughter paradise?
#+end_quote

The character that I recall who best fits the description of "unscrupulous monster" (of the characters whose ultimate fates were described), got reincarnated as a potato.

If that doesn't seem so bad, consider that it was the kind of potato that gets fried up for chips, which, combined with the way he died in the first place...

I don't think anyone would argue that character got off any easier than he deserved.
