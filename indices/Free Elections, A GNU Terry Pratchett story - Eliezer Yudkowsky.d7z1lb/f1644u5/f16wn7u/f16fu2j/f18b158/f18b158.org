My favourite fiction that has a somewhat Pratchettian style is EarthScorpion's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8753582/1/Overlady][Overlady]], a Familiar of Zero / Overlord (game) crossover fanfic that is better than either of it's source material; it can be read without knowing either source material particularly well. It's not a perfect match. As an aside, this fanfic is infinitely more Pratchettian than the actual Overlord game series, which Pratchett's daughter worked as a writer on.
