I'll paste it here for you and anyone else, and delete if [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]] requests. It's also about 45% more than Reddit's 10K character limit, so I'll break at an appropriate point and continue in a child comment.

Havelock Vetinari was fighting for his life.

Vetinari was aware of how rusty he'd become, like a knife that had been sheathed with blood still on its blade. The searing pain in his shoulder bore testament to the wound he'd already taken. Even so, Vetinari was among the finest students ever to survive the Assassins' collegium. The instant he heard too much silence from behind and to his left, he whirled and stabbed his attacker through the chest with his favorite stiletto, that had appeared as though from nowhere in his hand.

OW, his attacker said politely, as though to indicate a respectful acknowledgement of the fight.

Behind where Vetinari now stood, a corpse lay upon the floor, hand clutched to left chest. The part of Vetinari that had never left the Assassins' Guild noted that despite the pained look on the victim's face, the man probably had not suffered long; and estimated that it would be some hours before the body was discovered, having appeared to die of natural causes.

The knife Vetinari had driven into the skeleton's chest was his favorite stiletto from childhood, abandoned one mad day in the alleys during a desperate fight against a street mime.

Vetinari held himself to be a complex person, but being slow to comprehend ill news was not one of his cherished complications.

"I do apologize..." the ex-Patrician of Ankh-Morpork began, and then trailed off.

The pain in his chest was gone.

He was feeling a different pain now. It was the agony of juggling heavy axes for years on end, until keeping them in the air became your whole life, and then watching all those sharp blades heading for the soft and vulnerable floor.

That tended to happen when the juggler died.

Havelock Vetinari realized that he had made a mistake.

"I should like to leave a note," Havelock said. "Even a short one will do."

YOU ARE LATE. THERE IS A REASON IT IS CALLED THAT. SOME THINGS ARE MUCH EASIER TO DO FIVE MINUTES BEFORE MEETING ME, COMPARED TO AFTER.

There was a gritty feeling beneath Havelock's shoes. The world around him was fading into a night sky.

He'd somehow managed to neglect this possibility, amid all his cares. There'd been a time, many years ago, when to designate another as the successor of Lord Vetinari would have been a death sentence - either for the successor, or for Havelock himself. But those unsteady times had passed, padding away so softly and quietly that Havelock had failed to take notice of their departure. And so he hadn't...

"A dream," Havelock said. "One whisper, one haunting. Please. If I don't, they'll all think - that I meant to -"

THERE IS A TRUTH I OFTEN THINK OF, AND RARELY SPEAK. MOST SOULS WOULD TAKE LESS WELL THAN YOU TO HEARING IT. THERE WERE MANY GRAINS OF SAND IN YOUR HOURGLASS. EVERY ONE OF THEM WAS USED AS YOU WILLED.

"That was stupid of me, I much agree," Havelock said, his politician's mind plotting out possible courses of conversation and seeking paths to success. He was unaccustomed to playing the part of supplicant, these last years, but you never forgot how to ride a person. "Should others suffer for my stupidity? It's not for my own sake that I ask this one thing of you."

IT WILL ALL WORK OUT. The skull was regarding him with implacable compassion.

"I'm certain it will," Havelock said with a tinge of acerbity, "but how will it work out? Disastrously, perhaps?"

THAT IS THEIR AFFAIR NOW, NOT YOURS. I SUGGEST YOU CONSIDER WHAT FOLLOWS FOR YOURSELF.

All his office faded. He stood now upon a plain of endless sand, his soul dressed in death as it had been in life. There was only a more endless night sky around him.

Long ago, Havelock had believed himself a selfish sort. One day he'd seized the chance presented by Mad Lord Snapcase, to take the city of Ankh-Morpork and be applauded for it. Every day after he'd spent on defending his new possession, the wounded city all his own. Defending it from fire, from flood, from envious aristocrats. Defending it, most of all, from well-intentioned people with terrible ideas. In time Havelock had begun to think of himself as the only reasonable person amid the madling crowd. And what was reasonable, contrasted against the follies he spent his time fighting? Why, reasonableness was that which promoted the thriving of his new city. So Lord Vetinari had become a horrifyingly reasonable person, given time for the habit to sink in, reasonable to the exclusion of almost all else. That was the sad, the awful, the reasonable story of Lord Vetinari; and having acknowledged it long ago, Havelock saw little left to contemplate about his life.

"I've killed some, and saved others," Havelock said. "What is done in a case like that?"

I SUPPOSE IT MUST BE SETTLED FAIRLY. ONE MAN, ONE VOTE.

In the distance across the desert, faint shapes regarded him with accusation or grudging acceptance.

"That hardly seems fair," Havelock said. A tinge of apprehension rose in him. "I tried to do what was best for them, not earn their approval."

YOU MISUNDERSTAND. The skull turned, the dark robes began walking away from him across the sand. YOU ARE THE MAN. YOU HAVE THE VOTE.
