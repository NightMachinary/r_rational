My assumption has always been that Vetinari's legacy is the end of the Patricianship. The next generation will have power split between Vines, Moist and Carrot, with a strong press to hold them to account. The final step in making sure Ankh Morpork keeps ticking along is to make sure that it is not dependent on the life and competence of a single person.
