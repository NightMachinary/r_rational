I always thought Moist would end up running Ankh-Morpork after Vetrinari died. Moist is in control of communications, banking, and has strong links to transportation. Vimes is too Manichean to rule effectively, as Vetrinari alludes to several times. Carrot can't take the job. I asked my wife, and she thought somehow Nobby would find his way into the position, which seems like a strong Pratchettian solution.
