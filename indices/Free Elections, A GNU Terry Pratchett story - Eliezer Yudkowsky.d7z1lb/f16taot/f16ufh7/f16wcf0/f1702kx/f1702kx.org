It is unfair, yes. (Intentionally, I think--another of Discworld's themes is that there's no inherent justice baked into reality, justice is something that /people/ believe in and make happen.) Good people can end up in some kind of hell if they think they deserve it, too. (There's a joke in one of the books to the effect that people can only think they deserve hell if they know about hell in the first place, so missionaries should be shot on sight.) The deaths in the series are usually, or maybe always, narratively satisfying anyway.
