Does anyone know of any good Discworld fanfiction, or perhaps unrelated work done in a similar style (and by that I mean the dry, British humor + woah deep nerdy social commentary + interesting worldbuilding common to it and something like HG2G? I'd say the humor also characterizes something like Bill Bryson's travel works?)? I used to love these books back in high school & ugrad (read most of them in the span of a month, actually), and haven't quite had the same itch scratched in ages.

(the linked text was ok, but didn't really do it for me. Kudos for effort though! And on a technical level it was better than 90%+ of fanfiction out there, too)
