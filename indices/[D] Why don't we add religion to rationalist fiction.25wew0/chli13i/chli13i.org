Because it's boring. Religion and faith have already been gone over so many times, that they're often used as /the/ epitome of irrationality. It's just so easy to dismantle religion (dude, do you even solomonoff?); any argument with religion would be mostly one-sided (unless of course you're writing a story where gods /do/ exist). So writers focus on lesser known examples of irrationality instead.

If, on the other hand, you are talking about world building, the people who write rational fiction tend to interact with 'rational' people. This group /tends/ to take not believing in a god as a given, and sometimes have to do a double take when they remember that people actually /do/ believe these things. If they don't mention religion in their stories, or it is only part of the background, that is because that is the way it is for /them/ in real life.

If you want an example of a rationalist story about religion i'd point you to [[http://www.ibooksonline.com/88/Text/hell.html][Hell is the Absence of God]].
