Reading up on the Alief concept. It seems similar to a belief based on tradition that one has followed. Example, monotheist feelings of shame for wanting to express one's sexuality. It seems strongly similar to the psychological and economist concepts of "the divided self" or "intrusive thoughts." But I'm not an expert so I'm in no place to give a definite answer about it.
