It's more like an "intuition":

#+begin_quote
  In philosophy and psychology, an alief is an automatic or habitual belief-like attitude, particularly one that is in tension with a person's explicit beliefs.[1]

  For example, a person standing on a transparent balcony may believe that they are safe, but alieve that they are in danger.

In Kahneman terms, System 1 has aliefs, System 2 has beliefs. When people fail to differentiate between the two (should "system 1" and "system 2" be an accurate way of cutting the mind into pieces at all!), they overload the word "believe" in rarely dangerous but often stupid ways.
