Personally, I think you have to make an accounting for the fact that large portions of humanity possess an alief in some sort of god or gods, despite the fact that almost everyone has /expectations/ that are /completely and utterly unconstrained/ by God. People who call themselves believers will give you weird looks if you actually predict and expect that God will carry out some particular act in the testable near future, and they /will/, in fact, tease you when He fails to do so (this is why people laugh at cults).

Despite this, they will never stop claiming to believe in God, because most people don't separate alief and expectation.

Personally, I went along that way for a long time, until I kinda found out about wholesale extropianism, and /then/ the thought, "Plainly I wouldn't have been so incompetent or malicious at making the universe in the first place" hit me, and then I basically just rubbed out the mental check-box marked "belief in God" for good.
