It's pretty rare to find someone who hangs out in the rationalist community and is also religious, so I'm curious about a few things.

I don't know if you've been to Less Wrong, but over there is a consensus that religion is pretty much a solved problem, and quite an easy one. In the [[http://lesswrong.com/tag/welcome/][welcome threads]] they say:

  Bear in mind that many of us really, truly have given full consideration to theistic claims and found them to be false

Yudkowsky thinks that you can't really be a proper rationalist if you believe in God. See [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/ql/my_childhood_role_model/][this blog post]]:

  Einstein was a nice fellow, but he talked a deal of nonsense about an impersonal God, which shows you how well he understood the art of careful thinking at a higher level of abstraction than his own field.

What do you think about this? Does this give you any discomfort or cognitive dissonance?
