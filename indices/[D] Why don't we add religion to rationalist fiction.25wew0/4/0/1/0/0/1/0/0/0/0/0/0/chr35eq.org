Ah, well... thank you for the response.

Although, I'm a bit perturbed by the whole "revelations book." I never grew-up under Christianity so looking it up disturbed me. I'm not exactly sure what can be morally good about it or the prospect of Jewish people in hell.

If the Bible isn't openly interpretative then what about the parts of Adam and Eve or how God made the world?

Also, have you tried reading other texts of faith? There are plenty others that you can compare and contrast as far as acceptable morals to live by...
