1.) About Jesus Christ:

- If you self-identify as a Christian and recognize Christ as your Lord, among other supernatural phenomena related to the story of Christ, then does that mean you believe in the End of Times? Do you find it acceptable to believe that there will be a massive slaughter of all Jewish people in the holy land so that Jesus comes back to bring only the Christians to the Kingdom of God? Is that truly a good moral system to live by? It would be a genocide that surpasses the scope and scale of the Holocaust.

- If the supposition that Jesus Christ's teachings are true as far as Christianity; if it is absolutely true that recognizing Jesus Christ as Lord is the only way to salvation in heaven then shouldn't that mean every Jewish person who died in the Holocaust went to hell? If they didn't go to hell, then isn't the belief Jesus Christ as "Lord and Savior" be effectively inconsequential for salvation?

side note: The only contention I've heard to this one is that Jewish peoples can ask for forgiveness but that's a terrible moral prospect. Moreover, 1/3rd of every Nazi who killed Jewish people were Catholic. The rest seemed to follow Protestantism. Atheism contributed only to the slaughters under Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot; predominately because of their view of seeing Western culture as exploitative due to imperialism. However, the Nazis weren't atheist by any measure of the word.

2.) Interpreting the Bible and faith

- If the Bible is openly interpretative then how is that different from specifying any religion as openly interpretative? Furthermore, how is contesting the "open interpretation" of the Bible valid when it's no different than a catch-22 logical fallacy?

- If personal testimonies is enough to believe in miracles and Christ, then why not believe in ALL religious miracle testimonies? Why not believe in Hinduism's Krishna, the miracles of Buddha, of Horus, or other supposed deities? Buddha and Krishna predate Jesus, have active believers, both claim to be born of a virgin, both claim to have been crucified, both went to hell for three days, and claim that they'll return to bring about an Armageddon to save only true believers.

- Why believe in personal testimonies written in the Bible when they use illiterate, ignorant, and uneducated peasant women as documented proof of Jesus coming back from the dead? They wouldn't have been allowed to stand trial in open court during the time because they never had any education to the degree of the males. Why believe in testimonies by people who didn't believe in the number 0 because it was viewed as "evil" and didn't even understand basic algebra which came into existence after their time? How can you accept any of their claims as reliable when they were so poorly educated and had high tendencies to exaggerate their claims?

- If there is no documented evidence of a historical Nazareth claimed to exist during Jesus's time, if there is no evidence of even his birth date, and in consideration of the historical fact that thousands of peasants believed in varied and conflicting versions of messiah stories during that time - why believe the bible as credible? There are stories about Jesus that were thrown out because it didn't fit the Catholic narrative. How can you see the Bible as reliable at all to base your life's purpose around?
