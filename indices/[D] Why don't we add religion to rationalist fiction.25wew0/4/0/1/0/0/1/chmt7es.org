Actually, there's one more thing I'd like to ask. Compare a world in which God exists, the one you believe you live in, to a hypothetical world in which God doesn't exist. In what ways would the latter world be different from the former? First of all, do you think it's possible for the latter kind of world to exist, and would it have life and people? Would it have morality? Would society and culture be different? Would there be less people who believed in God? Would there be people like you who have witnessed miracles? Would there be /any/ people who had witnessed the same kind of miracles you have?

Again I'm not trying to disprove you, I'm just interested in the specifics of your faith.
