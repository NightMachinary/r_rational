A world without God. It's a question of the form "What would the world look like if [what you believe is false] and is quite widely advocated on LW in all kind of matters. Its basis is likely in Bayesian probability theory, because for all evidence there's counterevidence at least in principle. The factor by which observing A increases the probability of B is the same as the factor by which observing B increases the probability of A. It's basically "What would you expect to see if [what you believe is false] which can lead to a question "What kind of evidence would convince you that [what you believe is false]?" I personally try to use it even in everyday matters.
