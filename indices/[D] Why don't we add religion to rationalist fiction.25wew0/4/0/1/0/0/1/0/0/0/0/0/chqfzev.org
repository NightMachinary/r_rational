I'll preface this by saying that this is what I personal;y believe. If you asked those questions to 10 different Christians you would get 7-9 varieties of answers, which may be a fun experiment in of itself. I'll answer them in the order you asked.

- I don't know which parts of Revelation are symbolic, poetic or prophetic. If I did I would be the most esteemed theologian of the age. There likely will be an End Of Times in some fashion, but I don't have a clue as to what that will be like. According to the Bible, God has certainly punished his people to great extent before, so it wouldn't be without precedent.

- Yeah, they probably did. I don't like it either. The thing about Christianity is that the rituals, the ceremony, the style, the person's actual righteousness, all of it means /jack shit/ to Christ. [[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A22-23&version=ESV][Seriously]]. The /only/ thing that matters is having a close, personal friendship/discipleship with him. No more, no less.

- I didn't mean to imply the Bible is openly interpretive. Parts of it are vague as events are glossed over and such, but it's usually very clear about what it is saying (people who argue otherwise are often taking the verses they cite out of context).

- [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/25wew0/d_why_dont_we_add_religion_to_rationalist_fiction/chnpelj][I was actually wrong on that one]]. Oops.

- Those women were close personal friends of Christ and the twelve disciples they were reporting to, so they had no reason not to trust them (and when he shortly appeared to them in the flesh, that solved that matter). More importantly, the scriptures were written by humans, but God more or less "dictated" the content to the writers.

- Assuming the construction of the Bible was not under divine supervision, it's still good enough as a starting text into the faith. Look at it this way: you don't read a book on computer programming and call yourself a programmer. Even if it's the best possible book on programming in the world, even if the whole world agrees it is the best, you still have to /do programming/ to actually get anywhere.
