Revelation is just *weird*, dude, and that's coming from someone on the inside (even if only for two years).

As far as Creation/Adam&Eve, there really are a lot of ways to take it, but my favorite theory (which is going to sound really silly, and I haven't done any actual theological research on it yet) was that God created the world in six days, but when he did so he made it look like it happened over billions of years. An analogy would be a video game developer using editor software to create a level, but inside the level he adds lore and environmental descriptors to teach the players about the game, etc.

Honestly I'll hesitate to believe in any creation theory which is supposing entropy existing before A&E, simply because it was their choice that mucked up God's perfect creation. Everyone always asks "If God made the world, then why is it so shitty?" and the answer is that God /did/ make the world perfect, and we're the ones who shat on it.

I have a forever-long backlog of fiction and non-fiction, and some other religious texts are on that too.
