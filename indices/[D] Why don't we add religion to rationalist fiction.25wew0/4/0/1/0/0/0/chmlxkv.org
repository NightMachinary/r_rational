  Are you asking because you're curious, or because you want to try to disprove them?

Curious. I don't believe in God myself - I'm almost certain that God doesn't exist, but I don't really care about the theological aspects of this and don't have the enthusiasm to try to disprove anything. I'm mainly interested in how it feels from the inside, especially if you really use epistemic rationality e.g. have seriously doubted your beliefs.
