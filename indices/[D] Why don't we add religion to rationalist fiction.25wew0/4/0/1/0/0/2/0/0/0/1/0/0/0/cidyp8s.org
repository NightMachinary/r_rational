Then you have to go by the Bible, but I'm not an capable enough scholar to start comparing various holy books here. I should get on that, though.

One thing that has always bugged me about atheism is that it takes exactly /one/ miracle out of all miracles reported to be true to actually be true to prove that the supernatural really does exist. Do you have anything to explain that?
