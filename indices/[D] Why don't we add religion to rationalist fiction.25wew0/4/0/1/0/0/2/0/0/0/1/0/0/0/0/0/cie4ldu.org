I'll admit, I snickered at this part:

  As a student of neuroscience I've had way too much experiences with false memories, hallucinations, illusions...etc for personal testimony to outweigh my priors...

  That or, *witnessing it myself*.
#+end_quote

I just... does studying neuroscience inoculate you from the whims of your own brain?

Anyway, my main problem at this point is that I'm just too damn young (haven't even had my eighteenth birthday yet) to have amassed the kind of experience to form real wisdom, and the age problem also contributes to the lack of understanding said holy texts. One is hard enough man, trying to reconcile all of them is practically impossible.

Edit: Oh, I actually am interested in those cloud-saving sci-fi writers.
