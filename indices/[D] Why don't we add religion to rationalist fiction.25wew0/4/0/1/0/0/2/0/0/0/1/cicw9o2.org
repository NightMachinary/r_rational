Here I am, the thorn of doubt, come to prick you one month later!

Sorry, being dramatic - I'm mostly just curious as to what occurred after our conversation, seeing as you are one of a very small set of people who might identify as both rationalist and religious. Previously, you cited miracles as the major source of evidence for a strongly held belief, and later "they" said that miracles weren't a major source of evidence, which meant you had to either update a bunch of stuff or decide that "they" are wrong about miracles not being a good source of evidence. It's educational to watch these sorts of updating processes happen in real time, especially in someone who is familiar with rationalist tropes.

So, what happened next? Did you update your opinions in any direction?
