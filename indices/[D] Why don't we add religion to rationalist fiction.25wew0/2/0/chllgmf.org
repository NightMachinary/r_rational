  It's just so easy to dismantle religion (dude, do you even solomonoff?);

That's not nearly as easy as you make it sound. =K(x)= is incomputable, any approximation can be biased, and the /human mind's/ approximation of "simplicity" is /very definitely/ biased towards human-shaped thingies (see: Discworld series, all of). Before any argument about Solomonoff Priors on God is going to work, you first have to solidly convince someone to revise their concept of universal simplicity to relate to normal, established Turing machines... and then you have to deal with the cognitive dissonance you're about to create by looking for which bits of a person's brain their religion roots in and figuring out what else can root in those pieces (because people don't allow themselves to walk around with incomplete personalities, I should know).
