  Moreover, many of the enjoyable parts of Yudokowsky's author tract fanfic "Methods of Rationality" has Rationalist Harry talking to Dumbledore about the flawed ideas of souls and an afterlife.

Because most people tend to feel that these were the most wall-bangery parts of HPMoR, not because of "religion versus rationality", but because Canon!Potterverse simply and definitely /does/ have an afterlife. Strawmanning to make Potterverse more like (what we currently believe to be, with very strong Bayesian and error-minimization evidence) real life is simply not very artful.

  Side note: it would probably be better to not attempt to strawman religious believers in their emotional capacity so that they don't feel it's scornful to their beliefs.

Well yes.

Here's a reversal for you: transhumanism and extropianism are religion-replacements for secularized, STEM-educated people. I mean, come on, you're literally talking about movements that are based in changing the world to a radically ethically superior state, abolishing death, and creating Paradise. Anyone who claims that religious yearnings play no part in this is a liar.

EDIT: And that's not intended to be an insult to these two ideas. Seriously. I'm the guy who watched [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhGuXCuDb1U][Tim Minchin's /Storm/]], got to the part where he says, "Isn't this all /enough?/" and basically yelled "NO YOU DUMB BASTARD! IT ISN'T!" and fought to refrain from chucking my computer at the wall for daring to contain such idiocy.
