In regards to your "Storm" comment, I think Minchin was more talking about the view of some people who believe in the supernatural to express dissatisfaction about the "natural" universe by saying that it isn't good enough, or not liking that fantastic and beautiful things have known and mechanistic answers, and Minchin saying "why do you need supermaturalism to explain all these things? Why are these natural laws not enough for you? Why do you require ignorance of something in order to truly think it is beautiful?" I dont think he was saying that the world is perfect and noone should try to improve it anymore because thats "enough".

At least, that was my interpretation on it.
