Repugnant Conclusion. It can support 11 billion with current technology via unsustainable resource usage and at very low quality of life. If we want sustainability, it's time to head for the stars and/or stop having so many damn children.

/Luckily/, it turns out if you make people not-poor they stop having so many children, so the world population is actually slated to /decline/ in the 21st century after peaking around 9-10 billion, unless we either halt all economic modernization forever in a sudden collapse (unlikely: markets price-in predictions, that's their good point) or cure death.
