The problem I have with invented religions in fiction is that the author is completely free to make the religion true with hardly any repercussions for the story. Terry Pratchett plays around with this by having the gods be very definitely real and very definitely interfering with the mortals. It's hard to be an atheist in those worlds, because there is actual evidence for the gods.

On a more more meta level, it's not very useful to have gods in rationalist!fiction because it's often about celebrating the capabilities of /mere/ mortals (and sometimes about more or less building a god). Including existing gods (especially of the omnipotent type) makes the actions of the protagonists mean less if the author isn't careful.
