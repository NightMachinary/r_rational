What do you think I meant? I haven't actually seen whole scale rational ways of thinking; not even by the standards explained by CFAR. The community seems prone to the same cognitive biases, acts in the same vicious manner as any other web forum with generalizations and logical fallacies galore, and the only notable difference is this idealistic and naive notion that death can be overcome through transhumanism.

Transhumanism isn't real. Allow me to elaborate on why this concept has so many clear problems:

- Where will you get the resources to sustain a population over 11 billion? Much as people wish to believe everything in the world is better; there are still millions dying from infant mortality and conditions of poverty to this day. Even if their productivity increased, the natural result would be a quicker thinning of natural resources. The growth isn't sustainable.

- Pharmaceutical companies still test their drugs on children in third-world countries. This still happens nowadays. This includes the U.S. and it's the main reason why they don't see such a problem with selling drugs without FDA approved restrictions off televised advertisements. Will the wonder medication that saves the human race require the deaths of millions of infants in third-world countries? They are still taken advantage of by Western Corporations - including the U.S. so will we require more deaths to get it right? Also, go ahead and downvote for this as I expect you to; it's just another acknowledgement that you don't understand how to make transhumanism practical nor understand what technological civilizations have done to weaker civilizations for their natural resources.

- Why is it not more practical to use warfare to continue to brutalize Eastern societies so that population growth is more sustainable to stop the thinning of resources? That would conserve resources in all practical sense for the technologically elite cultures and food supply shortage would no longer be problematic in plunging the world to self-destruction. As such, transhumanism is only for the minority population of the Earth.

- How do you convince the top 1% to change their exploitative practices and give fair wages to people in Western societies - let alone people in Eastern societies? To do so would mean an increase in prices for goods sold. If everyone in the world tries to live the Middle Class life then will that even be sustainable once resources get stretched so thin?
