Been working on it for six months. But the whole "writing genocide, refugee crises, observing real war videos" portion of it has been depressing and emotionally draining. I'm also left wondering if humans are just a transitory phase of the world that will be no different from the dinosaurs; specifically because of the continued climate change debate when we needed action back in 2008.

Anyway, what do you think of the rationalist community as a whole? I'm beginning to wonder how "rationalist" the community really is. It seems the statistical studies about forum users being more sadistic than the average population is true based on my observations on several forums.
