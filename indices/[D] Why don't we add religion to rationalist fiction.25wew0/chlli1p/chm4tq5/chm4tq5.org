I agree with you. It's why when I first came here, I said that I don't feel like death would be a problem. It's a natural process and to argue that it's not is ignoring how nature decomposes corpses to be ingested or used by other life forms in natural forests. I've never agreed with the idea of stopping death; I find the notion completely ludicrous. More importantly, the planet can only support about 10 billion people according to studies that I've looked into and we're already at 7 billion.

Back to the point though: I think we're seriously ignoring the potential to broaden the audience base and maximize profits. I tried pointing this out in that other topic on HPMOR but all I got were strawman or ad hominen responses with a clear cognitive bias towards traditional publishing. Yet, look at the success of Game of Thrones; which invents it's own religions.
