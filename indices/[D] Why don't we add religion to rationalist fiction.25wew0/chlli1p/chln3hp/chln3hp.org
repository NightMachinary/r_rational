Why do people complain that HPMOR universe is different from cannon? Yudokowsky only used Harry Potter because that is easier than creating an entire new world, when trying to explain and show rationality. I find that what draws readers to HPMOR is the Harry Potter aspect rather than the rationality aspect, which is the opposite of what EY wants (although he wants as many readers for whatever reason as possible).
