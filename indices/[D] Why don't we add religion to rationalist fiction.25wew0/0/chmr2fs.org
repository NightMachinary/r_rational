Fictional Deconstructions of religions are stories in which religions are true, or the evidence claimed by religions actually exists and then the most obvious God corresponding to these is inferred. These can be helpful for breaking loose religious people from the trance of carefully not considering implications.

E.g., writing a story about a hard-labouring Egyptian mother with no political power, wailing over the crib of her firstborn son.

Some of the most effective atheistic material, I suspect, is by Terry Pratchett for similar reasons.

I've advocated that serious rationalists need to stop paying attention to atheism after a certain point, because after a certain point atheism becomes bad practice for handling difficult questions; atheism is not difficult and trains you to think that rationality is always easy and that bad ideas are always obvious.
