  What do you think about this? Does this give you any discomfort or cognitive dissonance?

Not really. If I'm supposed to judge the truth of Christianity based on the things I've seen in the world around me, then I am a freaking Christian. I have observed things /which do not make sense/ without the presence of God.

I usually don't bother making anything out of it in groups like this because the discussions dead-end immediately, and trying to defeats the purpose of those events and testimonies in the first place.

Honestly the intersection between Rationality and Christianity is super fascinating to me, and so far the two of them get along just fine.
