Are you asking because you're curious, or because you want to try to disprove them? If it's the second, I'm not going to bother. I don't have any hard evidence for these. You can't just say "Wait, don't do the faith-healing yet, I need to get my camera!" When they happen they happen in fractions of a second. It's infeasible to use logic and empirical data to explain miracles. You have to go by faith. /That's the whole point/.

That said, it's not the miracles themeselves which have me so convinced, but the overwhelming number of 'coincidences' in hundreds of personal testimonies. Anyway, your question:

- The most blatant miracle was a faith healing of a woman with one leg shorter than the other by a pastor at a church I was visiting. The pastor sat her down in a chair, took her feet in his hands and called out "Anybody want to see a miracle?" as her ankles reshaped themselves. There must have been an inch and a half of difference before he healed her, and then it was /gone/.

- I went on a mission trip to Honduras. The lead missionaries were a young couple who had been operating in the area for a week already (it was their first time leading a group. They had this story from the previous week: while out building a house in a field covered in a foot of manure, a woman slashed her bicep open on a sheet of aluminum roofing. Blood everywhere, and the wound was /yellow/ with exposed body fat. They took her into the truck and drove her back to a doctor, who was kinda old, had poor eyesight and only gave about half as many stitches as the wound needed. Even so, the woman's injury healed perfectly, no infections, and /no pain whatsoever/. Even when her arm was first cut open, she felt no pain. She could feel it, but she couldn't feel the pain. She didn't start feeling pain until the wound started healing, and even then it was only itches.

- My pastor was a /burglar/ before he had an honest-to-goodness, God-tapped-him-on-the-shoulder-and-turned-his-life-around moment /while breaking in/.

- One of my teachers was making a turn onto the interstate and spun out, directly facing incoming traffic (the road was wet). Around a dozen cars going at 60mph passed /through/ him and his vehicle harmlessly.

- My mom received the Holy Spiritn and developed a prayer language. It's Spanish. Fluent Spanish. My mom doesn't speak a word of Spanish, but good heavens, can she pray in it. There's quite a lot of that in my church.

- I personally have some experience with the gift of prophecy. I have a vivid imagination, but when I pray I can receive mental images that I can't alter. Now, figuring who the prophecy is addressed to can be an entirely different task, but some of the older guys at my church can reach Contessa levels of shaking people to their cores with a couple of inspired metaphors.

I can go on, but I think you get the idea. More importantly, I'd advise to not go by internet philosophy or hearsay on this matter. Talk to /people/. Go to a church (it doesn't matter what church; any church that's the least bit unwelcoming to atheists isn't a church at all) and start asking questions. Don't be afraid to challenge. Don't be scared of being magically converted. Have some faith in your skills as a rationalist -- but don't get into trivial arguments, there are as many interpretations as their are people. Interrogate the pastor after the service if you want to. If it exists, I know I wouldn't want to bet my eternal soul on a half-assed investigation.
