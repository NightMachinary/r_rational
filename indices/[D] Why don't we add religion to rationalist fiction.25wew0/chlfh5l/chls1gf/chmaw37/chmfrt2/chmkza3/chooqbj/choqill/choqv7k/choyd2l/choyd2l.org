If I had to pick a reason for this topic to be unproductive, it would be this: I have never, ever seen anyone persuade anyone else to abandon their faith in a religion over the internet. I have seen a bunch of theists and atheists debating a bunch of times, and I have never, ever seen a theist convince a atheist by reasoned argument over the 'net that their religion was correct and accurate and they should go get baptised or whatever. Similarly, I have never, ever seen an atheist convince a theist that their religion is wrong. The best you might achieve is to persuade people who are on the fence or are already doubting their beliefs - basically everyone I know who changed from whatever they were raised as, did so because of life experiences (e.g. especially traumatic experiences like deaths of close family members seem to make people doubt and choose again and either find or abandon god) and their own introspection/thinking within themselves.

I mean, even people who go door to door in multiyear missions who have carefully designed scripts and who keep lists of everyone who seems even slightly interested to try to persuade them again and who have the advantage of being in person and have cunning arguments apparantly have /reported/ success rates in multiple years of work of like [[http://www.cracked.com/article_21109_5-hardcore-realities-my-time-as-mormon-missionary_p2.html][5 conversions]], of which maybe 1 or 2 might be legitimate and successful enough that the person keeps going to church for a while after that and the others of which were more-or-less made up for status-among-other-missionaries reasons.

I'm not saying it's impossible to persuade someone to abandon their religious beliefs, or lack thereof, over a text interface which they can leave and cease paying attention to at any time, via cunning arguments. What I am saying, however, is that the feat seems to me to be similar to the AI Box Experiment escape in a lot of ways but like a *lot* harder and less likely to succeed - to the point where I have never even heard of it working, in spite of the numerous attempts I have observed.
