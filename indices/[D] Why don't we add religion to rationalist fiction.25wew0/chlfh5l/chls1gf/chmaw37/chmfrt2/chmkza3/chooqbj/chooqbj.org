  The most blatant miracle was a faith healing of a woman with one leg shorter than the other by a pastor at a church I was visiting. The pastor sat her down in a chair, took her feet in his hands and called out "Anybody want to see a miracle?" as her ankles reshaped themselves. There must have been an inch and a half of difference before he healed her, and then it was gone.

Any pastor that says "Wanna see a miracle?" is a snake-oil salesman. Occam's Razor, my friend. Which is more likely, that a supernatural event occurred and the woman was healed, or that the woman had a rare condition (or, hell, a dislocated joint) and the pastor found a use for it to help solidify the faith (or his hold on, depending on how cynical you are.) his congregation?

  I went on a mission trip to Honduras. The lead missionaries were a young couple who had been operating in the area for a week already (it was their first time leading a group. They had this story from the previous week: while out building a house in a field covered in a foot of manure, a woman slashed her bicep open on a sheet of aluminum roofing. Blood everywhere, and the wound was yellow with exposed body fat. They took her into the truck and drove her back to a doctor, who was kinda old, had poor eyesight and only gave about half as many stitches as the wound needed. Even so, the woman's injury healed perfectly, no infections, and no pain whatsoever. Even when her arm was first cut open, she felt no pain. She could feel it, but she couldn't feel the pain. She didn't start feeling pain until the wound started healing, and even then it was only itches.

Skilled doctor operating by muscle memory, as well as a one-in-a-million injury that severed a never cluster. No pain (severed nerve), clean suture with less-then-optimal supplies, and decent after-care to prevent infection. Once again, Occam's Razor.

  My pastor was a burglar before he had an honest-to-goodness, God-tapped-him-on-the-shoulder-and-turned-his-life-around moment while breaking in.

Psychosis can set in unexpectedly as well. This is not at all evidence.

  One of my teachers was making a turn onto the interstate and spun out, directly facing incoming traffic (the road was wet). Around a dozen cars going at 60mph passed through him and his vehicle harmlessly.
#+end_quote

What do you mean, through him? As in, a bunch of cars went through a solid object, and none of them stopped to wonder at the fact that they just sped through a solid object? Or are talking about that the man, who was spinning at "oh-my-god" RPM, may have lost his orientation and it may have /looked like/ the vehicles passed through him, when in fact they merely /dodged/ him? Again, Occam's Razor.

  My mom received the Holy Spiritn and developed a prayer language. It's Spanish. Fluent Spanish. My mom doesn't speak a word of Spanish, but good heavens, can she pray in it. There's quite a lot of that in my church.
#+end_quote

Abrahamic church prayers are primarily in Latin. Latin, Italian, and Spanish have a lot in common. Perhaps your mother simply picked up the phraseology from other people who pray in Spanish? Or just learned them second hand from another source? Why would you assume that the knowledge just appeared in her head? Again, Occam's Razor.

  I personally have some experience with the gift of prophecy. I have a vivid imagination, but when I pray I can receive mental images that I can't alter. Now, figuring who the prophecy is addressed to can be an entirely different task, but some of the older guys at my church can reach Contessa levels of shaking people to their cores with a couple of inspired metaphors.
#+end_quote

This is rather silly. First off, how exactly does imagining something hard enough that you derive a concrete image that you then have trouble altering count as prophecy? And, why is it prophecy, rather then the simple act of making connections by thinking things through?

And, for the older gentlemen who can ask armor-piercing quesitons, why is that jesus magic? Are we discounting a lifetime's worth of experience with dealing-with and reading people? Cheapening these people's skills and abilities until it can all be swept neatly under the "magic jesus" rug?

That's insulting, in a way.
