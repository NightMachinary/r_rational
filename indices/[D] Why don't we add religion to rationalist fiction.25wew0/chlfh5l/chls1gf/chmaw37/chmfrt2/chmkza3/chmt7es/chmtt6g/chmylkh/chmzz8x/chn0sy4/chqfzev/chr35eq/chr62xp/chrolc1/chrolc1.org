About that... isn't Adam and Eve and the death of Jesus no different than people blaming themselves for something they couldn't control? It seems like unrealistic self-blame for what couldn't possibly be the fault of anyone alive today. If it isn't unrealistic, then why not blame ourselves for ANY atrocities that our own subgroup: religious identity, ethnic group, or national identity caused on other people from as far back as 2000 years ago?
