Okay, I've spent hours digging some of my old world history books and I can't come up with anything explicitly caused by God but not his church. The Pope has made plenty of historically significant decisions through the years, but those would likely still have happened even if the religion was actually false.

The closest thing I can find that might answer your question is probably [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Constantine#Constantine.27s_army_adopts_the_Christian_cross][Emperor Constantine's vision]], which ultimately lead to Christianity receiving the backing of the Roman/Byzantine empire.
