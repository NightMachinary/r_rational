For what it's worth, I might have told you that this would be the response. The Hindu narrative (well, the more "organized religion" branches of it) tends to say the same thing - that the miraculous stuff itself is totally unimportant and the truths should be grasped with the mind alone. Some even have the idea that doing miracles is a "lower" thing that distracts from the higher purpose of enlightenment. People are the same everywhere and original ideas are rare.

But, when you really press people for evidence, they do tend to fall back on the miracles, as you did.

It's always people who participate in the more organized forms that seem to have the miracles though.
