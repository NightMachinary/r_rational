  I just... does studying neuroscience inoculate you from the whims of your own brain?

Nope, but unfortunately no [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/rn/no_universally_compelling_arguments/][universally compelling arguments]], etc, means that if the circuitry of my brain processes reality in a way that is fundamentally wrong, there's not much I can do about it.

Although, as someone who suffered from [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/e25/bayes_for_schizophrenics_reasoning_in_delusional/775y][Capgras Delusion and Reduplicative Paramnesia]] in childhood, I must say that a certain level of psychological meta awareness /does/ inoculate you to some extent.

More recently, after becoming aware of false memories as a phenomenon, U started identifying false memories as they happen - once my father and I thought we remembered accidentally leaving a suitcase on a public driveway and leaving...I remembered it, he remembered it, and we were about to drive all the way back. Then, I remembered the concept of false memory, so I mentally replayed the conversation we had in our heads. Upon replay, I realized that the conversation itself had planted the memory...the longer we spoke, the more convinced each of us became. So awareness of a phenomenon /does/ sometimes lead to escape from it...even though i hadn't meant to originally apply that in my post.

My opinion: The sort of wisdom you gain with age generally pertains to relationships, love, finances, career, and other practical matters which relate to your practical day to day survival in this life. You won't find basic epistemology problems such as this one getting /any easier/ to solve as you grow older.

Luckily, in the grand scheme of things, it makes no practical difference if you're religious or not... in this earthly life, at least. The sort of wisdom you gain with age pertains to things that you have first-hand experience with.
