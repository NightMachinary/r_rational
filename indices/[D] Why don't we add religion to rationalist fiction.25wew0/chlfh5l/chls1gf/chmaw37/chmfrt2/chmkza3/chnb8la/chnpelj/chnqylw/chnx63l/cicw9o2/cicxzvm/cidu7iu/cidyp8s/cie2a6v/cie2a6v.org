So...seeing as this is the case, doesn't that mean you /do/ have sufficient evidence for the supernatural (By your metrics of evidence) but you /don't/ currently have the evidence to accept Christianity from a rationalist ground?

  Do you have anything to explain that?

Regardless of whether or not these miracles exist, there will be a certain rate of miracles being reported, yes?. well, this rate is not high enough for me to believe the miracles are true. Like I said:

  I don't think personal testimonies of miracles are reliable because personal testimonies are unreliable.

As a student of neuroscience I've had /way/ too much experiences with false memories, hallucinations, illusions...etc for personal testimony to outweigh my priors.../especially/ when it just so happens that people always seem to experience miracles which neatly line up with previously held beliefs.

To change my mind, I would need to hear multiple, independent testimonies of the same miracle from people who have not communicated with each other after or shared a common prior expectation of what was to happen before, and the miracle must not be something that could be accomplished via sleight of hand. (This is /not/ the same thing as a single person /claiming/ that multiple people saw and agreed upon a miracle. I need firsthand evidence of independent corroboration.) That or, witnessing it myself.

  I'm not an capable enough scholar to start comparing various holy books here. I should get on that, though.

From a rationalist perspective, I agree, you should: One thing that's always bothered me about the "I'm not a scholar" argument, especially coming from a rationalist, is... how could you /not/ be?

I mean, given the incredible stakes of eternity and morality at play, if I thought that there was the remotest chance that religion was true I would prioritize becoming a capable religious scholar over nearly all other pursuits. I've /already/ become fairly well versed by layman standards in multiple religious texts, and that's just out of a philosophical interest. How could one who believes that the keys to morality lie with God and that we are reckoning with huge, eternal consequences /not/ become a capable scholar?

Thus far, I've kind of just attributed it to people not being rational...
