So...your thoughts on that?

I don't think personal testimonies of miracles are reliable because personal testimonies are unreliable. Missionaries think personal testimonies of miracles aren't reliable because of Satan.

If I understand correctly you were citing miracles as the primary evidence in the previous paragraphs. Has your opinion of miracles and coincidences now changed? And what of the hypothesis which previously rested on that support?
