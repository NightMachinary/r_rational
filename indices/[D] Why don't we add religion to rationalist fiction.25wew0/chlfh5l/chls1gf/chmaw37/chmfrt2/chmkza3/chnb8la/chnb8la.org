It's not like the miracles point you specifically to Christianity though - I hear the same sorts of miracles from friends and family members...except they are attributed to Hindu things. And it always seems specific to the beliefs of the teller...your mom got the "Holy Spirit" and learned Spanish, my family friend recalled a "past life" and suddenly somehow knew the geography and history of a place that they had never been. Lots of holy men preaching Hindu theology, healing people, making accurate prophecies, and more...

Many of the testimonies I hear directly contradict Christian theology (the past life one, for example)...would you disregard them on those grounds? Why do miracles seem to take on such a Hindu flavor when they happen within Hindu lands? If I trusted people's testimony the same way you do (and I have just as many testimonies as you do) then I'd certainly have to accept that something supernatural existed...but I would also have to eliminate Christianity from the hypothesis space, given the very un-Christian nature of some of the miracles I've gotten testimony about. (And they tell me all the same stuff about "faith" that you wrote)

So you're saying Step 1 = increasing the credence one gives to personal testimony. What is Step 2? Because if I /just/ go off personal testimony, then Christianity is wrong about a few important things... (past lives, idol worship, just to name a few...)
