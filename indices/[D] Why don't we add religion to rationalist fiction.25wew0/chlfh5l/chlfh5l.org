Why the downvotes? This is a perfectly legitimate question...

On topic, religion tends to function to fill in the gaps of society, be it by explaining events in the weather, codifying moral norms, creating support structures for the unfortunate, etc.

Like anything else it can go completely overboard and cancerous and radical, and there are as many interpretations as there are members. [[http://xkcd.com/927/][Go figure]].

Speaking as a (gasp!) Christian, and one who has been on several mission trips and witnessed a few miracles and first-hand accounts of plenty more, I'm perfectly fine with including religious topics in rationalist fiction.

Edit: typos.
