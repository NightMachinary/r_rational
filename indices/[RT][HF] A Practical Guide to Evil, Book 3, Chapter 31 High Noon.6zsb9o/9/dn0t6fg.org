Woooo, finally caught up!

Amazing chapter. This and the last few have reminded me of one of the things that makes this story so great: its moments of just sheer fun, from the over-the-top crazy action to the quips and witty banter that's been there from the start. The closest thing I can compare this aspect to is The Dresden Files, with all the compliments that implies.

Can't wait for the next one, now that I'm stuck in the grind with everyone else!
