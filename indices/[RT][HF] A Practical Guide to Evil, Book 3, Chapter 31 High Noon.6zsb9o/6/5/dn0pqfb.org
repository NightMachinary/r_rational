  - Thief is a heroine, and we've seen before that she can release what she steals. Might she turn on Cat at the worst possible time?

I hope not. Thief x Cat is my new OTP. The snark alone means it's inevitable.

  - Masego was blinded in the transition/fight when his glasses shattered and pierced his eyes. Is this permanent? Will he absorb the power of his glasses?
#+end_quote

Temporary, I think. He literally just handwaved away a broken jaw on Archer immediately after his transition.
