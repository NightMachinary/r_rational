Ha! That ending caught me by surprise, which is always fun. I do kinda wish "Yoink!" was an Aspect... Imagine how much crap Thief would have had to deal with after!

So, this opens new puzzles:

- Thief is a heroine, and we've seen before that she can release what she steals. Might she turn on Cat at the worst possible time?

- Masego was blinded in the transition/fight when his glasses shattered and pierced his eyes. Is this permanent? Will he absorb the power of his glasses?

- We know 2/3 of Archer's Aspects (right?). See and Flow. What's the last?

- Rampage is a great aspect for Hakram, but seems a bit less of a fit for Adjutant... Is that just my take on it?

- What is Ranger waiting for? I still think she's the "and one" part of the Battle of Four Armies and One. Does she want a Queen or King?

- Edit: what is the "upset" that Cat really wants to save for later? And who does she think she needs it against; the Summer fae or Diabolist?

Still, an excellent chapter and a great ending!
