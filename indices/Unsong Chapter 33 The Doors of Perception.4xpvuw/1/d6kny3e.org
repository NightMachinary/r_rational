Simeon's excuses don't make sense. If the goal was /really/ to have all the names discovered as fast as possible, you'd have your sweatshops somewhere with no minimum wage. Heck, just charge people so that they have to test out a Name every time they use one of the ones that you've copyrighted, and you have a desperate peasant workforce that /doesn't/ hate you and /isn't/ dying.

TCK is son of an Archangel of secrets, who founded an organization to keep the Names of God secret and who never explained anything. Do secrets have some sort of power in Unsongverse, aside from the obvious Placebomantic stuff?

Maybe TCK created UNSONG specifically for the Placebomantic setup it would bring around? Some lone rebels bring the organization down, charge after Hell, and are boosted by their heroic stature?
