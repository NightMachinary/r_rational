Bro, if you can find that quote then go ahead and point us to it. But it doesn't exist.

Uriel has stated that using the divine light to kill Thamiel would speed up the end of the world, but it's never been stated that Names have the same effect. The fact that he never complains about the multiple major corporations that exist solely to find Names is a major hint that Names don't degrade the universe (at least, as far as Uriel knows.)
