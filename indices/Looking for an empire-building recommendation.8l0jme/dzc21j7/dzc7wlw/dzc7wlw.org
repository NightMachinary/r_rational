Piggybacking on this, If you don't mind reading less rational and Isekai works, I recommend:

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReleaseThatWitch][Release That Witch]]

About a Chinese engineer who gets sent back to fantasy Europe and recreating modern techniques to revolutionize their world. There's also witches, thus the name. Read it [[http://volarenovels.com/release-that-witch/rw-chapter-1/][here]] as the qidian translations are trash.

Also if u haven't read or heard of A Heroes War then I also highly recommend it, however that's quite unlikely as it is quite popular on this subreddit.
