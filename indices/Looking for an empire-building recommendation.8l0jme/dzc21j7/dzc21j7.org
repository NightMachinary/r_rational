I dont know how rational people consider this and it could be less rational than i remember, but i enjoyed reading common sense of a dukes daughter and it 100% fits the genre. If i remember right its about a modern accountant/economist who is super talented that gets sent to a medieval world and takes over the body of a noble girl. It is all about her trying to manage a medieval dukedom with the advantage of knowing modern technologies and economic principles.
