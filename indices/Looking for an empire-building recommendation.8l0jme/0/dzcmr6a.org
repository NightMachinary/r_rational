I suggest [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/][Dungeon Keeper Ami]]. It puts a character that fights for good and truth and all that and puts them in one of the most evil and hated roles in that setting, a Dungeon Keeper. Ami has to keep making compromises - like hiring minions and fighting off the good guys and the bad guys who keep attacking her - just to stay alive. While she's still trying (and mostly succeeding) to stay good.

And in true Dungeon Keeper fashion, a lot of it is building up dungeons (which keep getting destroyed), managing minions and so on.

There is also a hilarious amount of power creep, but it's well earned. This story is long. The current arc has Ami, by herself, accidentally taking over an entire city. She just wanted to negotiate for them to maybe stop attacking for once, but they kept fighting her, actually trapped her and things escalated.
