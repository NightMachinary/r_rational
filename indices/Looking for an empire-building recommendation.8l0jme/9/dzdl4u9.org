A recent one I have discovered is [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/genjitsushugi-yuusha-no-oukoku-saikenki/][Genjitsushugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki]] (Alternate title "How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom"). Isekai genre, but focused on economics and logistics.

Have read the 10 chapters of the manga so far, and I am going to tackle the translated light novel.
