It's a rpgmaker game, not a serial, but [[http://the-last-sovereign.blogspot.com][The last sovereign]] actually fits what you're looking for pretty well. Lots of empire building, economy and logistics especially later on in the game. Plus you get to make decisions that have pretty well-thought out consequences later on. NSFW if that's a concern.
