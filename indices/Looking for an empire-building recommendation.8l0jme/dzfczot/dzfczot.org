[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/cruel-to-be-kind-si-multicross-rehost.3509/][Cruel to be Kind]] might suit you. It's been a while since I read it, but from what I remember I would call it fairly rational (though not rational/ist/).

Plot-wise, it's a multicross/SI fic about a guy who ends up bonding with a bit of sufficiently-advanced xeno-tech that allows him to travel almost anywhere in the multiverse he can imagine, but never back to the dimension he was born in. So of course he does the obvious thing and uses it to create his own interdimensional empire. It definitely fits your criteria though, with a heavy focus on creating a society from scratch, securing technology, resources and manpower from different dimensions and all the trials and tribulations of running a growing sovereign nation.

It hasn't updated in about two years because of various personal problems in the author's life, but he is still around so he may still get back to it someday and there's quite a lot to read, just with what's there already.
