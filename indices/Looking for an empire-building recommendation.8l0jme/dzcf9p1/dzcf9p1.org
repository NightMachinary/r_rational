The main character has some great luck, but the otherwise rational book series [[https://www.reddit.com/r/overlord/comments/68149b/where_can_i_read_the_light_novel_newcomers_faq/][Overlord]] just released its 13th volume, which was a fun read. The stated goal of the MC's faction is to conquer the world they've been transported to, and the MC himself is a lvl 100 skeleton king/magic caster. The series is known for its worldbuilding.
