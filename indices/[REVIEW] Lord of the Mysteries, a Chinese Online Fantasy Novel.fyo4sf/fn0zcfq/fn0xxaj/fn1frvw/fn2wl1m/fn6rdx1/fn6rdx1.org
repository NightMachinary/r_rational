  /Why bother with the veneer of investigation and research, when questions are answered automagically by divination, dreams, and asking magic mirrors?/

In-universe excuse is things of a higher level or sequences naturally counters divination, dream analysis and magic mirror scrying. I think it was also noted quite a few times that scrying things you are not meant to know often result in death or worse (ala Lovecraft), although I agree that Klein isn't punished nearly as much as he deserves for his reckless curiosity and constant death-seeking. But those high-level events would have gone unnoticed by the MC's POV if he wasn't paranoid enough to double-confirm things in his magical "cheat" grey fog, which somewhat overcomes those restrictions. Otherwise, the readers over his shoulder would miss out key plot elements.

And narrative convenience is an actual plot element in this story, given the SCP-like artifact feather pen and the high-level player that possesses similar powers himself. It's like Worth the Candle characters talking about what their GM would do.

Personally, I think these writing tricks by the author is preferred over to rapidly switch between the villain-of-the-arc's POV and Klein's, while Klein is none-the-wiser. I dislike, as a reader, having certain vital information revealed to us for a long period of time while the MC is utterly clueless. It makes them feel incompetent through no fault of their own.

Also, the author does rely on in-universe rules set up a long time ago such as "pathway convergence principle" to bring opportunities to move the plot along, to attract rivals closer and make fights happen, to have narrative convenience. The rules are explained, the magic works consistently (except for a few later on), and actions by even side characters and villains make sense as if they were intelligent thinking beings, taking what they believe are the best choices for their current situation.

LotM is not rationalist fiction, but it is certainly is rational-adjacent.
