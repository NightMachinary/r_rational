Yeah, I bounced hard off the first dozen or two dozen chapters. The translation alone wasn't the main issue - I've read and enjoyed through entirety of Release That Witch and that translation was /dire/ but the starting chapters are also extremely tedious.

But I might give this another chance, when I /really/ have nothing else to do.
