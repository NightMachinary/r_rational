  /That said, for Klein at least divination fail all the time when he doesn't have any hints, so he does need some research./

This reminds me of the key joke of Vol 2: Klein's fake detective persona claims to make deductions but is secretly relying on magical divination and then reasoning backwards. And then he calls himself Sherlock, while most people here have long observed is superhuman and does NOT engage in fair play whodunnit.

Up until he actually does some proper deductions so he can go back to divining.
