  I am always wondering why his enemies aren't able to do the same stuff and apply the same reasoning against him or his minions.

I think it's often stated his pathway (or whatever the gray fog is) is a natural counter to divination and Spectators, and the whistle is added on top of that, but it /is/ pretty convenient. That said, for Klein at least divinations fail all the time when he doesn't have /any/ hints, so he does need some research. I think the story is somewhat consistent at that requirement.

The anti-divination items remind me of how Worm self-insert fics pretty much always have to come with anti-Thinker powers otherwise it's an auto-loss. Divination is really powerful in Lord of Mysteries.

I think you're not giving the story enough credit, though. There is a degree of prep-time you rarely see in stories of this kind.
