There's a description of the genre [[http://www.paracelsus-games.com/theatrical-experiences-explanation][on his website]], but it's really geared at people who aren't that familiar with role-playing games to begin with. If you are, though, the concept is identical to a tabletop RPG, except that instead of sitting around a table, you're moving around in a game space, in character except when you specifically signal that you aren't, and mingle (or whatever else the game might have you doing). "Boxed" theater LARPs like this are a lot like certain tabletop RPG modules: the documents include rules and character sheets that tell you everything you need to know to play. Different theater games have different personnel/logistical requirements, but this one is rather small (seven people and a GM) and very simple: when I played, we played in two small rooms of the author's apartment.

As far as a demo goes: it's not really a demo-able game, because the game experience doesn't lend itself to being broken down into chunks. Mostly, you're seven people talking at a funeral (for varying definitions of "person," which is where a lot of the thematic meat of the game is).
