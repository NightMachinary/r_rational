whoops, i saw a link that says 'X reads the good student' and assumed it was outloud for audio, its actually just someone's thoughts about the story while reading it. ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/85iqv8/jakeb89_reads_the_good_student_111/]])

generally if you can't find the story, just append rational or webserial of fic to the end and it'll show up in google.
