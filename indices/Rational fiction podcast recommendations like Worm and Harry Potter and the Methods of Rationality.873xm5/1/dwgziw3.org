You could try "We Are Legion (We Are Bob)"

It's about a programmer who signs up for cryonics, dies, and is woken up as an AI candidate for a von Neumann probe. Apart from the science used to provide the necessary acceleration and a bit of have waving to get things started, the science is all legit. It's a ton of engineering competence porn, and definitely a blast to read when it gets good.
