I started reading from the start because I accidentally clicked on this post and thought I'd check it out anyway. I really liked the writing by the 3rd book, and have it in my serial fiction tab collection on my phone that I spam refresh now that I'm caught up lol

The Daily Grind reminds me, in bits and pieces, of another book I'm currently working through (Bellwether by Connie Willis.) It's fun, but I'm not sure if it's rational fiction or not, I mostly just seem to enjoy the genre more than most without being able to independently gauge if something qualifies for it myself.
