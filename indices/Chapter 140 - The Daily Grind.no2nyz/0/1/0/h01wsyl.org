Yeah. I get that, It seems like almost everybody would have more ideas about it if they were aware of the problem, but maybe it's that it's not a highly publicized problem in the organization itself yet. Though maybe it won't be publicized to avoid main members thinking more capitalist mercenary-ie as a culture...

I do like that the characters aren't all competent in every single area, and things go wrong apart from the current problem they are focusing on. Hyper competence in every single area seems to be an opposite trap that some new rational authors fall into. Or at least associated material that gets recc'd on this sub. And the scale orbs and other power-ups are a nicely satisfying relief from that frustration with changing up flaws.

I chose to interpret that it's also showcasing what only a few people actually trying to keeping things organized looks like in a huge organization (even without constant issues/crisises). And things constantly slipping off your plate, especially since the main character who's approving/spearheading most things has ADD (which I can reallllly relate to.)

Good news though, the latest chapter does be like oh wait we have a frickin gold ore vein. So I think that will get addressed soon, with more smooth acquisition brain power as the story progresses since it's now been reaffirmed as an ongoing scale problem to address.
