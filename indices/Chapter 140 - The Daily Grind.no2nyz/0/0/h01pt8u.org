Personally? I wouldn't call it rational in the way this subreddit generally does. Which is not to say I don't want to write characters that aren't idiots and objectives that are explained. I want the magic systems to be comprehensible, so people can point out to me when I've missed something obvious (this happens regularly). But I don't think it's the same degree of rationality that other works shared here have.
