Oh! Whoops! I misread your original comment, that's my bad. I'll probably check out Bellweather though, as anything described as 'adjacent to Douglas Adams' sounds pretty good to me.

Nikhail is trans, yes. Anesh is probably being investigated by at least one insurance company, also yes. And I'm really glad that you're getting into writing your own work!

Also, Dave was originally written to be kind of a jerk, and was not originally written to be on the spectrum. As with most things, I didn't have a plan going in, and just sort of felt out how the character reacted to the world and developed. This was about at the same time that I was noticing more in real life how neurotypical people in America seem to perceive people on the spectrum as being rude or impolite, because they lack an understanding of what's driving that behavior. And at the time, it just sort of fit with where Dave was as a character, so I shifted gears and went that direction. I hope it worked out in a way that isn't awful.

Anyway, thank you for your comments! I always appreciate feedback like this.
