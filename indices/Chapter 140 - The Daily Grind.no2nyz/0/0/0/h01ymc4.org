Hey! The author! It's cool to see you here. :) I want to say as a person with amazing poly friends, I really really liked coming across a healthy wholesome triad in the wild. I immediately recommended it because it's awesome (although I had to warn about how you wrote Dave as a possible autistic person as they're all autistic and... the characterization with when you were setting him up to be a bad guy at first... it's, I'm glad it's gotten better as the story goes on.) Also, is Nikhail(sp?) a transman? I think that might have been implied and I was very happy.

You've actually inspired me more to actually write something.

And also imagine how. much. better. I could make my life under capitalism, as multiple copies with mind sync: tagging out with a copy on work breaks to conserve mental energy and defend from repetitive stress pains: the ability for chores and having one not on a night shift sleep schedule to take care of business hour chores; work on personal projects... (and all the drama of logistics like if it would be possible to get health concerns address across multiple bodies with the same identity without being prosecuted for insurance fraud, lol))

Edit: also as an actual reply to what you said, I was actually meaning I wasn't sure if Bellwether was a rational fic, but if you have time to read I recommend it! It is a sci-fi in capitalist framing fyi, sort of complimentary to Douglas Addams writing too)
