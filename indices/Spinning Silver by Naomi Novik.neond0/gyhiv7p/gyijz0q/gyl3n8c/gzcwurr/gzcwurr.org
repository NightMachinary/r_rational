I love this book. I'm not a fan of the ending, but it didn't ruin the whole book for me. I like how the mythology is shown, and this is one of those books where magic and real life blended beautifully.

Its connection to rumpelstiltskin didn't stick out to me, I was too into the mythology to notice.

I agreed with what you said about the 3 main characters. By the middle part of the book, I already adore and root for them. And even if their small victories are followed by great consequences, their growth over their decisions are at the front and center.

I love the hansel and gretel house and the way it was written. When I realized its connection to the house Magreta stays in, I had to put my ebook down and clap, haha

The fact that the author never names who is the narrator of each chapter is a testament to how well defined these characters are. I can already guess them by the first paragraph except for Irina's first chapter, it only clicked to me when the ring was mentioned again.
