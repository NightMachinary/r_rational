I felt the same, and the concept of a “fairytale reimagining” is decidedly not to my usual taste. I don't want to overinflate expectations but Spinning Silver is one of my favourite novels of the last decade and the degree to which the author improved from Uprooted was shocking.

(Unfortunately said improvement was not present in her latest novel, which I found the weakest of her last three).
