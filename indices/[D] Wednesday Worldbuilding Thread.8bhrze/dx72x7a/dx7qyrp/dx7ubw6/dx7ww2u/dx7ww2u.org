I've got an idea, take it or leave it. Some models have time being cyclical. We follow a loop: universe starts, exists, dies, starts again. Same thing every time, nothing changes. But! You have your antag with the ability to change the past. He simply shifts the "wheel" left or right at a certain point and can travel along the wheel as he chooses. While your protag simply sets a smaller wheel within that wheel (your stable loops)
