Yeah, I'm not waiting to think of an ending before I start writing the story. I already have the first two (short) chapters written out.

I just wanted to know if anyone here could come up with their own ideas about two conflicting models of time travel and my favorite one was the one about everyone being in a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8aa92m/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dwy3sdj/][simulation]].

Your idea where they both can do whatever they want to the timeline and only incidentally intersect has merit, but it doesn't feel right unless I have some idea for an underlying model of how the time travel works to permit such drastically divergent variations. It wouldn't be in the spirit of rationalist fiction otherwise.

It's still fine for now since I'm on a journey to 'discover' how time works with my characters.
