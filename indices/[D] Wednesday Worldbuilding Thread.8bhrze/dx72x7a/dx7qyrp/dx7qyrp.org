No need to be ashamed of struggling with your ending. Lots of writers struggle to figure out how to wrap everything up. Sometimes you have to write the story and just sort of figure it out, sometimes you already know how it's going to end. Everybody's different about that, and that's totally cool.

You could just treat everything like a many-worlds model. Your protag creates stable loops along a single timeline, while your antagonist creates new timelines but leaves the old ones intact. Time would be immutable along each line, but changing your line could change the past and future as you please. You'd have to find someway for your protag to stay with the guy in his same timeline. Unless she sees different versions of him.
