I'm trying to work out a FTL system for a sci-fi story I'm probably never going to write and I would like to get some feedback on loopholes or workarounds that I may be missing.

The goal is to have a whole bunch of tiny colonies that decided to break of from their parent nations and strike out on their own. I want the colonies to have contact and trade with larger multi-star-system governments while simultaneously making it infeasible for those bigger nations to invade/take military action against their former colonies. Here is what I have right now:

FTL travel uses a device called an aperture to establish one end of an FTL jump. You can either jump from one aperture to another or between one aperture and a sufficiently large (star-sized) gravity well. Since the latter option usually puts vessels /inside/ the star in question, it is really only used by unmanned drones to scout out new systems and put apertures in place there (you send in hundreds of drones until one appears in a location where it is not immediately fried). Once a foothold is established, a network of FTL jamming satellites is put into place around the star to prevent other parties from sending in their own drones.

To make a successful jump, the sending party has to first communicate detailed mass distribution scans of the payload to the receiving party which can then decide to accept or reject the jump. If the scans don't line up with the payload, the jump fails and the payload is ripped to pieces.

This all means that ship to ship combat mostly isn't a thing. You can scan ships for weapons once they arrive, so each system just parks enough weapon platforms around their aperture to blow apart any ship that comes through with more weapons than they are allowed to have (the allowed number of weapons is typically zero). The only moderately viable way for an outside party to take military action against a system, then, is to somehow get enough undercover agents into the target system to take control of the aperture control station and/or incite the local population to rise up against their government. Both options are expensive, risky and unlikely to work, so most parent nations decide to cut their losses and attempt to maintain some semblance of good relations with their rebellious colonies.

There is a few other details that I left out for brevity, but that is the basic gist of it. Anything obvious that I'm missing?
