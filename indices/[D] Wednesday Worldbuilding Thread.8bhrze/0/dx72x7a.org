I have already posted nearly the exact same comment to last week's Friday Off-Topic Thread, but in interest of having a different set of commenters, I'm posting it again here.

I'm working on this time travel story where the protagonist has the power to induce Stable Time Loops which means she believes that time is immutable in the sense of [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rrW7yf42vQYDf8AcH/timeless-physics][Timeless Physics]]. The antagonist is someone with a different time travel power, but unlike hers he can change the past and thus sees time as mutable in a Branching History Model.

The [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/moral-conflicts][Good vs Good Conflict]] practically writes itself where the protagonist is horrified at the antagonist seemingly murdering trillions every time he changes the past and the antagonist thinks the protagonist could destroy the world if she abuses the Stable Time Loops to create an [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ARaTpNX62uaL86j6/the-hidden-complexity-of-wishes][Outcome Pump]].

The part I'm ashamed to need help with...is the ending. I wanted to come up with a model of time travel that could permit both mutable and immutable types of travel and I've been having trouble coming up with explanations for how both can occur. Clearly a conflict can't be written if I can't explain how it's possible to have both versions of time travel in the same world.

There's several ideas I've already have thanks to the suggestions of friends and the mad genii who post here, but more would be greatly appreciated!
