Yeah, I agree. It was a bit of a slapdash idea based off the Wheel of Time. This is why I generally don't enjoy stories about time travel or manipulating time as if it's some element distinct from the fabric of the universe. The only one I ever liked was Slaughterhouse Five.

After reading the simulation idea, I think that's probably OP's best bet.
