I mean one obvious reason you might not hear about rational supervillain lairs is because supervillain lairs aren't as advantageous as they seem.

Generally it would be vastly preferable to keep your base of operations secret and be able to move if it was disrupted (or for other reasons). Thus giving it too many defences would conflict with making it inconspicuous.

However if you were going to have a lair that everyone knew about anyway then you'd be advised to make it similar to modern military structures like bunkers/military bases including their defensive measures and it might also be advantageous to have a battleship as your base since they have good defences and are mobile. However all these options assume you have billions of dollars to throw around, because if you don't then having a non-secret base within your price range will lead to you getting very quickly taken out.

Still even if you're absurdly wealthy having a conspicuous base doesn't seem worth it because if you're a proper supervillain then most likely modern militaries will take you out pretty quick if they can unless you're allied with another nation they don't want to start a war with.
