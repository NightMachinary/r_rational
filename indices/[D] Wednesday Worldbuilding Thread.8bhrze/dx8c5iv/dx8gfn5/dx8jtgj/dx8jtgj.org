Lots of great stuff here, thanks!

  Parent nations can set up in the star system next door and throw rocks.

Just a rock won't do, as the colony will see it coming and be able to knock it of course. At minimum you'd have to include shielding, engines and probably some weapons. My thinking was that putting that much effort into a plan that won't come to fruition until multiple decades (at minimum) into the future is just not worth the trouble.

You bring up a good point that just putting it in motion might be enough to disincentivize future rebellions. That is kind of a big problem. I hadn't considered making blind jump targeting random, but that is a very interesting idea and might very well be the solution for this problem.

  How do incoming vessels send their manifest to the receiving aperture?

There is a separate mini-aperture connection that just sends over a standardized data storage device of some kind. Destroying an enemy aperture is possible though, for instance by sending a shipment of antimatter ming vases and detonating them on arrival. The problem is that all that will do is make transport into and out of the system impossible until it is rebuild (which is somewhat expensive, but not economy crippling) and ensure that a whole bunch of people won't accept incoming jumps from you anymore.

There is a reasonable allowance for error in the manifest, but crew does have to be strapped into their chairs for the trip. Scans that happen on arrival in the system are much more detailed and basically give you a blueprint of the ship. It's pretty hard to smuggle anything through, but there is still a human in the loop so you won't start an interstellar war by duct-taping a gun to the side of a ship.

Note also that they are scanning for ship size weapons, smuggling in side arms is supposed to be somewhat tricky, but not impossible.

  Will your scanners be able to tell that..

Yes on the antimatter ming vases and the tractor beam (provided you use a different piece of tech, I don't intend to have tractor beams), no on the rest. In general, they'd be able to see what kind of modifications you made to your ship compared to standardized schematics. Of course anything can be a weapon if you are creative enough and assembling a fleet armed with improvised weapons and/or ramships would be a viable attack vector, but that still puts you at a significant disadvantage compared to the defenders (especially since you have to keep everything hidden from the local government while you're assembling). Cars are weapons in the real world, but most militaries still prefer tanks.

Tourists that are also space marines is the actual way people try to take over other systems, but that tactic does not allow the larger nation to fully take advantage of its much larger economy and industry (which was the intended purpose). In fact, the story centers around an experimental military unit that tries to solve this problem by answering the question of "how much force multiplication can we stuff into a single person?".

Biological weaponry is another excellent point that I hadn't thought of. Maybe there is some kind of interstellar ban on that kind of stuff, though that seems extremely hard to enforce. Hmm, I'll need to think about that.
