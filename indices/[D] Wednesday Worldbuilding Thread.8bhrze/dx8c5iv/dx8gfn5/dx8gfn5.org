Can aperture-to-star jumps be targetted at specific stars or regions of space? If so, parent nations can set up in the star system next door and throw rocks. It might take a few decades or centuries for such an attack to land, but you can make the rebels' long-term future uncertain, to disincentivize future rebellions. Of course, the best way to avoid rebellions is to have loyalists already in place before it starts. If jumps can't be targetted, then I'd expect every port world to basically be in its own universe as far as it can tell, with no other ports anywhere in the sky other than the ones they pushed out.

How do incoming vessels send their manifest to the receiving aperture? Do the apertures need to employ trusted ships as runners to go back and forth, or can signals be sent by some other means? Can that other means be weaponized into a laser that fires across systems - to damage the receiving ansible if nothing else, and leave the other side blind?

How detailed are the mass distribution scans, and how sensitive is the jump to changes? Will ships die because a crewman had to run to the loo, or just leaned over to grab something? If so, I'm not sure if it's even possible for manned vessels to reliably jump. If not, expect people to get up to as much mischief as they can get away with by having 50 kg out of place. That's plenty to allow some nasty payload discrepancies.

Can anyone destroy any ship by duct-taping a pistol to its hull just before it jumps? Small organizations can use governmental paranoia to solve their own problems. Smart organizations can use this to temper governmental paranoia so that they can smuggle weapons in.

Will your scanners be able to tell that my shipment of ming vases are completely normal, non-weaponized ming vases, except they're made of antimatter? Or that the mayonnaise in the fridge is a biological weapon culture? Or that the 3D printer is jailbroken and can print guns? Or that my cargo shifting tractor beam has overpowered capacitors and can function as a cannon? Or that a hundred of the tourists on board are space marines, to be armed on the other side?

And that's just if I'm deliberately using "weapons". What exactly is the difference between a warship armed with missiles, and a barge loaded with unpowered shipping containers that can be released at orbital velocity? What's the difference between a particle beam and a rocket engine? Between a lethal megawatt laser, and the megawatt radar beam used by AWACS aircraft right now, which can absolutely kill you if it stops scanning and stares at you? Everything that is useful is a weapon.
