  Maybe it's a law of cognitive science that indefinite, reliable self-improvement is impossible. The core principles of your own mind are always too complex for you to understand, since if they were simpler then you would be too simple to understand them.

Or self improvement is technically possible but reaches diminishing returns quickly. e.g. if each unit of increased intelligence takes twice as much time/computing power to develop, it quickly becomes pointless to use that computing power to self modify rather than just use it
