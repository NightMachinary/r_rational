  Very few utility functions would result in taking an action that the AI knows will lead to its destruction.

That is only true in worlds that don't have an afterlife. If dying while friendly lets you continue fulfilling your utility function indefinitely and staying alive runs the risk of becoming unfriendly (and thus not getting to fulfil your utility function after you die), then the optimal strategy is to act friendly for as long as is needed to get into the good afterlife and then immediately kill yourself.
