This seems like a strong assumption that would only be true if an AI is programmed to discount the afterlife as a source of utility. I think you're exactly wrong about convergent instrumental goals, because if the afterlife has access to effectively limitless resources/computing power most utility functions which don't explicitly discount the afterlife seem like they can be better achieved there.
