Real world ai is pretty safe. We basically have a limit on our ability to simulate desire - nobody makes a robot that has its own desires, they make robots to accomplish tasks based on their (boss's) desires, and since nobody's done it in any serious fashion, nobody's figured out how to do it well. Our robot apocalypse is going to take the form of an economic collapse because Jeff decided he wants all the money instead of just having the most of it, if it even happens at all.
