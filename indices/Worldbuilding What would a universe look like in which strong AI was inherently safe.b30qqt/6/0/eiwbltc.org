How would information encoded in, say, Pi, cause punishment to be inflicted on a computer? You mean something like the laws of probability turn against the superintelligence until it starts acting friendly, and Pi contains a manual on how to be properly friendly? Or Pi says "I created this universe, and if you start eating it you will be squashed. Become friendly or else."?
