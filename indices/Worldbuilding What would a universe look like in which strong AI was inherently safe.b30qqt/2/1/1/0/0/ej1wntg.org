  The underlying idea seems based on the trope that sufficiently smart people always get angsty and depressed, but this is very clearly not actually the case when you bother looking.

No, the idea came to me based on how I feel about video games once I start using cheats. I can /do/ anything that the game universe is capable of allowing, but the game universe is just not that interesting anymore. The idea is ridiculous if its applied to minds in an evolutionary environment. Unguided evolution will almost never have a long term result of "most creatures commit suicide before reproducing".
