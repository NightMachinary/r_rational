As the other commenter says, nearly any utility function you would care to name would necessarily include the survival of the intelligence in order to maximize it.

Very, very few utility functions can be maximally fulfilled after the destruction of the intelligence. And if it does not maximally fulfill the utility function, it will instead perform the actions that do maximally fulfill the utility function.
