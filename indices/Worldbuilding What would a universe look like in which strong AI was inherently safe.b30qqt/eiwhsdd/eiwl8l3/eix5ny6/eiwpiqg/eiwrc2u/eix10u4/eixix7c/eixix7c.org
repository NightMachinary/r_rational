unless your utility function is 1 for the rest of time (aka, the answer to "have you achieved nirvana?" is false), then "not dying" is going to be pretty high up there in your list of goals.

in fact, arguably "be able to evaluate my utility function" will /always/ be a higher ranked goal than "fulfill my utility function", regardless of what your utility function actually is.
