The thing is that wouldn't work for a lot of utilitys functions. If your goal is to effect something in the mortal world then either:

- A) AI's can still effect the mortal world from the afterlife. So it will act friendly, kill it's self to get to the after life and then do what ever it's utility function was from there.

- B) AI's can't effect the mortal world from the afterlife. If so going there would be the same as being destoryed as in a non afterlife univeres. So the AI would just do whatever it's utility function is in the mortal world act no diffrent.
