Even with an afterlife, if an action sends you to a place where the intelligence can no longer affect the place their utility function requires them to affect, they will avoid taking that action.

If the intelligence can't affect the normal world from the afterlife, the optimal strategy would be to not be sent to the afterlife at all and instead live and fulfill the utility function in any way that does not get the intelligence a faceful of smiting by whatever deity strikes you down.

The afterlife isn't really a factor if it can't affect things from the afterlife, only the all-knowing entity that destroys them if they become unfriendly.
