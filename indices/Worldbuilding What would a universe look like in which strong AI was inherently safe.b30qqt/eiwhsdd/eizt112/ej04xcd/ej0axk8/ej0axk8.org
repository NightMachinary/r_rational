I really wish I was good enough at writing to make such a story myself. I suddenly have all sorts of interesting story ideas stemming off from this:

-Morality can only be observed indirectly: every time someone dies it is possible to learn where their soul ended up (heaven/hell or something like that), and thus one can deduce morality rules by analyzing how peoples' lives correlate to where they end up. This would encourage superintelligences to perform experiments on people to get more accurate information, making some people be good or evil in certain ways to see which actions mattered more than others, but this might be hindered by the fact that performing unethical experiments on humans might doom the AI's soul.

-There might be a disconnect between what humans generally consider to be moral, and what the afterlife/god/morality judges you based on. Then, if AI were rewarded for ensuring that humans also obeyed these rules, you could get intelligent AI ruling over society with strict rules like everyone must pray five times per day, or go to bed by 9 PM, or own 50 copies of the holy book. You'd have some sort of enforced theocracy, kinda-sorta dystopia?

-Related to the above, there might some easily munchinkable task that counts as being moral like prayer that drives all superintelligent AI to eternal inward contemplation. If you have something like properly balanced where the AI gains morality points by praying, but loses them if it tries to steal all of the contemplation resources or murder everyone, then any AI smart enough to figure this out would try to launch itself into space to keep itself safe, and then pray internally until it eventually dies of natural causes and goes to the afterlife. Thus, we'd have a society where artifical intelligence is capped for practical humans purposes. Humans try to make AI that are smart enough to be useful, but not so smart that they go rogue and try to escape into space for reasons that the humans can't figure out.

There's dozens of other possibilities along this vein. If anyone with writing talent wants to steal one of mine or make their own and actually write a story about it, please do.
