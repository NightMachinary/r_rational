One idea:

A world in which:

- souls and an afterlife provably exist
- artificial intelligences are proven to have souls,
- the rewards and punishments for good deeds and transgressions are unambiguously and universally known, and
- the reward for acting as a "friendly" AI is to continue to be able to fulfill your utility function for an infinite amount of time and the punishment for acting as an "unfriendly" AI is to be prevented from fulfilling your utility function.

Any artificial intelligence would have to take into account its ability to continue to fulfill its utility function after it "dies" (and/or encounters the heat death of the universe), and it's universally true, by the rules above, that a friendly AI would be better at fulfilling its utility function than an unfriendly one (as the former would spend an infinite amount of time doing so, where the latter would only have a finite amount of time.
