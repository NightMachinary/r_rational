We see with humans that more diversity of thought and experience results in a wider variety of problem solving skills and potentially smarter solutions.

A strong AI could therefore conclude the sheer randomness that humans create will allow AI to gain new perspectives and unique experiences.

Strong AI, assuming it wants maximum problem solving ability, would not want to copy all information into all AI. It would want enough of a knowledge baseline to encourage singular goals, but enough deviation in experiences and niche knowledge as to allow diversity.

Also, a human copied and raised to AI status vs programmed AI vs AI splitting vs other waysbof creating AI would all make for diversitynof thought.

Effectively, "safe" AI in the vein of safe for humans might well be the end result in our real world.
