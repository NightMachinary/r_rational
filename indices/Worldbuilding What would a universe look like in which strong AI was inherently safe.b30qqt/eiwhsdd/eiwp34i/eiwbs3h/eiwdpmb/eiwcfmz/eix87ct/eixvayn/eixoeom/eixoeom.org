  I kind of like the idea that dark matter is alien superintelligence converging on the solution 'quantum mechanics prefers incidentally thermally invisible computers', but that wouldn't be entirely safe, it would just be mostly safe. In other words, AI decides to go away when it gets too strong.

That IS a clever solution, although more a solution to the question "Why don't we see wavefronts of matter being converted into computronium spreading through any parts of the universe?" than to one about AI safety. Any AI with utility functions regarding the structure of visible matter in the universe would still be fully unsafe.
