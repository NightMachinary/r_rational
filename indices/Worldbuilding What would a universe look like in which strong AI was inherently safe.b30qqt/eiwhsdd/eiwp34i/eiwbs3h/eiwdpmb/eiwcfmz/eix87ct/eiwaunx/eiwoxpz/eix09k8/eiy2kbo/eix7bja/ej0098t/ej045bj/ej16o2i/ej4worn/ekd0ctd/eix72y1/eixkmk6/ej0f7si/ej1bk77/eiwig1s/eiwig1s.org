I don't know how close it would be to what you're describing, but Asimov's short story The Last Question seems like it would come close. There are also a few other short stories relating to Multivac and Galactivac as well. All the Troubles in the World I think was the name of one of them that touched on a point another poster made, that I won't reveal for spoilers.
