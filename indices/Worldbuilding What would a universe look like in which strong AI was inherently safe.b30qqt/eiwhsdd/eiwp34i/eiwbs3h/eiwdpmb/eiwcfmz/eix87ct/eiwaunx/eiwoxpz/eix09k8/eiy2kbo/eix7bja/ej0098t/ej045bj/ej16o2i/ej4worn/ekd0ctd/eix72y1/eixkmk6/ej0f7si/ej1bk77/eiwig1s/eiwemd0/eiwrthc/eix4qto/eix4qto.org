Because ai risk is not mostly a Sci fi problem. You might disagree, but op, and lots of people on the subreddit think that AI risk is a real problem, and safe AGi is just a tiny portion of the space of posible AGi.

I'm curious, why do you think AGi is necessarily safe(or at least likely to be safe) ?
