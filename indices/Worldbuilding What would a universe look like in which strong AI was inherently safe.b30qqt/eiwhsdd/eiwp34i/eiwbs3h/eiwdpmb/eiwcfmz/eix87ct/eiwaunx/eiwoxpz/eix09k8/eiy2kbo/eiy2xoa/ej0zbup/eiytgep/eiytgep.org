  Consider a paperclip maximizer. If we're precise, it's not maximizing paperclips, as paperclips aren't the sort if thing you can free into a CPU. Instead, the AI is maximizing some sensor's report about the number of paperclips.

But. . . but. . . if it does that it will lead to lead to less paperclips existing! :) How about if I make care about having accurate sensors AND paperclips?
