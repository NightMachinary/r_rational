An idea for how this might be accomplished with several interesting story possibilities.

All potential AIs are generated as Boltzmann Brains and trained within perfectly simulated, hermetically isolated digital environments. Essentially the AIs are created as "people" unaware they are simulations living within in a simulation. The simulation environment provides them all the experiences they could ever need to determine who they are as entities and is designed such that only AIs with a certain constellation of attributes (however you want to define them) are able to ascend from their isolated environments into the common digital space.
