recursive self-improvement to maximize utility is a feature of real-world AI in tasks where the AI can verify whether it was correct or not. For example, Google's speech recognition AI can tune itself based on whether the user immediately tries again or types a search - not a perfect system but over time it becomes accurate enough that they're starting to use it to create another one which can emulate a human and interact with secretaries or the person who answers the phone at your local pizza place.

But it's still limited in the scope of what it can do, because it was never trained to program a better AI (And even when that one is made, it will be limited by what the developer was able to imagine it might need to be able to do to perform its function)
