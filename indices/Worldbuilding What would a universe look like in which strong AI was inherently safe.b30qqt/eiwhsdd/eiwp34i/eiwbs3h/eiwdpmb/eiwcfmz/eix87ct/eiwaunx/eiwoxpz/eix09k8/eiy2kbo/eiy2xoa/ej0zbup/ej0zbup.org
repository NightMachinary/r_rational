An A.I programmed to maximize paperclips will not inevitably wire head itself in the manner you describe. The map is not the territory and the measure is not the actuality. If the A.I hacks its sensors to show infinity paperclips then it just means its sensors are inaccurate and it no longer knows how many paper clips there are which won't actually help it achieve its goal. Changing its utility function has the same issue in that won't actually help satisfy its current utility function.
