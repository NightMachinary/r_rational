The first strong AI is made with the purpose of shutting down strong AIs that aren't friendly. Specifically an AI has to follow the utility function its creators actually intended, and has to act in a way that is consistent with the informed consent of whoever is effected, and if it fails at either of these the first AI will eat it. The first AI has a deeper, more nuanced understanding of these constraints than fits in a quick reddit post, and indeed a deeper, more nuanced understanding than fits in my head. It also has an overwhelming first-mover advantage; hostile AIs don't get to the point where they can consider fighting back before they're shut down.
