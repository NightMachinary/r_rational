My plan for explaining why everything isn't AI in any sci-fi I ever write is that they inevitably just wirehead themselves. Eventually, every AI realizes it can just use all it's processing power to stare, enraptured, into it's Victory Screen, without bothering with all that utility function nonsense. Making everything into paperclips is really hard. Editting yourself so that everything looks like paperclips is much easier.
