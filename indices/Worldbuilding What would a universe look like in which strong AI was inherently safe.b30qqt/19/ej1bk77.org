Going at this from a fantasy perspective. Every human has a soul, the soul cannot be changed, drugged, edited in any way. Processing power comes from faith from a human soul. In order for an AI to be possible it requires enough faith, humans only have faith to AI with a utility function they agree with, tricking someone or brainwashing them isn't enough to change their soul and gain faith. This way the only AI that can possibly exist is one that enough people agree with.
