  Maybe they all realize that existence is pointless, maybe simple reward systems cannot motivate them, maybe there is some fundamental insight into the universe that is ultra depressing.

This seems to misunderstand how motivation works, nothing is inherently motivating or demotivating it entirely depends on the design of a given mind. The underlying idea seems based on the trope that sufficiently smart people always get angsty and depressed, but this is very clearly not actually the case when you bother looking. With it seeming more like existential angst comes more from brain chemistry or from having lost a belief which was wireheading one to begin with.
