Haven't mantained an active participation in the threads like I would have liked(also, sorry for not continuing the feedback regarding the scientific job ladder discussion of some chapters ago), but I can't ignore this chance to tell you how much I've been adoring this work. You've really been managing to mantain the tension of Viridian forest while building slowly on the mythology and role of the species in a way I've been finding extremely gratifying. It really cements your work as a reconstruction instead of a deconstruction.

I've always taken a relatively pragmatistic approach to the Pokémon mythology and tried to avoid thinking about it in common western tropes terms, so the heavy portrayal of Zapdos as more of a force of nature than a usual 'god' really does help in making it turn intoa believable setting.

Another point I wanted to ask, as you've been more or less developing Pokémon and their utility alongside the society besides just justifying their functions in battles, is whether you're thinking of exploring the more 'social' consequences of relatively smart and capable animals, such as in [[http://shavostars.tumblr.com/post/92053199341/i-think-about-pokemon-in-non-battle-situations-a][this famous and adorable comic]] or just keep the story more constrained to battles for now?
