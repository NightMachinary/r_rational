Thanks for the feedback, I'm glad you've been enjoying it :) We humans have never had to contend with actual gods, but struggling against and trying to conquer the forces of nature is a theme that's core to our history, and our future.

I definitely like the idea of pokemon in ancillary utilities, including social. Since they're not sapient the applications won't be as unique, but those with special powers can be particularly useful when trained properly.
