  I've read about that distinction in scale of battles in different eras before (in ASOIAF analyses), but I didn't think about the implications to mass reanimation.

If the analysis you were reading was [[https://acoup.blog/2019/06/12/new-acquisitions-how-it-wasnt-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-iii/][acoup]] then this is going to sound very familiar :-).

The difference in scale during the medieval period was a product of a collapse in centralized state power in that period in Europe, and isn't a set in stone thing that has to happen in a fantasy setting. You could have medieval technology and much of medieval aesthetics and still have big battles like this, if that's what you want.

Raids and sieges are a feature of a society where armies are small enough to actually be defeated by a castle wall. Those small armies are what you can get out of a system of hierarchical fealty relations, where the largest possible army comes from the king asking all his vassals to ask all their vassals to bring as many troops as possible. If your army is instead a permanent professional military paid in the taxes collected by your centralized government, that can be large and disciplined enough to skip the siege and build a ramp.
