  If the analysis you were reading was [[https://acoup.blog/2019/06/12/new-acquisitions-how-it-wasnt-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-iii/][acoup]] then this is going to sound very familiar :-).

That looks like the blog. I've seen it brought up in other discussions, but they commonly link that blog, so I assume it is the main source I am thinking of.

  Raids and sieges are a feature of a society where armies are small enough to actually be defeated by a castle wall.

Now I am trying to figure out if the zombies I described are enough to make Feudal-style castles impractical and sieges unnecessary. Zombies make a pretty good disposable first wave to throw at castle walls with siege ladders: you could kill the outlying peasants and raise them, equip the zombie with ladders, then have just one or two necromancers direct them. The necromancers just need to instruct them to bring the ladders forward, set them up, climb the ladders, then flail at whatever enemies are around. They don't even need to be that effective if they can outnumber the defenders and distract them long enough for the rest of the raiding force to finish the job.
