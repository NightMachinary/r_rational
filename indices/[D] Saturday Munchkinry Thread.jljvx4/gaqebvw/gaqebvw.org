You are a 3000 year old immortal human who travels across the multiverse visiting different Earths. Your occupation is “Professional Kingdom Builder”. (I might change it later so that he also has a small crew of professionals like a doctor, and civil engineer and such.) You crash land in medieval England with pretty much the exact same history of Earth up to when you arrive. Circa early 1300s. What would be the minimum amount of time needed to create a modern day satellite and all the things associated with it such as a computers and the tech required for it? For plot reasons they are on a race against time to do this is as quickly as possible. I'm guess maybe two centuries at most maybe three considering how long it took to go from 1800 to noon landing in 1961. Can it be done in an even shorter time? Thanks.

Edit: Bonus: How much longer would it take if they started from the Roman Empire? Would it just be an extra hundred years?
