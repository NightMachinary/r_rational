You may run into some moral problems, because as I view it, the absolute first step is to completely upend medieval society and install your protagonist as God-king. Feudal society is extremely unsuited for an extremely rapid scientific industrialization. Your protagonist would be opposed by basically every entrenched power there is, along a variety of lines. The Church in particular would be directly opposed to almost every action you take, every idea you have, and the Church is a /powerful/ force in medieval society. You'd be opposed by basically the entire population. I kind of skimmed over it, because the industrialization part is IMO more interesting, but it's an immense hurdle to get over before you can even start.

Installing your character as dictator for life, as the beginning of your novel or series of novels, would... uh... maybe give you some backlash from your readers.
