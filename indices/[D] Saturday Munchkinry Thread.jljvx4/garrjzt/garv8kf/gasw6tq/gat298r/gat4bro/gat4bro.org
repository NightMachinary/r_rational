Yes you could touch and hear them, and smell them and taste them. "Touching" cold or hot planets/stars will feel like a burning sensation. Same with taste. Hearing will either sound like nothing (if there's little or no atmosphere), or like whatever the planet usually sounds like(storms? wind?). Your senses cannot damage you physically, the sensations you feel with your linked senses are only a copy what you'd feel if you were to actually touch them, but without the risk of physical damage. For example you could look at the inside of a chili and feel what it would taste like, and as soon as you looked away the sensation wold be gone.

Since the astral bodies are so far away that you can't distinguish much, your other senses of the body will be similarly affected. What you hear will be the average noise across the whole planet, and what you smell/taste/touch will be the same. To narrow down it down you need to focus on more specific parts of your senses (like focusing on the voice of one random person in a mall, or one specific leaf on a tree, etc.). The ability only works if you have direct line of sight to the physical object. You can't look at an image of a star, but you can look at a star through a telescope without mirrors.
