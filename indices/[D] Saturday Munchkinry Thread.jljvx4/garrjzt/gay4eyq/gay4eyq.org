Really, this would probably feel like a strict line-of sight cone clairvoyance/peri-perception with occasional "sparks" outside your sensing field when you hear or smell something that you can't see. If the "remote touch" portion of the sense tells you not only the texture/temperature of an object but also the spacial position as it would proprioceptionively through your fingers, then you would be able to assemble very accurate spacial mental maps of your surroundings.
