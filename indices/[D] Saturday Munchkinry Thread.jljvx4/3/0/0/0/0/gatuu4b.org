That's pretty much the plot of the novel and the moral tension. The basic premise of the story is that two career kingdom builders crash into Medieval Earth. One is the protagonist the other is a literal nazi and by literal I mean he's trying to colonize the planet for colonial nazis. The reason the two are racing to build a satellite is to contact their respective space faring empires for support before the other. Basically the fascist will have an easier time of it while the protagonist will be more moral. But yeah I can see being a forever dictator would be an issue.
