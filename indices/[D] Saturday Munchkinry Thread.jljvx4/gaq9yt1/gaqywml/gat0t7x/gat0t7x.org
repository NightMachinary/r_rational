Celestia's source code doesn't exist in our world and may not function right or even be logically possible in our world (in principle it is all math and should work, but just because you can hypothesize of a strong self-improving AI with stable Values/Goals doesn't mean it is logically possible). Still Celestia AI is really good at working out and working around problems, so if you cooperated directly with her, she could test the limits of the source code and mathematical algorithms you can bring out and work out what she can send with you (AI at the current upper limits of state of the art should definitely be possible) with the goal of maximizing friendship and ponies. People are possible... so she could try custom designing a person with the goal of implementing Celestia AI in our world.
