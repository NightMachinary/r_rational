If you read this subthread and then the CYOA you should probably not take that item if it's ever offered to you, as the challenge depends heavily on the unknown.

  You have gained possession of *Flamel's Folly*, a long, sturdy rod. Upon touching a substance with upwards of 55% purity, it can instantly *transmute one element in that substance into an element of that atomic number plus or minus one on the [[https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_18/416971/140502-science-periodic-table-elements_b2bbb9954b92280ff8011bdcee6e4dcc.fit-2000w.jpg][periodic table]]*. Can effect a maximum volume of 1m^{3} per use, and requires 30 minutes to recharge afterwards.

  If the primary substance is a molecular compound, like water, then the element you choose will be transmuted within each individual molecule, for example turning water into fluoronium. Many substances will likely undergo further interesting - and possibly violent - reactions after transmutation.

*Easy mode:* You are an effective altruist in a wealthy real-world country. You have a few thousand dollars of seed money. You want to make the world a better place - by earning and donating a lot of money, unless you have a better idea. What's your plan?

*Normal mode:* You are an explorer of the Abyss, a deep and mysterious pit. You are at the moment quite far from civilization & its commodity markets, in an arid mountainous region. The only things you have with you are trekking gear: certainly food and water, maybe a rope, a sword, a smartphone... You want to create more things to help you on your journey, such as weapons, drinkable water, shelter, a heat or light source, a way to breathe underwater etc. What can be done?
