The source does not say. I don't think it's /intended/ as a perfect 3D printer, considering there are other items that do that. Good thinking though.

  filling a container with a noble gas and then back-transmuting the specific shape you want into a solid metal

This I don't think would work very well. If you transmute a gas into something that ought to be solid at room temperature, I think it would deposit as a thin, uneven layer of solid on the container's walls? Also possibly causing an implosion from low pressure. There might be niche applications for this process but I wouldn't trust it for normal objects like armour.
