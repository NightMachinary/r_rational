I guess it depends on what specifically the percent is measuring, element or molecule, and by moles or by mass, but granite is 72% SiO2 by weight. Oxygen makes up part of most of the other components, so maybe that would work instead. Silicon, aluminum, and oxygen make up pretty large amounts of any given rock, so you could easily get lucky.
