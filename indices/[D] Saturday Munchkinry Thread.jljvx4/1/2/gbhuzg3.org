Personally, I would enter the book “Number of the Beast” by RAH... One of the principle plot points is that they have a machine which allows access to all fictional universes. Use that machine to reaccess our reality without exiting the book allowing real material to be brought back and recursively access anything, essentially bypassing the rules.
