If you can pick any world you want it should be fairly easy to pick a world that is objectively better than ours and ditch earth with whoever you care about and simply not come back.

For this, there are three main criteria, although getting all three in a single book book is quite difficult.

1) The book goes on for a long time at least a mortal lifetime, but (as ties in with point #2) ideally goes on functionally forever so you never have to go back.

2) Immortality, or at least significant life extension is attainable.

3) It should be trivial for you to avoid dying, and gain a high standard of living without significant risk or requiring any luck. Ideally it should be possible to gain a standard of living fundamentally beyond what we have on modern earth. Obviously this ties in with #2 as well, since immortality existing is useless if you can't get it.

Getting any two of them together is easy (The Silmarillion grants you 1 & 3 easily if you choose to live in Valinor under the Light of the Trees, any novel where you can join the Culture gives you 2 & 3 and basically every Xianxia ever gives you 1 & 2 at the expense of you probably just being shanked by a murderhobo cultivator).
