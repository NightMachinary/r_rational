Extracting ordinary material wealth seems pretty obvious. Find whatever story that has a lot of gold that you can take, bring it to the real world. Or whatever currency you want.

If the story has to be fictional, find historical fiction for your desired time period, and bring back as many historical artifacts as you want. Any story that contains a reference to the Library of Alexandria before it was burned could work well, depending on the limitations of what things you can bring back if they no longer exist on Earth. (You could kind of cheat and jump into Worth the Candle because it has a magical backpack that can create almost any item that has existed on Earth, which at the very least could save you a lot of time and effort of getting things the hard way)

You could maybe bring back extinct species through the above method.

Talk to any historical figure that has had fictional books made that include them.

Have a fun time debating with Christians about whether the Bible counts as a fictional work for the purposes of your power. Have identical arguments with any other religious group that has a holy book.

Jump into the Culture books and find out if the limitations on bringing things back that don't exist on Earth extend to entirely biological enhancements to yourself. You could similarly de-age yourself, or alter your body however you want, provided you remain within the normal bounds of humanity. This has some obvious uses for almost any difficult medical problem.

Selling real people first person viewings of their favorite stories would be interesting.
