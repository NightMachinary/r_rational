The natural exploit is to use a story that never has to end.

Specifically, a story with time travel, so you can travel backwards over and over and so prevent the story from reaching its end.

I would just use Steins;Gate's perfectly safe time leap machine to rewind time over and over and over, gaining infinite time to do infinite research and advance technology infinitely.

One problem though, is whether the original world's time is rewinded when time is rewinded in the fictional world. I may have infinite time in the fictional world, but if the real world keeps on progressing, there won't be a planet earth to come back to when I am done.
