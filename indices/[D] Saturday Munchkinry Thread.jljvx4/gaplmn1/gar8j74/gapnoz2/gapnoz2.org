With someone cooperating with you, you could max out the forgetting by being given large quantities of information at a time, with dummy purpose made information as filler given in the same format as the real target information. You learn/remember it just well enough so that when you stop remembering it, it counts as forgotten.

So for example, if the government wanted to cover-up a secret or classified document, they give it to you mixed in with a bunch of fake but plausible documents. You study them for a few days to remember them, then go through more fake but plausible documents. At the end of the process, the real document, along with a bunch of dummy made-up documents is forgotten.
