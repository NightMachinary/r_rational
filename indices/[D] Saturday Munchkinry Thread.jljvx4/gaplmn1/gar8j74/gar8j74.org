Is there any way to control/turn off this power? If not, you should probably just die.

Because this curse makes you cripple the rest of humanity just by learning and forgetting things.

Forget what the safety/emergency procedures for anything is? Everyone forgets it. No one remembers what to do in an emergency and they get screwed over. No one remembers how to safely do tasks and so cause more emergencies. They can look it up, but that takes time, time they may not have if they are already in an emergency situation.

Forget what a word means or how to spell it? Or even how to pronounce it? Countless documents all over the world that contain that word become unreadable. People making speeches suddenly can't understand the words on the script, and neither do the audience. Movies, stories, music, many will become gibberish and nonsense. Especially with heavy accents that make it even more difficult to figure out what word they are speaking and how to look it up.

Forget about a store? Suddenly no one goes there anymore, because no one remembers that it exists.

Forget about a COUNTRY? Well, the United Nations will be very very confused about this country's representative in their midst that they don't remember at all.

Unless you have eidetic memory or something, you will constantly be forgetting things, forcing the rest of the world to also forget and have to relearn it, and in the meantime deal with the fallout from not remembering important things. You are effectively the #1 enemy of humanity, causing destruction and mayhem on a global scale.
