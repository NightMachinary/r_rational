You have access to a vial of potion that allows you enter any fictional world. It cannot be custom-written for this purpose. When you enter a story, you gain gain a copy of the book, which is your portal back home. If the book is destroyed in the original world, it is destroyed in the fictional world as well. You end when the story ends. A book-portal has any number of uses. As many people as you want can go in and out of it. You may not bring anyone or anything back from the other world that does not already exist here. So dust is fine, an Olympic medal from 200BCE is fine, but an X-Wing fighter is not. Neither are any people. What do you do?
