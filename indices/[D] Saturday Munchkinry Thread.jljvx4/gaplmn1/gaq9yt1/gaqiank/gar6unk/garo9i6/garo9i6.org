Maybe accelerated time could work even if looped time doesn't? Use the hyperbolic time chamber from dragon ball, get a year per day. There are probably other stories with more extreme time acceleration, like MoL, though there's some questions on which viewpoint is the one used for outside reference.

Though you have the very real problem of the fictional world not obeying real life laws, so you couldn't directly test anything you make in the fictional world. Still useful for lots of things, but you're not advancing science by decades at a time or something like that.
