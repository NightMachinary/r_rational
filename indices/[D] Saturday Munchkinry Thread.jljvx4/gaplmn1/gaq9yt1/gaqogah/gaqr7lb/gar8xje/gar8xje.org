If you obtain the kinshifter on the same layer, you can copy 65 dubloons worth of other Relics, then also obtain a copy of Flamel's Folly. You can now chain the effects of two Flamel's Folly together to get much more powerful effects, converting two elements in a substance by 1 atomic number of 1 element by 2 atomic numbers.

For obtaining water, get carbon ash by burning something, then convert the carbon ash to beryllium, then beryllium to lithium, then burn the lithium to get lithium oxide. Now you can convert the lithium to hydrogen, giving you a mix of hydrogen peroxide and water and oxygen (HO2 is unstable and should break down quickly). This reaction will probably be energetic given the breakdown HO2 into H2O and HO and O2. But still, water. 30 minutes cool down between each step... it would take at least 90 minutes, but you can do 1 cubic meter per 90 minutes, so if you do it in bulk to fill up all your canteens at once it isn't too bad of a time usage. Unfortunately, the level you first find Flamel's Folly on is an ice level, so limited usage their.. but you could track down the purity tree and burn it to get that carbon ash.

You could also go the other direction and convert carbon to oxygen in CH2 (methelyene) and CH4 (methane) into oxygen and get water that way.

If you have nothing to burn you could convert the Nitrogen in the air into carbon, but you are limited by volume, not mass, so you can't get a lot at once.

For edible stuff... you want sugars which are too complicated to get with single or even double atomic molecular transmutations.

For other useful stuff. Maybe silicon (common in quartz, sand, and many rocks) to aluminum to magnesium to sodium. Sodium oxide is used as flux in glass making.

If you have water, even impure/undrinkable water... you could change it to ammonia (N2 and NH3). Then if you have platinum as a catalyst, burn it to get nitric acid and water.
