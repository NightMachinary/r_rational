Hmm, this depends whether only the water's oxygen atoms get transmuted, or all oxygen atoms in the target area. Rule's unclear. I worry that too much of the non-water oxygen compounds in a body could get explodey/poisoney when transmuted. Fluorine is a lively element.

Beats being eaten, for sure, but that's uh not always the outcome of losing to an Abyss monster.
