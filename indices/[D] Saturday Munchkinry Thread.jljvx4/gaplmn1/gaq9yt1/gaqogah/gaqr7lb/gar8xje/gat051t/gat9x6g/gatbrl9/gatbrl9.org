I think its implied you can choose the volume that gets transmuted? So transmute the brain to instant kill the monster and "only" blow up the head in a reaction that hopefully isn't so explosive that the skulls fragments are dangerous. Actually, since the skull has hole, wouldn't the explosion be directed out the nose/eye sockets?

Do the tentacle monsters have central nervous systems to destroy this way?
