I think you're overlooking some practical difficulties in containing gasses when you have basic survival equipment. Methane to water seems like it could work, but how are you going to get and keep useful quantities of methane, and get to at least 55% purity?

The carbon->lithium->lithium dioxide ->water is really clever though.
