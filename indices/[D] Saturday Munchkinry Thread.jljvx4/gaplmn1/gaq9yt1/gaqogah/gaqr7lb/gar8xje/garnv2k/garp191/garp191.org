I brainstormed a bunch of ideas before seeing the range of resources in the layers that way I would already be looking for viable combos and synergies ahead of time. I was hoping there might be a natural gas deposit at some point. If there had been one it would have been viable to try tapping it.

For making containers (to hold intermediate products when using Flamel's Folly)... the Orb Weaver (layer 3) is really valuable. Actually it is valuable as a weapon as well. If you spray it into some type of improvised fragile mold that can hold it in place for the 10 seconds it takes to solidify you have a solid vessel. In my build I used this to store the created water when I realized 3 flasks is way too few. If you spray the Orb Weaver at an enemy then within 10 seconds the enemy is immobilized or at least heavily hampered if it can't rip through material as strong as iron. If you spray it at nostrils you can choke out an enemy. The Orb Weaver has no cool downs or refresh period either.

There wasn't any good source of methane on any layers, but there is stuff to burn in most of them. In Agartha, you could use Flamel's Folly to rapidly complete the land excavation job by transmuting long narrow cylinders of soil/stone into explosive/reactive materials.
