Easy- Buy as much lead as you can. Spend an hour and a half per cubic meter to transmute into platinum. Maybe go to iridium. Become unbelievably wealthy. Later, transmute uranium-238 into plutonium, solving all energy needs forever (though be careful of critical mass).

Hard- Not fully sure on what the requirements to escape are. With a single tree, you could make charcoal, then turn it into lithium to make a flare. You could kill things that get near by turning the nitrogen in the air to fluorine, at the risk of yourself. Or turn solids into gasses to make an explosion. You could slowly tunnel through rock by turning the aluminum or silicon into gasses. Turning nitrogen into carbon would give a good source of fuel, though only very slowly. Might be better as an attack, since it would suddenly create a very low pressure area.

Without a good way of containing gasses, you're really limited on what you can turn things into, since no matter which way you go you'll run into the noble gasses. You can't, for example, make water by turning carbon into hydrogen then igniting it, because you have to go through helium. Turning a solid directly into a gas would release a /lot/ of gas, and you're not going to be able to contain that for half an hour.
