Thanks. This is perfect! I needed this kind of rough outline. I might have a few wars in the novel so I might stretch the novel out a little bit longer but this is perfect. Now I just got to plan this out and not turn the book into an exposition dump. Thanks for the help. I'll be sure to credit u and [[/u/suctumbo]]
