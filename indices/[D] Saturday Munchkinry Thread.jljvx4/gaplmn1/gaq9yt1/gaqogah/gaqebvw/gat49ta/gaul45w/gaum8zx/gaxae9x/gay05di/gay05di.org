Thanks. I agree the church would be a huge obstacle and being a king wouldn't be the end all as an early goal. I agree there would be a huge war if they outright reject the church. I think then something to start out from would be to influence or become part of the church through deceit. (Something like make them believe that the pope has been chosen by God to lead the people into the future or something. Then again the pope is in Rome so that would be difficult lol.) The blogs have been really helpful in understanding that specific time period. Thanks for that.
