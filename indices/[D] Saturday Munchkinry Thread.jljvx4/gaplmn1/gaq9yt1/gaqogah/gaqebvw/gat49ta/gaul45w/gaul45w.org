I'd guess about 80-90 years. I'm assuming that if I have the means to get to this time/place in the first place, I can bring along a laptop, portable projector, and solar charger so that I can have access to thousands of downloaded reference manuals and schematics, textbooks, the entirety of Wikipedia, all published patents, reports regarding oil, gas, and mineral deposits, etc. Given that I'm 3,000 years old, I'm assuming I've probably also done this before, or at least I've done this around a similar time/place and I've learned enough to think that this approach would be easier than my previous attempts. For example, I probably already know who to turn to for assistance early on, and may have even worked with them previously.

Given all that, I don't think it's unreasonable that I'd be able to maneuver into national leadership position very quickly, possibly in under a year. For example, arriving in January of 1381 and befriending [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Tyler][Wat Tyler]] could be a quick way to overthrow Richard II and end up in a pseudo-leadership position before the end of the year serving as Wat's /extremely/ knowledgeable advisor, basically implementing an early Oliver Cromwell gambit by proxy.

From that point, quickly teaching people is going to be a significant barrier, as [[/u/suctumbo]] mentioned. Given a position of national leadership and access to future knowledge, I suspect it wouldn't be too difficult to secure a position as a teacher for teachers. I've listed every subject I could think of that might need to be covered, and it shouldn't actually require more than about 14 years, which is fantastic (!) because I doubt that the laptop, projector, and solar panel would last much longer than that without maintenance, even if they're all designed to be rugged and long-lasting. I expect these would constitute the bare minimum to get the ball rolling:

This adds up to 332 credits worth of classes for me to cover. Assuming I could teach 12 credits per semester (and assuming I hire a few trustworthy scribes to make students' copies of all of the appropriate textbooks and reference manuals), I would only need a little more than 27 semesters to complete all of this material, and I'd leave summer and winter available for remedial classes or miscellaneous scheming. On the plus side, I've probably taught all this material several times before, so I have the benefit of experience when I'm preparing and presenting lessons tailored towards a medieval-era classroom.

With Cambridge busily discussing and sharing the absurd treasure trove of information given to them, I could turn my attention fully towards succession and industrialization. For example, given that I know where all the gold and silver mines are around the world, and that I've tried mining most of them a few times already, I should be able to use my earnings from teaching to scoop up ownership of a particularly profitable mine, hire workers, and purchase equipment to exploit the mine as quickly as possible. I could provide directions on exactly where and how to get the ore, I would already know where to hire the cheapest and most reliable workers, I would've already encountered the most likely setbacks, and I would know who would be most likely to invest enormous sums of money once they see how profitable my ventures are. I would expect annual growth rates well surpassing that of Amazon in real-life (~31% on average), quite plausibly in the range of 50% annual growth rates due to both enormous profit margins and frenzied investment.

If I can sustain that pace of growth, then within seventy years, I would have multiplied my investment by over a trillion times. By this point, I would likely have the required financial resources and the country would likely have the barebones of the required industrial capabilities to launch a crude satellite into orbit.
