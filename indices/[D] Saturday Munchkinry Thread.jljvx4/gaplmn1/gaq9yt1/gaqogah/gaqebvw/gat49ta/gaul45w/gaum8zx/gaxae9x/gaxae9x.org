FWIW, I disagree with the above poster on a lot of issues.

First and foremost, acquiring enough power to make the changes would not at all be as easy as becoming the advisor to some prominent historical figure. As an entertaining overview, [[https://acoup.blog/2019/06/04/new-acquisitions-how-it-wasnt-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-ii/][these]] [[https://acoup.blog/2019/06/12/new-acquisitions-how-it-wasnt-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-iii/][two]] blog posts outline the basics of feudal society. I kind of alluded to this in other comments, but you'll note that not only is there no existing position with even a fraction as much legislative power as you would need to make your desired changes in this society, the entire system prohibits someone from getting that much power. Even if you became king within a year, the king does not hold all that much power. He's the first among equals. The various other lords and nobility all have their own control over their domains, power that they aren't giving up peacefully. You would have to fundamentally change feudal society in order to get as much power as you would need, because there is no possibility of working within the system to rule over significant parts of the country. And that fundamental change basically means a series of wars. Wars you could win, sure, you have access to information centuries ahead of the time, but you're going to spend a lot of time, resources, and people waging a war of domination against everyone around you.

Second is the problem of religion. Modern people don't always realize just how revolutionary various ideas were that we now take for granted, both societal and scientific. The idea that the Earth is not the center of the universe was heretical: Galileo spent the rest of his life under house arrest for it. The germ theory of disease was highly divisive because it meant doctors were unclean, that they needed to wash their hands to become clean, and that they had been inadvertently killing numerous patients because of their ignorance. These ideas and a dozen more would be foundational parts of any education you try to give to medieval people, and these heretical ideas would be fundamentally incompatible with religious teaching at the time.

That leads into opposition from heavily religious people of the time, i.e. almost everyone. The separation of church and state is a modern idea. The church was a foundational institution, and would employ a huge portion of the already literate men you would ideally want to use to educate the rest of the population in addition to its vast social and legal powers. Being excommunicated by the Church in medieval England means your life is basically over, because the Church commanded vast social power. The various ideas you try to educate your population with would get your entire government excommunicated a dozen times over, in addition to the dozen excommunications you got for supplanting the Church's existing legal powers. You'd have constant revolts. I really think there would be another Crusade from the rest of the continent, attempting to stop your heresy, which would be yet another war to fight while also trying to industrialize a nation.

I really wasn't exaggerating when I said you would be opposed by every entrenched power that exists.

Moving on to the education itself, I think the course lists the above poster gave are just funny. Starting at the low end, these are college/mildly pre-college classes that only work with an already high school educated populace. High schools that don't exist, using teachers that don't exist, teaching students who are badly needed on their parents' farms. I really do think it would take decades: you would first have to make a grade school through high school curriculum, teach the teachers who would teach the children, wait for them to be raised, until eventually they get to your college where you can teach them.

Keep in mind that you're trying to do this when most of the existing literate people work for the Church, and would ideologically oppose doing literally anything for you. Also keep in mind that your initial teachers will suck, because high student to teacher ratios mean worse education, and you're the only teacher.

And then there's after college; college is not at all a complete education. For the types of technical positions you would need, it is a baseline of education that allows you to become actually educated in the specific job you will do. Education which only exists on paper, because those jobs don't actually exist yet. There's no economies of scale here, there's so many minor jobs that you will never have time to directly teach people how to do them well. Your initial educated workforce will all suck because they had no one to teach them the ins and outs of their trade.

That then leaves the job of setting up rail lines, making mines and smelteries, setting up factories, all that good stuff, which at least has the advantage of clear historical precedent. No real clue as to how technology would advance when all the science and engineering is worked out from the start, and it just needs to be built. You'll also have to deal with the largest population boom possible, which should be neat.

I don't really get the point in talking about wealth and investments and whatever. The only way you're starting this off is by becoming god-king of England. Your wealth is the wealth of the country. It's not going to increase on a smooth exponential like that. Nor does the money in your bank matter at all: you're limited by infrastructure and technology.

Anyways, that's what I thought of last night, hope it helps with your novel.
