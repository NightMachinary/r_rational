Thanks for the comment. I am aiming to make a novel out of this and a realistic out of that or close to it as possible. The kingdom building ones I see operate on too short a timeframe or have too many things to right so quickly that it kind of throws off the suspension of disbelief. I think I'll start with medieval England as there are more records of that time and the conflict in society would serve for some drama. I guess pinning it around 300 years could work. Thanks again for the ideas.
