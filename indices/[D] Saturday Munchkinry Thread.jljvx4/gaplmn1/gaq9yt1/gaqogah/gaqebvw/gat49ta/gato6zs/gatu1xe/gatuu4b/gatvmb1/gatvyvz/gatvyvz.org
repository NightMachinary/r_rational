Oh just to communicate with the ships that are in space. They'd have to be a special type of satellite if they are to receive messages in time to do anything. I was using the word as a substitute but the means of communicating with these ships that are hundreds to thousands of light years away would have to be faster than speed of light. I might remove the limitation and put them closer but then that wouldn't explain why they couldn't find the planet if they were scanning.
