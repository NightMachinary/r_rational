The first step would be to accrue power, and a lot of it, since you don't want to have to fight rival factions every step of the way, and it lets us handwaved cultural problems. Let's say you're really good, and become absolute dictator within 40 years, starting from basically nothing. Your next challenge is that you have the technology/infrastructure base of medieval England. You're going to need to spend decades simply educating the people who educate the other people who educate the people who do direct work. You're introducing science to a culture that, what, still follows the four humours theory? You need to have a hugely accelerated industrial revolution, since 95%+ of your workforce producing food is not a great method of launching things into space. You obviously have a lot of advantages since you can just hand over blueprints of a Bessemer converter or a steam locomotive, along with tried and tested methods of making those things, but you're also industrializing an entire country at a ludicrous pace.

I think you should set your sights lower than a modern day satellite, since they're just so highly complex and computerized, requiring global transportation infrastructure, resource gathering, and uncountable specialized jobs. Getting the equivalent of Sputnik into space within 200 years would be an astonishing success.

I think the scope of this problem is so huge that you're never going to get anything like a complete answer as to how long it would take, not in a reddit post. The societal upheaval alone is something you could write a book about, going from most of your population being uneducated farmers, to a vastly larger population that shares almost nothing in common with their parents. Subsistence farmer to factory worker to industrial chemist in 3 generations.

I could go on, because it would take hours just to write a barebones outline of all the things you would need to do, discounting research time, but I think that's enough for now.

Starting in the Roman Empire would IMO be easier, at the very least because the Roman Empire controlled a larger territory, had a higher population, and was generally more technologically and socially advanced. But as for quantitative differences? Somewhere between a 0 and 100 year speed up, and that's as close as I can confidently say.
