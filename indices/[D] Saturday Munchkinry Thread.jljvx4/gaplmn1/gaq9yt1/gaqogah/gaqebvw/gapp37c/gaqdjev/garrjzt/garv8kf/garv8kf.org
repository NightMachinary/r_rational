So, to make sure I understand this correctly, suppose I play a game of Blackjack.

I sit down at the table, and the dealer starts shuffling the cards.

Since I can HEAR the cards being shuffled, does that mean I can SEE the cards being shuffled? But, which side of the card am I seeing? Surely it can't be from the perspective of my ears, otherwise I wouldn't be able to see through walls when I hear through walls, and the power wouldn't be that useful.
