I've thought on this one before...

Water bending clouds mixed with air bending and maybe earth bending of particulates in the air (if sand bending works this seems possible), let's you generate static electricity which you then control with lightening bending. Not a huge advantage over conventional lightening bending, but it should let you produce lower/less lethal voltages and spread the lightening around more.

Metal bending and lightening bending seems like they might lead to magnetism bending, but I can't think of any good applications for magnetism bending that metal bending can't do.

We already see Lava bending in LoK.

By precisely controlling the water and earth separately in mud you could probably get it to do stuff like soil liquefaction or make make the mud hard like the cornstarch and water trick. Earthbending can already do that on its own though.

Bend coal into a fine powder, spread with Earth and air bending, then set off massive explosions with fire bending.

Hmm.. Most of the synergies I can think of are kind of redundant with the raw power and precision the Avatar can already do with a single element with the Avatar state.
