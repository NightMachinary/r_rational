Hmm. Then the gamble that is easiest for your power is probably Mahjong.

Mahjong tiles make loud noises when they collide with each other, so you could use your power to see your opponent's hands and maybe even the tiles that would be drawn next.

Play mahjong to make lots and lots of money.

On another note: what is the maximum range of this ability? If you look up at the night sky, you can see other planets and even distant stars. Does that let you hear them? Touch them? (Would that kill you actually since they are super super hot or cold?)

If you look at Mars, could you also feel/hear the Mars Rover?

Could various spacecraft save on communication equipment by having you hear them just by looking at them, without actually sending out any telecommunications?
