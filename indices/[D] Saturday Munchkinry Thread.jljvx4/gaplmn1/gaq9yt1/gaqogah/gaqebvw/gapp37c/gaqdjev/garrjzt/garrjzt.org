All your senses are linked supernaturally. Anything you can see, you can also touch, taste, smell, and hear. This doesn't actually touch or lick whatever you look at, but it gives you the sensations of what each of your 5 senses will feel when sensing the object. It also works with your other senses, anything you can hear you can see (and smell, and touch and so on), and anything you can smell you can see. However, your senses are limited to human precision, so you won't be able to see molecules of citric acid, or touch hydrogen. Also, your brain is now wired to work with your linked senses, so you don't need to worry about adjusting. What do you do?
