  Does it work on animals?
#+end_quote

Yes, but since the human necromancer's motor skills are not those of an animal, there would be a penalty to motor coordination and skill, unless the necromancer spends years practicing and specializing with the animal.

  Do they still have the same level of addition and categorization ability?
#+end_quote

If the animal could hypothetically learn single digit addition and single digit complexity categorization the zombie of the animal can as well.

  If so, you can make computers out of lots of zombie rats. Probably limited to vacuum tube era complexity, but you can get there without electricity.
#+end_quote

Clever idea. Not a lot better than vacuum tubes, but still very useful in the early modern era for stuff like calculating tables of logarithms. Also the zombie rat computer either needs good design to keep each rat simple and interchangeable and/or the necromancer needs a lot of skill in giving commands to make the zombies follow mathematical commands.

  In more modern settings, grasping and basic object recognition are extremely hard for robots/computers
#+end_quote

That is a good point. Even simple object recognition might be very valuable in automated applications.

  If I understand your rules for extending an animation correctly (human calorie needs but meat only?) then this option would essentially never be used, since it's more expensive than feeding a slave.
#+end_quote

The sacrifice is 100% efficient in transferring life energy to the zombie, so it gets calories out of parts of the animals humans might have trouble digesting or safety eating (bones, offal, etc.). And I meant to imply the zombie has less caloric needs than a living human in upkeep... still meat is valuable so you are right that keeping the zombies going might be more expensive or at least logistically complicated than it's worth for many potential ancient applications.

  In the ancient or early modern world, where large field battles left lots of dead lying around, that'd be a strong supplement to your next battle. In the medieval world, where most warfare was sieges and small raids, you wouldn't frequently have fresh dead around to make that big of a difference.
#+end_quote

Good point. I've read about that distinction in scale of battles in different eras before (in ASOIAF analyses), but I didn't think about the implications to mass reanimation.
