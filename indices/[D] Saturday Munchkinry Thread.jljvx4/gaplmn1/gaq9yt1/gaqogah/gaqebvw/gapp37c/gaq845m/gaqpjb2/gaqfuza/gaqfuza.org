  If I understand your rules for extending an animation correctly (human calorie needs but meat only?) then this option would essentially never be used, since it's more expensive than feeding a slave

Disagree on this part. The zombie magically consuming a live animal is still useful because you can use animals that normally humans wouldn't eat, and you remove any effort expended in processing the animal to turn it into food. I'm thinking that you could breed rats to then give to the zombies, because rats feed on almost anything, breed quickly, and are too small and gross for humans to eat in normal circumstances.
