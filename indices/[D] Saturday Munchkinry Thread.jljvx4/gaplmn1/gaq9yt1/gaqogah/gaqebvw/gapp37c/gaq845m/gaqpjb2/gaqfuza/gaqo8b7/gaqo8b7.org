You are thinking along the same lines I was... Sacrificing rats to the zombies was exactly what I was thinking of as a use. And the sacrifice counts the whole animal, even offal that a human couldn't eat. And the zombie uses the calories more efficiently than a living human. So at the very least, zombie beat slave labor in calorie efficiently that way, although the logistics of living animals might be too annoying to work with. (You could feed the rats trash and save on food costs and get enough rats for a few zombies, but any large scale farming of rats that exceeds the trash you have would require a more dedicated food source for the rats and possibly lose the cost efficiency.)
