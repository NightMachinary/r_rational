Does it work on animals? Do they still have the same level of addition and categorization ability? If so, you can make computers out of lots of zombie rats. Probably limited to vacuum tube era complexity, but you can get there without electricity. Early computers were used to compute artillery firing tables, tabulate business expenses/resources/etc, brute force tables of results for scientific equations, and for cryptography. So those are all more advanced than you may expect. (This is all possible with animated humans of course, but you should just hire a human computer instead.)

In more modern settings, grasping and basic object recognition are extremely hard for robots/computers and trivial for humans, so you should expect zombie labor to be integrated into more conventional factories where that's applicable. Fruit picking in particular is still very manual. However, our society jumps through some extra hoops to pay migratory farm workers particularly little, so it'd be hard to get your zombie prices lower than that.

The way you've defined the limitation of zombies doesn't make them /that/ much cheaper than a harshly exploited labor force. In the ancient era, mine labor was considered a death sentence, and turning a mill stone a particularly harsh death sentence, and society still found a way to make those things happen. Your zombie setup gets a few extra weeks of work out of the slaves in exchange for a few minutes of work from an expert, so necromancy is a good profession to be in, but it would only be a marginal gain on overall economic output. If I understand your rules for extending an animation correctly (human calorie needs but meat only?) then this option would essentially never be used, since it's more expensive than feeding a slave.

Military-wise, zombies can be used to deliver suicide bombing attacks or chemical weapons. Otherwise, the high cost means you'd mostly be limited to turning the enemy's recently-killed dead against them. In the ancient or early modern world, where large field battles left lots of dead lying around, that'd be a strong supplement to your next battle. In the medieval world, where most warfare was sieges and small raids, you wouldn't frequently have fresh dead around to make that big of a difference.
