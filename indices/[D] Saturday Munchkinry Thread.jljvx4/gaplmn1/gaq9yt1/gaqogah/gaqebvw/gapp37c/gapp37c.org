*Generic Fantasy Necromancy*: Dead bodies can be animated with touch contact and a minute or so of concentration (ten of minutes for inexperienced necromancers). They will stay animated for several weeks before crumbling away. This time can be extended by sacrificing living animals, generally as much continued animation as the calories of the animal. Repeatedly extending the time may cause the reanimated body to wear away eventually. Bodies that are just skeletons require scaffolding of additional material to hold them together. Bodies that have been dead longer hold up to repeated extension of animation time better.

The bodies are controlled by the animating necromancer until another necromancer spends a few minutes with touch contact and concentration. The bodies can be commanded to perform any simple physical task the necromancer can or that the body was able to do in life, but they have poor coordination and poor motor skills, especially if only one or the other is able to perform the task. If both the necromancer knows the skill and the body had the skill in life, the animated body can perform the task with okay coordination. Tasks that require mental effort beyond single digit addition or sorting by a single digit number of categories are beyond the animated. With focus, the necromancer can control a single specific body with precision. Range of control is a few miles (for inexperienced necromancers) to tens of miles (for experienced necromancers). Reanimated

Necromancy requires several months of meditation and mental exercise to get the basic animation and several years to get better at control, gain more range, and be able to give more detailed commands, and reduce the time concentrating required.

Economically most valuable usages (modern/medieval/fantasy setting)? Munchkinry loopholes I missed? Best way to weaponize?
