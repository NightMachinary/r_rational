Your power is this: When you forget something, everyone else who knew it forgets it as well. For example, if you forget which day of the week it is, so does everyone else. If you forget a word, everyone else who knew that word in the same language forgets it as well. Now, everyone else can relearn things after you forget them - they can just look at their calendar to see what day of the week it is, for example. But of course you can learn things multiple times as well, and every time you forget, so does everyone else.

How do you use this power? It has a bit of an unusual limitation in that if you try to forget something very specific you will probably only remember it all the better, but there are still uses for it, I think.

(For the purposes of this ability, having to spend a few seconds to remember something still counts as remembering it. It needs to be 'gone', such that you can no longer recall the memory/knowledge unaided. Also, death or brain damage would not activate the ability.)
