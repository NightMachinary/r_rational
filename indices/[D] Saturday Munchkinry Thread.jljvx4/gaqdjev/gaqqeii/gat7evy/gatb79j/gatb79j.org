Possibly? If I recall correctly, MRI uses the magnetic resonance you get from different quantities of water and other properties that alter magnetic resonance, (I know fMRI is basically just seeing blood flow)... so it would probably just be more efficient to use/develop a sense of blood and blood flow (presumably blood bending+Earthbending echolocation could let you invent blood echolocation)...
