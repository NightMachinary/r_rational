Earth and fire bending might let you bend the impurities out of metals which could be useful for making high-quality iron and steel. Most importantly, this also allows you to inexpensively make un-bendable metals to construct shackles and prisons for containing skilled metal-benders.

Earth bending could be used for building houses or other structures, as well as furniture, kilns, water towers, wells, even forming plumbing and sewage pipes out of stone. Metal bending could be used to make various parts and pieces that might be needed, like doorknobs, locks, sink faucets, shower heads, etc. You could use water bending to fill the water tower, and fire bending along with earth bending to create and purify glass windows to install in the buildings.
