Mostly offtopic, but is there a good description of Eliezer's beliefs re: monetary policy, etc? (This is apropos the quote "On the other hand, right now (2014) the European Central Bank is making textbook economics errors causing trillions of euros of pointless damage to the European area"). I've seen NGPD Targeting be mentioned, but never explained or advocated for clearly.
