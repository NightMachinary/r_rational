I think of the dementors as representing loss-of-value, of which death and depression would both be instances. Depression because you stop caring and because of anhedonia. Death, well, because without sentient beings to enjoy the world, the world doesn't have much value. Also, most humans value life very much.

When HPMOR!Harry became demented, he didn't fall dead, he became a being with a utility function that assigns zero or less utility to everything.

Oh. And you can heal from contact with dementors through chocolate. That's another point for depression.
