Yeah, I know that by the Word of God, they're depression and nothing more. But there's also such concept as [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor][Death of the Author]]. So I think, that if only clarification is the World of God (not inside the work itself), it's fair to argue, that author's presentation could be interpreted a certain way, even if the author didn't mean it that way.
