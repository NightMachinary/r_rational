I think this gets at a lot of what I was thinking about when talking about /Star Trek/ yesterday. If you see a replicator, and ask "Why doesn't the Federation replicate people?", or see a transporter and ask "Why doesn't the Federation just use transporter spoofing to make a second person?" the answer has to be something like:

- It can't, because the Federation would have tried to do that as soon as the technology was in prototype stage.
- It can, but it's so strongly taboo that no one does it.
- It can, but the technology is tightly controlled by some entity.
- It can, but there are technological problems that prevent it from being worthwhile (like single-bit errors).

The answer /cannot/ be "No one thought of it," at least, not if you want people to read and enjoy your fanfic. And in the Trekverse, where there are trillions of people with access to near infinite knowledge and resources, along with dozens of /other/ cultures with divergent values, any munchkin attempt immediately raises the question of why it wasn't done before.
