Just to clarify here, but she didn't say that Dementors /are/ depression, she said that they were /inspired by/ depression, specifically her bouts of clinical depression. When people say that Dementors don't make a lot of sense as depression, that's because they're not depression. But I think that people around here get it confused with HPMOR, where Dementors are much more literally death. Rowling's Dementors were just an analogy.
