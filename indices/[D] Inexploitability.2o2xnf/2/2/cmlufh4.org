Yeah, I think Eliezer is just dead wrong about this one, and seems to get more caught up on their appearance than what they actually do. Why do happy thoughts fight off death? Why does death make your worse memories play out again and again? Why are there more of them when everything is gloomy and sad? Why does chocolate make you feel better?

[Also, my own head canon is that they absolutely can be destroyed by a concerted patronus charm, I know word of god is that they cannot be destroyed, but that's absolutely silly: in story its not actually clear if they can be destroyed or not]

EDIT: it's worth noting that I have no real problem of them being death in hpmor, just in Eliezer claiming that they are obviously death.
