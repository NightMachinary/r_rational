I think the point comparing to governments messing up would be more salient in response to people who respond to things that they wouldn't do, or they don't find acceptable with "That would never happen" if people /in real life/ didn't have that exact response to things that are /in real life/.

It's the old joke about people having taken 101 classes and then looking at the world with that knowledge and just being completely exasperated, before you follow the (often quite long) chain of hows and whys things are the way they are (which are often misleading or potentially unknowable for that person), the initial reaction is to do that, and since people usually just react in reviews that seems fine to me. Especially when you consider that none of that information is known, people have deduced that the population of Harry Potter is small, but reading the books you have no indication to jump from: seeing apparent flaw in universe, to long list of rationalism for it, instead of assuming it wasn't important enough for the author to spend time making sense on it, which was again a lot of peoples reaction to the student number of Hogwarts too, especially when if they do you have to assume that the author then researched this information to compose this, but then spent that effort doing that but didn't bother adding a throw in line to make it clear.
