The best examinations of spirit stones as a concept I know of are World of Cultivation and Forge/Threads of Destiny. That isn't saying much though. FoD uses them as an excuse for xianxia mechanics in the fundamental magic system of the setting, and are otherwise just stones you can mine in certain sports that don't have any elemental aspect to them. WoC makes it clear that an x level spirit stone represents y average cultivator hours of work. The high end sects have techniques that let them absorb spirit stones with high efficiency, and when a new cultivation system is (re)discovered, people have to find new sources of spirit stones of that type.
