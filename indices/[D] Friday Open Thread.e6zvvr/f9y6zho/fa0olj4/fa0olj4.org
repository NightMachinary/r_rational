  The logic goes like this: pretty much any system outside of ridiculously simple toy models is chaotic. Chaotic systems have infinitesimally small information encoded in their initial conditions become macroscopically relevant at long times. Therefore, in order for the future evolution of, say, a system of three bodies orbiting each other to be fully determined, their positions at t = 0 would need to be encoded by real numbers. But real numbers contain an infinite amount of information, and we know that there is a limit to how much information you can pack in a certain volume of space before you get black holes. Bringing QM into it doesn't significantly change the argument because wavefunctions and Hamiltonians still use real numbers. Hence, there must always be some intrinsic randomness due to the universe having limits on, well, numerical precision - just like any computer simulation.

It seems to me that he's conflating rules that apply within the universe, such as the Bekenstein Bound, with rules that apply to the underlying reality (whatever that may be).

If I created a simulated universe and imposed a limit equivalent to the Bound within that universe, that wouldn't mean that the numbers I used to represent the simulated universe would be subject to that same limit. That argument should apply to our own universe as well.

  Basically, you can't rule out superdeterminism, therefore the scientific enterprise is completely moot. I don't think he's wrong there, but then he makes a step saying that the scientific enterprise is actually meaningful, therefore free will must exist, and that seems more like wishful thinking to me.

If there's some sense in which everything is pointless because it's predetermined or whatever, then it's also pointless to worry about the pointlessness, so IMO we shouldn't.
