  If I created a simulated universe and imposed a limit equivalent to the Bound within that universe, that wouldn't mean that the numbers I used to represent the simulated universe would be subject to that same limit. That argument should apply to our own universe as well.

That would only work if that additional information stayed hidden forever, which it doesn't. If the information contained now within a sphere of 1 nm of diameter will be relevant in a million years to the configuration of this entire sector of interstellar space, then that information /is/ real to the universe, and part of it, and thus should obey the Bekenstein Bound. What you're saying applies more to stuff like hidden variable theories of QM, where we hypothesise there is a "true" value for observables, we just have no way to know it to enhance our predictions beyond the Heisenberg indetermination limit.
