- Use conditions: Can't do X until Y is done. This one is really OP, specially if you really can't do without X.
- Change word usage. Use 'Want to' instead of 'Have to' and 'Get to' instead of 'Got to'. This improves mood and motivation.
- Make rules and laws for yourself and follow them. And respective punishments if you don't. If you're naturally lawful or conscientious this helps a lot.
- Somethings can only get done if you allocate time into them. i.e writing, getting ideas, planning..
- Statistical thinking can be less helpful than positive thinking if you're doing difficult (unlikely) things.
- If what you have to do is uncomfortable (upsets your stomach) the less thinking the better. Pre-plan the task and do it when the time comes, if you start thinking then you will likely procrastinate. Helpful if you're asking for a raise, or asking somebody out..
- Checklists are OP and you should use them for everything. Checklist Manifesto is a great book.
