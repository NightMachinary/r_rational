So I've just read a series of papers by Swiss physicist Nicolas Gisin which I found philosophically pretty interesting:

[[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06824.pdf][Indeterminism in Physics, Classical Chaos and Bohmian Mechanics. Are Real Numbers Really Real?]]

[[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01497.pdf][Time really passes, science can't deny that]]

[[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.08300.pdf][Collapse, what else?]]

These are various musings about the determinism vs. free will, and why the author believes in the latter without necessarily believing in dualism. The argument that struck me the most here is the one that Newtonian classical mechanics are, really, not deterministic at all. The logic goes like this: pretty much any system outside of ridiculously simple toy models is chaotic. Chaotic systems have infinitesimally small information encoded in their initial conditions become macroscopically relevant at long times. Therefore, in order for the future evolution of, say, a system of three bodies orbiting each other to be fully determined, their positions at t = 0 would need to be encoded by real numbers. But real numbers contain an infinite amount of information, and we know that there is a limit to how much information you can pack in a certain volume of space before you get black holes. Bringing QM into it doesn't significantly change the argument because wavefunctions and Hamiltonians still use real numbers. Hence, there must always be some intrinsic randomness due to the universe having limits on, well, numerical precision - just like any computer simulation. He doesn't mention space-time being discrete, but that seems the obvious next step in logic to me.

He then makes an interesting argument that rationality and scientific thinking are only possible in a context in which free will exists. It goes like this: in order to falsify a theory, you must be able to choose which experiments to perform. If you can't choose, then you performing the experiment, and the outcome of it, could be part of a grander, ridiculously complex law. You can never be sure what would have happened if you did not perform the experiment, or what happens when you do not, because your performing or not performing the experiment is as necessary and sure a consequence of the laws of nature as everything else. Basically, you can't rule out superdeterminism, therefore the scientific enterprise is completely moot. I don't think he's wrong there, but then he makes a step saying that the scientific enterprise is actually meaningful, /therefore/ free will must exist, and that seems more like wishful thinking to me. Or perhaps he just means the alternative would make our own lives and work entirely meaningless, so we best work in the assumption that it's not the case, or nothing really would matter anyway.

In general, though, they're fun and interesting reads, which don't require much specialised knowledge. I'm not sure how even proving that randomness is an inevitable part of the laws of nature would then translate into "free will" without some kind of mind-matter substance dualism, but it seems at least an interesting thought to explore. At the very least, something I do like is the idea that quantum collapse is an objective process. I lean towards that sort of belief myself, though I can't discard Many Worlds either. Copenhagen though is just handwaving and pretending the problem doesn't exist.
