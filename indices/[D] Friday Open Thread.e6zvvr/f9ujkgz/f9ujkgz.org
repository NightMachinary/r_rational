Often a common theme in fantasy rational or not is that the MC has some level of motivation that is higher than others. I'm trying to translate that into real life for myself because I have such a hard time moving forward. Does anyone have any rational ways of dealing with motivation? I used to use my depression as a driving force but it's stopped working lately and I'm on meds to make sure it doesn't come back anyway. How do you keep doing stuff when you feel lost or inadequate?
