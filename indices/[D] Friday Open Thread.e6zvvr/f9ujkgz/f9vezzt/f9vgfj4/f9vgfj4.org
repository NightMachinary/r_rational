A few bits of advice, not really a cohesive thing:

You can only have so many top-level priorities. Maybe three? Society generally expects you to prioritize more things than can be prioritized. You have to ignore some of it to be a healthy person.

Taking care of yourself needs to be really high on the list of priorities, especially if you're prone to any kind of depression. Even if you're off trying to save the world, you probably should put things like eating, bathing, exercising, and sleeping on schedule higher on your list. Naive trade-offs against self-care don't work because slacking off on self-care chains together.

Even if you have a goal that you're intrinsically motivated about, you can't do that thing all day every day, or even all day minus self care. We're not built to do that for more than a few days in a row. One helpful way to maintain long term motivation is strict time-boxing: work on your thing for a set period of time every day, but just as importantly, /don't/ work on it outside of that period. You want that feeling that you really want to cheat and work on your thing outside of the time box, because it means you still want to keep working on it.
