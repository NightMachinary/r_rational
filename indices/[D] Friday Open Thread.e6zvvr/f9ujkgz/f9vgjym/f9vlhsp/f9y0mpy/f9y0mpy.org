To me it seems like such spirit stones wouldn't be a simple currency; they would be a resource in and of itself. Since creating them requires effort, spirit stones would effectively be crystallised labour, which can then be used by someone else to advance their power level. So I think that works just fine, it's like any other economic good. The only difference is they're not scarce in the sense in which, say, gold is scarce, so that the work a gold hunter would do looking for it is also limited by the amount available in the environment. However, labour requires time, and in this case probably something to accumulate experience (like monsters to hunt), and both time and monsters /are/ a scarce resource.

So they're not forging currency, they're mining it. Not unlike Bitcoin, with the notable exception that the only usefulness of the work that goes into making Bitcoin is that it allowed the Bitcoin system to exist (which is why it's liable to end up as a bubble), while the work poured into the spirit stones can be reconverted into useful work at any time. It's like buying empty batteries, hooking them to a bicycle generator, recharging them by pedalling for a day, and selling them back charged at a surplus.
