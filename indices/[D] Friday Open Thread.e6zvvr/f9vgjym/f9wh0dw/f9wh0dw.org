To my understanding cultivators are typically depicted using the bartering system with monster/demon parts, pills, armor, tools, weapons, formations, knowledge, and the like up for trading.

Spirit stones are like one use battery packs that refill you when Qi is low or when your Qi pool needs to overfill to break into the next realm. It's used as bartering material because having lots of battery packs is a plus while having no or too little battery packs is bad in a potentially life threatening situation or when you need your Qi pool filled fast.

I have no idea how economics would work if anyone could potentially make their own currency. Never read anything that went into the subject either. Bad if the currency isn't regularly and quickly taken out of circulation. Good if... I have no idea.

Counterfeiting

I think counterfeiting would be used as a weapon. Like the reason Spirit stones (SSs) are used is because they are neutrally aligned and don't have any drawbacks. I could see tainted spirit stones in circulation crippling or harming cultivators long term and short term cultivation wise and or health wise. Either messing with an enemy nation's cultivators or messing with an individual in a trade deal. (It would of course be very bad news if someone was tainting SSs and the person in question would very likely get lynched by a host of cultivators.)

Supply and demand

SSs as a resource is typically produced in vast quintiles in many places and could potentially be artificially produced if Qi was concentrated in a limited enough area. Though the artificial SSs are just an idea of mine and I don't believe I've ever seen them in a story. Something close though is sects and clans making formations to draw in the surrounding Qi and making a Qi rich area to cultivate in or to grow resources in. Anyhow demand- the demand for SSs is pretty so so with cultivators sometimes not taking them as payment. SSs are used when in a trade with two parties, one doesn't have cultivation resources (CR) (artifacts, monster parts, pills) while the other does have the a CR needed by the other party or has a service that the other party needs. SSs are used to supplement the lack of CRs or services the lacking party cannot provide. The bulk of trade is in CRs and services.

Currency as a consumable

When a currency is a consumable.... I got no idea. The thing on the forefront of my mind is "Hope it doesn't run out". Doesn't really apply to SSs as CRs are the bulk of the economy in low tech and high tech cultivator stories. Though in high tech and low tech stories the good toys are powered with SSs and not CRs.

One thing of note is that cultivators sometimes have to deal with mortals and as such could potentially have various currencies and precious mortal materials (metal, gems) on hand.
