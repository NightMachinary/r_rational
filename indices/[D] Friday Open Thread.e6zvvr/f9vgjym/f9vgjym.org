This is probably better meant for Wednesday World Building thread, but it's a little late in the week to post there and I definitely won't remember my questions in time for the next week's thread.

In cultivator novels, there are spirit stones or something similar that every cultivator can use to either advance their cultivation/power levels or as a form of currency to trade for resources. They also often have the cultivators be able to create the spirit stones (which would cost qi and if consumed at 'full' qi reserves, it advances power levels).

My question is that is there any economic literature, articles, or books on how the laws of economics function when people use currency that can be produced by any single individual member of a nation? Does counterfeiting still make sense as a concept? How does supply and demand for spirit stones work if large sums are constantly being produced and consumed all at once versus a normal central government printing a nation's currency? How does it work when currency has an alternative use outside of trade? The only thing similar is when gold was often used as jewelry outside of trade, but it's not similar to how spirit stones aide in personal development.

The only thing that seems similar to our world is if there was an economy that used food as a currency and I definitely didn't find any such wacky cultures in my google searching.

I would also appreciate it if anyone can suggest cultivation novels that delve deeply into investigating these questions.
