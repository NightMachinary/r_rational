  Hair, severed body parts, and grafted body pieces don't count for the one-centimeter rule.

Aw! /Picks up chopped off hands and glues them back on./

  TL;DR you have super strength via short-range telekinesis. Try to find clever applications other than punching things really hard.

I'm going to assume that since this is telekinesis, you don't feel the pushback from things you push with your telekinesis. Otherwise if you tried punching things really hard, your fist would break from the pushback.

  I'm pretty sure this doesn't let you fly by pushing against air- you don't have that much air within a centimeter of your skin, and you'd need to push that air awfully fast to fly - although I'd be happy to be proved wrong.

Can you just hold yourself up? Like, telekinetically grab parts of your body and hold them up or throw them upwards?

  You can form arbitary telekinetic constructs so long as they're within one centimeter of you, up to some precision that is high enough to let you manifest cutting blades but low enough to not let you reforge molecular bonds.

Can I create fans on my skin? Like a bunch of spinning telekinetic blades, pushing air through them? How fast can I spin them? Enough to generate a cooling breeze? What about wind attacks?

Using the fans, could I swim at super speed through water? Or if not fans, what about a treadmill like shell around your body, pushing things in front of you to the side and then back behind you? Can you swim through the earth?

What about heat generation? Rub your telekinetic constructs against each other until they catch fire? Being 1 centimeter from your skin means you get burned too, but it may be useful in a pinch.
