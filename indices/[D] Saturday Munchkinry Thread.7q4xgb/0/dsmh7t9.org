TL;DR you have super strength via short-range telekinesis. Try to find clever applications other than punching things really hard.

You have very short-range telekinesis. Specifically, you can sense the location of and exert force on anything within one centimeter of your skin. The telekinesis isn't particularly strong, but it does give you a really good grip on surfaces that you otherwise wouldn't have a grip on (allowing for very steady footing/Spiderman-style climbing skills). Hair, severed body parts, and grafted body pieces don't count for the one-centimeter rule. The strength the telekinesis can exert is peak human level, so no ripping apart metal cubes with your mind (although you could manifest some sort of cutting edge/drill).

You can form arbitary telekinetic constructs so long as they're within one centimeter of you, up to some precision that is high enough to let you manifest cutting blades but low enough to not let you reforge molecular bonds.

I'm pretty sure this doesn't let you fly by pushing against air- you don't have that much air within a centimeter of your skin, and you'd need to push that air awfully fast to fly - although I'd be happy to be proved wrong.
