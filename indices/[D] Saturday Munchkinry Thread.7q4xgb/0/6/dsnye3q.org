If force is fixed, then power output can be made really big by applying that force to something moving really fast. You're not crashing the energy market or anything, but I'm sure you could find a use for a few megawatts.

1 cm can still be a pretty good distance. With the right barriers, you could work with things in vacuum, at molten-metal or near-absolute-zero temperatures, in a biologically isolated environment, etc. Can't think of anything too crazy, but there's got to be some economically useful low-volume high-cost applications.

If your dexterity is good, you could probably become one heck of a goldsmith. Or surgeon.
