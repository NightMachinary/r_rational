Aha, so under these assumptions my first step would be to see what proportion of "me" was necessary in a volume for me to have telekinetic control of that volume. Goal: maybe I can aerosolize my blood (saved up ahead of time), like a tear gas grenade, to temporarily give me a larger volume of control.

Alternatively, I could have a "lab" where the atmosphere contains the correct proportion of aerosolized blood and I therefore am completely telekinetic.
