Random thoughts: You can float (in water) and keep yourself warm by creating forcefields to keep air in. Likewise, you can probably swim faster. What qualities do telekinetic constructs have? Are they green lantern types, forcefield types, can I dictate materials for them to imitate? You would be an excellent melee fighter- one inch punches hit as hard as roundhouse kicks from a centimeter away. Also, peak humans can rip apart metal cubes, at least small ones, so similar feats may be possible.
