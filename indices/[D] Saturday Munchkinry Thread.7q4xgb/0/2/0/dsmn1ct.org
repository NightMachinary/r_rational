Telekinetic constructs are invisible forcefields. They can bend/curve, but don't have volume. They inhibit movement in both directions, so you can't use a one-way setup to compress gas. You can wrap your body in one large field, (Glory Girl), or wrap your body in many small, sharp fields (Narwhal). Multitasking probably limits the number of small fields to a couple hundred, and you wouldn't have anywhere near perfect micromanagement.

If pushing against something bearing down with more force than the forcefield can exert, the forcefield doesn't shatter but moves with some inertia. Parts of forcefields that would be pushed inside your skin or further than 1cm away disappear without causing you harm.

Floating in water is a very good point - a 1cm bubble of air creates somewhere between 15-20 litres of air, which is more than enough to make the human body buoyant. That's also a bit over two minutes of relaxed breathing - although I haven't crunched the numbers to see if "ideally applied human strength" could , it's probably enough to bring a bubble of air might function in vacuum?
