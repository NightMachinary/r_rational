  Floating in water is a very good point - a 1cm bubble of air creates somewhere between 15-20 litres of air...

That seems surprisingly large, but I checked the math and you're right. Taking an average healthy adult male (70 kg, 180 cm), the standard [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_surface_area][body surface area]] formula would yield about 1.9 square meters of surface area. Multiply by 1 cm and you get 0.018 cubic meters, or ~18 liters.
