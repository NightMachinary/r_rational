- *Telekinetic gun:* Imagine a telekinetic tube 1 mm in diameter going down the length of my right arm with a telekinetic storage chamber on my right shoulder. Fill the chamber with air by creating a chain of telekinetic discs which move backward from the mouth of the tube. Assuming I'm limited to about 100 lb. of force, I can achieve a pressure of 155,000 PSI, or about 2.5x the maximum chamber pressure of a browning .50 cal machine gun. Switch that 1 mm tube to a â‰¤1 cm tube, place an appropriate projectile inside, then release the gas chamber to fire. Assuming I can produce about 909 watts of power (sprinter equivalent), I can produce a shot equivalent to a .50 BMG once every 22 seconds (though obviously I'm limited to 10 mm projectiles, I can use heavy projectiles at ultra high speeds).

- *Flight:* Assuming sprinter levels of work (909 watts), it would be possible to produce 909 newtons of thrust, or about 13 newtons/kg for an average healthy male. Achieve this with constantly moving blades/waves of telekinetic force forming near your head and rapidly moving down over your body until they're fast enough to achieve peak thrust. As long as you're not overweight, you'll be able to fly straight upwards, though you'll be limited to sprinting distances.

- *Scuba diving:* Create a large pressurized air chamber and then surround yourself with enough rocks/dirt to become neutrally buoyant. Drop the dirt/rocks as you use up your available air to maintain neutral buoyancy. Create telekinetic fins/flippers around your hands and feet to make swimming easier. Don't go more than about 50-100 ft. deep to avoid nitrogen narcosis.

- *Burrowing:* As with the flight example, you can use blades of telekinetic force to turn yourself into a drill to slide through dirt. As with the scuba diving example, you can take a pressurized telekinetic air tank with you for breathing while underground. Ideally you'll want a very large number of relatively small blades so that your body almost acts frictionless as it glides through the dirt.

Edit: Corrected my math on the flight section.
