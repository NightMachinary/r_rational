You are a study group of five that stumbled across the secret of magic. That was your first mistake.

It turns out the global flow of magic is finite, it is already in use, and the Immortal Arch-Wizards of Earth are not interested in you burning through mega-thaums of mana figuring out how to light a candle.

Fortunately, summarily murdering you is socially unacceptable. (most new mages are friends or family to an arch mage that fucked up the secrecy protocols. So killing out of hand is not on. You do not fit this category, but you still get the standard courtesies. Such as they are.) The standard protocol is instead to toss you into a time line that has a viable biome but no indigenous toolusers.

"Resources" you are getting courtesy of... Lets call her Morgana.:

120 people that will not be reported missing. She mostly procured these by rescuing them from durance most vile and healing any health problems. So, 120 sex trafficking victims, drug addicts written of by everyone and oh yhea, one petrochemical engineer being held hostage by the cartel up until five minutes ago. Yes. She left a major trail of bodies rescuing these people. All of them had it coming. If you want food for a horror novel, I guess you could interview your new tribe.

All in literally perfect health, but also you know. Kind of traumatized.

A container of hand tools, a lathe, five computers and enough solar cells to run them. Not gaming machines, but magically indestructible, loaded with a vast collection of reference works compiled with no regard whatsoever to copyright law and locked to you personally.

Most interesting, also contains a series of manuals on sorcery. A very /long/ series.

30 geared compound sports bows for hunting.

So: Morgana will point the cross time gate at any set of coordinates on planet earth equivalent you ask her to. The timeline she has in mind is in an iceage. You also have 9 days and 9 hours to collect any additional crap you want showed through. If you want more stuff from earth, you can get it when you chew through enough of the manuals on sorcery to open your own gates. That will take a approximately 300 years. You are under magical compulsion to not say anything to anyone not in your new tribe..

Where do you go, what do you bring.
