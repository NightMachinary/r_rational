I have to ask, is the magic in the alternate timeline connected to the Earth's finite magic? If so, how is tossing you there supposed to stop you from wasting it? If not, why the heck are the immortal archmages not coming to this timeline to use the magic here for their magical experiments and what not? It clearly doesn't cost them much to do so, since they are willing to waste whatever it costs on you and 120 other people.

Also you are screwed. Not only is the ice age a literal hell on earth, you're stuck with 120 other people who have no compulsion to obey you or not murder you in your sleep, and many of whom have made horrible life decisions like taking drugs or getting involved in criminal cartels.

I have no idea how you are even going to handle the heating problem. (I assume that by iceage, you mean the entire planet is covered in ice. Otherwise you can just pick the parts of Earth that are still warm and the iceage wouldn't really mean anything.) You can hide underground or in a cave somewhere, but then your solar cells would get no sunlight and you wouldn't be able to use your computers and would be wasting your time not learning any magic. You can try to bring over as much burnable fuel as you can, but that's not sustainable.

You will have to somehow build a power plant for heat/electricity on the other side, but what would it be? The easy one, hydroelectric, isn't available since all the water is frozen. Wind and solar are unreliable, and since they are outdoors, where falling hail can regularly damage them, they will need frequent maintenance. Good luck forcing the 120 people out to work on them in the freezing climate. As for coal/gas/oil, where would you find them?
