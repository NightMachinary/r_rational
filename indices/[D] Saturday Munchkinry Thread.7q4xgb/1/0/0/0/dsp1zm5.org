  If the timeline is close enough to ours, coal/gas/oil will be in the same spots as on Earth, which can be looked up on the Internet.

That's a good point. Would Morgana let you check whether the coal/gas/oil is there though? Otherwise you risk bringing over everything you need for a coal/gas/oil power plant and then finding nothing there.

  It could be that they are using personal timelines for experiments, but that mana cannot be transported between them and so they need to use the primary timeline's mana for effects within it.

Hmm, I suppose that could work if there are tons of timelines, plenty of them to conduct experiments in while still having plenty leftover to toss random nubby mages.

  If the whole planet was frozen over, hunting bows wouldn't make sense.

/Looks at bow./

/Looks at 120 people./

Jokes aside, I kinda ignored the hunting bows part, because food really isn't a problem. You have 9 days to take out massive loans from everywhere and buy tons of preservable foods to throw across the timeline gate. The fact that you have a planet-sized freezer to store them all in makes it fairly easy to prolong their shelf life for decades. Heating up your living areas is the real problem.
