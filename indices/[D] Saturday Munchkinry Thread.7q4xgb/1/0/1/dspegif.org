No, each timeline has its own magic supply determined by how much life is on that time line. So you get a planets worth to yourselves. Not a prime planet, but a planet.

Its not snow-ball earth - There are still places that are outright tropical, but its also not the most fantastic place for farming because the weather patterns are not all that stable.

Gates take nine days and nine hours of continuous casting to open. You have to enchant yourself quite heavily for the sleep deprivation to even be survivable - Its not worth it for casual use, tough yes, the very most magically intensive experiments and projects do take place on empty earths. (Also, this is for safety. Major fuckups can have nuclear bomb level consequences at the high end. That typically will not kill a wizard warded up to experimental standards but... well, that wouldnt help the town it happened in. ) and anyone inclined to emigrate permanently already fucked off thousands of years ago.

Earth prime is universally considered the best place to live because it is the place with the most advanced "Muggle" civllization, the place where the best 1200 wizards live and study and also because it is the shelling point for cross-world commerce.

Morgana is not setting you up to /fail/ - she completely expects you to come back in three hundred years and offer her a cut to facilitate you trading anything you can scrape together that is valuable for updates to the Codex Sorcerous and 40 tonnes of assorted crap off future amazon.

The tribe is not slaved, no, but Morgana is a /really good/ healer- Perfect health means no addiction pangs, no ptsd. Also, you are wizards. If you cant figure out how to parley that into authority, you deserve to die in her view.
