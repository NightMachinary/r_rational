Currently, you can do bugger all. That will change as you read through the codex and practice. Also note that the entire settlement is within dunbars number - violence should not be a huge problem.

Teaching is entirely up to you. The computers are locked to you, but you /can/ share access if that is what you want to do. Do you want to bring a printer? Because for full "Everyone gets magic" you are going to need one. Heck, you need one for the non-magical manuals.

Killing you bricks that computer.

Anyone at all can become a wizard. The world you are being sent to can support about 4-500 of them before running into mana shortages.

That was mentioned as a warning, because if you teach everyone you will absolutely hit that limit before the 300 years are up barring a heavy commitment to birth control. A lot of branch worlds do this - just flat out not have any muggles, and run a "civilization" that is a village of a few hundred wizards. There is a term for it, even - its called going "Mount Olympus" - The easiest magic of all to learn is healing yourself, which includes rejuvenation, so anyone who starts down the road is in the game for the long haul.
