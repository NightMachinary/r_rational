  Also, you are wizards. If you cant figure out how to parley that into authority, you deserve to die in her view.

Oh, I thought you were still a nubby wizard who didn't even know how to light a candle without burning up the planet's mana supply. If you can actually cast spells, that changes things, depending on what sort of spells you can cast.

But the question is, can anyone become a wizard? You seem to have been a muggle who discovered the secret of magic, and your computers contain the secrets of magic, so... can one of the 120 people kill you and take your computer to become a wizard?

Then again, you have 5 computers, were you expected to share them to make the 120 people into wizards? How will you maintain your authority if everyone is a wizard?
