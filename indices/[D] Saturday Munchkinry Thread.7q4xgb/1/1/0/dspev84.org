The clock never stops ticking. Wizard society on earth prime is extremely stable politically - It is made up of the remaining coalition of the wizards that ended the dawn age wars over magic and a smattering of noveaus that proved themselves worthy to take a spot opened up by attrition. Noone except Morgana can even find you - That is as much for your safety as anything. Earth Prime has rules about what one may do to wizards. These are not enforced on off-shoot worlds, and since you would currently loose a fight to anyone that has read 30 pages of the codex, you have a floating sign above your head reading "Potential victim".

The discovery of magic, and the social settlement that allowed a stable number of wizards to coexist without the fear of being murdered to free up mana both count. Casual browsing of the index does not seem to indicate anything related to ai, tough there is an entire section labled "Cognitive enhancements that have been proven to not drive you mad".
