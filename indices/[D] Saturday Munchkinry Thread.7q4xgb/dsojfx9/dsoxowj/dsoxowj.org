After 300 years, will it be magically possible to go back to the primary timeline just after banishment? If yes, there's an equivalent of the Fermi Paradox on why nobody has used such accelerated time to go for a technological Global Victory. If no, and the clock in San Dimas is always ticking, and since the living are a significant fraction of the dead, I expect our timeline to be contacted after one political upheaval or another before 300 years have passed. What do the books say about how magic and its users deal with Singularities?
