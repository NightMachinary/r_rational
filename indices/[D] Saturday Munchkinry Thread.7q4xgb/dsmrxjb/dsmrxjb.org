You possess the ability to maintain any environmental or structural features selectively within one kilometre radius. This will permit you to do things such as fix the water level of a lake and then water can flow out forever without draining the lake. However water added will not raise the lake. Another possibility is to maintain the heat inside a blast furnace or a refrigerator. This power also lets you maintain structures such as impossible buildings. This will let to manage a floating island if you can get it in mid air. This does not render anything inviolable but balances any normal change and over the course of up to a day regenerates the structure till it is the state you started in. This means people can dig any at the supports of a building you are defending but the building will not fall and the damage will be gone tomorrow. If you leave the area the stasis will stop until you return and a presence or absence of animate objects cannot be defined i.e. you could defend a shrub but not a bear, and you could defend a wrecked car but not a moving one. How do you utilise this to make as much money as possible? In addition you are somewhat paranoid, how do you defend yourself using this power? How do you use this to aid the human race?
