Like, you want to find 6 Klingons already aboard, ready to serve you, or if you're pessimistic, pissed off because their captain is missing? Why not just find some friends to man the stations? Althought I suppose the Klingons would be more experienced with this kind of thing. I really hope Duolingo's Klingon course comes out soon.
