In Star Trek, I attempt to contact Spock and tell him of the future, the Borg, the Q and the relation of Reality to Star Trek. I can only hope that the Q would be grateful for the news that the Federation can defeat the Borg. Is the 29th century extrapolated from before or after my insertion?

In Reality, my Transporter gives me biblical powers such as aborting any attempts to reach me in orbit (if they ever figure out I'm even there), kidnapping anyone, or perhaps moving nuclear weapons around, though my onboard weapons may be more effective. Find Elon_Satoshi and find out what else he has imagined for this hypothetical. Smother any nation squabbles by going directly to the top of the command chain. Perhaps institute and enforce a world government. Make sure AI research goes well.
