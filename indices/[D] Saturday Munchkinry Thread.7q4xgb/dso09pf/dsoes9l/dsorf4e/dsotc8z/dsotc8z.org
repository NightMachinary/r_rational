Oh! So your ability is some kind of future determinator, locking on to future timelines where random chance events just happen to shift the cell into the motion you want? Hmm...

You could probably get massive power generation by building wind power in an area and making the air currents constantly flow in that area, or by building hydroelectric dams and making the air currents pick up water from the ocean and drop it where your dam is.

You could also destroy any settlement on the coast by making the ocean air/sea currents move in hurricane-forming patterns and keep sending them in the direction of that settlement. Inland settlements may also be possible with tornado formations.

But actually it is probably best if you never use this ability. After all, altering large-scale earthly convection cells tends to drastically alter the biosphere, turning forests into deserts and submerging large chunks of land underwater are all very likely side-effects. Throw in the fact that you can't even control where the excess energy goes, and you're pretty much playing with fire in a house full of hydrogen balloons.
