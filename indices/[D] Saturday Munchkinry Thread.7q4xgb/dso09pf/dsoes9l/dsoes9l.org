  Your influence is limited by the cell's ability to rapidly change, characterized by things like momentum and other conserved quantities. You also don't possess the ability to stop or 'kill' these cells.

Can you clarify a bit more on these limitations? Especially the part about conservation of momentum, if we can't change that then it doesn't seem like we can change anything. Also, even if we can't stop or kill a cell immediately, can we slow it down bit by bit until it stops?
