Basically, the cells presently have linear and angular momenta, some energy, etc. but you can set a goal state that doesn't alter these quantities, and the system will evolve towards that goal state, with the speed being influenced by how much momentum, how much energy, how 'large' the system is in a holistic sense.

You can promote goal states that naturally tend to have energy bleed off as they return to a natural state, but you won't have control of where that energy goes, since generally two cells aren't directly transferring energy between one another.
