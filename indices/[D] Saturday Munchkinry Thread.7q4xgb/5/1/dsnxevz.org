The ability to store energy for later use. Like the terrismen from mistborn. Store strength for later, use it as a small increase over a long period, or a large burst in a short span.

Storing all incoming energy would allow you to move without sound and nullify any impacts. Conservation is preserved because the energy does not dissappear and becomes potential energy.

Store heat to cool down in hot weather, use the stored heat to survive freezing temps.

Store incoming light to become a silhouette in the background. Release light as a flashbang or shoot off concentrated bursts of coherent light.

Eat everything whenever you want, get fat, use the stored energy for later... wait... no.. everyone has this one.
