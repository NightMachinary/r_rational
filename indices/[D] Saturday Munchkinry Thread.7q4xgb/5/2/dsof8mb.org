Reality Warper of course.

Then, cleverly warp the world to sidestep these laws.

#+begin_quote
  Conservation of Energy (and also no extradimensional sources of energy or similar)
#+end_quote

Use your reality warping to to "destroy" energy by teleporting it far away, which conserves it and doesn't involve extradimensional sources of energy. Similarly, "gain" energy by teleporting it from far away to where you need it.

#+begin_quote
  Conservation of Momentum (Linear and Angular)
#+end_quote

Just make all matter teleport around instead of moving via conventional physics. They still have their momentum, it's just now irrelevant because they will always teleport to places according to the new rules of reality you wish upon them, regardless of their momentum.

#+begin_quote
  No matter or information can move faster than the speed of light.
#+end_quote

Warp reality to increase the speed of light.

#+begin_quote
  First & Second Laws of Thermodynamics
#+end_quote

The first law is almost exactly the same as the law of conservation of energy, so just do that.

The second law "states that the total entropy can never decrease over time for an isolated system", so just make the system not isolated. Warp reality to allow energy and matter to enter and leave.

Now all the laws you listed are still conserved and not violated in any way. They have simply been rendered irrelevant in the face of your almighty reality warping powers.
