  You can form arbitary telekinetic constructs so long as they're within one centimeter of you, up to some precision that is high enough to let you manifest cutting blades but low enough to not let you reforge molecular bonds.

I wonder how arbitrary is arbitrary.

Molecular bonds are on the in the couple hundred picometer ballpark, so if you only had resolution down to the 1 nanometer ballpark (eg 1000 picometer range), then you'd be good enough to construct computers from scratch.

Which is where 'how arbitrary' comes in. Because if you can start building arbitrary, purpose built ASICs then you've just become a one man singularity engine with rapid fab times. God help everyone if you can make the leap to carbon based electronics or 3d chips.

This changes the nature of the threat from 'guy who can telekinesis things' to 'robot apocalypse and also some guy with them'.
