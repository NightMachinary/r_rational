  How do you utilise this to make as much money as possible?
#+end_quote

Build a structure out of gold/jewels/other valuable materials. Maintain it and just keep extracting the material as it refills. If that doesn't work on solids, melt it first. Make a tiny "lake" of liquid precious metals, and maintain that while an endless stream of metal flows out.

  How do you use this to aid the human race?
#+end_quote

Same method, mass produce resources for the human race to use. You are not quite a one man post-scarcity economy, but you come close.

  In addition you are somewhat paranoid, how do you defend yourself using this power?
#+end_quote

If you're paranoid, you really shouldn't be trying to make money. You should be trying to hide and/or build an impregnable fortress. Here's a list of items to check for a paranoiac:

- Can you maintain your body so it doesn't need to eat/sleep/breath/etc.?
- Can you put a bag over your head and maintain the oxygen in it, thus generating an endless supply of breathable air?
- Can you maintain a lake of drinkable water? How small can you make it? What about other drinks?
- Can you build a structure out of edible material, like chocolate or biscuits, and maintain that structure while periodically taking bites out of it? If so, there's your endless supply of food.
- Attempt the same test with medical supplies and nutritional supplements.

If these tests work out, great! You now have the ability to keep yourself alive and healthy for the rest of your lifespan without needing to refuel or move from your spot. If you can maintain your body, you can even become ageless. Which means you can now construct a hideout to protect yourself. You have four alternatives, in order of increasing safety:

*Land Hideout*: Build a 1 kilometre radius labyrinth around yourself and maintain that. Fill it with all sorts of impenetrable walls and deadly traps.

Advantages: * Lots of available space. * Easy access to materials. * Can easily hire people to help you build your hideout. * Stable: Nothing short of an earthquake will dislodge your hideout.

Disadvantages: * If you hire people to help you build your hideout, then they know where it is. * Can't move your hideout: once it is discovered and publicized, everyone will know forever after. * People have a strong incentive to attack your hideout: you used great building materials for its construction no? Extracting them is sure to be profitable, especially since they regrow. * People have easy access to your hideout: it is just sitting there on the ground. They can just walk up to it.

*Air Hideout*: Build a floating island! You will need to get it in midair using something like a massive Zeppelin to carry it, but it is doable!

Advantages: * Hard to reach: humans can't fly. * Difficult to harvest: Let's say they chop a block of material off your hideout. How are they going to get it to the ground? They can't just drop it, it will break apart on impact. And once removed from your hideout it will regain its heavy weight since you are no longer maintaining it's floating nature. * Easy to kill intruders: Stop maintaining the part of the floor an intruder is standing on. Goodbye intruder!

Disadvantages: * EVERYONE CAN SEE YOUR FLOATING ISLAND! Secrecy = ZERO! * Fairly difficult to build. * Weaker defenses: the heavier the hideout, the bigger the Zeppelin needed to carry it to the sky. You will have to settle for whatever lightweight defenses you can bring.

*Water Hideout*: Build your hideout deep underwater, far far away from any landmass or other humans.

Advantages: * Awesome secrecy. * Actually not that hard to build: just build a large boat as your labyrinth, sail it to the middle of an ocean, and then sink it into an ocean trench. * Awesome defenses: thousands of miles of water pressure will kill any intruder before they reach you.

Disadvantages: * Did you check if you can survive the water pressure? This is kinda hard to check. * What about your ability? It maintains a hideout by regenerating it, not making it invulnerable. It is possible that the water pressure will just break it apart faster than it regenerates, and then you die.

*Space Hideout*: Spaccee! I'm in spacee!! Space. Launch your hideout out of the solar system. This is going to be very hard since you can't maintain the rocket while it is moving. You have to launch yourself off the planet, then wreck the rocket with some kind of self destruct to the moving parts in order to make it count as a wrecked vehicle that you can maintain. On the plus side, you can replenish your rocket fuel by maintaining a small fuel lake, so you won't need to carry a lot of it and can avoid the horrible exponential Tsiolkovsky rocket equation. Space.

Advantages: * Leave the earth and all the self-destructive humans behind. You will be safe even if they blow up the planet with nukes. * Ultimate secrecy: you are a speck of dust floating in the vast reaches of space, it is easier to win every lottery on earth than find you. * Almost unreachable: even if humanity somehow finds you, they will need to launch their own rocket, and it has to be much better than yours to catch up with you. * Movable hideout: repair your rocket and move if you are somehow discovered.

Disadvantages: * Hardest to build. * Risk of rocket explosion by accident/sabotage before you reach space. * Not secret while you are building it. Rockets are kinda visible. * Let's hope there are no aliens that can detect your hideout and find it interesting.
