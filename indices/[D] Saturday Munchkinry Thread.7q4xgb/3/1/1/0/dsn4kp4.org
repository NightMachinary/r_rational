  After thinking on this would that really help humanity? I know it would make you a lot of money but I understand the price of pharmaceuticals is heavily dependent on research which you can't get round.

Pharmaceutical companies spend [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/11/big-pharmaceutical-companies-are-spending-far-more-on-marketing-than-research/][more on marketing than on research and drug development]]. On average, [[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/060115/how-much-drug-companys-spending-allocated-research-and-development-average.asp][18% of their revenues]] is spent on R&D. Since you've got manufacturing costs down to $0 and you can skip drug marketing, etc. you can do the R&D for peanuts, comparatively. Don't forget limitless supply of chemical compounds for research either - that will make some of the R&D exceedingly cheap.

  Also while nuclear reactors seem all very well and good, what about maintaining a electrically charged capacitator which is constantly draining into wires.

You can't have all the power needed in the world coming out of a single capacitor. Power produces heat - put too much in one place and you've got melting cables and arcing electrical discharges over plasma. Also don't forget about transmission losses. You're better off supplying uranium or thorium to thousands of nuclear power plants so that power can be produced locally.
