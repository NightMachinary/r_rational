After thinking on this would that really help humanity? I know it would make you a lot of money but I understand the price of pharmaceuticals is heavily dependent on research which you can't get round. So no new drugs would be invented. It would make you a lot of money but only if you have no morals. Another option that I just considered would be that it states that a refrigerator could be maintained as cold which implies that energy and matter can be deleted as well as created. This opens up options of starting a disposal service by creating a small pile of substance and maintaining it at that size causing any additional material to be deleted. Also while nuclear reactors seem all very well and good, what about maintaining a electrically charged capacitator which is constantly draining into wires. You might be able to produce more power that way, the only downsize being if you left the area it would need to be restarted. In addition questions can be raised about the difference in mechanics between fluids and solids which cause a floating building to be held where it is and a floating pool to flow down. This may present issues living on other planets without disturbing everything unless it can be toggled. Also fun fact: I originally came up with this power to help create a dungeon theme park filled with impossible biomes and structures which I suppose another option if you just want to have fun.
