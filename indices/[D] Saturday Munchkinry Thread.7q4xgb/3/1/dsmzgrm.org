Defend a massive pharmaceutical and rare elements warehouse? As a pharmaceutical reseller or delivery service, you could sell everything for 5% off of current market prices and make an absolute killing. When prices go down, you drop yours as well and keep selling at 5% below market prices until profit margins are gone and we're down to just the cost of manufacturing and delivery - at which point your competitors go out of business and you keep the prices fixed at the most affordable they've ever been while still massively profitable for you.

On the rare elements side of thing, you could sell copper, gold and silver, but if you really want to make bank, sell refined uranium, plutonium, or thorium to nuclear power plants. Once you've got enough money, build your own power plant(s) and power lines and provide effectively limitless energy at low cost.
