  This breaks conservation of Energy across the whole universe at once, so you don't have any place to teleport the energy to.

I'm not very familiar with the physics beyond newtonian ones, but I'm assuming this is because of some laws that say the faster something moves the more energy it takes? You could just break those laws instead of the energy conservation one.
