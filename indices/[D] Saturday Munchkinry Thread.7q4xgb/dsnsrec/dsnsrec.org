A genie lets you pick any single superpower you can think of, subject only to the constraint that it should not allow you to violate any of the following Laws:

1. Conservation of Energy (and also no extradimensional sources of energy or similar)
2. Conservation of Momentum (Linear and Angular)
3. No matter or information can move faster than the speed of light.
4. First & Second Laws of Thermodynamics
