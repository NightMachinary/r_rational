  How are they meant to be kept in line again?

Eh. I'm sure Akua and/or Masego and/or Legion mages can come up with some sort of Suicide Squad setup to force the drows to stay in line. I'm more worried about Larat's inevitable betrayal, because /he/ has the potential to deal damage Catherine would not recover from.
