I checked the email update (which I'm like 80% sure sends you the original version) and the paragraph is there. Though I think other chapters have been edited in the past so you're right in that respect.

  It's one thing to be aware of the slippery slope of evil, and quite another to avoid tumbling headfirst down it.

Very true, wondering if that might e the central conflict for this part of Cat's story. She's agonized about retaining her humanity a lot, but now she seems to have some control over that but she hasn't worked out how to be a good (in the small g sense) human. Part of that is that she's almost always been acting reactively sine she's had independent power. As Queen in Callow she hasn't been actively imposing her own plan for the nation, but always responding to invasions and other external threats. I feel like she would have no idea what to do if suddenly all her threats were gone and she had the time and resources to do what she liked with Callow
