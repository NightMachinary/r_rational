Huh, so all the subterranean races (Drow notwithstanding) are technologically inclined?

Dwarves have a penchant for machinery and the goblins for alchemy. I bet the Gnomes had a penchant for natural physics and mathematics, permitting them to build airships and WMDs.

I'm willing to bet the Dwarves have history with the Gnomes.
