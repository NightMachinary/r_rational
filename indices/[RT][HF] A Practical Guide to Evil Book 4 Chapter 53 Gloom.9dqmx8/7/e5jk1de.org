I, for one, am interested in how would the Night and sentient Winter undead interact. They already have access to their memories, but would they if the corpse would have been harvested first? Does killing them add to the Night? Can they harvest / be harvested? What the bestowal Ivan talked about entails? Will Cat just raise those or combine them into one Renaissance Drow and leave?
