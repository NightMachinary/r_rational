Would they? As you point out, they have buffers between them and the closest human civilizations.

Plus, I suspect that knowledge learned through the night can't be taught, or at least drow civilization is resistant to drows teaching things to other drows.

So let's say you form a raiding party. You have to go through the Dead Kingdom or the Elf forest somehow (and you don't have access to Faerie portals); after taking some casualties, you make it, and murder a bunch of peasants before the local lords catch on and organize a militia with 10 times your numbers, lead by a Heroic named. At that point, your only choice is pretty much to run away and go back to the Everdark.

Congratulation, for all your efforts, your entire clan now has 3 blacksmiths. Until someone else hears about them and steals them from you.

(also, presumably drow supply chains aren't that great)
