The Night is a really cool concept for a magic system. Makes the whole society inherently unstable and zero sum. Some thoughts:

-- Does knowledge from non-drow get absorbed? I'd guess not given their technological stasis, they would have killed someone with knowledge of blacksmithing or whatever eventually.

-- They talk about absorbing skills and secrets, but not memories. Why are those different? Or are they doing so, hence why the guide refers to its past self as a different person. Could one use it to obtain passwords, battle plans, etc?

-- Can non-Drow learn how to absorb the Night? If so thats a massive available power source. You could make your own version of the Watch by powering up human soldiers with Night from the Drow.

-- Hyothesis for how the Drow society collapsed: While they had a steady stream of Night coming in from surface enemies (the cattle) one advanced by doing raids and getting their share, and the proceeds were spread around the rest of society. But when the supply dried up (due to the Chain of hunger, Dead King etc) the “economy” of night collapsed, it became more effective to avance by killing other drow and stealing their Night, so it became a zero sum all against all continuous war, and cooperation to do large scale raids, infrastructure, etc, collapsed.

Masego will be pissed he didn't come. This seems totally different from the rest of magic in Calernia.
