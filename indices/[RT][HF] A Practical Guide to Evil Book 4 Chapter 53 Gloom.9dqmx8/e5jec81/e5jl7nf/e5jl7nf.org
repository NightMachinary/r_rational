  Maybe I was a coward, because when I gave the order it was for drow to settle it among themselves.

Cat's spent a lot of time talking about killing prisoners recently, but I'm still not 100% sure where she sits on it.

Last chapter she was extremely firm that prisoners have the right to live, but now she's willing to have them killed. If you're a surrendering Praesi mage who's had amnesty extended then there's no question about what to do, and there are no issues with killing one of her fae for no other reason than to keep the rest in line, but Drow slavers warrant half a chapter of debate before the decision to spre them is backtracked and they get mostly offed anyway.

It seems to mostly be a question of how much Cat dislikes you/your nation, how useful you can be, and whether it's convenient to extend mercy?

  “I want to be perfectly clear, here,” I said. “If you kill humans, or any other race. It grows the Night?”

  “That is so,” the drow reverently said. “All is one. All is strife. The worthy rise.”

So the Drow are incredibly dangerous as allies. Not only are they extremely untrustworthy and "infamously not the most loyal of companions", but they've apparently got the ability to grow exponentially from any fight they're in. Kill a master swordsman and now you've got a better chance at offing a powerful mage. Killed a powerful mage? Now you've got a better chance at killing a Named (or however they learn Secrets like "the Secret of Many Lives"). How are they meant to be kept in line again?

To make matters worse, the Drow seem to have as much incentive to kill Callowans as they do to kill Callow's enemies, if not more. Why not take from the nation that's going to have the most trouble fighting back? The one with mages and priests and humans and orcs and goblins and fae and Named and more? That's quite the buffet.

They've also got plenty of incentive to kill all of the civilians too, which isn't particularly great whether they're on Cat's side or no.
