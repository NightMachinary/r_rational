Maybe? I'm not always sure on what problems Masgeo can or can't solve, but that sounds like something he could do. I definitely don't think Akua should be trusted with this, though she's probably the one with the best suited skillset.

I'm not sure it works as a solution though. Even if Cat could get the Drow to agree to that, with her somewhat-less-than-stellar negotiation skills, it doesn't resolve the problem where the Drow can apparently get very good at magic by just killing a bunch of magic users. And then there's the fact that the evil army being held in line through sorcerous means is a story that's just /begging/ for the monsters to be let off the leadership, and probably at the worst possible moment.
