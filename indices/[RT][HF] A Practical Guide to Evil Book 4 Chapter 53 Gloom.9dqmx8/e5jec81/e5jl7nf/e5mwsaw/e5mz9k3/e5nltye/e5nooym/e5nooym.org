  80% sure sends you the original version

The email's the original. I'd be very impressed, and more than a little scared, if WordPress edits could reach into your inbox and change that. To try and save face here, I'm going to lame the blame for my mistake at my being sick and distracted today (also, /dammit/ I wasn't certain whether that was a change of not, but thought I'd take the chance). Thanks for pointing that out.

  As Queen in Callow she hasn't been actively imposing her own plan for the nation

I'm not sure I'm sold on active Cat being a good person. One of the first pivotal decisions she made was to instigate a civil war in Callow to cement her control over the country, well before she set foot into the pressure cooker of the more recent books.

Yeah, she'd almost definitely be an ok person if circumstances were perfectly set up to allow that and all her problems were solved for her, but that's not a terribly high benchmark to cross. Most people are going to be moral if it's as easy as the alternative, but that's not really the point of being good.
