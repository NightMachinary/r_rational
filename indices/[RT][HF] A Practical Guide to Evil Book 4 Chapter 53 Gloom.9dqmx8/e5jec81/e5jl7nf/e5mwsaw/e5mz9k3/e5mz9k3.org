That's a fair point, but I'm concerned about the inconsistency in her desire to be ethical as much as anything. This chapter Archer asks Cat why the Drowning slavers warrant care and consideration when Praesi murders don't, and Cat's answer was ... pretty much a non-answer? She points out then she'd have to hold the entire civilization accountable then, which would be inconvenient for her (despite how she holds centuries old Proceran crimes against all Procerans, or her feelings towards essentially all of Praes), but doesn't really deal with the morality of the subject and then pretty much drops that topic.

On a related note though, it seems that the chapter has been edited. I'm pretty sure that this paragraph:

  Killing Malicia's minion who'd tried to surrender came much closer to the line, in my eyes, but it'd been a trick played on an enemy. It felt like a step closer to becoming someone I cared little for to have played it in the first place, but I could swallow my discomfort.

Is a new one. Which is quite interesting - I hadn't realised the work might be edited after being posted. It might be worth flicking through some old chapters now and again.

But I worry about Cat; I don't think her moralising over evil acts really matters too much or wins her any points if every time she's going to choose the evil act. It's one thing to be aware of the slippery slope of evil, and quite another to avoid tumbling headfirst down it.
