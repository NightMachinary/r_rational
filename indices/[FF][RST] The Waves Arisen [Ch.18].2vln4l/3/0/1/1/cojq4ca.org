Note the sarcastic quotation marks. Rape is /grossly/ overused used in fiction (written by lazy authors) to show how bad a person or society is ie [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil][Rape is a Special Kind of Evil]] - think about why Law and Order SVU exists for a prime example, or think about why Irreversible was so much more controversial than Inglorious Barsterds.

TVtropes also has [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama][this to say]] :

  (Rape as Drama) is horrifically overused in Fan Fic, for a number of reasons. Most often, it's just as a cheap shock in backstory without bothering to explain it any further than a sentence. Sometimes it's used in a case of Die for Our Ship, in which the character the writer hates is the rapist, and the rape is used as a device to get the two desired characters together (usually after the character the writer wants to "win" the ship war kills the perpetrator). Sometimes it's just used to make a Woobie out of the writer's desired Canon Sue, or to pair the author's Mary Sue or Marty Stu with the victim in a Hurt/Comfort Fic. It's arguable that less than 1% of Fan Fic actually uses Rape as Drama effectively, as most of the 10% of "good fics" that Sturgeon's Law claims there to be avoid using rape entirely.

I could go on for days about why it is a /bad thing/ beyond just being horribly lazy, but that discussion has been had many times here and in the hpmor sub.
