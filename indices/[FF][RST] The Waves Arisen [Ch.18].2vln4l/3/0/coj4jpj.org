Considering it had been hinted at already (and the fact no "realistic" ninja fiction can ever get by without at least passing mention of rape) I was actually more surprised that it took until this deep in the fic for Naruto to explicitly point out that civilians were /slaves/ with /owners/.

I guess he just doesn't see it as unusual, having grown up in the society.
