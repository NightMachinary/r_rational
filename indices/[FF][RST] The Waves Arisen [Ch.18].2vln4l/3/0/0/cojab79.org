I don't think it's the rape itself as much as the casual conversation about on the way to the shop that's skeezing me out. And the fact that it happened /in/ Leaf. I guess I'd always thought of wartime rapes as the sort of thing that happens along with the looting that follows a successful invasion in foreign territory, away from the restraints of the centralized institution.

This says more about how authority and institution have skewed my own sense of what's okay than it does about the relative immorality of raping someone versus talking about it. "Such things are 'uncontrollable deviances of base human nature' as long as they occur away from me and not under the auspices of the institutions that protect me. Or at least, if they are under their auspices, they don't do it /here/"

Reminds me of the debates about torture in Guantanamo Bay. I wonder how that would have shifted if it was happening in the continental US. Probably not that much if we had been promised that torture was only happening in "special zones" and would surely not happen in the protected zones where human rights were actually a thing and /real/ people lived.
