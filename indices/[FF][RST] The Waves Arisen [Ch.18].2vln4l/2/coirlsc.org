So Naruto has a human affinity? Looks like [[/u/kaukamieli]] [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2vd5f5/ffrst_the_waves_arisen_ch16/cogmrdh][called it again]].

I think it would be more rational for Naruto to wait till he get more chakra factories online, but it is understandable that he doesn't want Jiriya to die.
