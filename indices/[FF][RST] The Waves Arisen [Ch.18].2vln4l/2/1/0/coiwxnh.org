  If Naruto were currently regenerating four or five thousand times more chakra than every other ninja together, the story would be over.

I disagree - especially with the final arc starting. That kind of power isn't a "fix everything" button - simply power. What do you do with it? What are the unintended effects? Would it have been better to simply talk things over?

There's still an interesting story to be told, when an imperfect character gets grand but still limited power...
