The trouble with that is that, while rational, it's very rarely a good plot point to give your protagonist literally limitless power. Afterwards, there's no tension. If Naruto were currently regenerating four or five thousand times more chakra than every other ninja together, the story would be over.

As an aside, it's likely that he'll be regenerating four or five thousand times more chakra than every other ninja together by the time the story is over.
