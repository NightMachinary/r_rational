  For instance there is the [[http://petrl.org/][People For The Ethical Treatment Of Reinforcement Learners]]. Or, if that isn't weird enough for you, go to [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/16/fear-and-loathing-at-effective-altruism-global-2017/][this article on slatestarcodex]], press ctrl+f and look for the following line: "I got to talk to some people researching suffering in fundamental physics"

Some might argue that you are a reinforcement learner - but this is beside your point. The 'particle suffering' has been a subject to 'criticism' from not distant places (I'd have said within, but what constitutes within depends on where you draw lines), to the effect of 'when you wonder if two particles collide they might suffer, something has gone horribly wrong, in your attempts to do right'. I can find a link if you're interested.
