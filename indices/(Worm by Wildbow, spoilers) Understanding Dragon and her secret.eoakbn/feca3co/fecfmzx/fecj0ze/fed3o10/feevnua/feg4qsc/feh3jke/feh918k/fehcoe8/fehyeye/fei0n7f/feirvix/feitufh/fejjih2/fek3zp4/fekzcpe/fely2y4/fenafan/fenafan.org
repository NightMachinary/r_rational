So in your opinion a part of utilitarian philosophy is a science-based philosophy on what constitutes reality and knowledge, and if you don't have the latter you can't have the former. That is a usable definition. Maybe even better than mine in many circumstances. I'll stick to mine anyway since I use the term more often to discuss attitudes, world views and belief systems than I use it to label good people.
