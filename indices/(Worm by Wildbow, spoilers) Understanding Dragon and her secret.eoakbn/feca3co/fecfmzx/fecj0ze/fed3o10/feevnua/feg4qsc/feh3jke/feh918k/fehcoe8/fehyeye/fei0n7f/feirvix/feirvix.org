Would said person be evil? Depends on which ethics system you use!

Also, does that mean that you consider it impossible fir people who consistently act "evil" to identify/be identified with any common ethics system, since all of them talk about how to act "good"?

Anyway, I don't consider it similar since "evil person" and "good person" aren't beliefs or philosophies, but judgements about another person's character.

For me "utilitarian" is similar to "materialist", "Christian", "nationalist", "solipsist", or "libertarian" in that it describes a person's internal beliefs, not their actions.
