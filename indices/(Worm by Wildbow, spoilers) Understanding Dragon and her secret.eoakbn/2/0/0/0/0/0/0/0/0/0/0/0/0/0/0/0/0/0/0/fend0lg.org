I'd substitute science with empiricism. I really don't know if it's better or worse as I'm hardly an expert on normative ethics. And yeah, going through our convo, I feel like there's so many nuances to both utilitarianism and materialism that it's hard to keep track of what aspect we're referring to at a given point.
