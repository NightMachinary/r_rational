Two things:

The word "good" must be defined first. That's the point of ethical systems, of which utilitarianism is one. It tries to respond to the question "what is good".

Second, even if we disregard the above part I would still say that someone who wants to accomplish "the most good in this world" as you put it, doesn't actually have to be good at accomplishing that. You can be a utilitarian and wrong about major things. You can be a utilitarian and an idiot at the same time. You can think that being black is an unfortunate disease and still cling to utilitarian goals and methods. You can genuinely think that prayer is a major way to improve the world. You can believe in an eternal hell and thus, as a utilitarian, make it your goal to safe as many people as possible from it.

All of the above won't actually make the world better, but the person who does them can still think he's doing the most good for the most people. As long as he believes that results matter more than anything else and wants these results to be happiness/good/value fulfillment for as many people as possible, what else is he, if not a utilitarian?

Or to give an example, have you read Unsong?
