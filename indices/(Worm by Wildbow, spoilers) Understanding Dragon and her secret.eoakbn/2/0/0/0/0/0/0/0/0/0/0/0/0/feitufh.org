Yeah it isn't a great analogy - it's the first thing that came to mind if identification is entirely subjective. In that sense, anyone can be anything as long as it's their internal belief.

Anyway, instead of my initial comments about vectors (orthogonal vs. parallel), it might be more accurate to think of these labels as overlapping venn diagrams. Utilitarianism and materialism have a higher overlap (objectively in the real world) than say, materialism and Christian.
