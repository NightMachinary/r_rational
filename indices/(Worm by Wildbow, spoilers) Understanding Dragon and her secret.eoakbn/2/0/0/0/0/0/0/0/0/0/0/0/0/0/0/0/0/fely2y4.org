That sounds like a blend of absolutism and utilitarianism. But to the car question, no, I don't think a utilitarian can act on what they don't know. But objectivity involves finding out what is known and independent from our own perception. Ethical subjectivism naturally happens because of the limits of utilitarianism and human cognition in general, but a utilitarian still needs to act on knowledge and results to fulfill the greatest good to the greatest number.
