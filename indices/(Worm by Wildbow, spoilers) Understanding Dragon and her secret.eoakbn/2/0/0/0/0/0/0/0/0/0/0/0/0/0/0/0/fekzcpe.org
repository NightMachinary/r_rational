But by your metric of objectivity it might well be possible that there exists no human true utilitarian right now? Like, what if cars suffer horrendously every time we use them and none of us know? That would mean that all the wannabe utilitarians who aren't doing anything about car suffering actually can't be considered to be what they think they are.

And I am not completely pulling this weirdness out of my ass. For instance there is the [[http://petrl.org/][People For The Ethical Treatment Of Reinforcement Learners]]. Or, if that isn't weird enough for you, go to [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/16/fear-and-loathing-at-effective-altruism-global-2017/][this article on slatestarcodex]], press ctrl+f and look for the following line: "I got to talk to some people researching suffering in fundamental physics"

To put it differently, under your definition the only entities that could without a doubt be utilitarian both from an inside and an outside views would be effectively omniscient ones.
