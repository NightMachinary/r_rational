Utilitarianism isn't related to how accurate your knowledge about the world is. You could believe in supernatural stuff and still be trying to maximize happiness. Even if you do dumb stuff like trying to maximize happiness using supernatural means, I don't think that disqualifies you as a utilitarian on principle.
