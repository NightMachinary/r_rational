So "materialist" seems to be a synonym for "utilitarian" here and transhumanism is the prescription.

Very fun blurb that's also relevant to WtC. I don't subscribe to the impossible-to-change-from-within outlook, but it doesn't help that the human psyche is psychologically (or even biologically) predisposed to resist change. And that sorta makes people give human systems the evil eye.
