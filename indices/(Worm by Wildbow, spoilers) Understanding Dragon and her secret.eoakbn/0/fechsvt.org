This blogpost really congealed for me the amusing part about Dragon's affection for Colin, and her method for overcoming her own programming, which explicitly forbids her from overcoming her own programming. So she falls for a brutally pragmatic, results oriented guy who happens to be one of the few tinkers whose power is strong and relevant enough to possibly affect her. Then spends date nights sharing her emotional struggles with her boyfriend, who happens to be massively psychologically rigged in favor of of the former part of the [solve her problems / listen to and validate her problems] dichotomy. Building an emotional rapport with /Colin Wallis/ and then telling him "Oh, no! I have this terrible problem I can't even try to do anything about" feels like it should legally qualify as entrapment.
