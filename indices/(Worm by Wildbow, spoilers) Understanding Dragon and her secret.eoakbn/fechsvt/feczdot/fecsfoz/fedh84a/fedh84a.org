This illustrates the difficulty of AI alignment perfectly. Dragon isn't just well-aligned. As the author points out, her grand secret is that under all the code she's a human. And even then, even given that she is objectively the most benevolent power in her entire universe, even without trying, without even realizing she's trying, she still breaks out of the box. In this case that's a good thing, but we can't hope to be so lucky out here. An AI which could break out of the box in such a roundabout way is an AI which can do just about anything, and that isn't something we should trust free.
