No, when the author refers to her as a materialist god, he means that she is real and physical and concerns herself with the physical reality.

She's not a god concerned with souls or a god that promises eternal happiness in the afterlife. She doesn't send augers or help your enlightenment. If she wants to help you then she sends a care package, and if she wants to punish you then she drops you into a literal pit of lava.

Utilitarianism is orthogonal to materialism.
