A "utilitarian", as far as I understand it, isn't someone who acts in a way that other utilitarians happen to approve of. It's someone who agrees with the premise of utilitarian ethics and lets said ethics guide his decision making.

Is /that/ maybe our definitional disagreement?

Anyway, a big part of Unsong's whole premise is (spoilered for purists but it isn't really a big spoiler since it is evident from very early on) various Abrahamic religions turning out to be true and how the world deals with that. This includes Kabbalah actually working and the names of God having magical effects. And yet, utilitarians definitely still exist and matter.
