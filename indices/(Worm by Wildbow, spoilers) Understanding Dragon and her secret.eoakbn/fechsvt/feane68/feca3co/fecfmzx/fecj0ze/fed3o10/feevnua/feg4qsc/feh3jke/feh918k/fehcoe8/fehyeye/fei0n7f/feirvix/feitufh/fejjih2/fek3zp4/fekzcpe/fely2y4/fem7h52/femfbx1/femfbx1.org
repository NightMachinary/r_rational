It doesn't matter that there's criticism. Even valid criticism. I mean, they are most probably wrong. But what they are thinking about isn't literally impossible. And if, by an insane off chance, we do actually live in a universe built on near infinite suffering, then those handful of crazy seeming people are the only humans even approaching utilitarianism, by your definition.

Or in other words, I wasn't trying to say that you should look into these things because maybe you are missing something important, I wanted to highlight that no one human can actually be a 100% sure that what they are doing is a net positive in the world, just like we can't be a 100% sure of anything else. Which in my opinion makes your personal working definition of the word "utilitarian" less useful than mine ðŸ˜‹.
