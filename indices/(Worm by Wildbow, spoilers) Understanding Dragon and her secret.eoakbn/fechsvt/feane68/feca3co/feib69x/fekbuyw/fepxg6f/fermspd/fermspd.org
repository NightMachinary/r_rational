Eh. I'm not 100% sure that the Birdcage = Hell is what WB intended but I'm rather sure it was what he was going with those parallels. I don't think the Government or PRT is the “God” in this analogy. It's probably Dragon. Dragon like God works in a sinful world not dictating the laws of humans but punishing the sinners after they fall. You say in the other comment that it's the inmates who manage the prison but it's not really them; Dragon decides who goes where and manages if they survive in the Birdcage or not. (Of course it's not a perfect analogy, I don't think the bible intends to have death be a way out of Hell.)

I could go on and find more examples that work for me but you seem to believe I'm cherry picking and I probably couldn't convince you with all the parallels I could find since you believe that the author didn't intend any parallels between the Birdcage and Hell.

So I guess we'll just agree to disagree.
