Alright, I've read a little and this seems pretty hilarious. Let's see how it turns out.

Edit: it's a bit much to read all in one go, the constant barely-sequiturs seem to have unhinged my brain somewhat. Could be fun for an occasional chapter.

This may actually be the first time I've read something with references too intellectual and obscure for me to catch. Or it's just the first time I've noticed and they've been whizzing by above my head for years now, which seems more likely.

Yes, less rational and more sherlock holms really. Less extrapolating from available data and more pulling answers fully formed from the ethyr. I'm pretty sure that's explicitly one of The Doctor's powers as it happens.
