Pretty male-dominated with no justification.

The story mentions vast population growth as a result of immortality. I strongly suspect that, once immortality is generally available, people will wait to have children until they are older, so the rate of new human construction relative to the existing population will go down. Of course, it would have to go down by more than half to make up for the lack of dying, and that only gets you back to the current population growth. (About 330,000 people were born and 150,000 people died each day, last I checked.)

Of course, that doesn't matter when you're measuring the time until the stars have all burnt out. Humans not using a star's energy output doesn't make the star last longer.
