Ok, it's a /little/ disturbing when the Cosmic Mind-People take the same shape as Anti-Spirals.

And I do wonder how they had hyperspace, hyperspatial travel, and an eternal Cosmic AC and /couldn't/ reverse entropy much, much earlier. In fact, I find it hard to believe they figured out the nature of space and time and couldn't come to a conclusion about entropy.

Ah, well: I'm living much later than when Asimov wrote, and at least the Stelliferous Era is projected to last 100 trillion years rather than a mere 1 trillion.
