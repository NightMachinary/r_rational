How is reprduction?

  Pretty male-dominated with no justification.

Lots of women like to have children too. If you not a creationist the simple Darwinian fact that those that are better at reproducing become more numerouse over time is so obviouse it does not need explaining why people 20,000 years in the future are verry fecund. Human instinct to limit reproduction evolved in responce to historical resource shortages. The decedents of interstellar settlers would be descendants of the most fecund of the most fecund of each generation.
