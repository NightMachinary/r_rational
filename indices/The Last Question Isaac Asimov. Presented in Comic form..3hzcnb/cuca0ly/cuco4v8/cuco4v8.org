In the current modern period, novel cultural environments have neutralized allot of the historical triggers for peoples reproductive instincts. But over time those who are better at maximizing their reproductive potential will have more children, and many of these traits will be genetic, so over time these people with stronger reproductive instincts will become more numerous over coming generations. When they have grown to the majority of the population humans will regain the ability to reproduce exponentially when possible like all life unless some kind of Malthusian ceiling limits population growth. So a few thousand years after immortality is invented most people will be popping out as many babies as they can in their long lives because the population was created by parents who did so, and they will of inherited those traits. The future belongs to those who show up.
