We've got research showing that cultural and environmental features have a huge bearing on the number of children people have. You're essentially taking it as an article of faith that those effects will go away. You're furthermore taking it as an article of faith that people will evolve to churn out as many infants as possible, with everyone who can bear a child being constantly pregnant, and that within just a handful of generations.

I see no reason to believe you.
