Oh I know that culture has had a lot of influence on people reproduction other the last hundred years (if my post gave you the opposite impression your reading comprehension sucks), I also know that the spread of bacteria is inhibited by the application of antibiotics, but I also know that the continuous application of such inhibitors will breed resistant strains of bacteria. You're essentially taking it as an article of faith like a creationist that simple Darwinian principles dont apply to humans or their brains. But its really quite simple even tautological, those that are better and reproduction become more numerous over time. There are numerous studies that show that genetics has a very strong influence on peoples personalities and behavior identical twins adopted into different families unsurprisingly have near identical scores on all psychometric tests which is what you would expect if the brain was a product of genetic evolution rather than creationism. I never claimed to know how long it would take for humans to evolved genetic resistance to anti natalist cultures but the relevant section of the cartoon is set over 20,000 years in the future. Over the last 10,000 years humans have evolved many new genetic traits such as lactose tolerance, gluten tolerance, alcohol tolerance, and many other genes that have been selected for that we do not yet know the function of, many of these genes are variants of DNA areas that control brain development. But of course as well as genetic evolution there is cultural evolution, there is evidence that the Elites of many previous empires had trouble replacing their numbers before being swamped by more fecund barbarians, it may be that in the grand scheme of things anti natalist cultures never last long enough for humans to evolve genetic resistance to them, but the result may be rather similar anyway.
