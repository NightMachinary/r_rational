  Oh I know that culture has had a lot of influence on people reproduction other the last hundred years (if my post gave you the opposite impression your reading comprehension sucks)
#+end_quote

You are being needlessly combative.

I never accused you of saying that environment and culture are currently irrelevant to reproduction rates. I repeated the fact at the start of my post because it's a shared point relevant to what I was saying later. It was summarizing important background information. I did this because it made reading easier and because your post was long and had no formatting, which would make it hard for someone to grok that context if I had not repeated it.

  I never claimed to know how long it would take for humans to evolved genetic resistance to anti natalist cultures
#+end_quote

You said "a few thousand years".

Genetic modifications that will override all the cultural and rational factors leading to depressed birth rates in educated populations with a high standard of living -- that sounds like a pretty daunting prospect. Granted, the fitness would be high, but getting those genes in the first place would likely be nigh impossible. It's appreciably more likely that a left-handed mad scientist named Rita will engineer such a change than that it would occur naturally.

  lactose tolerance

Human milk contains lactose. It's the production of lactase in adults that is interesting.

  alcohol tolerance
#+end_quote

Huh? It's not like ethanol is outrageously more lethal to, say, dogs than to humans, measured in milliliters per kilogram. The data I can find suggests that humans are about as tolerant of alcohol as mice, and appreciably less so than rats.

Did you research this claim? Or any of your other claims?
