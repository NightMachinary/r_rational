Before someone complains about reposts:

This has been posted here on a [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1uf68n/the_last_christmas/][couple]] of [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1tl5m0/thedaythatsantastolechristmas/][occasions]]. But note the sidebar:

#+begin_quote
  Because of reddit's ranking algorithm, there's no way for users to bump old posts to the front page. For this reason, reposts are not only allowed but explicitly encouraged!
#+end_quote

I think this story is worth posting again and it'd be really appreciated if no one complained about reposts.

The only fault in this story is that it's a bit too short. The ending felt quite anticlimatic because I was prepared for some longer and bigger story development. The whole thing with the elves maturing came out of nowhere and happened very suddenly.
