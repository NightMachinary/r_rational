The ending definitely needs some work, and I need to go back and pepper in some foreshadowing. I've got a rewrite of the story sitting in a folder that's a few thousand words longer that makes up for some of the problems it has in the current version, but I'm sort of doing an idle re-edit every once and awhile instead of putting most of my writing effort into it.

It was originally started a week before Christmas and finished on Christmas Eve (I believe), and that accounts for a little bit of the rushed feeling to it.
