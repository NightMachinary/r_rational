"I - no," he says. "I am not a Power."

He considers how to explain, then produces one of his incomprehensible objects. It is a short stick; now it is a short stick which glows at one end. Glow. No glow. Glow. No glow. The difference between these states is accomplished by pushing on the end opposite the glowing end.

"A... thing, made by people," he says of this minor miracle, in his rapidly improving Quenya.

"You cover and uncover the light source?"

"No... almost." Glow. "Now it is a light source." No glow. "Now it is not."

 

That didn't make sense. Celegorm knew how to make gemstones that didn't merely refract light but created it, bright enough to read by. There were some that stopped working if you broke them, and there were some that crumbled into smaller glowing gemstones, depending how you'd married the stone and its new purpose. None of them lit on demand.

 

"How did you make it?"

"I did not make it. Other Men made it."

"How did they make it?"

He frowns in thought, then puts that object away and gets out another one, which also glows but in writing-like patterns on a flat pane. After manipulating this display for a few seconds, clumsily with his armoured fingers, he concludes: "I don't know."

 

Perhaps Miles isn't a scholar. This makes him instantly jump in Celegorm's esteem.

Though even Celegorm could explain how to make every thing the Eldar have achieved short of the Silmarils or AlqualondÃ«'s swanships. Or some of the obscure mathematics, possibly. He wants to take the light pen and see if he can identify the alloys on closer inspection, but it must be valuable beyond measure. Better to let Curufin be the one to demand that.

"Who was the creator?"

 

...Miles considers this question for another few seconds, then repeats, "I don't know," in a tone that suggests he is dissatisfied with the completeness of this response but can't do any better under the current linguistic conditions.

 

"In our people, to create a thing that enhances the world, or the joy of its inhabitants, is a great good. Everyone will know your name, and desire to study under you, and there'll be festivals, and they'll start thinking of you as collective property and crushing you under the weight of their demands for narrative perfection as well as engineering perfection until you're isolated, paranoid, and beloved by all."

 

That had started off in simple enough language that Miles was supposed to understand it, but he'd lost the thread of his thought somewhere through the sentence. A few of their cautiously circling guard stared at him.
