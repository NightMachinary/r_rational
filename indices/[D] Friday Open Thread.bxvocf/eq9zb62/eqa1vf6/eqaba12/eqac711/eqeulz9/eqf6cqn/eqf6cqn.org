Most glowfics, especially in Alicorn's three major continuities ([[https://www.glowfic.com/boards/1][Effulgence]], [[https://www.glowfic.com/boards/44][Incandescence]], [[https://www.glowfic.com/boards/18][Silmaril]]) follow a pattern of

1. Main character falls into another universe (or sees through the masquerade) and has first contact with the locals.
2. Long, slow build-up of personal relationships. Long, slow experimentation with local magic system(s).
3. A horrifying problem rears its head. Drama happens.
4. The problem is swiftly dispatched by the characters' now considerable magical power.
5. Crossover with the rest of the continuity!
6. Long, slow conversation so that both sides are caught up with everything about all known universes, that you the reader already know about.
7. Magical tea parties on the moon.

1 is like crack to me, and 5 is similar enough. 3 tends to give emotional whiplash; they don't hold back with how badly some characters get hurt. It's a GRRM kind of fun. 4 is wish-fulfilment sugar. The rest I could do without, though by now it has grown on me some.
