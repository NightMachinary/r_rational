It is from a [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_4Z2zdRKaSwZPm3S0X14DYoo7w46U_MZ4En6oOediNQ/edit][Glowfic]] ([[https://www.glowfic.com/posts/84][this one]]), an estranged offspring of rationalfic that's more about exploring character interactions and playing with settings & crossovers than about plot.

It's an acquired taste and I don't recommend it. But since I /have/ acquired the taste, I share good quotes I find there every now and then.

If you do find that you enjoy it, lintamande has a thing for the Silmarilion so there's a fuckton of glowfics crossing every point of its timeline with countless other settings.
