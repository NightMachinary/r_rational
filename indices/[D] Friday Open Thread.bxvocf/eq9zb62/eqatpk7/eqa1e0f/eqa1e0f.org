So I have been feeling pretty indifferent lately.

Is there anyone here who likes watching anime, manga, comics etc.? If you do then thank you.

I was just thinking about all those death battles, versus debates where people pit a character from one world against another from another world. Like, Naruto versus Ichigo, for instance. As a matter of fact I do love those kinds of debates because those are quite fun.

However, recently an idea has been bugging me that makes me wonder if it's even possible to get accurate comparisons between the characters on such basic categories like speed, reaction time, stamina, durability etcetera.

The problem is that, for instance in Bleach we have Author Canon that Ichigo in the beginning Soul Society Arc after attaining his base Bankai i.e his main (and only) powerup was capable and going up against his enemy a Soul Reaper Captain at the insane +speed+ velocity of multiple lightning bolts.

But then again, if that were really true you would expect the surrounding area to be constantly being updated with thunderclaps (as is natural in an Earth like environment), the intense friction superheating the air to plasma levels and thus marking his path with waves of glowing hot plasma. Since he was moving almost constantly in and around Byakuya's surrounding area you would expect those constant movement to be creating shockwaves, thunderclaps and most importantly the plasma with which Byakuya could have very easily noticed his movements.

Yet this isn't what happens. Instead, we get shown that Ichigo just flickers from one point to another like an afterimage with barely any sound, barely any breeze, barely any craters on the ground, etc. (no thunderclaps, no shockwaves, no plasma). And then he stops and a small gust of wind breezes through flaring his cloak around his person.

What can we expect from that type of physics? I know that that shows that his world is quite, *quite* different from ours in every way possible and that the similarities are just cosmetic. Purely cosmetic indeed.

If he tried that maneuver in our world, Universe, Earth the effects on his surroundings would be drastically different right?

So how does him being a Lightning Timer (in that period of time) in the Bleachverse which is operating on quite different physics reliably scale as being a Lightning Timer in OUR IRL world? And the same goes for the Narutoverse which has shown that it has pretty much the same thing i.e it too has entirely different physics compared to our default IRL version.

So my question is how the flying f can we even try to equate Naruto (Lightning Timer version) with Ichigo (Lightning Timer version) as if they both are characters whose movements in OUR IRL world's Earth will always almost entirely cause the same sort of physical effects on the immediate surroundings (even assuming both have the same mass for approximation purposes)?

The same thing goes for every other world we see in our daily fiction. Clearly, Marvel and DC have quite different physics so it's almost moot to discuss how a character relates to another character even if they both are continent busters.

Because the base standard isn't standard at all! To make a standard version for the purposes of accurate versus debates, we will have to extrapolate and analyse how exactly Fictional World A Physics (and Meta Physics) scale with our own IRL Physics and Meta Physics.

Am I wrong in thinking this?
