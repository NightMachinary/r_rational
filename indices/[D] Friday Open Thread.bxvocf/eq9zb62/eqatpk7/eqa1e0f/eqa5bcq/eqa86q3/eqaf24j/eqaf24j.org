This was really helpful, the analogy to muscle memory when playing video games especially resonated with me since I've been playing fighting games for about a decade now.

I still wonder if consciousness is even necessary for human-level tasks. I'm, probably incorrectly, relating this to computer science, where words are like variables/objects stored in memory connected to data and any bug in the hive could access this memory and reading is more like a method call that requires the prerequisite hardware to run it (a human brain, of which there is only one). But, would human intelligence or consciousness (boy is this word a can of worms) be necessary for reading comprehension? I think part of the difficulty here is that I've never encountered anything that explored the results of brain-to-brain communication between human and sub-human intelligences.

Thanks again, I just wanted to make sure Skitter-esque feats would be possible with less exploitable and hard to write multitasking abilities. I worried something dangerously close to super-intelligence would result from millions of human minds being able to seamlessly communicate, coordinate, and amass information at the speed of thought. You're explanations make it seem like you could probably get by with relatively few threads of consciousness and still manage to do basically everything Skitter does.
