I wonder about this a lot as well. The Tines from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep][A Fire Upon The Deep]] are my favorite fictional example. They have 4-8 bodies that communicate with each other hypersonically. True consciousness requires four, but more than eight isn't doable because there isn't enough bandwidth in sound for the mind fragments to remain in communication. If you want your hivemind to have a size cap, maybe it could be something similar? It could be something like addressing: only 1024 currently linked insects to a hive mind.

  Like, let's take weaving spider silk into rope, would you need to control each individually, or is arachnid intelligence combined with them having access to what you're visualizing enough for them to handle it with only minor supervision.

I imagine it would require individual control, especially at first. But animals can be trained. To me the process looks like this:

1. Skitter minutely controls the spiders to make them do a simple weave. Each is moved individually and slowly.
2. The spiders individually learn the movements with their tiny brains and become capable of repeating them with a nudge.
3. Skitter optimizes the timing and movements until she can subconsciously perform all the nudges.
4. Skitter has generalized how to do certain things and can teach new spiders the movements rapidly in the future.

Real life humans do something very similar with muscle memory and subconscious actions. Consider video game controllers:

1. At first the human must carefully control each finger individually to press buttons.
2. After practice the movements become entirely automatic--a part of the human's brain has learned the task and offloaded the effort from conscious attention.
3. The human can now focus on playing the game optimally and can forget about the controller.
4. Having learned it, the human can pick up basically any controller and rapidly adapt to it.

It's a bit different because Skitter has to overwrite the old habits into new bugs all the time.

  Do you think a collection of insects with their minds linked might be capable of some sort of more-than-the-sum-of-their-parts cognitive abilities?
#+end_quote

It depends. If you mean normal Earth insects, I'd say no--consciousness doesn't arise just because you have enough power. But it's absolutely possible to have nonlocalized intelligence! Octopi are that way already with their individual arm-brains, but surprisingly so are birds with their neural clusters. Mammals have sheets of neurons in the brain, but birds have interconnected nodes. [[https://www.quora.com/How-do-the-different-brain-structures-of-birds-and-mammals-affect-their-cognition-and-behavior][Link]]. Gram-for-gram, the clustered version seems much more powerful.

If nothing else, you could have pseudo-spiders with normal insect brains and a tiny amount of extra processing that can gather into a consciousness. It's important to keep in mind that more processing power doesn't /guarantee/ consciousness... but cells produce thoughts /somehow/ so we know it's possible for many to become one.
