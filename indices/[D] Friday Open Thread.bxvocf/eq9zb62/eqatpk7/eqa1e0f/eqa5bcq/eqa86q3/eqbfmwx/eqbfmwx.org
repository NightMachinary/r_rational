I think Canon has it that her consciousness doesn't stay with the bugs at all, rather her passenger temporarily overwrites the bugs' instincts to go along with her desires. Similarly she doesn't move her consciousness to a particular bug, she just has an extra set of senses that copy what the bugs are experiencing and she can focus in and out of various parts like most people can with their hearing.

The few times she exercises fine control what is actually happening is that she's continually overwriting the bug's instincts to take very specific actions.
