I think back to when Taylor had to really /focus/ to produce a single bug clone, or steal one key from guards. It seems like once she'd mastered a trick, her desiring something to happen just prompted QA to execute that desire. At the extreme range, QA learned to puppet Taylor to automatically dodge attacks even without Taylor's input or knowledge, as she had to learn from Glenn Chambers.
