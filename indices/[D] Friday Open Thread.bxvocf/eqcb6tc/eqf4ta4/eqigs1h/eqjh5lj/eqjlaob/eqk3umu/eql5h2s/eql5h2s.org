You give me too much credit. I wasn't trying to say anything about red pill people at all. [[/u/Robert_Barlow]] originally used "that" instead of "who" but edited his comment to fix it.

Note that he ended his comment with an ellipsis, which probably implies that it was meant to be read as sarcastic or sheepish or something. I have no idea what specific tone was intended because the written word lacks inflection and emphasis and all that, but I assume the ellipsis was supposed to be a substitute for all that and indicate that the words weren't meant to be taken literally. Maybe. It'd be pretty silly to pretend not to have made an error when reddit shows that the comment was edited an hour after an error was pointed out.
