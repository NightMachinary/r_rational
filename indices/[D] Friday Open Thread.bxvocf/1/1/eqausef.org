You're quick man!

Thanks so much for taking me out, I had such a great time, even though I didn't say much (you are lucky we weren't speaking english because I never shut up), I picked up soooo much and your friends are both lovely.

So that's now two [[/r/rational]] meetups i've been involved with. I'm so popular :D

next stop, Berlin (once I get a house share sorted.... it's.... taking a while)
