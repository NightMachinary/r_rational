  I worried something dangerously close to super-intelligence would result from millions of human minds being able to seamlessly communicate, coordinate, and amass information at the speed of thought.

Leave out 'speed of thought' part and that's basically a description of the Internet.

A hivemind made of an arbitrarily large number of average-human minds is going to have a capped level of intelligence - smarter than a single average-human mind (because they can effectively take more thinking-about-things time in the same amount of clock-time), but we're talking average-human-with-arbitrary-time-to-think-about-things smart, and not super-human smart.
