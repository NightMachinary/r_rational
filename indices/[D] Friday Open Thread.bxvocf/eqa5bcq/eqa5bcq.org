So I somewhat recently read a Worm fanfic (Thaumaturgic Awakening) that explained Skitters abilities a little differently. Basically, she couldn't do multiple human-level tasks (like reading) concurrently because there was only one mind in the hivemind capable of such things and in order for her to do otherwise, her shard would have to make a duplicate of her consciousness into every bug under her control.

​

So my problem lies in the fact that I was trying to develop a magic system where something like Skitter's abilities was a potential emergent property but if making millions of copies of your consciousness is possible, there are some pretty absurd alternate, unintended byproducts of that. I came up with some ways to get multitasking but on a lower scale (dozens of threads instead of millions), but I'm left with all sorts of questions as to how hiveminds would actually work and how much of what skitter does actually requires human intelligence distributed through every single bug.

​

Like, let's take weaving spider silk into rope, would you need to control each individually, or is arachnid intelligence combined with them having access to what you're visualizing enough for them to handle it with only minor supervision. What about making a bug clone? If we're going the hivemind route, each bug might know what a human looks like (roughly) either by themselves or by piggybacking on your memory, but I suspect properly animating it would still require at least one human consciousness. Do you think a collection of insects with their minds linked might be capable of some sort of more-than-the-sum-of-their-parts cognitive abilities?
