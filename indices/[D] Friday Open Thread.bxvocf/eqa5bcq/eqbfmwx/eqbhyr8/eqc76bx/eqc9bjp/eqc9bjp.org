The degree to which the brain would have to be altered to take in and process all the information she receives probably wouldn't fit in the human skull. We don't have to go down that route though since shards are BS that can do anything. But that's the question, what is the shard doing? And it appears it allows multitasking, which if we are to use a computer analogy, you can't run two threads (thought processes) concurrently on a single CPU (a brain) but you can with 2 CPU's, so the shard is probably simulating copies of her brain to handle tasks simultaneously. You could potentially get similar results by uploading a copy of her mind into a sped up simulation of reality and control the bugs based on all choices she could conceivably make, but I think that's a bit more ridiculous.
