Yeah, but I mean, that's true of any series that isn't overly rigorous in defining how their magic works. People who write crossover works or versus matches have always had to use first order approximations or thereabouts to compare feats, which can sometimes fall apart when the authors of those original works are inconsistent with internal mechanisms of the story.

While it may be more accurate to throw up your hands and say "there's too much weird shit going on to compare the speeds of Ichigo and Naruto", that's utimately not a very meaningful answer. So even if it doesn't hold up to any kind of rigorous scrutiny, comparing the two is what we do.
