I don't think you need to go so deep into things to get a (relative) satisfactory answer. Rather than look at the results of seemingly-divergent physics and assume the foundations must be different, why not look at what is already different and assume the divergence must come from there? The already-present difference in physics for Bleach is reiryoku, and in Naruto, chakra. It's reasonable, then, to assume any strange happenings in those universes are more a result of this additional particle/energy/law interacting with "baseline" physics, rather than a completely new set of laws.

It may not help much with trying to compare between different universes since you can still only get approximations of what a "lightning-fast" move actually means when chakra/reiryoku/etc is messing around with things, but it can still help when the feats are more grounded in reality, like bullet-dodging comparisons and such. [[/r/whowouldwin]] has a lot of posts about this kind of thing, if you're interested.
