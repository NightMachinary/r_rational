Thank you for commenting.

My main problem with such scenarios is that people always do blatantly illogical things like say: Taking Ichigo's feats in HIS Universe as evidence for him being a Lightning Timer and taking Naruto's feats in HIS Universe as evidence of him being a Lightning Timer AND THEN THEY PROCEED TO put them together in the same category of speed by saying they are both Lightning Timers! In our World even!

But the true fact is that that is totally wrong! That Ichigo is a Lightning Timer in HIS world (and that's up for debate too since OBVIOUSLY we can't equate their world's physics with ours because they are fundamentally different) and that Naruto is a Lightning Timer in HIS world!

That's the basic gist of it.

Edit: How the hell can an author expect us to equate Ichigo as a Lightning Timer with regards to our World's Quantum Mechanics when there world's are fundamentally different already? He's (past version) a Lightning Timer in HIS world. That's the ONLY fact we can say is consistent with the Bleachverse physics. Nothing more nothing less. And the same is true for Naruto in his Universe.

And now we can't even hope to compare the two's speeds because they are operating in entirely different realities where physics is fundamentally different between there worlds. Trying to analyse and standardise their energy also doesn't work since they are too inconsistent.
