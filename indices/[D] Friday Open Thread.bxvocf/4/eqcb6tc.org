No other sub makes me angry like The Red Pill. I think it's the unique mixture of some good ideas and some utterly terrible ideas. Other subs like The_Donald or Chapo_Trap_House I disagree with 99% of what they say, so while I might be annoyed while browsing them, it fades out of my mind once I leave. The Red Pill though has a lot of good ideas(e.g recommending exercise and healthy diet, self-confidence and self-respect, acknowledging men and women have different sexual strategies) but also a lot of utterly terrible ideas(e.g women are subhuman, idiots, and naturally immoral).
