I've often thought, in discussions of time travel, that the first, easiest way to establish oneself in the middle ages would be with beekeeping. Not just knowledge of bee-space and movable frame hives, but just knowing about bees would be an insane asset. People had no idea, back in the day, that bees laid eggs, or the role of the queen (they thought it was a male "king" bee), or what pollen was, or where nectar came from. All of this would give one a huge advantage in sugar production in a medieval setting.
