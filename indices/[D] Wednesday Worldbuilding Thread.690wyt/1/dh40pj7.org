I'm really tired of virtual reality fantasies where people are surprised by the veracity of the criticism which seems to place you directly in a world (spoiler:it probably magically does) and then never do anything with the tech again. Like, if tomorrow something like that came out, there would be government intervention to get this kind of technology. Any rigs would be declared a national asset and the company would get very "politely" questioned, at the very least. They take matrix level technology and try to ignore that that's what they did. It's annoying.

In another genre, I'm honestly surprised that more portal fantasy protagonists don't pay any attention to either distilling or beekeeping as really easy ways of making money. A packed column still is supremely simple to make in theory, and the only truly difficult parts of it are the thermometers and the needle valve, and the movable frame hive is revolutionary and simple in practice. Both of them were made in or after the late 18 century, well well before the Middle Ages equivalent most of them are set in.
