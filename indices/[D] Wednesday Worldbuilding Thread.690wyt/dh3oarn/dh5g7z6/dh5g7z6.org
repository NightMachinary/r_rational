- Bow of Sudden Thornwall: When activated, an arrow loosed from this bow will cause a wall of thorns to sprout from the ground along its path. These squares are impassable terrain, but the wall can be removed or destroyed with damage and other relevant effects.

- Bow of Ultimate Scaling Convenience: When fired as part of a full-round attack action, arrows fired from this bow at a vertical (or near-vertical) surface magically divide into several separate climbing pitons and embed themselves into the surface across an area no wider that five feet and arbitrarily high, these can be used as improvised steps. This reduces the climb DC for that surface to 5 for a number of rounds equal to the wielder's level, after which the pitons vanish, leaving the target surface unharmed.

- Bow of the Inverted Locus: When an arrow loosed from this bow hits a creature, that creature and the bow's wielder instantaneously trade positions.

- Bow of Reliably Unfortunate Spasms: when a creature is hit by an arrow from this bow, the strange and recondite energies within cause a limb or jaw of the creature to lash out uncontrollably for a moment, and somehow always wacks someone. The hit creature makes a basic melee attack against a random creature within range (if any) as an immediate interrupt.

- Bow of the Horror Walrus: For a number of rounds equal to the wielder's level, creatures hit by this bow automatically suffer the frightened condition for one round whenever it has line of sight to a walrus; or if it fails a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check to know what a walrus is, to any object or creature that it is led to believe is a walrus.

- Bow of Fletched Annoyance: When fired at a square in the ground, arrows loosed from this bow become sapient, capable of speaking one language that the wielder knows, and rude. This Lasts for five rounds. A torrent of squeaky insults compels foes to smash the arrow and shut it up. Provided it understands the arrow's language, the nearest enemy creature to the arrow must make a Wisdom (Insight) check of DC 20 each round of the effect to not move toward the arrow and attack it. The arrow has 1HP and an AC of 1. The arrow's taunts have a range of 60 feet and the DC is 25 when out of combat.

- Obnoxious Bow of Fletched Annoyance: As above, but can affect the nearest two enemies.

- Most Obnoxious Blow of Fletched Annoyance: Draws three dudes.
