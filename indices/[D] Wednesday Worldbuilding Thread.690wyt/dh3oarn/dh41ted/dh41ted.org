Grappling bow: Any arrow fired from this bow is automatically attached to the bow by a magical string. This string is weightless and inertialess and extends in length to match the speed of the arrow until the arrow hits its target. The arrow automatically sticks to the target, and the string (magically as as strong as silk rope) exists until the command word is spoken, allowing the wielder to (for example) swing across a chasm by holding onto the bow. Assuming, of course, that whatever the arrow is stuck to can hold the user's weight.

Net bow: Fires a net which entangles and traps its target.

Solar bow: Any arrow fired from this bow detonates in a flash of solar energy on impact. Always destroys the arrow. Much sought after by vampire hunters; though the flash of light will still often blind those that are not harmed by it.

Camouflage bow: The wielder's colours will change to almost but not quite match the scenery behind him, rendering him harder to spot.

Deluge Bow: Every arrow fired by this bow will become two identical arrows on striking the target. Both arrows disintegrate after doing normal damage. (Named because it's easy for a force armed with this bows to fire a vast deluge of arrows)

Exchange bow: On a successful ranged attack against a living creature (doing damage as normal) the wielder and the target are both teleported to each other's positions. The favoured weapon of Hank the Suicidal, who liked to jump off a tall building or take some similarly suicidal action shortly before firing it at an enemy. (Hank the Suicidal eventually died shortly after his bow was replaced by a non-magical duplicate).

Spellbow: Casting a touch-range spell on this bow will cause the next arrow fired to deliver that spell to its target on a successful hit.

Sleep bow: A successful hit may cause the target to fall asleep. Generally used in training exercises.

Eartheater: Arrows fired from this bow do no damage to living creatures. Instead, if it hits earth or stone, a large volume of earth or stone is simply annihilated. Can be fired at someone's feet to create a pit.

Trick bow: If two arrows are fired from this bow in quick succession, the second will always hit the first mid-flight. Great for impressing people who have never heard of the bow, but not particularly useful in combat.
