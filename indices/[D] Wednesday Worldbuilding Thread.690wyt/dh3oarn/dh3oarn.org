*tl;dr: need some neat magic bows*

I gave one of my D&D (5E) players a magical weapon, the Copy Bow, which can copy the magical properties of bows and mimic them. He's had the idea to go into a magic mart (which exist in this setting) and spam copy every bow he can find. I'm totally in favor of this, since it sounds cool to me, but I need some bows - there are very few magic bows in the core book and I want them to be (mechanically) interesting while still not being overpowered for level 6-10. Some examples:

- Frog Bow: This +1 longbow is decorated with lily pads and always slightly damp to the touch. Any arrow fired from this bow will turn into a frog. Because frogs are not terribly sharp, they will only do 1d3 damage. Likewise, range is reduced by half.

- Vector Bow: This +1 shortbow is angular with hard edges, as though its builder despised curves. Arrows fired from it are not subject to gravity, wind, or air friction. Instead, the arrow will travel on forever at a constant speed until it strikes its target (assuming it was aimed true). Long range on the Vector Bow is infinite so long as you have line of sight (though it still carries disadvantage as normal).

- Tincture String: This longbow comes with a small funnel on the side, into which various liquids can be poured as an action. Thereafter, a command word allows the weilder to fire an arrow composed entirely of the chosen liquid, which will fly through the air and splash on its target. Due to the magic of the bow, this can also be used to administer potions which would otherwise need to be swallowed.

I've got ~30 of these so far and would like some more. If it matters, this is for my "there are loads and loads of gods for even very minor things like tying your shoelaces" setting, which partly helps to explain why someone would ever make something as weird and pointless as a bow that turns its arrows into frogs.
