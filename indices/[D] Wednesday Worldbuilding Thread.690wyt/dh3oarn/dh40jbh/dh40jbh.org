Here's a few, likely not balanced though.

- Bow of Smoothing: Arrows fired from this bow will turn surfaces beneath their flight path into a smooth, close to frictionless surface, 1 foot wide. Only one smooth path can exist at a time; if another arrow is fired, the existing path will disappear. The arrows only reduce friction; you can't walk over smoothed lava.

- Killer Clowns's Smile: This +1 bow is carved and painted so as to resemble a hideous clown's smile. If an arrow from this bow hits something alive, that organism will have something hilarious and mildly painful happen to it. It might step on a rake that wasn't there a minute ago, or have it's pants fall down to their feet when it tries to take a step, whatever the god of clowns thinks is funny.

- Smokebringer: This longbow is made of twisted ebony. When fired, arrows will trail clouds of pitch black smoke behind them. The smoke is breathable, slightly flammable, and blocks out almost all light. It dissipates quickly, smoke from an arrow only lasting two rounds.

- Bow of the Foolhardy: This +1 shortbow looks completely normal, but upon striking an enemy, will launch itself forward towards them. If a Strength check is passed, the bow's user will be pulled forward as well, ending up directly in front of their enemy. They may not make an attack mid-flight. If the strength check is not passed, the bow will launch forward on it's own, dealing 1d2 damage.
