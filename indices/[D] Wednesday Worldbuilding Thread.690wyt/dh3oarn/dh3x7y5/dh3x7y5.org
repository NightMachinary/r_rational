Hmm, I have a few ideas, no clue about balance though:

- Traceless Bow: Is completely silent (both when firing and when the arrow strikes something), and also casts /mending/ on any object that it strikes, removing any damage it causes.
- Tracer Bow: Arrows fired from this bow glow with light as bright as a torch, starting from when the arrow is drawn and ending one round after it strikes a target.\\
- Boomerang Bow: Arrows fired from this bow will attempt return to the shooter after striking a target. If it is stuck in an object or creature, this deals 1 additional damage the following round. If not, the arrows land near your feet the round after they were fired. You still only recover half of your ammo, with the other half breaking.
- Universal Bow: Can fire arrows, bolts, sling bullets, and blowgun darts interchangeably.
- Stasis bow: After drawing, you can press a button on the grip of the bow to lock it in its fully drawn position, and press it again to release the effect. In this form, it acts as a one-handed ranged weapon that you do not have proficiency in.
