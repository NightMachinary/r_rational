Some magic bows (made most of them +1 masterwork longbows because that seems to be what would be appropriately useful for the levels you specify).

- Equalizing Bow: Deals 1d2 damage per every one hit dice more the target has than the wielder. Deals no damage if target has no more HD and deals 1d2 damage to wielder for every one hit dice they have more than the target. Bow is sized for wielder with appearance otherwise being based on number/size of HD of wielder. In the hands of a classless NPC it is the most impressive looking bow imaginable, but to a high level character it may appear to be barely in working order, and to a being of greater power it may have an outright absurd appearance such as a curved twig with a bit of yarn as it's string (that still somehow functions normally).

- Lighteater Bow: Every square the arrow travels through is put in total darkness for 3d6 turns. Darkness can not be illuminated, but can be magically dispelled (treated as having been cast with ECL 16). Does not block vision of creatures with darkvision or other methods of seeing through total darkness. Is otherwise normal +1 masterwork longbow.

- Stormbringer Bow: +1 masterwork longbow that can change weather in squares the arrows travels through. Effects are constrained to affected squares but take effect next round and last for 3d6 minutes. Weather effects are only controlled by direction of shooter when arrow was initially fired and can only be changed by firing another arrow though those squares and waiting for it to supercede the previous effect. While fine bows in their own respect they also serve useful purposes in watering crops or wearing down enemy armies through harsh weather.

- Ethereal Bow: Deals considerable force damage in addition to being a +2 masterwork longbow. However all arrows shot turn incorporeal and will thus only affect ethereal entities or creatures composed primarily of force/astral energy and other such non-physical magical entities.

- Time Skip Bow: +1 masterwork longbow whose arrows disappear when fired. Disappeared arrows will then reappear and continue on their original path normally at a later time that the shooter specified when they initially shot them, from a turn in the future to 24 hours later. A favorite of assassins or anyone who knows their target will be in a given location at a set time so they can set up a barrage of arrows to wait for them. While weaker than sigils or other such magical traps they can make up for it in sheer quantity and by being less conspicuous. Can be spotted via true sight or other mid-high tier detection magics and dispelling the area they disappeared in will cause them to reappear (but this may be very bad for the dispeller).

- Metamagic Bow: +1 masterwork longbow. However this bows main effect is that a magic user can apply any known metamagic feats to the arrows when fired, and the bow can remember any metamagic feats that have been used with it and then apply them to any fired arrows. Treat arrows fired as you would a spell that did the same thing (so usually treat as lvl 1 spell, but may be higher if enchantments have been applied). When applying metamagic feats can only apply feats if resulting ECL of arrows does not exceed level of shooter.

- Illusory Bow: +1 masterwork longbow. Can apply pretty much any illusion to arrows though this must match the arrow you are disguising it as, unless you just want to act as a normal arrow. Arrow can mimic any arrow material and otherwise act as any arrow you have ever seen fired (such as that fired from a ballista). However any targets it hits save vs will to disbelieve, and if they succeed the arrow only deals 1/5 damage (basically like the shadow illusion spells).
