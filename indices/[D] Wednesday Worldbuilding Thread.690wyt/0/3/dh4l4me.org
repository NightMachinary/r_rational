I'd be worried about the Vector Bow being overpowered if the player takes the Sharpshooter feat. Among other things, it lets the player ignore disadvantage for long range, so the only limit would be line of sight. A possible solution would be to have disadvantage at 800 feet (twice the long range of a Longbow) regardless of Sharpshooter feat, provided that the target is aware of the players. This would be an approximation for the target being able to see the arrow coming over a long distance, and then move out of the way.

If you are playing without feats, then it looks great.
