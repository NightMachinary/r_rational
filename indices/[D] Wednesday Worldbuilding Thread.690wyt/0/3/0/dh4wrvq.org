I tend not to worry about balance all that much, since this isn't for wide release and it's only ever going to be used by (at most) two players if they buy it /and/ copy it. If anything is ever a problem, it's easy enough to adjust the challenges the players face, especially if they're facing an enemy that knows they're coming.

I think there probably is a realism argument to be made, since an arrow fired 40 miles away from the top of a mountain is almost certainly not going to hit its target given that the degree of imprecision gets multiplied. At the same time, I really like the idea of there being a sniper shot that only one specific bow can make, and to a lesser extent I like the idea of the trade-offs implied by archers actually using long range.
