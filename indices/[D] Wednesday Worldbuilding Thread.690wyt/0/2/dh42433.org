I'm rubbish for numbers, but here's some ideas:

Trap Bow: Upon releasing the string to fire, the bow shatters, dealing damage to the wielder.

Smokewood Bow: Any arrows fired from this bow pass through wood as if it were smoke. Variants could exist for a variety of target materials.

Soulsplit Bow: Every time the bow is fired, the string will cut into the forearm of the offhand (unless it is heavily armored), dealing 2d4 damage. If the arrow hits, the damage dealt to the wielder is added to the unit hit.

Breach Bow: Every arrow fired from this bow blinks past the first target (or up to one meter of solid material) it comes across, hitting anything behind it as normal.

Empathy Bow: The components of this bow transform into the material hit by the last fired arrow, affecting effective strength required to draw the bow, damage dealt, etc. On hitting a target, alternate whether it is the string or the bow which transforms.

Roulette Bow: Every 1d4 shots, the arrow somehow disappears before hitting anything. Alternatively, only every 1d4 shots actually hit.

Phase Bow: Every arrow fired from this bow passes harmlessly through its targets, until the front half has penetrated, after which it resumes corporeality.

Dorf Bow: It menaces with spikes of elven bone. This bow somehow manages to be capable of firing small axes, and will not perform with any other ammunition.

Bow of Greed: Deals ludicrously good damage, but only when a gold piece is inserted into the slot before each shot. Where the gold goes is a mystery.

Artillery Bow: Once per fight, the bow may be invoked, placing the wielder into a trance for one round. The wielder fires four shots into the air, each on a progressively shallower trajectory. All four shots land simultaneously on target, dealing bonus damage in addition to that of the four arrows. An empty space above the wielder greater than or equal to the maximum range of the bow is required for this to work.

Reverb Bow: As a fast action, wielder may flip an arrow end-over-end, catching it again. For each such instance of arrow-flipping prior to firing, the arrow will ricochet once after landing.

Timelock Bow: Arrows fired from this bow do not move beyond the position just beyond leaving the bow. The next solid object to touch the still arrow unfreezes it, receiving full point-blank damage (if on the business end).

Pacifist Bow: Arrows fired from this bow inexplicably turn into soft flowers just before hitting their target.

Remembrance Bow: A small daemon lives within this bow. If you offer a memory to the daemon (by holding it firmly in mind while firing), it will consume it, adding damage to the shot proportional to the importance of the memory.

Bejeweled Bow: An extravagant bow studded with various sizes of gaudish fake gemstones. Arrows that land never fail to hit their target between the legs.

Reverse Bow: Mid-flight, the material properties of the fletching and arrowhead swap places, usually resulting in an arrow landing with a feathery tip and steel fletching.

Sideways Bow: No matter how hard the wielder tries, arrows fired from this bow always manage to hit their target sideways, dealing 1d2 damage.
