Depends on what it is, but while the arrow is protected from gravity, wind, and air friction, whatever you tie to it is not, and the arrow isn't protected from whatever you tie to it. If you tied something that weighed as much as an arrow to the arrow, and considered only gravity, then it would drop at the same speed as an arrow, despite having twice the mass. Hopefully this won't come up though.

(In my campaign setting, arguments about what does or does not constitute a _____ are resolved on the metaphysical Platonic plane that overlays the natural world, where an aggrieved overgod semi-arbitrarily makes decisions when presented with a corner case.)
