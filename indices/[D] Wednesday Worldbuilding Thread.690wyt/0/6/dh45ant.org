  Vector Bow: This +1 shortbow is angular with hard edges, as though its builder despised curves. Arrows fired from it are not subject to gravity, wind, or air friction. Instead, the arrow will travel on forever at a constant speed until it strikes its target (assuming it was aimed true). Long range on the Vector Bow is infinite so long as you have line of sight (though it still carries disadvantage as normal).

So if you aim at something behind opponent, it would pierce them inside out? BTW Cool idea.

Some of my ideas you may like:

- Crash Bow - Projectiles shot from this bow don't do damage, but instead launch medium sized or smaller target in a direction opposite to the archer. If there is something on their way, they will crash into it and get 1d6 damage.
- Blink Bow - A shortbow that doesn't actually fire arrows, but rather teleports them 60 ft. from the user. If the area is occupied by some creature, it gets 1d6 damage without an attack roll.
- Divine Arc - This composite longbow is basically a denial of what weapon should be. Instead of dealing damage, it heals 1d8 hit points upon striking its target.
- Shotbow - A weird looking bow containing a small bubble of warped space. It can be loaded with up to three arrows by putting them into it's pocket dimension and fire all of them in one go with -2 penalty to attack roll. However loading it is a full-round action and the range is halved.
