  the Fae never seem to win anything

I mean, that's kind of the point of the Fae, right? They're locked into eternal stories; when they war with each other, any victory will always end up with their eventual downfall. And any defeat will be unmade when the seasons change, and all the defeated Fae return.

The Summer princess said it herself: they don't have stories (or at least not powerful ones) in Creation. So mortals /can/ beat them there. And Akua might be a mortal, but she's a powerfully Named mortal who has spent years planning and months preparing for these fights.

Akua is also a somewhat unreliable narrator - part of the power of her Name is that she seems to get stronger with her own victories ("Raw power pumped through her veins, her very Name feeding on the sight of her supremacy."). Basically she sees what she wants to see, which is her own power crushing her enemies. The rest of the battle isn't actually going all that well for Akua's forces:

  The melee that ensued was brutal, cast iron in furious eldritch hands smashing into the silvery arms of the Summer Court's peerless knights. Diabolist paid it no further mind

  Deaths, so many deaths, of both mortals and fae.

  The walls were holding, by a thread... The casualties were brutal, but what did she care when her dead men rose within moments to hold their blades again?

  ... half her walin-falme were gone, but so was a third of Summer's most dangerous soldiers.

And she has three great devils that were supposed to be equivalent to the Summer princes and princesses; but since the Summer princess attacks Akua from behind, the implication is that all three devils were destroyed by her.

So even after months of preparation, Akua seems to have lost a good portion of her (living) army, at least half of her summoned devils, all three of her major devils, has had her battlements scorched and melted, was forced to activate an array she had planned on saving for the Legions, and took a hit that bypassed several wards designed specifically to counter Fae attacks. She was also forced to use all three Aspects of her name, which likely have some limit. And she doesn't win so much as force a draw due not to her own efforts, but because Cat probably set off alarm bells by traipsing through the Summer side of Arcadia with her army.

Black would look at this battle and think it was a waste of resources. Cat would look at this battle and be infuriated at how Diabolist just tossed away the lives of her men to use them as a power source. Akua looks at it and thinks she's amazeballs, because she's an old-style megalomaniac.
