Ursula didn't think humans could challenge her and were easily fooled. She was completely correct regarding this and if she hadn't grown huge everything would have worked out well. In hindsight the evil overlord rule " I will not turn into a snake. It never helps." should probably include the clause "I won't make myself enormous to the point where I'm not in my element anymore" as well.

Cruella...that's a good point. It should be noted that there aren't that many people you can approach with the idea "can you make a puppy proof room where we can gather almost a hundred stolen puppies that will be skinned" if you want it to remain a secret but it really could have been done better.
