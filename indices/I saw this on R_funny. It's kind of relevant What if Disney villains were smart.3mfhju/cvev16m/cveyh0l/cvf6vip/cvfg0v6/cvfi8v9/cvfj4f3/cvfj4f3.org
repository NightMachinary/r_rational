I guess the first was the huntsman, but I thought of that separately. After Snow White grew up and the mirror told the queen about her, first she sold her laces and tied them tight enough for Snow White to suffocate, then the dwarfs found her, loosened them, and revived her. Then the queen sold her a poisoned comb, and the dwarfs revived her by taking it out of her hair. Then she tried the poisoned apple, and the dwarfs couldn't revive her. A wandering prince said that he fell in love with her and asked for her body for reasons that I'm sure were completely wholesome, and then dropped the casket which made the bite of the apple fall out of her throat and woke her up. And then she was so thankful for being saved she never thought to wonder what the prince was planning to do with her body.
