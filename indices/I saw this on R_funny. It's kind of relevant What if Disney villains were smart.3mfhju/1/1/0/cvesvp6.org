I don't see this as changing his values, but as recognizing there are likely other women who could meet his values in the same way Belle does. I grant that the "million other hotties" probably don't fall in that bell curve, but if you handed me a random nerd who was hung up on a girl to the point of organizing a coordinated attack against her chosen partner and a nerd who, once rejected, looked for other women, I think it's clear who I would think is more rational.

That being said, I do like the [[https://youtu.be/q9vgqq8KyZo?t=205][Twisted]] interpretation, in which Gaston loved Belle for who she was, and saw her love for her captor as Stockholm Syndrome, and led the mob against a criminal.
