Didn't Cruella want puppies because their fur and hides are softest? I'm pretty sure that was stated somewhere in the film. Also Dalmatians used to be kinda rare back when the film came out, the film was what propelled their popularity, so it's not like there were tons sitting around waiting to be adopted.
