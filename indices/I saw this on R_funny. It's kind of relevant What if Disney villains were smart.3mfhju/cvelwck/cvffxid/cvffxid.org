I've seen a discussion about Cruella on CollegeHumor that I can't find right now. They said that she was planning on raising the puppies and killing them as adults, but she was about to get caught, so she decided to just kill the ones she had so far. I assume she adopted as many as she could, but you can't adopt 101 dalmatians.

The Stepmother thinking her ugly daughters would get picked over her beautiful step daughter still counts as being stupid.
