Broker a deal. If Cinderella identifies and works as her servant, technically she's property of the house. She could literally sell her either for money, or write into the contract that in exchange for the girl, the previous owner gets semi-royal privileges or a stipend. If Cinders is uneducated, starved, and worked to the bone, she's probably not going to have the gall to oppose her stepmother offering her freedom and marriage in exchange for signing her name to a piece of paper.
