Except that genies absolutely can make new genies, which is where new genies come from. If Jafar can wish for Genie to make Jafar a genie, he could wish for Genie to make ALADDIN a genie instead. And then use his first wish from Aladdin to make Aladdin perfectly loyal, and then his second to make Jasmine a genie, and her first to make her perfectly loyal, and so on netting +1 wish per transformed person. If he really wanted, he could use his third wishes on freeing all those genies, who would still remain loyal, and would retain however much power Genie had after being freed which was not a small amount. But now he has armies of them.
