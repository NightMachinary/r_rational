Yes, but it's a two possibility path, and since he has one wish left, he can't have both. either all genies are inherently bound unless clearly specified otherwise, in which case- wish for your nearest enemy to become a genie, assuming you use one wish to keep them from betraying you, one to keep the chain going, you turn a one wish profit, at the cost of increasing the genies in the world by one. or genies aren't bound by definition, and wishing to become a genie is optimal, also, note genies seem to have absurd lifespans, so it might be a net gain for jafar anyways. infinite wishes are nice, but risking your enemy recieving that is not happening. he chose the gamble that gave him personal power, rather than the gamble that didn't. plus, he doesn't know the rules genies play by, and he can't be sure. genie sure isn't gonna tell him.
