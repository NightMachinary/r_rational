Is "are all genies bound by rules?" a rules question, though? would it even give the right answer? "does every genie play by your rules?". He knew what Genie's rules were, but not if every genie had to play by them. it turns out they do, but... Does Genie have to tell other genie's rules?

If an AI has to tell you what rules it's bound by, it doesn't have to tell you the rules other AIs are bound by.
