On one hand, I'm an idiot, but on the other he probably wouldn't be able to make genies out of nothing. He says that he can't raise the dead so I'm assuming that he can't create new people that are exactly the same as the dead people. If this is true he would have to have a person that he turns into a genie and in that case the genie would probably be cross with Jafar.

A rational person could still just make all their wishes very carefully worded so I suppose it works.
