These don't really work. Sure a rational Jafar might have decided to just remain as the most powerful person in the world and maybe even use his last wish to find where other genies are but you can't wish for more wishes and it doesn't make much sense that a genie has the power to make more genies.

Cruella de ville's plan was perfect and would have worked if it wasn't for the fact that animals can talk to each other and some random farm animals found the puppies.

Gaston liked Belle because she didn't immediately like him so changing that is changing what he's attracted to, not making him rational.

Wasn't the whole point about Ursula that she had to get Triton to give up his power willingly so that she could control the trident and not get blasted into tiny bits?

The stepmom in Cinderella woudn't have though Cinderella had a hope in hell unless she saw her all magic'd up.

The queen....why didn't she just stab Snow White?

Edit: While I stand by the others in general I have to admit that there are many ways for the Jafar scenario to work that requires very minor tweaks.
