If Ursula kills Eric and thus captures Ariel with a contract she can't fulfil, she can still work a hostage situation with Triton as she did in the actual film. His trident for his daughter back; Ursula still becomes queen of the sea.

If Cruella's all that rich, surely she could've hired better thugs and maybe a mansion with a cellar, or some kind of metal doors. Pretty sure the pups escaped in the first place through a hole in one of the walls.
