I think it was implied that Scar's hyenas sharing the hunting territory seriously contributed to the lion's problems during the drought. But Scar needed the hyenas to maintain power, so he was stuck with them.

But you know, even after all that, part of the tribe remained loyal to him and Scar's heir ultimately inherited the throne. All in all, I think Scar's scheming came out in net-positive, as far as Scar's own metrics of "positive" go... even if he didn't win everything forever, he got more than he would have gotten. Although he might have gotten an heir even otherwise.
