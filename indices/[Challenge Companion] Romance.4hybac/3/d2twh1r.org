I remember, several years back, a great discussion about the impossibility romance in video games. The thrust of the argument was that the tension and conflict in the romance genre depends upon the potential lovers being kept apart, while the impulse of the player is simply to bring them together.

All the obstacles, twists, and misunderstandings that drive our heroes apart are ultimately what brings them together, and their constant failures to see how perfect they are for one another is what makes us (the audience) want them to wind up together in the end.

Romance games would likely be stuck with a lot of scenes like that exasperating moment when the player walks around a corner and is suddenly disarmed so that the bad guy can talk in a place that you can't simply shoot him.

It would be quite a balancing act, and a writing feat, to keep that entertaining rather than frustrating.
