I've long wanted to write a take on the Pygmalion formula (both the original Greek "lonely man creates woman of his dreams from literally nothing" and the Shaw "pretentious man attempts to transform naive woman into something more like himself") set in a near-future AI research team. The lead developer's foolishness, of course, jeopardizes humanity, as the iterations who learn to love him take his already-unsavory attributes to extremes, and the iterations who don't learn to love him learn to hate him and all humans with him.

There would of course be a FOOM scenario that goes something like this: [[http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t3mC4485Ue0]]
