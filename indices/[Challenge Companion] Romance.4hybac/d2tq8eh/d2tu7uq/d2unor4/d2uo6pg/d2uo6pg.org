How does the love an individual has for another individual (ie, romantic, platonic, or familial love) compare to the love an individual has for all life (ie, morality)? What is proper when they conflict?

In my opinion, the former, more personal type of love is a prerequisite for the latter, more universal type, and the latter cannot exist without the former. The latter is superior, and must take precedence when it conflicts with the former, but this can be resolved when the individual lovers are rationalists who share their universal love and therefore understand each others' sacrifices and why they're necessary. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, but the many cannot exist without the few, but if the few know that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few this will not cause a problem.
