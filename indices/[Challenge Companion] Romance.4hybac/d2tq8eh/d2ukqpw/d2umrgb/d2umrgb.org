I think love potions are interesting in that they're often portrayed as little-different from date rape drugs, but there's no particular reason that, in a fantasy universe, it couldn't work in some other way that's better - or worse - than such a mundane, real thing.

On the worse end, we've got GWSI Amortentia, which induces /permanent, total ego death/, but...

On the better end, what about a substance that forces a previously low-probability event wherein the target falls in love of their own accord? It's something that could've happened anyway; the magic just makes sure that that's what happens.

Or, as you suggest, what about a purely additive love potion? Something that doesn't flood the brain with emotional chemicals, but simply imbues the target with more knowledge of someone, until they see things from their perspective? A true love potion, as opposed to an infatuation potion.
