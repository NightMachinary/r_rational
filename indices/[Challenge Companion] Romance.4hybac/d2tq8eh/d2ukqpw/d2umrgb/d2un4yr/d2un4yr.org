You might be misunderstanding me. To clarify, unless you /do in fact fulfill the values of your romantic interest/, I'm not sure of any way to ethically get someone to fall in love with you (except perhaps changing yourself to fulfill those values).

Anything that changes your romantic interest's values in a way that your romantic interest, pre-change, would not approve, is skeevy to me.

The low-probability potion is good, but I'm not quite sure how you're intending the additive potion, because of the "until they see things from their perspective" bit.
