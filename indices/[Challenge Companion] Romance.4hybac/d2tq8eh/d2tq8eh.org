I expect the most interesting topics on this theme will probably relate to the challenges, ethics and consequences of fantasy powers and characters in a romantic context. Apart from fantasy settings, cultural variations on romance in sci-fi settings may also be worth exploring. Example topics:

- *Love potions:* Probably unethical, but are you sure? There are many ways to make someone fall in love with you, so what exactly makes love potions different?

- *Telepathy:* Rationalists are often attracted to other rationalists. How would a rationalist telepath woo another rationalist without them figuring out about the telepathy?

- *Cupid:* If Cupid died, how would the process of falling in love change? What would be the sociological impact? How could we prove that Cupid had died (or ever existed), and how could we correct the situation? Would love potions become acceptable?

- *Shapeshifters:* They gain a unique ability to test their lovers' faithfulness, but what problems or ethical dilemmas might arise from doing so?

- *Polyamorous families:* In /The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress/, Heinlein describes how lunar prison colonies adapted to an environment with far more men than women by forming marriages between multiple men and women. Is this the most likely outcome of societal gender imbalance?
