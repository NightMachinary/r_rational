  Conflict relating to a romance shouldn't be an interpersonal conflict within the couple (because then we'll take a side, or not, and come to despise one or both people), but rather an external conflict that threatens the couple('s formation).

Well ... this depends on what the internal conflict is. I think internal conflict is fine, so long as it's an internal conflict that can be resolved such that both people end up conforming to the norms that the reader is comfortable with.

For example, she's an overly optimistic cop on her first day in the big city, he's a streetwise hustler trying to coast by and not form attachments. By the end of the movie, she's discovered that the world is a more complex place than she thought, and he's joined the police force as her partner to use his hustling powers for good.

Redemption is a pretty common theme in love stories, in part because it allows for an interpersonal conflict that can have a resolution via one or both people changing, and the audience will almost always agree with that change if it's from something socially unacceptable to something socially acceptable. (It can't be /too/ socially unacceptable to start off with, naturally, because there are some things we're naturally inclined to think are irredeemable.)

One of my favorite movies with a strong romantic subplot is /Groundhog Day/, which pulls a similar trick; it's all about Phil becoming a better person, and his romantic conflict gets solved by him becoming not just /good/, but at peace with himself and his place in the world around him.
