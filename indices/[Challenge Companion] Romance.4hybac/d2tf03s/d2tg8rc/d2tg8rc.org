For all that the device is criticized, perhaps the best use of romance in a narrative is a reward? Or rather, a motivation. A Something To Protect. Conflict relating to a romance shouldn't be an interpersonal conflict within the couple (because then we'll take a side, or not, and come to despise one or both people), but rather an external conflict that threatens the couple('s formation).
