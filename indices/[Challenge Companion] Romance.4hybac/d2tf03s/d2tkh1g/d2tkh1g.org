Romance is very much rational --- your emotions are an aspect of your mind that interacts on equal footing with reason, willpower, memory, morals, etc. Your emotions can inform your reasoning, but your reasoning can inform your emotions.

Rational romance consists of realizing that "romance" as branded by the heteronormative society is full of sexist, harmful bullcrap like "love is indeed not rational," as well as the idea of "the one and only."

The goal of a romantic relationship is connecting intimately with another person, emotionally, and usually also sexually. To this end, it makes perfect sense to dispose of any inherent "mysteriousness" of romance --- mysteriousness of a thing is a property of one's lack of knowledge, not of the thing itself. And it defies belief to think that there is only one person out of 7.4 billion that you could connect with, or that every romantic relationship is supposed to last forever.

Romances can be long or short, stable or turbulent, but above all they require work and effort and willingness to change. So the "rational" way to go about relationships is to have good introspection, clear goals and boundaries, communicate a lot, and being prepared for eventual change in the relationship, as well as being prepared to put in a lot of emotional work.
