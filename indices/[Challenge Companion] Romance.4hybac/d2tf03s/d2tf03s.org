Romance doesn't really work as the main conflict of a rational story, in my opinion, because love is indeed not rational - and if it is, if it's an element that can be understood and manipulated and intelligently exploited, then it's not a romance anymore, is it? It's just manipulation. Romance as a subplot works great, but romance as the main story element is either creepy or has to be shunted off to indirect goals.

I suppose you could do things like a rational story about a consultant who solves a clients problems while falling in love? But again, that pushes the romance to a subplot.
