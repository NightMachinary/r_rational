Yeah, it was mentioned earlier too. I assumed that the Bard has some kind of ability related to perception aspects, considering that the Pilgrim has Behold as well, and Epilogue IV implies that the Bard can manipulate what the Augur sees:

  The Augur sitting alone in a frosted garden, spoken whispers still echoing in her ears like a coiling snake.

But considering that the Augur recently won a victory over the Bard, it could be the case that the Bard just has generally good intentions, but some kind of long-term plan that's bad for everyone else, and that's how she got the Pilgrim to trust her.
