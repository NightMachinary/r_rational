Cat's wish is probably what Kairos was laughing at when they first met.

From Book 5, Chapter 7:

  The Tyrant took one look at me, good eye widening, and convulsed. For a heartbeat I was worried that the Night had somehow hurt him, but the convulsion erupted into raucous, heartfelt laughter. I blinked, taken aback. I flicked a glance at the nearest gargoyle but it just put out its tongue at me. I discretely kicked it while the Tyrant kept laughing his guts out. Eventually the villain got himself under control, wiping tears out of his eyes with trembling hands.

  “Oh, that is a fine jest indeed,” he said, then peeked at the floor. “You never disappoint.”

  I cleared my throat.

  “I don't suppose you'd care to share,” I said.

  The Tyrant smiled at me in the way of man for whom smiles came easy and meant little.

  “You are so short,” Kairos Theodosian said. “It is quite delightful.”

  He was a good liar, I decided, but I'd known better. Just by looking at me he'd learned something, and I had no idea what. I set that aside for later consideration.
