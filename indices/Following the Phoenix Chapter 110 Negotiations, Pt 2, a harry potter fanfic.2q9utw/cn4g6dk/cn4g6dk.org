Minor typo: I think "dunked" should be "dumped".

Fun chapter -- Harry comes up with very sensible proposals and knows how to present them: "I surrender. Here's a list of suggestions on ways to keep my surrender from collapsing your economy and ruining your country. Just suggestions, mind you -- I'm happy to do it however you like. Still, might be a good idea to take them."

I like the fact that you remembered the "sense of doom" thing; I had forgotten about that. Seems to me that Dumbledore is in over his head on this one; I don't see how he can stand up to Quirriddlemort and simultaneously protect everyone else.

Also, what was the /Catena Magnus/ spell that Hermione cast?
