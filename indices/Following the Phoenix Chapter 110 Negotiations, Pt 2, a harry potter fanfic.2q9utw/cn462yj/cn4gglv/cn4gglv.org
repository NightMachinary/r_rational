Thinking about AK made me remember something. In HPMOR ch86, Moody says:

#+begin_quote
  The first is that the Killing Curse strikes directly at the soul, and it'll just keep going until it hits one. Straight through shields. Straight through walls.
#+end_quote

As I recall, in canon the curse is stopped by inanimate objects (such as walls). For example, the centaur statue that Dumbledore used to block Voldemort's curse in the Ministry battle. Did EY get it wrong / change it for his AU, or is there something that I've forgotten about the books?
