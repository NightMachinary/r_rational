Avada Kedavra is a great equaliser. Unblockable, easy to cast, not getting any better no matter if you're level 10 or 1000.

There are at least 2 people capable of casting Avada Kedavra at Tom, both of them are telepathicaly commanded by Harry and unable to disobey him.

Why are they even talking with Tom?
