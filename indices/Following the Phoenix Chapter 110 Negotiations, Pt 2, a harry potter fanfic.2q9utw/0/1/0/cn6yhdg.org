Can Dumbledore actually cast AK? I think I remember it being said somewhere that he isn't able to, if that's right then there's only the 2 adults capable and Lucius can be influenced by Tom as we see in Negotiations 3. Also Tom's proven to be an accomplished duelist so having him dodge is in no way a stretch.

Hmm on the note of interesting ways to counter AK, would transfiguring an object into an animal, say a brick into a cloud of gnats would they block AK?
