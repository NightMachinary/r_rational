Except we see in the Rowling books that AK works on an insect of some description when 'Mad Eye Moody' is the defense teacher. It's also used on various other animals in the series including a fox and an owl.

This could come down to the MoR changes to magic. There's not really a mention of what AK does in ToS other than killing without leaving a mark.
