But why call that the end? The end of that puddle on the asphalt, yes, but all the water that made up the puddle still exists, and will continue on to do other things.

In fact, that water has likely existed since the formation of the earth, doing all kinds of things we don't know about, and it will likely continue to do so until the Sun expands to consume the planet.
