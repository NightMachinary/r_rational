I think that this sounds like a good change to encourage better commenting. In addition, we should test it as an experiment, if we think there's any chance of it being better.

Also, I know that there's a "contest" mode that puts them in a random order, so that might be better, though if I remember correctly, that also hides child comments, so that wouldn't be good.
