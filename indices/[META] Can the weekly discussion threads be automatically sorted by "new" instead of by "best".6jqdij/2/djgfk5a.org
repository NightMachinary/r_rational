I agree, it would be helpful.

That said, I'm not sure if it's possible. Does reddit allow custom settings for threads out-of-the-box? As far as I could tell, moderators could only enable contest mode for individual threads, or change sorting order of comments for all threads on their subreddit, but not for individual threads.

Though I wouldn't mind if we switched onto sorting by old/new comments by default.

(Probably because I already set that as a preference for all of reddit, but nevermind that.)
