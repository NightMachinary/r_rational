For flat-out action-centered testosterone, [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29957204-nothing-short-of-dying][Clyde Barr]] is pretty good.

If you don't mind superhero settings, the protagonist of [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9715417-in-hero-years-i-m-dead][In Hero Years, I'm Dead]] fits pretty well, too.

And I have to give a shout-out to my absolute favorite action hero novel of all time... [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/472220.Hunters_of_the_Red_Moon][Hunters of the Red Moon]].
