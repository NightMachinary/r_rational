There's isn't, although there's a little bit of ship teasing at some points. (Either that, or Datcord's infamous comments on SB are making me see things that aren't there.) It's a fantastic story and should be right up your alley, though. You don't need to know anything about RWBY or the Gamer for it to be good.
