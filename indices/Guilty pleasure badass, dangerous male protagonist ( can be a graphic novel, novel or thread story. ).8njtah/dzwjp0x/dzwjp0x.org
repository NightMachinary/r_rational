Have you read Dune? Paul (and later Leto II) Atreides get super-OP.

The Elenium/Tamuli series by David and Leigh Eddings would probably suit you better than the Belgariad, given your description of the protagonist.

Sandman Slim is pulpy but a lot of fun -- of all the recommendations on my list, I think match what you're looking for the best.

I'm not sure if Earthsea quite matches your description, but it's close enough that I'd feel bad leaving it out.

And yeah, as someone else mentioned, Zelazny's Amber and Bryant's Jhereg series (and the related Khaavren Romances, which are based on the D'Artagnan Romances, but with magic).
