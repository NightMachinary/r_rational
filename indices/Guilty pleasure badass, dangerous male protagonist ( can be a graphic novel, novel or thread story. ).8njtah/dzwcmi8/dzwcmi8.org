Does it have to be a male protagonist? Because when I think of works I've found on this sub that meet the criteria "badass, smart, OP protagonist takes world by storm," I think Worm and Practical Guide to Evil. Although in both of those cases there's a lengthy ramp-up before the OPness and the taking-the-world-by-storm, they're pretty intense once they reach that point. Both protagonists are vicious and deadly when they come into their own, and they set their aims high.

That said, I'm not sure whether you prefer the protagonist to face challenges proportional to their own skill and power, or whether the guilty pleasure is in watching them steamroll everything. Both legitimate preferences, but the works I mentioned are in the first category. The more powerful the protagonists get, the higher the stakes and the more dangerous their opponents.
