If you're looking for something seriously badass (though perhaps not the strongest re: rationality...) you should check out Feng Shen Ji.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhua/FengShenJi?from=Manga.FengShenJi]]

It's a chinese graphic novel. The premise is that in a fantasy world in which vaguely Buddhism-inspired gods rule mortals with an iron fist a king dares rise against them. In the first chapter he clashes fiercely with an army of thousands against them out of the doors of his city... and loses. This isn't his story - it's the story of his /son/, who sets on a long and tortuous path to power in order to be able to finally avenge his father and accomplish his dream - that humans might live free from the rule of the cruel, capricious Gods.

It's amazing. Seriously, seriously badass, full of page spreads that will leave you gaping in awe at the spectacle and of incredibly awesome fighting scene. You want a spectacular fantasy epic in graphic novel form with an original setting (at least if you're used to the western-type ones), it doesn't get much better than that.
