Lots of stuff from [[/r/hfy]] would fit there.

- [[http://deathworlders.com/books/deathworlders][Deathworlders]] by Hambone. Not all of his protagonists are male, but all are awesome and dangerous.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/61ya08/oh_this_has_not_gone_well/][Oh This Has Not Gone Well]] started good, got awesome, stayed that for a while, had a bit of a slump in content and quality, but the last few chapters have been getting better and better again.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/30tk8j/pithe_fourth_wave_part_i/][The Fourth Wave]] went on a bit long for my taste, but it should fit your criterias very well.
