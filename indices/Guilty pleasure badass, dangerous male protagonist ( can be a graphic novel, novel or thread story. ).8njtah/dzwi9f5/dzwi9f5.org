The Acts of Caine by Matt Stover. Contains everything you asked for, is very well written and has plenty of rational aspects plus an intriguing premise: ‘actors' from earth make their living playing roles when they're sent to a parallel realm that is a fantasy world with conventional fantasy ‘physics' and have their internal experience both recorded and ‘live-streamed' to viewers. The protagonist could be straight out of most of the series you mentioned except with more depth.

Of the series you mentioned I would place it slightly above Joe Abercrombie's First law, which I would place a tier above all the others mentioned.

Chronically underrated series. Ignore the awful cover!
