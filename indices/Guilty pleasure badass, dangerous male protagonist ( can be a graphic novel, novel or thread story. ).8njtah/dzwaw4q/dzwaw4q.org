Self promo: I write a superhero serial called [[https://inheritorsserial.com][Inheritors]] if you don't mind those. The main character is a clone of the greatest hero ever, and while he isn't as strong as his predecessor yet, he's still badass enough to take on Houston's Hero, and fight off a bunch of gang members in a hallway. He can convert heat into kinetic energy, which packs one hell of a wallop, and during the first arc he becomes the talk of Houston.
