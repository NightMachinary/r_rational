Yeah, i know of his books,think i even tried ghost once but it's like you said, it's more of thec being a manly man than anything else, not that I'm pruddish or anything heck i enjoyed fimbulwinter and it's sequels, but if you take away the action scenes from ghost then it becomes something you'll probably find in a porn store, probably still something you'll find there, thanks though.
