While it's not 100% in line with rational fiction you could try Salvage, by Rantarian over in [[/r/hfy][r/hfy]]

It's basically an 80's movie (think Schwarzenegger, Van Damme or Stallone) in written format, with about a hundred chapters published (unfinished), set in a larger writing metaverse (different writers, this isn't the first one), this one being in the current decade where humans have been abductees by a larger alien society and a former soldier is caught by some Roswell Greys. Better than it looks like. Also got Australia in it, eh.
