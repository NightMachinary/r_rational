There's a few Light Novels in that line.

Slime Tensei is about a guy lucky enough to get off way better than any other reincarnators, befiends with a dragon and stuff, in every fight/conflict all he did was flicking his fingers and got what he want.

I'm a spider, so what? is similar, but the female lead is a all-action-no-talk type. She charged into every conflict and came out with level ups and stupid OP powers.
