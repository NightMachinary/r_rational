Absolutely.

I just find, for myself at least, that the urge to skip is frequently overwhelmed by the urge to reveal /absolutely everything I ever thought of/. Killing my darlings is uniformly harder than coming up with additional awesome. Even when that's not the case, there's usually enough awesome to go around. Cramming additional space with less critical stuff is a bad habit I'm trying desperately to undo.

Ultimately, I hope to find the least possible content with the most possible impact.
