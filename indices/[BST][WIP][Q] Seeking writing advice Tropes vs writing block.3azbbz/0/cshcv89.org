Knowing how much you can afford to elide is one of the great ways to tighten your writing. Does it introduce a problem? Does it solve one? Does it reveal something important about a character in a way that advances the plot?

If the story still work without some information, it's probably safe to remove it.

Skip ahead to the fun stuff.
