Don't explain away memory problems with garden variety bad memory. Give your lead a /reason/ to have failed to pay attention closely.

It's certainly rational to pay attention to something more important, or be startled/frightened, and miss details.

Is there any unresolved conflict that you can have storming in out of nowhere and drag your lead's attention away from what you don't want to write about?

Do it. Follow the conflict. If the lead misses something /now/ then it makes the later /need/ for that information (if that happens) more interesting as the lead struggles to remember, and has to puzzle it out as opposed to simply knowing the answer.
