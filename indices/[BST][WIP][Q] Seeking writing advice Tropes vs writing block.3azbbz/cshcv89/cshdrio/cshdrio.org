  Skip ahead to the fun stuff.

Make sure that you're skipping ahead for the right reasons though. I've seen timeskips done really poorly in the past; sometimes an author gets bored, and just wants to race ahead, and it can leave the audience scratching their head wondering why they never got the middle section. Elide too much, and you have pay-off without the build up, which isn't actually pay-off at all.

I think that's probably what [[/u/DataPacRat]] is struggling with; when to skip ahead, and when not to. I think if you've got writer's block, it's fine to just write all the stuff that you feel like writing to get you back in the flow, but then you actually need to go back and write in all the necessary precursors. You can't have the climactic ending without any of the growth or development in place (or you can, but it's going to feel a little hollow).
