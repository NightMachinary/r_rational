The same ways you would use ordinary secure randomly generated cryptographic keys?

The comic seems to be suggesting that you use measurements of the soul to generate the numbers for cryptographic keys. Since the soul is unpredictable people can only find the key through brute force.

A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator][hardware random number generator]] seems like it would give similar cryptographic performance and be easier to use.
