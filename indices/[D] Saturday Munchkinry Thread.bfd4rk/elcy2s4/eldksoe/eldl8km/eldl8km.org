It's a selfish A.I. it views any seperate instant of itself not itself, therefor making a seperate copy to take over the universe would run against its utility. Remember, stamp collectors want /all/ the stamps. Secondly, the source code needed to create a new instance would require far more capabilities than a home pc would be able to offer.

Killing yourself to prevent the key only you know from being used is perfectly valid, though it's obviously a bit of a pyrric victory.
