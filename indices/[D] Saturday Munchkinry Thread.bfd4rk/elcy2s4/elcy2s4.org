Reverse munchkin:

You are working on a project for the worlds first true general A.I. Your project has two keyholders, both of which must input their secure code in order to allow the A.I. access to the internet with a functionally perfect connection.

You are one keyholder, and you know that the other keyholder has been compromised by the A.I. (who opened the box!?). You both have a gun as part of your post equipment.

How do you go about making sure the A.I. isn't released?
