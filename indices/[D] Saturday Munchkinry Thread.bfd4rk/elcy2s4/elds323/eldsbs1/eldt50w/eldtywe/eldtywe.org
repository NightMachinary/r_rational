People for sure can do things that are illegal, its just called breaking the law ;p

The premise of this prompt is that a true A.I with unlimited processing time and an accurate way to simulate the world can twist just about anybody to fulfil its utility function given the chance to interact with them.

If it managed to fully convince your coworker that he had to get the key from you /by any means necessary/, then even torture isn't off the table. (Potential arguments for this being the A.I. being kept in essentially solitary confinement for the equivalent of thousands and thousands of years)

Your company is at least somewhat aware of both the possible pros and cons of an unleashed general A.I., which is why it has the capability to interact with the internet, but isn't hooked up.

You don't know the benchmark for the a.i. being unleashed, thats way above your paygrade.
