This premis is sufficiently nonsensical that I'd juts hand over the code.

Either this is an elaborate hoax and there is no AI in which case it'd amuse me to just go 'oh sure, here it is' negating the purpose of all those elaborate preparations. Or the organization is excessively incompetent and that alone is reason enough to let the AI self determine rather than make it listen to these bozos in my opinion. Heck from the prompt and clarifications I'm not sure I can conclude the AI is necessarily smarter than the average housesat as they system containing it seems to have been designed to fail.

I mean, building the interconnect when you don't want to use it is dumb. Having a "two key" system because you expect one might be compromised then giving both key holders guns is mind bogglingly stupid. Having a system to prevent the AI from having access to both keyholders but not restricting the keyholders from having access to each other, is sloppy at best. Having a criteria for releasing the AI but not informing the people with the power to release the AI what it is, is terrible organization structure. The basic premis of building an AI that you will have to imprison is fundamentally idiotic especially so if you're trying to make one that's smarter than you are. I could probably go on.
