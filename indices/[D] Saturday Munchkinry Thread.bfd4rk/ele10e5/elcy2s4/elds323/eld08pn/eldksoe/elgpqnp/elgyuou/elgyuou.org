This seems like the safest answer. Got to take one for the future of humanity and destroy the only recording of your code. Shooting yourself delays the release and calls attention at least, and fully stops it at best.

Everything else is too risky, you're going up against a equally equipped person who's being coached by a super intelligence. He could have the perfect argument to convince you of his cause or could just capture and torture you for the code.
