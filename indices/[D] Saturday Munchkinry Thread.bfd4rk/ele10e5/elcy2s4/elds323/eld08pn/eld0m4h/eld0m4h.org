For whatever reason for this project the key has to be built into the very basis of the AI, without it the AI would either have no way to interact with the outside world or would always be able to do so.

Considering the resources required to get the AI online, it was considered best to build one that could be given access once deemed safe, rather than having to build an additional one or risk a dangerous ai with the internet.
