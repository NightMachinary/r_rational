Antifragility, which you could more sanely call adaptiveness (I don't care that Taleb denies this), and black swans, which you could less poetically call kurtosis risk, are more like presentations of interesting parts of risk modeling and management with typical pop sci overemphasis. It isn't a "style" of mental arts, it's a collection of hypotheses and prescriptions, like any other thesis. It isn't a paradigm in and of itself. At best it's a few considerations to keep track of in your epistemology and ethics according to their value.
