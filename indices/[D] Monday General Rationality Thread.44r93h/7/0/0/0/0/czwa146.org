I'm treating the extinction event itself as a thing. Extinction events aren't instantaneous moments in time. They're extended periods during which many species go extinct. If unexpected crazy shit happens during the extinction event, it sustains it, causing it to go on longer and lead to the extinction of more species. Only normalcy, the development of a new status quo, can end an extinction event - that or the trivial solution of all species on the planet (ie, the "fuel") being exhausted.

ETA: Yes, I'm aware that species are going extinct all the time, throughout the entire history of life on Earth. I'm referring to conditions in which an unusual amount of species are going extinct. The equivalent contrast is between an economic depression and the regular economic misfortunes people suffer in any time period.
