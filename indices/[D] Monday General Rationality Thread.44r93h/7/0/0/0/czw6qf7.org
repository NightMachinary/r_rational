I'm not sure what you even mean by that. If you're looking at the ecosystem as a whole, it is being adaptive, because it provides a selection pressure to species in accordance with the probability of such severe events happening. If you're looking at the species being extincted, it is being neither adaptive nor "antifragile," because by definition the system under consideration no longer exists.

Events aren't "antifragile" or adaptive. Systems are. So what do you mean?
