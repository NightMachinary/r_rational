First I would like to explain by saying I was using the talk to text function on my phone. I should have double checked that it had actually typed what I had intended to say. That is why they are huge sections of my message that are very jumbled up.

Second I will address the idea I brought up of forms martial arts and mental martial arts. I know that you may believe that I am over focusing on this analogy but that's because I don't believe we have gotten all the value out of the analogy we can once we have we can discard it. The reason that martial arts exist is that people who are not naturally strong or fast discovered individual techniques that could be put together and become a force equalizer. The difference in the martial arts comes from both the environment in which of martial arts were developed to be used and the basic premises upon which understanding of the body was built. In the same way I can imagine that each culture could be equivalent to the environment in this analogy. I would love to see a systematic study of biases across cultures. My gut tells me that while certain problems exist in every culture both the language and history of each culture would make them immune to certain biases and highly vulnerable to others. An example of this is that Arabic culture, I would be willing to bet, has a slightly higher rate of optimism bias because everyone in the culture, Muslim and Christian, is highly religious and discussing something not happening that you want is almost implying that God can't do it which is very taboo. By that same token their profound faith makes both of the major religions in the area regularly practice both in financial terms and in time work with the poor. This means that most of the Arabic people I have met how much better empathy when it compares to wealth. I'm willing to say that this may be all in my head and more importantly I don't believe there's enough data currently for anyone to have a clear understanding of what I'm saying is right or wrong but I'm going to keep using it because this belief is made my mental map more accurate. The second part is what you believe about the mind and more importantly how you design your Minervan art to reduce cognitive energy cost. This leads into my use and defense of the works of Nassim Taleb. I will be comparing him against classic rationality from less wrong but I want to make it clear that I understand that neither of these guys has divine wisdom written in stone.

When I first read about less wrong I was very enthusiastic to the point of fanaticism. If it wasn't for the introduction of happy death cult spirals in the very basics I can easily see how rationality would have become one. But the problem was that while I now know of these biases and even had some better ways of thinking so that I would have the less of this affecting my decisions in the future I still did not have a clear set of instructions on how to build my mental muscles. In fact I found there to be very little discussion about ego depletion at all. I call this the first arrogance and first fiction of rationalism that someone has the mental energy to be rational and to use a rational thought process consistently.( I would recommend looking into the book Thinking Fast and thinking slow by Daniel Kahneman one of the founders of heuristics and bias research. He says that our brains are not actually that good of reasoning in logic and in fact using what he calls your system to rational brain is exhausting literally the same as running a hundred meter sprint in most ways to your body! )

If you want be able to do that all the time you need some kind of exercises. This is where I feel that less wrong rationality could be improved. Because it takes a long time between when you first read these things and become constantly vigilant of your own psyche before they start to become second nature. The threshold to success is rather high using that system. Talib points out in his books that there is a heuristic that can be added at the beginning of every single decision that is extremely simple to implement extremely simple to explain to others and once used properly can have profound effects on the long term. That double sided heuristic is to ask 1) where in my reasoning and in this goal could a Black Swan event, that is to say an event which is not only unpredicted but also unpredictable at the current moment because you lack information, ruin my plans or strengthen them. And 2) is the system or project I'm about to work on fragile or anti fragile which from a mathematical perspective can be defined as how well will this system and/or object deal with a sudden change or surprises or Black Swan events.

The rest of his books describe different places where people make the mistake of either assuming that black swans do not happen or how to apply his anti fragility thinking to real life and those things are useful. But the truth is just using those first two rules, which is much easier to explain to someone and to have them start doing right away, is a mental force equalizer. Especially because in the long run unpredictable things tend to have a much bigger impact then small subjective changes. Applying just these two rules for a normal person will make them invest and act as intelligently as some of the best investors and risk managers in the world. I am willing to say and that maybe this does not constitute a whole style for every person. For me I believe there is enough depth to explore for a while and that is good enough for me but I can understand the other side.

I guess a better way to summarize it is that for it to count as a mental martial art it not only needs to create techniques by which you practice strengthening your mind against ego depletion and making rational choices second nature it also needs to provide a coherent strategy for creating a personal worldview. I assume, but I may be incorrect, that different mental Practice will naturally lead to the discovery of new biases that can be defended against. Also I know this is going to end up as a block of text because I am doing this on my phone but I wanted to say thank you for not only pointing out the unreadability of my earlier post but calling me out to become more specific
