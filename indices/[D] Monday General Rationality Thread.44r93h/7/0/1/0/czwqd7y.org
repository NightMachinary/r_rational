The practice of rationality is individualized. It makes sense for there to be a repository of mental techniques and behaviors and a systematized way to teach each one (CFAR), but there is no such thing as a "style" or "form." I cannot think of a single reason why making disparate and unitary "styles" of rationality would be useful when you can judge pieces of evidence and techniques on their individual value to you in your current situation, like everything else in the world. A categorization of techniques, perhaps, but this still does not approach "styles."

Rationality is one thing: "Doing what works," subject to your own beliefs and values. If you're saying it should be anything else, please give actual reasons. If you think "Antifragile" and "The Black Swan" are somehow useful as an entirely separate paradigm, as opposed to science per usual, give reasons for that. Don't just tell me they're important; I'm not going to risk my time reading them on the word of a fan. /What is actually important in those books?/ Give me a summary. Give me examples. That is the only way to convince me.

What? Do you mean the value of academic research? I'm not denying that, I'm denying the usefulness of the word "antifragility" specifically. I think robustness, resilience, and adaptability are very important in systems, and I think they cover everything "antifragility" is meant to.

  It's valuable because it actually works to change your life and doesn't require a huge initial mental investment.
#+end_quote

Does it really? How would I know from what you've said? What is "it?" What is "actually working to change your life," and how? What techniques are you talking about?

#+begin_quote
  I personally believe it counts as a cohesive style is that instead of giving you many techniques of which you can probably use a little bit here and there he instead focus is on a few topics that have profound implications
#+end_quote

That doesn't point to "a cohesive style." That points to "some things you should pay attention to, along with all those other things." /What is the point of "styles?"/

  lol I think that they are generally some truisms across all mental forms some of the questions that you run into when you take a rationalist approach don't have a necessarily correct answer but an ethical or personal one.
#+end_quote

More coherent English might help my understanding, but I'll try to address this. Yes, there are individual answers to questions dependent on personal values and preferences. There are individual answers to questions dependent on your nature and your situation. Are you saying you want a rationality counselor? I'd like one too.

  My has yet to be answered by anyone really where do you think people should study to create their own forms of rationalism lol
#+end_quote

As I said, I don't think the idea of a "form" of rationality is useful. "Their own," however, is something I can get behind. As I said, I believe learning and practice should be developed in a manner subjective to the individual's circumstances and goals. I mean, that kind of thing is pretty much an antithesis of "styles" or "forms."

I mentioned CFAR. They do week-long seminars, I believe. They're the only real example of a "rationality dojo" I can think of, other than perhaps meetings in the Bay Area (the most concentrated group), though that is undoubtedly not as systematized.

Other than that, there is no physical location, though I wish there were. The Internet is both a good and a bad thing in this sense: communities have a much broader scope, but a much harder time connecting in real life.

I realized I may be misunderstanding you. Do "their own forms" mean discovering /novel/ biases, concepts, and behaviors? I think it is more important to first develop your fundamentals. There is a use for the analogy of martial arts in this case.

"When you can take the pebble from my hand, it will be time for you to leave."

I don't want to end on that condescending quote, so I'll end with my opinion. I think we probably agree regarding your actual question, but the way you express yourself is somewhat incoherent and otherwise hard to understand. I think you're focusing on aesthetics ("Minervan arts" and the extended metaphor of martial arts in general) to a fault. I'll leave it at that, I don't want to be too presumptuous.
