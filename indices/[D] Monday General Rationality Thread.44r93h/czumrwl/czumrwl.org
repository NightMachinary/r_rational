I liked this [[http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/future/technology/217097-doctor-adventure-makes-an-ear][cool cyborg ear.]] It looks pretty sci-fi.

Does anyone know if there's a word for fanfiction that occurs in the canonical universe of one setting (eg Harry Potter) but doesn't involve any of the main characters? Eg, if there was a story about a team of Gringotts goblins working on a way to improve vault security, or someone who works in Diagon Alley and their issues with payroll tax, this is still Harry Potter fanfiction but is there a word for its distance from the main storyline?
