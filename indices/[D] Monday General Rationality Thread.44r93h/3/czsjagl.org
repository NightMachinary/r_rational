Myself and [[/u/Transfuturist]] are taking the MITx class in probability and stochastic processes being offered this semester. It's kinda theoretical and the lecturer sounds like Chekov from Star Trek TOS, but it does help to review the foundations and fill in gaps of background for anyone hoping to do statistics and such. For one thing, nice introductions to stochastic processes are hard fo find!

Further people should join! It's free (without certificate) and is estimated to take 15 hours/week.
