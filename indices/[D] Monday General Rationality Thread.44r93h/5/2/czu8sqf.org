The tribes generally disagree on what the state of the world is, where the problems are, and what should be done to fix them. And the people belonging to the same tribe don't necessarily share values with the common egalitarian motive. Social conservatives /are/ anti-SJW, and liberal authoritarians /are/ anti-patriarchy. When you have a tribe that explicitly identifies itself as against some group (anti-SJWs, anti-patriarchy/hegemony), you are not going to get a happy bundle of unified opinions.

I'm curious, what shared goal do you think these tribes have? It's not egalitarianism. It is, as always, scoring points against the other tribe. It's a social sport, completely separate from the ostensible topic at hand, and I'd like to see any sort of evidence against that. The values you can infer from their behavior are exactly what you would expect.
