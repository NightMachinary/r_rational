The hospitals are full of really overworked, frustrated people who moved to the area for the low rent but became collateral damage in the hugely destructive fights. Sometimes they receive huge donations from the Wayne Institute, but that doesn't make up for the nights when the ER is overflowing, there's no beds available and civilian casualties with less severe injuries are waiting for hours to be seen. Staff burn out quickly, there's a huge psychiatric team with massive staff turnover. Ward veterans take bets on how long newbies will last.

On the upside it produces a LOT of publications for case studies - with so much wanton violence there's plenty of material for universities all around the world to draw on. The maxillofacial surgery team is renowned for their collaboration with plastic surgeons to repair damaged jaws and teeth.

They take every kind of insurance you can imagine.
