Is humanity's intellectual history /really/ a series of misguided attempts to establish an unjustified monopoly of theory?

There's cases like physics which buck the trend, I guess? At least some of those developments/changes happened as a result of new explanations better explaining observations, though I can appreciate arguments saying it only advanced the state of the science because older people died off...

I wonder what they're trying to capture with that quote.

Is the major thrust: communicate to non-experts for ethical and cooperative wins?
