I read an interesting article today about the practice of science ([[http://www.jstor.org/stable/3881649]]). Sorry about the paywall; it isn't interesting enough to have to pay, in my opinion, I just happened to have access to JSTOR for free. I think the most interesting part of it was the final paragraphs:

  Today we [scientists] are told that what we do must be relevant to society's needs. But relevant /when/? Today, tomorrow, a decade hence? ... Today's advances ... will surely underlie a new technology, and will offer major new forces for the alteration of the human condition. Issues of a new dimension will surely be raised. It is crucial that these issues be made understandable to non-scientists who must participate in decision-making.

  As the Reverend Theodore Hesburgh (1962) has observed, man's intellectual history up to now has represented a long series of abortive attempts to establish an unwarranted hegemony for this or that kind of knowledge. I can only agree with him that we now have the rich opportunity of changing this trend. But we will not succeed unless we each have deep conviction. We must repeat with Terence: nothing human is alien to me: no human insight, no human misery, no human beauty, no human knowledge, no human anguish, no human value, no human hunger
