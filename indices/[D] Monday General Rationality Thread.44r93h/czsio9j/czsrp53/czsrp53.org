Taleb gets talked about a lot, but I find his books needlessly long for the amount of information they convey.

It boils down to...

1) Don't assume everything is a Normal curve.

2) The sum of the smallest probabilities can often be big enough that the probability of at least one of those events occurring is fairly high.

3) Some predictions have such a large margin of error that they are basically useless.

4) Don't trust prediction markets, stock prices, etc. They can easily be wrong.
