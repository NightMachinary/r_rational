so I have been thinking about an idea that I saw in less wrong and I've been elaborating on for a while internally. Eliazar mentions in one post that his techniques are almost like a school of martial arts and one that like all martial arts is strong and some ways and weak in other ways. I've come to believe that Nassim Taleb and his books on unpredictable events and how one deals with them ( the black swan and antifragility) could represent a second style of Minervan art (Minerva being the goddess of wisdom and strategic battles).

Since I feel like this is just starting as a field who else do you believe is on the path of creating new and slightly different Minervan arts?
