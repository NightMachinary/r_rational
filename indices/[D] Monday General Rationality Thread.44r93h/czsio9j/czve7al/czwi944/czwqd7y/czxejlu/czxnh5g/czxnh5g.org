Are you still using it?

I would bet that different cultures have different incidence of biases, just as different cultures seem to have different incidence of psychological disorders. People also have different brains that work in different ways and have problems with different things, with biases as with mental dysfunction. This does not point to "styles" being a useful metaphor, this points to individualized training. Psych treatment does not involve treating people as discrete groups with uniform prescriptions.

  This leads into my use and defense of the works of Nassim Taleb. I will be comparing him against classic rationality from less wrong but I want to make it clear that I understand that neither of these guys has divine wisdom written in stone.
#+end_quote

There is no such thing as "classical rationality." There is no alternative to distinguish it as "classical" from anything else. You have provided nothing to say that anything in Taleb's works are somehow /exclusive/ of rationality as it is known. /The exclusivity is what I am denying./

#+begin_quote
  [third paragraph]
#+end_quote

You are fundamentally misunderstanding what the effective practice of rationality is. [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/09/constant-vigilance/][It does not require logical reasoning such as doing expected value calculations and brainstorming in your head.]] Paper and calculators are entirely fine for that purpose, and tools certainly help to explicate and develop mental models, but this is not how you counteract biases, it is how you form /strategies/ for things you /don't do every ten minutes./ Nor is it the paradigm of reductionist and algorithmic mathematical thought, though that certainly helps literally everything. [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/5kz/the_5second_level/][The practice of rationality is a number of habits and behaviors performed below the five-second level.]] [[http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/p/microrationality.html][Tortoise skills.]]

  [fourth paragraph]
#+end_quote

1. Taleb did not invent the concept of unknown unknowns, and the idea of asking "Where in my plans will unknown unknowns occur?" is literally useless. What you do to counteract unknown unknowns is to diversify your strategy and reserve more resources to offset risk than you think you otherwise need to.
2. Robustness, resilience, adaptability. And second of all, you should not be asking "Is the system fragile?", you should be asking "How can the system be made more robust?"

Additionally, I will point out that

#+begin_quote
  it takes a long time between when you first read these things and become constantly vigilant of your own psyche before they start to become second nature
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  there is a heuristic that can be added at the beginning of every single decision
#+end_quote

is selectively applying your complaint. It would take no longer for any one LW/CFAR technique to be well-trained as second nature than it would for Taleb's /one/ technique.

Now, either you're complaining that rationality techniques expend energy via System Two thought, or it takes too long to train rationality techniques as System One thought. You don't get both.

  Applying just these two rules for a normal person will make them invest and act as intelligently as some of the best investors and risk managers in the world.
#+end_quote

That claim is patently ridiculous. I will not even entertain argument on it unless you have compelling evidence.

#+begin_quote
  I am willing to say and that maybe this does not constitute a whole style for every person.
#+end_quote

It does not constitute a "whole style" for /any/ person.

#+begin_quote
  For me I believe there is enough depth to explore for a while and that is good enough for me but I can understand the other side.
#+end_quote

I believe this is your way of rationalizing a suboptimal choice to reduce choice fatigue. What you are describing is /literally one concept./ While it might be a place to start, you are claiming it as a "whole and alternative style" that is "good enough for you." It may be good enough for you, just as rejecting rationality concept and techniques entirely may be good enough for you. But this does not actually reduce your epistemological biases, or even any other instrumental biases. All it does is make you a better planner than you already were, /without even allowing for any other means of becoming a better planner./
