ETA? I know what you mean by extinction event. They apply selection pressure like any other extinction.

You still haven't explained how "antifragility" applies to extinction events as a system. "Antifragility is defined as a convex response to a stressor or source of harm" (a convex response of what in particular I have no fucking clue). You seem to be saying that 'unexpected crazy shit' is a stressor to the system of an extinction event, but it isn't. 'Unexpected crazy shit' is the /cause/ of extinction events. /Normalcy is the stressor./
