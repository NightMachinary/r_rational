  To me it seems rational to walk from place to place quickly so you aren't wasting time you could spend doing something more interesting.

Walking is interesting. There's people and places to look at. The weather's nice. The light exercise gets my blood flowing. I can think if I want to but I don't have to focus on a specific task. And it doesn't need a huge slice of time dedicated to it.

If I wanted to get somewhere quickly, I'd take the bus, or the car. Or at the very least I'd set out earlier so I can make it at a leisurely walking pace.

Anyway there's no sense in saving walking time if you're just going to waste that time in some other way. If I needed more time in my day, I'd start by blocking Reddit.
