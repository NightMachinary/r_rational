I think that the answer might have to do with prioritizing why you're walking. I know that several famous scientists and philosophers say they think better while they're walking in such a situation it's the locomotion itself that you want so having a leisurely pace while slow walking is reasonable where is if you're trying to get to one goal or another than going the fastest you reasonably can is probably the right move. There's a word flaneur (?) which represents someone who takes his time strolling around his hometown.
