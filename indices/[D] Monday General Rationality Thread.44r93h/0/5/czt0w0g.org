People walk slowly because as we were growing up, other people walked slowly, and so it's weird if you don't walk slowly. If that were not the case, screw walking, I'd be galloping everywhere.

As for why people, long ago, walked slowly... I'd gamble it had something to do with walking in groups. The speed of the group naturally falls to the slowest walker.
