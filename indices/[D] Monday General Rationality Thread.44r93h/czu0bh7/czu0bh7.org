WARNING: SPIDERS

I find it interesting that both the socjus tribe, and the anti-socjus tribe want basically the same thing (equality for everone) and yet have polarised into two camps that seem to spend hours every day demonising and ridiculing each other instead of productively working together toward their shared goal.

Society has an alarming amount of both misogyny and misandry, of predjudice in all directions, and all but the fringe crazies of both tribes believe these things to be terrible tradgedies to be rectified.

And then /instead of working together rectifying them/ they waste time drawing comics and writing blog posts depicting the other tribe as disgusting pathetic bigots.

As far as I can tell, the socjus tribe thinks the anti-socjus tribe are rapey neckbearded redpillers, and the anti-socjus tribe thinks the socjus tribe are cultish violent hypocrites.

And /sure/ there are /elements/ of these things in both tribes, but they tend to be vocal minorities, right at the edges. For the most part, if you tabooed any gender-politics jargon and took a person from each tribe and got them to talk to each other, they'd actually find they have very similar views.

That they hate each other so much just seems to boil down to standard us vs them tribalism.

And socjus vs anti-socjus isn't the /only/ place where I've noticed this bizzare trend of people with common values dividing into two tribes that spend more time mudslinging each other than trying to acheive their goals.

So I'm wondering if you all have any ideas for getting people to drop their pointless tribalism and actually work together on shared goalstates.
