Let's get the naive solution out of the way... give them a common "other" or "enemy" to fight against

A bigger problem might be that the group membership or perceived group membership is very vague. It's not necessarily true that members of either tribe encounter the others by running into them IRL. Probably lots of them don't even directly encounter the other, or only do so anonymously online.

Maybe making extreme statements on either side politically inconvenient?
