What do you guys think hospitals' must be like in the universe the TV show Gotham takes place in? I absolutely love the show and the rules do seem fairly stable, but the people in the show are all practically superhuman. I'm used to accepting that knockout punches are no big deal, but in gotham a character can be shot, stabbed, and have their face repeated slammed into a table all in one episode. Not only that but they are always in perfect health for the beating they take next episode. In a world where anything that doesn't kill you immediately heals in about a week do you even need doctors? Or just a bunch of people to wrap you with bandages so you don't bleed to death before you can seemingly regenerate.
