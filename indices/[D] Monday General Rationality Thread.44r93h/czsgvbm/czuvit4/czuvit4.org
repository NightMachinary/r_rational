Even if one somehow manages to get into a good university, attending classes tends to be an effective way to learn when one's academic ability in the subject is lower than that of a typical student. Otherwise everyone's going to be moving too slow and time is wasted.

The usefulness of lectures and group sessions depends on a variety of variables outside of the student's control, such as the talents of the teacher and peers, the financial state of the university and so on. On the other hand, there are usually several good textbooks to choose from for every subject, and it's fairly easy to acquire the very best ones. Given decent studying skills, a combination of google, wikipedia, stack exchange and the best textbooks on the subject (and related fields as well) is very hard to compete with. A small group of closely matched students working in close coordination with an education-focused professor would probably achieve somewhat better results, but that's not how education in universities works at all.

As you can tell, I'm in complete agreement with your friend as far as efficiency of self-study goes.

In regard to the issue of friends and social life, the optimal solution is to hang out with fellow rationalists and effective altruists, I think. This satisfies the monkey-brain's need for meatspace social interaction and keeps one healthy, without forcing one into interactions with idiots. Not to mention the fact that there is a bunch of ways to cooperatively use social effects for various benefits, such as using public commitment and peer pressure to overcome motivation problems.
