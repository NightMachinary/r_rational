Sounds like a serious case of halo effect. a person can't save the world on their own, and they can't save the world if they don't take care of themself. your friend needs to taboo the word rationality and remember that the thought she cannot think (even if the thought might be wrong) limits her more than the thought she can. She shouldn't let her thinking be paralyzed by the fear of thinking an irrational thought, because that could cause her to think too rigidly.

Rationality is a skill that can take a long time to master or even to be proficient with. People don't learn that kind of thing as well if they expect themselves to be perfect at it from the getgo and then get upset at themselves when they're not.

Instead of putting a metaphorical dam in her mind to block her less rational thoughts from consciously forming, it might be better to let those thoughts come out into the open and address them with more thoughts, even if she knows they're wrong and even if it makes her feel stupid. Be willing to question everything, even if the question doesn't make sense since if it doesn't you can just unask the question afterwards. And if she finds herself spinning in circles stuck on a particular looping line of reasoning, she should just take a step back and take an outside view on whatever the subject she's thinking of is.

Ultimately rationality is just a tool to help someone form more accurate beliefs and achieve their goals more effectively. If it's not helping her form more accurate beliefs and it's not helping her achieve her goals more effectively, she should ask herself what she thinks she's talking about when she says "rationality". Real rationality isn't just believing the words of some great teacher, even if what the teacher says is so obviously sensible and right and rational, one should still think it through thoroughly for themselves, just in case there's anything at all the teacher might have gotten wrong that slipped their notice, since the teacher is imperfect and human just like everyone else is, and since thinking things through thoroughly for yourself is a good habit to have.

I'm starting to suspect that halo effects and happy death spirals are a common and prevalent enough problem for the rational/ist community that we really should be doing more to address it. People who are in a happy death spiral about rationality make rationality and this community look bad and aren't doing themselves any favors either.

Hope this helps, and I hope your friend recovers from her happy death spiral as soon as possible!
