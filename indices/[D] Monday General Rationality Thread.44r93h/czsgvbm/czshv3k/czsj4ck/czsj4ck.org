To play devils advocate...

Most people aren't the people you read about in books.

The only reason that a live interactive individual would do better then the collective sum of recorded human knowledge is because individuals might be able to tailor their advice for you specifically. You get information tailored to a specific individual.

But on average they're going to be worse at conveying information then someone who's thought a lot about how best to convey their information to a general individual.

There are two fundamental problems. The ability to convey useful information over speech, and the selection bias of who you're talking to (IE: not people who think the ideas are important enough to commit to the internet).

(You can get around the latter by careful selection of people, and specific instruction is often very useful for learning a skill)

If you're relying on /talking/ to people to get introduced to new ideas, well you're going to have a bad time. Read more instead.
