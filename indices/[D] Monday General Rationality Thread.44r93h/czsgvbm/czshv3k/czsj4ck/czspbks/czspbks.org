You aren't incorrect but you're making a mistake in assuming that the information you are going to receive from those people is going to be intentionally conveyed. I forget who said it but and often repeated idea is that everyone teaches you either they teach you what to do or they teach you what not to do. In which case your observation of that person is significantly more important than anything they say.

Besides I think that you're also making a problematic binary here it's not that there are interesting people and boring people life is more vague than that. Maybe that person who you think isn't very rational stumbled upon a really rational belief and practice by accident. Maybe it only works in one aspect of their lives but if they have a brilliant way of doing that, which I believe almost everyone has at least one or two brilliant revelations inside of them, then it's more like there are points where your wisdom quality will increase and decrease.

So I still believe that the best argument in favor of interacting with other socially is the anti fragile one. You lose almost nothing trying to be social and forcing yourself to do so for one full minute per person at a party. If you get bored or if you decide you don't like it you can always leave but you may get lucky. And if you make it a point to be social over a long enough time You are almost guaranteed to be lucky because unexpected people will be there.

More importantly she even said that the only reason she would have to interact with other people and introduce them to rationalism if she wants to do that then she should be a good rationalist and be a fun person to be around. There is a terrible terrible stereotype of the Vulcan rationalists without emotions who only talks about analytical things if you want to be a real rationalist you have to figure out how to deal in a world without everyone following rationalism and you can't just lament that they're not as smart as you you have to set an example explain it where it is relevant and socially okay so that people are willing to listen and actually change their behaviour and more importantly you need to be the kind of person that people want to copy
