Tell your friend to do a thought experiment. Ask her how many of the profound ideas she is reading she could have come up with herself. Then ask her how important it is that you introduced her to this. The final part is ask her why does she believe that other people don't have the potential to contribute ideas just as life changing as rationality? For further reading I would say she should look into Nassim Taleb and his books the Black Swan and anti fragility. Pretty much he says that any event that you go to that has minimal downside on your immediate well-being but could have potentially huge upside should be engaged in. And parties fall into this anti fragile category. You can extend this to socializing in general.

Meeting someone cost you a few seconds of your life which, if you are being healthy as a rational option, you can probably afford a few seconds and if you don't like them you can politely disengage and not have to worry about it again. People disengage all the time, but maybe you will find that person who will introduce you to rationalism or your new favorite band or maybe the person who you love and motivates you to be a more effective altruist in another way. I guess the more effective way to say it is her understanding of rationality is very short term. friends and socializing and parties and even class don't have a great return on a daily basis but if you spend all semester in class and only get introduced to one life changing idea that you couldn't figure out on your own then that class was still totally worth it. You have no way of predicting that ahead of time and if its a boring class you can just read while you're in class
