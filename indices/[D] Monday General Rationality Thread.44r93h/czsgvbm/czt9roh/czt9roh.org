  I mentioned that having regular friends and being able to converse with regular people have a lot hidden (and clear) benefits. But she thinks social life comes at a great cost, it takes a lot of time and distracts her from more explicit rational and altruist aspirations. She's afraid her standards for herself will drop, she'll become more like other people, less productive, less obsessed with world-saving.

Yes, spending time with people will tend to make you more like those people. Deliberately walling yourself away from people will, I think, make one more extreme in one's views. Not occasionally discussing one's views with others removes a number of sanity checks - it's often true that one does not notice the flaws in one's own beliefs and opinions (confirmation bias makes this very hard to do through self-study alone, and discussing an idea only with people who already subscribe to part of it risks forming an ingroup that runs into a group form of confirmation bias).

So... there /is/ a cost, in time and other ways, to having a social life. But it's also a buffer against a number of self-reinforcing mental biases. If, somehow, your friend is always perfectly correct about anything and everything, then it would be too costly to have any social life, at all...

...but if she /thinks/ that she is that good, then I have to consider it significantly more probable that she is over-estimating her own correctness than that she is, in fact, that good. (Would that be egotistical bias?)

So, yeah. I can see a clear and obvious failure mode that starts with refusing all contact with regular friends, and ends with spending several years and a lot of effort in pursuit of something which, in hindsight, turns out to be the /wrong thing/ to do - perhaps trying to make everyone happy in a way that turns out to be equivalent to forcing wireheading on the world or something.
