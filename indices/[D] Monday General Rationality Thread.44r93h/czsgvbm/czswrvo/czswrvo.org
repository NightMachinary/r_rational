This reminds me of a point Tetlock makes in Superforecasting; he describes a thing that almost all of the forecasters who performed extremely well over a 4 year rigorous forecasting tournament shared: a 'dragonfly-eyed' perspective, or in other words a tendency to actively include multiple external points of view. The general makeup of a 'superforecaster' seemed to correspond to a careful, rational thinker, after reading through the whole book, so it seems relevant to dig into this 'multiple perspective' idea.

Here's one slightly more detailed explanation. So, there's studies about how averaging lots of people's estimates can actually produce really good estimates taken together, granted on problems where observers have any chance of being able to forecast at all (kinda pointless to ask a crowd to forecast the psi of a gust of wind 20 years from now in a South African diamond mine). However, there's potentially even better forecasts possible if you *extremize* that calculation. That means 70% -> 85% probability and 30% -> 15% probability, or something similar. The intuition is that scraps of useful information are spread across many observers; if those observers all knew all of the information, they would update their forecasts to be stronger. Turns out by extremizing the 'wisdom of the crowd' measure, they were able to beat out the 'wisdom of the crowd' (based on what I understood). So, including lots of perspectives actually makes you more accurate (but you do still have to incorporate those perspectives well and update with care, and have an eye to the underlying causal relationships too, and so on and so on....)

Anyway, incorporating multiple points of view is directly beneficial to anyone who wants to become stronger rationally, it seems. (There are probably more direct ways to argue this point)

Besides the other benefits, like feeling contentment (social contact seems important for this) and discovering new allies. I personally can't imagine having grown half as much in general without all the social experiences I've had at work/college, including meaningless blather.
