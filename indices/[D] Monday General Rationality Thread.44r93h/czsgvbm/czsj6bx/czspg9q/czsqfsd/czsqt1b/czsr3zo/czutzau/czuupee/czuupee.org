And I can't say anything for American or Israeli universities, because I've been retroactively informed that even my second-tier undergrad was considered elite on a national or global scale. And Technion was Technion: the best STEM institution in the country and one of the best on the planet.

Which kinda frightens me, considering that apparently our civilization is willing to label "stress-testing of students" as "elite education" while all the actual skill at teaching seems to be scattered around elsewhere.
