I agree with [[/u/eaturbrainz][u/eaturbrainz]] here. Professors are usually experts in the field, and will usually know more than you will learn in your whole undergrad career about the class subject. There are exceptions, like when you do research in the class topic and your professor doesn't, but that doesn't happen often. I also find it hard to believe that anyone will learn more in 50-70 minutes of reading a textbook than by spending the same amount of time paying attention in a lecture environment with a person you can ask questions to.
