I did that for most of my last two years, and though my social life was completely demolished from lack of interaction with my classmates, I got more than adequate marks just from reading the lecture notes and doing the coursework.

I mean, in retrospect it was a terrible idea that quite likely pushed me into a depressive state for months at a time, but academically it wouldn't have changed much.

The lecture notes contained much of the same material as the lectures themselves, and what they didn't I could get from textbooks at the library. And most professors took more questions outside the lectures (during breaks and via e-mail) than during them.
