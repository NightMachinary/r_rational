*Seeking socio-econo-political organizing methods*

How many useful ways are there for an uploaded mind, an em, to organize copies of itself to maximize the accuracy of their final predictions?

The few that I've been able to think of:

- "Strict hierarchy". DPR.2.1 can advise DPR.2, but DPR.2's decision overrides DPR.2.1's.
- "One em, one vote". DPR.2 gets a vote, and so does DPR.2.
- "One subjective year, one vote". DPR.2.1 is running twice as fast as DPR.2, and so DPR.2.1 gets twice as many votes.
- "Prediction market". The DPRs implement some sort of internal currency (which, thanks to blockchains, is fairly easy), and make bets, receiving rewards for accurate predictions.
- "Human swarm". Based on [[https://www.singularityweblog.com/unanimous-ai-louis-rosenberg-on-human-swarming/]] .

How many reasonably plausible methods am I missing?
