One of my friends is a very enthusiastic aspiring rationalist, actually one of the most enthusiastic I've seen who is still very excited trying to implement the LW style of rationality in her day-to-day life.

Anyway, she's in an university, but she doesn't want to attend lectures because they're mostly less educational than her own reading, doesn't want to attend group session because they take too much time and the only reason she would want to attend classes is that she'd be able influence other students to become more like effective altruists.

I mentioned that having regular friends and being able to converse with regular people have a lot hidden (and clear) benefits. But she thinks social life comes at a great cost, it takes a lot of time and distracts her from more explicit rational and altruist aspirations. She's afraid her standards for herself will drop, she'll become more like other people, less productive, less obsessed with world-saving.

I understand her point because I've noticed I become more similar to the people who I spend time with, and therefore try to distance myself from people with hostile and antisocial beliefs because I don't want to become like them. But taken to this extreme, it seems... kind of crazy?

[[http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/03/my_beautiful_bu.html][People like Brian Caplan have said they've done something similar,]] who makes sure he gets as little input from the outside world and mostly likes to spend time with libertarian economics Ph.D.s which include bloggers from the rationalist memeplex like Robin Hanson or Alex Tabarrok from Marginal Revolution. His motivations seem to be more selfish - he simply doesn't like other kind of people and finds the outside society "unacceptable, dreary, insipid, ugly, boring, wrong, and wicked."

But I'm more interested in my friend's case because it's more tangentially rationality related, and Caplan's motivations are quite uninteresting. If you want to want to maintain your current personality into the far future as closely as possible, are measures as extreme as this warranted? Your deeply-held beliefs might not change, but how important you find them probably will if you spend time with people who don't find the same things important.
