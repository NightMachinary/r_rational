That depends very heavily on the quality of education. I can't say anything about the best American universities, but I can absolutely vouch for self-study being the most efficient way of learning in Russian universities.

More generally, the coursework moves through material at the pace of the typical student. Therefore, a student who's significantly more gifted than their peers will naturally be able to master material quicker by themselves.
