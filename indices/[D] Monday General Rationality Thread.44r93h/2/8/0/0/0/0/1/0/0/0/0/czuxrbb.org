Credentialism wouldn't be a problem if we had independent certification providers for every significant profession. But since universities have a de facto monopoly on certification in most fields, one has to pay an ungodly amount of money and spend a very significant amount of time going through the education they "provide" before being allowed to receive the proof of competence. Looks like pretty obvious rent-seeking to me.
