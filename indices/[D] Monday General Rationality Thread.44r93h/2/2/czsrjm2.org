#+begin_quote
  I mentioned that having regular friends and being able to converse with regular people have a lot hidden (and clear) benefits. But she thinks social life comes at a great cost, it takes a lot of time and distracts her from more explicit rational and altruist aspirations. She's afraid her standards for herself will drop, she'll become more like other people, less productive, less obsessed with world-saving.

She's rationalizing (and she seems smart, so she's pretty good at it). Nobody is so hyper-rational that they would be able to cut out social contact just because they've decided they could get more useful information through reading.

Her decision to cut off most contact with others is an emotional, not rational decision. If I'm right, she's probably a lot like people on this sub, people who like both rationality and reading. For her, it's become an addiction, which she has rationalized as a perfectly reasonable decision.
