There are two issues here. The first is friends. All her points are quite valid. Although surrounding oneself with friends that motivate, inspire, and help one make progress toward one's goals will indeed help her in achieving her goals, the opposite is also true. She's said there are no people of the former class near her location; for her to then go out and cultivate a friend into the above description, or seek out people that fit that criteria, is extremely suboptimal - one should not place that expectation upon her. It sounds like she has many online friends whose company she values; her social skills will not atrophy. Her acceptance of her situation is rational given her goals, and will not have costs to her emotional health.

The second issue is the human need for in-person socialization. This appears to be a concern you haven't raised with her, and of which she might not be aware. Rare is the human whose happiness will not suffer when isolated from in-person, one-on-one interaction for a prolonged period of time. This interaction need not be any deeper than eye contact and a smile, jest, and/or thanks; each interaction hardly costs any time, and the benefits to one's mental health granted by even twenty minutes of such interaction will be well worth her time. It's also an opportunity for her to exercise her social brain in-person, as online interaction, even via video, isn't quite the same.

I feel the need to say this because I think other advice offered here strawman her concerns, and conflate the above two issues.

I don't think you've given us enough information to judge whether she has social anxiety or awkwardness that is influencing her reasoning. To mitigate whatever influences that might or might not be impairing her ability to reason as a rational agent, I offer this advice: Evincing to her that you come from a position of agreement with her goals, present any advice or suggested courses of action not as criticism but rather as refinements to her plans.
