I 100 percent agree with the sentiment espoused in this quote. I feel like the work has to come from the side of the stem community. Both by setting good examples allowing ourselves to become public figures without pandering. We need to find the best teachers and best explainers of ideas and make sure that they go to the public in a way that makes them want to listen Neil deGrasse Tyson is trying but we need more and not just intellectual public figures but those who are willing to disagree with each other in a true and clear sense because showing civil scientific debate will be more valuable to bringing the rest of the world into the discussion than anything else.
