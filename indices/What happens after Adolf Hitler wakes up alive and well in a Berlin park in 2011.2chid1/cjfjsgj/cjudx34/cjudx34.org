Hmm, I'm sorry if you think I misdirected you.

Let's see:

- it involves a protagonist thrust into another world or unusual environment
- he has an outside perspective on this new world, which he uses to rapidly raise in status within it
- he immediately begins optimising the world he finds himself in, according to a very specific and coherent set of goals.
- he believes he can change the world in big ways, unlike normal people who assume this is not possible, and by believing it he effects much more change than he would have otherwise

These are common tropes on [[/r/rational]] so to me it felt like it fit right in.
