  The whole book is based on a misunderstanding between Hitler (who thinks he is Hitler) and the Germans (who think Hitler is just a method actor). The only reason this misunderstanding prevails is that it's funnyer that way.

I think part of the reason we see this differently is that the book goes out of it's way to avoid showing Hitler saying things like "No, I really am the actual Hitler, I just time travelled here from the past".

So it looks like the author is avoiding a problem. But I just don't think it's actually a problem. You could write a scene where he says that and people could say in return "wow you are so dedicated" or something.

i.e. if you already believe he's a performance artist, everything he does is just confirming evidence of that theory.

Yes, it's unlikely. It's much more likely that he'd be put into a mental institution at the start, but it seems quite possible.
