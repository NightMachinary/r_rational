I've read it before you gave that recommendation.

I think it's not good [[/r/rational]] material as it's utterly unrealistic (and as a parody, that's okay). The whole book is based on a misunderstanding between Hitler (who thinks he is Hitler) and the Germans (who think Hitler is just a method actor). The only reason this misunderstanding prevails is that it's funnyer that way.
