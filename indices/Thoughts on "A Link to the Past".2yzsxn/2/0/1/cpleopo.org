But then you yourself become morally suspect, for intentionally incentivizing human sacrifice.

My test of goodness as independent from skill would probably be one of altruistic sacrifice. To pass the test, the seeker must sacrifice something they care about - perhaps an arm or something - to save another person. (Or at least, they must /believe/ that someone is really at risk and they are sacrificing something)

There shouldn't be any incentive to save the person other than the person being saved - as far as the seeker knows, no one will know if they do not do the sacrifice and let the person die, and there's no reward waiting in the end.
