Your dungeon could include the ghost of a previous adventurer - actually a pre-built part of the puzzle and not a real ghost (if such things exist). How you treat the ghost could have some nuanced kindness and morality checks to it.

Depending on the nature of what's hidden in the dungeon, plain old Zelda-style puzzles built around cognitive biases might actually be a good idea. However good and kind someone is, everyone can make mistakes, and if I'm going to hand them an artifact of immense power I'd feel safer knowing they're free of, say, the Positive Bias. The more you cross off the list the less likely they are to do something catastrophic. And the more of these hoops they have to jump through, the more they'll probably realize you had a specific concern here.
