You know, that'd be an interesting twist: Instead of trying for tests which are designed to keep the artifact out of the hands of evil people, you try for tests which are designed to keep the artifact out of the hands of somebody too stupid to realize that [insert catastrophe] would be bad for zemself, too.

Yeah, it might get into the hands of a world conqueror, but if you did it right then that world conqueror is at least smart enough to keep the world running.

(and maybe even smart enough to see how long-term selfishness can look remarkably like a given amount of selflessness, since happy citizens are productive, &c &c).
