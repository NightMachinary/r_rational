"DRM Dungeons" (places where the keys are hidden alongside the locks) seemingly only serve to slow looters down, sure. But I don't think they're meant to be be free-standing.

Instead, I always believed that, somewhat like an Indiana Jones movie, these were mostly /temples/ in the literal sense---places that were guarded by groups of warrior-priests trained in combat, trap construction, monster husbandry, etc.

The dungeon itself is meant to be, effectively, a lock: the people who have the key can get in, while the people who /don't/ either choose an easier target, or sit there picking it for long enough that the rightful owners can be alerted, arrive, and dispense with them. Which does happen for some dungeons!

In others, though, the rightful owners are long-dead. The dungeon wasn't actually /designed/ to keep people out forever without its active maintainers. The maintainers were required to reset and refill the traps, breed and feed the monsters, patrol the halls, /keep the keys on their persons somewhere that isn't within the dungeon/, etc. Without them, it's just a leftover set of decaying traps that have yet to wear out or run out of charges. These sort of "dungeon ruins" make perfect sense as DRM dungeons.

By analogy, imagine an abandoned prison complex. The cell doors are locked, but there are keys to them just left hanging on a hook in the guard tower. It would look, if you thought this was a place /purposefully/ constructed to exactly this plan, that they had simply intended to have would-be attackers scale the guard tower, take the keys, and then use them to get further inside. That seems like a DRM dungeon. And yet, it was never a dungeon at all. When it was an actively-inhabited installation, you'd never have managed to scale the guard tower; you'd have been shot. The keys would be on a guard with another guard watching their backs and ready to alert a whole squadron. Etc.
