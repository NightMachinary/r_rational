So ... I'm not gonna claim LoZ all makes total sense, but for game thematics the first dungeons aren't awful.

In the Eastern Palace, Link must be able to face down a horde of knights without his sword and shield, instead relying on his bow as the enemy charges towards him in formation. For this he receives the pendant of courage.

In the Desert Palace he cannot progress unless he can lift boulders, and at the end of the dungeon he receives the pendant of power.

At the Tower of Hera he uses the Moon Pearl to retain his human form, after being shown his "True Self", a pink bunny rabbit. After this ordeal he receives the pendant of wisdom.

I'm pretty happy with that video game logic, myself.
