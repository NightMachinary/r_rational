I'm not overly familiar with the Zelda games, so is the pendant of power actually about physical power?

Because the other two seem like virtues, and I can see how those virtues are legitimately demonstrated in those tests, but unless "power" is about physical power, I don't see how the boulders relate to that at all. And if it /is/ all about physical power, how is that a moral virtue?
