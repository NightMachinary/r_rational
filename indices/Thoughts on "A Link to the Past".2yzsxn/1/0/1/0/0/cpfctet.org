So, this tends to vary with the Legend of Zelda games, but what it comes down to is that there are three gods - one for Wisdom, one for Power, and one for Courage. The Triforce isn't really about "good" or "bad" at all, it's just about that dynamic.

What typically ends up happening is that the three pieces of the Triforce are split between three people, and those people are always some form of Link (the protagonist) who gets the Triforce of Courage, Zelda (the princess and sometimes deuteragonist) who gets the Triforce of Wisdom, and Ganondorf (the villain) who gets the Triforce of Power.

So you're totally right that power isn't really about good and evil - and typically, the villain is the one that gets the power part of it, because power is Ganondorf's most developed attribute. Power isn't a moral virtue, and the games don't imply that it's one.
