I think this is Halo effect - "Those of great skill and intelligence are generally also wise and worthy people" is a heuristic most of humanity lives by. That's why people keep bandying Einstein's quotes. People mistakenly think that because he was smart, his opinion holds more weight for everything in general, even morality.

Truth be told, it's not a /terrible/ heuristic. We like writing genius sociopaths into fiction, but in real life they aren't incredibly common, and the brain abnormalities leading to abnormal morality judgement usually comes with cognitive deficits as well. (Not to mention, the bulk of "evil" misdeeds are probably more irrational behavior than they are a result of abnormal moral judgement.) That said, there are plenty of people who are both smart and morally iffy, and /power/ does seem to have a relationship with questionable morality.

So...what would /you/ do, if you wanted to seal something powerful away for generations after your death, and you /did/ want it to be rediscovered eventually, but only by the wise and good and worthy?
