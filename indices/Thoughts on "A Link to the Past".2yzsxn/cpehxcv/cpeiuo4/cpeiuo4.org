Huh, this question actually turns really interesting, if you take it seriously. Suppose you /do/ have the resources to build this type of protective dungeon full of magic puzzles, but that any social institutions are unlikely to survive. Sort of a related problem space to what they are planing with scaring people in 10 000 years away form nuclear waste.

One idea I come up with, is set up instructions and some lesser repeatable reward for some evil behavior, like human sacrifice. Or maybe some tool that is useful for only selfish purposes. Then the actual thing you were trying to hide i only given to the one who disrupts/destroys these evil things.
