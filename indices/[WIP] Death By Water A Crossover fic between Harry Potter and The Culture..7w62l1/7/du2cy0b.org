This reminded me of another HP/Culture crossover. I can't find the link, but it had a similar idea: Harry was teleported to a Culture ship and raised as one of them. Magic drew from the Grid, but only in one direction. Harry, having grown with the Culture, could draw from both directions of the Grid. He could cast without a wand, and opposite-direction-Grid magic was OP. Harry had a knife drone and a neural lace, and used them both. Harry's "Mom" was a named character from one of the books, and the Culture faked magic using effectors and drones for as long as possible.

This one is better, in that it doesn't make the Culture immediately OP and that Harry at least has some constraints on his power. The OCP angle is something that wasn't happening in the other story, and it's a nice addition.
