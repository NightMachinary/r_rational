You're right. I suspect that (like HPMoR) the poor writing at the start puts off people who could enjoy the meatier interactions between Harry and his peers. Like MoR, harry is an outside context problem who stomps all over the established characters and has yet to be faced with a true obstacle.

On the other hand, there are some really clever passages and I found it a relatively quick read during a part of the day when my focus was too frayed to do anything productive. I'd call it the fan fiction equivalent of a pulp fiction novel you might find at a grocery store.

Like a crack fic, except without the patina of early 2000s “random humor”
