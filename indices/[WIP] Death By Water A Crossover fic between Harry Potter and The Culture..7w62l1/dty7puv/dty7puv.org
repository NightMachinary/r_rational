Wow. The writing sure is, uh, /something/...

  They fucked for a while, with all the creativity and vigor that modern science had endowed their kind with. Gaiane orgasmed half a dozen times, each lasting over a minute.

The conversations are stilted and thinly-veiled infodumps:

  “I could make myself immortal anyways and fall into some pleasant, diverting habit to pass the millennia. But that static routine is not a person I want to become. I could Sublime, leave this universe behind for a kinder, better one, where I could grow to become more for all infinity. But that's just static immortality inverted. If I spend all eternity growing, who I am now will quickly become irrelevant, and as far as I'm concerned that's death as well, just one that happens when you aren't paying attention. I could place myself in suspended animation until something interesting happens, but that's just putting the problem off until later.”
