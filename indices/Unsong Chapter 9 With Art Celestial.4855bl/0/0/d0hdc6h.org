Ugh, Uriel is clearly such a bad software engineer. 'ruby for rails for /the databases/'? He's been clearly just following the latest fads at the time, ActiveModel is decent but surely not worth the maintenance price pulling in such a huge dependency. Next thing he'll say is he's running it using MongoDB 'because of the scale'.

I'm not surprised the entire thing is falling apart.
