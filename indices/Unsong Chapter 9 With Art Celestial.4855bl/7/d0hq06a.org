I'd like to bring up the use of the word machine. I'm not sure it was intentional but using that phrasing reminded me of a conversation I had with a CS professor the other day. He was arguing for that math in our current form may not be universally useful. I think he was mostly talking about our postulates which I can definitely agree with though I disagree on the larger argument, but regardless, he brought up computational machines as a possible explanation for how the laws of physics might differ. essentially there are various math mathematically perfect machines used to help understand computation. There are certain classes of problems that can only be solved by certain machines, for example finite-state machines while perfectly capable of answer questions like the validity of a string regarding some sets of roles can't solve any problems that require counting (at least counting beyond a predefined value). He argued that you could have a universe simulated on a computational machine which makes it impossible to solve certain problems which would obviously impact the usefulness of math. I wonder if this is what Uriel is talking about when he describes the machine. What ever he was simulating on top of it then would be a more limited machine which makes me wonder what, if any, new problems can now be solved with the programming starting to break down.
