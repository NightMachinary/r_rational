  I really don't see any way you could have a creature capable of doing math simulated on a machine that can't be used to simulate a Turing machine.

If a machine can simulate a creature capable of X, then the machine can by definition do X, even if the algorithm has to be so circuitous as to start with "Step 1: Simulate that creature in a situation where they want to do X"
