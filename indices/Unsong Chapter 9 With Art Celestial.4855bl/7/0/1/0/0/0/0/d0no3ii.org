Fair. I'd be happy with a citation (even a non-mathy one), though.

I'm suspicious of your claim because there seem to be computability classes that include an uncomputable function =f(x)= but not compositions of it, like =f(x) + f(x')=. A oracle machine that can computer =f(x)= (whether by =f= being an oracle of not), seems to necessarily also be able to compute =f(x) + f(x')=.
