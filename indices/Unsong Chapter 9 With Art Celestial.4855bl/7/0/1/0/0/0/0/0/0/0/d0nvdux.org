Would you mind giving an example? I'd imagine it being symmetrical, but I definitely don't have a math background.

Oracle machines just spit out bits, and turing machines just operate over bits, as I understand it.

  Hypercomputation or super-Turing computation refers to models of computation that can provide outputs that are not Turing computable. For example, a machine that could solve the halting problem would be a hypercomputer

  It can be visualized as a Turing machine with a black box, called an oracle, which is able to decide certain decision problems in a single operation. The problem can be of any complexity class. Even undecidable problems, like the halting problem, can be used.
