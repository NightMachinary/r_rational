"Don't go into the caves" is of course a reference to Nostalgebraist's [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522][The Northern Caves]].

+Regarding the following+

#+begin_quote
  +THE TEN SEPHIROT ARE A SERIES OF STAGES OR LEVELS OR JEWELS THROUGH WHICH DIVINE POWER FLOWS IN ITS MOVEMENT FROM GOD TO THE FINITE WORLD. EACH ONE CORRESPONDS TO A SPECIFIC DIVINE ATTRIBUTE. THE FIRST REPRESENTS THE WILL OF GOD. THE SECOND REPRESENTS THE WISDOM OF GOD. AND SO ON.”+

  +“THERE ARE TWENTY-TWO DIFFERENT PATHS BETWEEN THESE JEWELS. EACH CORRESPONDS TO A PARTICULAR HEBREW LETTER.”'+

+The image appears to have 11 nodes. Also, I count 9 green connections, 3 blue connections, 6 yellow connections, 3 purple connections, 4 rose connections, which tallies to 25 total connections in the image used? Some letters appear repeated for no reason? Maybe the connection runs under the central nodes and and counts as one connection somehow, and the diagonal pink connections count as one also, in which case the count could be as low as 21 connections? I don't don't kabbalah, though, so I don't know if there is some sense in which some of those connections 'should' be counted as the 'same'? Maybe the joke here is that Uriel's many problems include the fact that he makes many errors, including basic arithmetic errors?+

The image was replaced with one that better matches the text.

This seems like a different understanding of Astronomy than one that was based on crystal spheres? Also, I guess they defined away Pluto earlier than the 2006 that we did - that, or maybe a planet (perhaps Pluto) was taken over by the Comet King and rammed into Hell or something or otherwise destroyed?
