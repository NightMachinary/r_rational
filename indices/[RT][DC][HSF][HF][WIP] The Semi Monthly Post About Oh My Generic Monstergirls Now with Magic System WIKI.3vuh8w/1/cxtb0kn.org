Okay, so:

I like your art style. It rocks, and it beats the hell of my expectations for a free online quest thing. I continue to like the way you handle fog of war. I like your premise, and the weirdness. I even liked the musical number.

Buuuuut...

The seven deadly words: *I am not interested in these people.* I see them from the outside only, so I have to rely on their behaviour to create the attachment. The problem is that

- They're a bunch of strangers stuck in a room, so they don't exactly have heart to heart talks (initial crying aside). There are occurrences of characters discovering something that makes them emotional and then quietly going off to process it on their own. Which is totally realistic, but. Sometimes I don't even get to find out what the cause of their turmoil /is/.
- There's a shitton of them, competing for very limited screen time. With one line of dialog per scene, no shit I don't care about lizard-girl #7.
- What little we do get to see is... not very appealing? AFAICT they're just a bunch of interchangeable excitable kids. The occasional personality traits that do come through are pretty stereotypical.

I could get past that if there was something really interesting going on, but after that initial bit of exciting exploration, there isn't much. Some banter, some dialog that's not even banter, some news about the rest of the world (which is treated like it's happening on a different planet; I don't get this unspoken voluntary confinement thing). And there's some pieces of the puzzle they're stuck in, but so far they're mostly middle sky pieces.

I got to postcount #300, and skimmed ahead a little, but I'm going to drop it for now. I really want to like it, but it's not happening.
