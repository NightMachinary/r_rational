Thank you for the time and the critique. And that actually covers one of the biggest problems I was initially trying to avoid.

Pity I didn't quite manage it yet.

To address the presented flaws going into the future: I'm already trying to ramp up the pacing and tighten up the scenes again to focus on smaller segments of the cast.

The "exposition" chunk looks like it in hindsight went on for far too long and a lot of talk with little action has been going on.

My plan from the start was to try and keep the cast of "important" protagonists to six or seven total with dynamics between threes and twos being most of the beats.

Would you mind jumping in at a later time after I've had time to try and get the plot out if this rut and tighten the focus?

That is going to take a while since this is serial fiction but I can flag the update when it gets that far.
