Huh. The chapter title seems like a reference to A Practical Guide to Evil:

#+begin_quote
  “Above the gates of Stygia there is a statue of a magister,” he finally spoke. “He is a tall, proud man this magister. On his shoulders are two cranes, named Redress and Retribution. They are the patron spirits of the city, said to speak in the dreams of those deemed worthy.”

Also, typo:

#+begin_quote
  he could not say that the blamed the boy.
#+end_quote

the blamed -> he blamed
