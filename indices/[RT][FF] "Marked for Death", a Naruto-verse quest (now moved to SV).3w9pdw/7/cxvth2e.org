Hm. I know basically nothing about the /Naruto/ universe except what I learned through /Lighting Up The Dark/, /Time Braid/, and /The Waves Arisen/. I do think it would be fun to participate, as a cowardly ninja who would rather be an unpowered civilian, to excuse my lack of knowledge. Is that plausible?
