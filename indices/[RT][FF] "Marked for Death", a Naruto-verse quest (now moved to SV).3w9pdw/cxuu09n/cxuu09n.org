Can we talk a little bit about how the voting works?

To me it seems like we can vote for as many alternatives as we want. The way to make sure something doesn't happen then is to vote for everything /but/ what you want to exclude.

I am also somewhat unsure what is meant by "earlier votes by a user is excluded". My assumption is that you only get one post to vote in. Which makes it a good strategy to go back and edit your voting-post later?

It also seems to be the case that simple majority wins.

How will you resolve cases that seem similar or have the potential to be combined? I assume a certain degree of consideration is required by the GMs when deciding winners.

I am most interested in how you will resolve this in regards to stat-distribution. If a complete stat-distribution with fire-affinity gets 4 votes, but a simple vote for earth-affinity(only, no other details) gets 5 what happens?

How will you mix and combine if points are insufficent for both? Say earth-attribute 4 by itself gets 5 votes, but the complete distribution, which only has fire-attribute 2, but no points leftover gets 4 votes, how will they be combined, if at all?
