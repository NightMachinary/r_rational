  I am also somewhat unsure what is meant by "earlier votes by a user is excluded". My assumption is that you only get one post to vote in. Which makes it a good strategy to go back and edit your voting-post later?

The voting bot looks back through all of the posts looking for things with an [x] in them. Then is takes the most recent by each person, counts and collates them. Simple majority does indeed win.

In cases of a tie the GMs have a few options, such as waiting another half hour and re-counting, gauging the feeling of people in the thread or just picking the one that will make a better story.

Fortunately votes are kept separate even if they have similar parts. So, you won't end up with a mangled mish-mash of a character made by slamming two other possible characters into each other.

If, later on, you end up in a position where there are 7 people saying go right, and 10 saying go left split into 5 go left and smell the grass with 5 saying go left and kick a rock, it is unlikely that you will end up going right.
