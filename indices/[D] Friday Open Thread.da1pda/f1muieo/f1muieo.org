What is the optimal way to stay up-to-date with world events? Or, failing that, how do /you/ do it?

I'm speaking of political, science, and economic developments alike.

- Which news websites could be trusted to provide reliable information on new developments in technology and science, and not /miss/ any major developments?

- What is the best way to get information about the current state of any field of technology? Browsing science articles? Reading Wikipedia?

  - For example, how far have we gotten with uploading animals since [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaCRNX0hdwU][this thing]] from four years ago?

- What are some more-or-less unbiased sources of news on global politics and economy?

- What political analysts do you trust? What economists?

- Are there any other resources useful for the overarching task of staying-up-to-date, besides news sources and analysts?
