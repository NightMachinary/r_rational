  Don't try to stay up-to-date. Stay informed. Read the day two stories, not the live updates. Look at moments, but pay attention to the trends, not the details of the moment.

This. This so much!

I have a tendency to tune out nearly all live news or news that try to be as immediate as possible. So much of the news are about being as emotional as possible and there is always some distortion as they exaggerate or outright falsify what is happening (intentionally or not).

News reporting is optimized towards reaching as many people as possible. That means it's all about being as efficient of a replicator of a meme as possible. Hence all the click bait titles, extreme emotional drama, simplified into a quick sentence summary, and many other ways to butcher and mangle the truth until it's more fitting and well suited for publication.

At this point in my life, I cannot recall any time* when any piece of news was so relevant or important that I needed to know about it right away regardless of how accurate it might be. I rather listen to day two stories where the reporters have had more time to investigate and with less of a pressing need to cram in as much emotional drama as possible.

This method has its pros and cons. Sometimes I'm unaware of major events that just happened and am surprised when some of my friends are talking about it. But after I have taken the time to catch up, I have a better understanding of what is going on without any distortions from reading the first published news reports.

*The one exception might have been 9/11 since I lived in the same state at the time, but I was pretty young and wasn't old/mature enough to care about watching the news or to understand what was going on.
