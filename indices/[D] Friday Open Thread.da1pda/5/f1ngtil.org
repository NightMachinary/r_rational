I'm working on a Halloween costume based on one of those tiny jumping spiders, like a /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maratus][Matatus]] spp./ These are smaller than a penny. I'm blowing it up until its head is big enough to be worn over my own head. And I'm having problems with the eye material.

I'd really like to capture the somewhat-metallic appearance of these eyes, while still being able to see out of the eyes. Here's a reference for a /Maratus volans/: [[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Maratus_volans#/media/File:MalePeacockSpider.jpg]]

What material or technique would you use to achieve that color and curve on the lens?

Last year I used cheap sunglasses lenses that were the wrong color, and this year I'm playing with heat-forming plexiglass and painting it, but I'd like to know what suggestions the community has.
