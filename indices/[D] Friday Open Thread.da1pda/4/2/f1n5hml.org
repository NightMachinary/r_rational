In order:

1. Lecture attendance policies are bullshit. Lectures are like gas, they expand to fill all available space. I've never met a teacher whose lectures were worth paying attention to that failed to convey information in the time given, and likewise, I've never met a teacher who sucked at giving lectures that would have done better if given twice the amount of time. As far as I am concerned, as long as I do well on the assignments, it should be up to me what I do with the time allocated. Ditto for technology policies. If I want to use my phone to not pay attention, that's my business, not the teacher's.

2. You're chasing the proximate cause rather than the ultimate cause. The problem isn't how to disable keys to make room for your cat, it's how to keep your cat off your keyboard. I recommend a water bottle, but a kinder alternative is to keep something the cat likes better than you nearby. I distract mine with a cat tower he can use to peer down at me, but a cat bed nearby on the desk might be more helpful. Assuming your cat is nice enough to use a cat bed. But to answer your question: [[https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/11570/disable-the-keyboard-with-a-keyboard-shortcut-in-windows/][google says somebody already made a solution ages ago that's compatible with Windows 10.]] I imagine if you want to be more specific and disable only the function keys, you can just write your own AutoHotKey script.

3. Not important at all. Fuck copyright, and /specifically/ fuck copyright trolls who think a meme or a single diagram is important enough to demand citation. It's /polite/ to give credit to artists and photographers, and expected if you're citing academia, but if you expect to be processing a lot of copyrighted information in a short amount of time, it's a waste of resources for something that's probably not even going to get you in huge trouble. Only do it if you think the citations will point your students or coworkers to resources that might be useful. A lecture or an informative slideshow is a transformative context anyhow.

4. Correlation doesn't equal causation. I wouldn't be shocked if obesity was partially caused by food choices in childhood, but given the overwhelming evidence in favor of modern food being unhealthier and more plentiful than food in the past, I /would/ be shocked if your baby food was the most important factor. People have been trying for years to frame the obesity epidemic in ways that imply it's not the fault of grown adults for making the decisions that they do. I won't claim that they're wrong - a lot of that evidence is very compelling, and most of it makes sense. But this study in particular seems like an extension of that in a direction that doesn't feel like it works. I'm not going to do a deep dive into the study, but there are a couple points that bug me. One: I'm pretty sure [[https://www.stateofobesity.org/obesity-by-age/][adults in /every/ age range]] started gaining weight at around the same rate, in the same proportions. People who are older than sixty-five probably weren't eating baby food in 1970. Two: [[https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo2012157?WT.ec_id=IJO-201306][the idea of HFCS being responsible for the obesity epidemic is pretty old]]. We're still not sure if it's functionally different from other sweeteners, and there are plenty of other things that could have caused it.
