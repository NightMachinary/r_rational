After chatting to the director of the computational stats dept on campus, I was asked to lead a year-long workshop series on Bayesian inference. Since my home department is Anthropology, I think this'll be a good way to further signal my technical skills in anticipation of industry positions after graduation. And while it won't be paid, it's work that I'd mostly be doing anyway (in running an ongoing reading group on the subject), and it'll be catered (my budget for refreshments is $100 / meeting) and I'll have another $1k to use for travel purposes. Looking forward to it overall! Now I need to make a flyer and figure out what to call it. I'm tempted by something in the Charles Atlas style, complete with scantily clad bodybuilders and "DO YOU WANT TO UNLOCK THE SECRETS OF ABS (Applied Bayesian Statistics)?" calls to action. Don't know if they'll go for it.

Have had some other questions over the course of the week that I wouldn't mind reading this community's thoughts on:

Also had a tire pop on me earlier this week -- I approached the prospect of swapping it out for the spare with some trepidation, having never done it before... which turned out to be entirely unfounded. One 3 minute youtube video and 10 minutes later and I was done (and this is triple-checking myself every step of the way)! Super easy, dunno why the media portrays it as something that can discriminate the hapless from the handy.
