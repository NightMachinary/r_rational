I've been forced to use new-reddit as the new mod tools are only available for new-reddit, and I need them for [[/r/3Dprinting]].

I threw an open-source reddit clone on a cheap server if anyone is interested. Eventually it's supposed to end up being federated, so it could talk to other reddit clones.
