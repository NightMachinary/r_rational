I'm not sure this is possible without a very large amount of noise. A lot of revolutionary things are only revolutionary in retrospect, or arise from skunk-works projects. If you want to see all the new things, there's going to be a lot of low-level press-release "we made a new thing" stories that are quantifiable improvements but not major developments. I'm including "Apple releases iPhone 11" as an example of this sort of improvement.

Generally, I'd look for publications with topic-specific RSS feeds that publish occasional updates rather than ongoing coverage.
