I liked it. You have a character trying to deal with PTSD, and the clash of living in a world with electricity and English after having lived with elves and magic, a guy who got twisted into a monstrous tyrant having to find his place in society, and a practical guy trying to hold everything together.

That said, the ending kinda threw me. The main characters are all running away from their problems and abandoning those closest to them. It becomes literally about escapism It isn't bad, just something I disagree with.
