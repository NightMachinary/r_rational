It was a pleasure to read technically, but kind of a disappointment in the actual story. I can't find my original criticism of the story (probably on an old monday thread) so here's my best attempt at remembering it (spoilers for ending):

I really didn't like how the brother character basically pulled a perfect karma houdini and gets away with it in the end. He successfully lies to and manipulates everyone, gets to have his cake and eat it, too. The friend character is screwed from the beginning, there was nothing they could have done to return to their world, and basically end up having a psychotic break to end up in an asylum, after being betrayed by his best friends. You could say having an ending where a bad guy with a good plan wins is quintessential "rational reality", but eh, it was a pretty unsatisfying ending.
