The furriness of most of the head puts some constraints on that, but let me think about where I could see out.

There's a gap in fur behind and above most species' pedipalps, which is a narrow slot but one's that's already negative space, and thereby suited for hiding mesh or eyes.

If the fur is discarded, and the spider is presented in a lowpoly fashion with fabric stretched over an inner frame, black fabric would provide good places to look through. I've used that technique on other masks.

If I were a rich man, I could slap a camera or two or eight on the spider, and wire those to per-eye displays. I saw a Protogen furry doing something similar, and I wonder if they've documented their build.
