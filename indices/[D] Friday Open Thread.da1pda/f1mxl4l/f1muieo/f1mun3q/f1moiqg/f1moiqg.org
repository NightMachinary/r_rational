So I went to a co-ed pickup sauna the other day (for the first and probably last time, though the person I went with assured me that this was a substandard club. 3/10 got groped, would not recommend. any regulars want to read my 2,200 word writeup feel free to request it and I'll PM it to you - note that nothing interesting or titillating happened if you are expecting a penthouse letter). But that's not what this is about.

What this is about is that I realised that the sort of sex club vibe seemed very much like how I imagine vampires to be, so I wrote a (pretty bad) short story based on the layout/appearance of the club I visited (except I made the vampire lair classy). Thought people might be interested in it: (1962 words) [[https://pastebin.com/6yKhmgWX]] (contains a very small amount of mild sexual content, and it's text-only)
