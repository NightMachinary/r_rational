  What are some more-or-less unbiased sources of news on global politics and economy?
#+end_quote

This does not exist. There are only sources with different kinds of biases.

If you want a broad basis, for the US and UK I'd recommend perhaps The Guardian, NPR, the WSJ, the Economist, the Washington Post, and the NY Times, but you'll need to keep in mind how those publication's editorial biases and their writers' personal biases compare to your own.

  Are there any other resources useful for the overarching task of staying-up-to-date,

Get a good feed reader. I don't know which one to recommend to you, though, because my feed reader is Tweetdeck and Reddit and a few Mastodon instances skewed towards hedonism, and that's not a good combination for your purposes.

Don't try to stay up-to-date. Stay informed. Read [[https://www.emptywheel.net/2017/10/02/in-praise-of-day-two/][the day two stories]], not the live updates. Look at moments, but pay attention to the trends, not the details of the moment.
