There are SO many fics out there about people from our Earth who are punted into a fantasy/sci-fi world. But what if the hero came home ... maybe after gaining powers or learning things? Anyone ever heard of a rational (ish) story like that?

Closest I can think of is re-do stories of coming back from the future with memories/skills intact. Not quite the same thing.
