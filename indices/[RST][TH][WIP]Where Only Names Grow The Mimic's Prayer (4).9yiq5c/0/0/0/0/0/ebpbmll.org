I'm planning to set a firm schedule soon. I was playing it a bit loose for the early updates to try to ease myself into a rhythm for it first, with one roughly every couple of weeks.

Unfortunately, a close relative passed away last week, so I'm pretty thrown off at the moment. Hence the delay. I'm glad you're into the story, though!
