I'll definitely still be following this even if every chapter isn't being posted here. This first arc has done a great job of introducing the setting so far. I think you're striking a good balance between which information about the world to reveal and what to keep hidden. I'm interested in things like what a phylactery is or getting more information on the compromises that go against the spirit of the Oaths, but keeping the information to things relevant to the current case is working well.

I liked the musing on interviews. I hope the attention to the social aspects of getting testimony continues. I tend to get too caught up in clue hunting to notice things like Anna calling for desert early, so it's nice having a viewpoint that catches that sort of thing.

And the bit about preemptive theories... definitely something to watch out for. Sasha's working without the meta-knowledge that she's in a mystery story, but the point still stands even with that. Being warned about trying to make text fit theory is probably a reminder I needed.
