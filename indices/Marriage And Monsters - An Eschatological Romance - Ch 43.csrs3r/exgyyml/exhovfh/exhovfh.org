I actually didn't know about Sequester Thoughts! I'd done a pretty big library search on spells that might have interesting interactions with memetics at the start of this but of course I didn't find that one until you mentioned it, well after I'd written a bunch of this. The perils of Pathfinder as a solution- there's always a spell, skill, or obscure feat that does it better.
