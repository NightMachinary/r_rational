Unsong, Chilli and the Chocolate Factory: Fudge Revelation, and Practical Guide to Evil have all come up here before. I need to go back and finish Unsong since I got distracted last time, but its good. Chilli is short and the first ~third is a bit clunky, but I really enjoyed it overall. PGTE is not short, book 6 is very nearly finished and then the final book will start. I mentioned a bunch of rarer stuff in this week's recommendation thread too, so ctrl+f that thread for more stuff.
