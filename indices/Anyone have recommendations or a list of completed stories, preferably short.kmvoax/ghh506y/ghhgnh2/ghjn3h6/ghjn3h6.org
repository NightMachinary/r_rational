If you're not allergic to ponies, the Friendship is Optimal MLP fanfic and its recursive fanfics are really, really good and mostly completed and short.

It's about AI safety, unfriendly AI, escaping the box, and that sort fo thing. In my mind the ponies are only a backdrop and it doesn't require knowledge of the show beyond "there was a tv show with ponies that children and a certain type of young man enjoyed"

Recommendations (all in universe):

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal]] - the original fic that started it and laid down a lot of groundwork rfor the setting. 38k words.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/69770/friendship-is-optimal-caelum-est-conterrens]] - an amazing story that stands alone about identity and brain uploading among other things. can stand alone IMO. 55k words.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/386867/leftovers-a-friendship-is-optimal-story]] - A story about cryonics. I'd probably recommend you read the original story first as it assumes knowledge of the setting. 12k words.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/406526/implacable]] - revcerse munchkining very thorough anti-AI defenses. 17k words.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/114862/friendship-is-optimal-tiny-morsels-of-satisfaction]] - a whole bunch of short flashes set in the FiO universe that provide cool worldbuilding. 36k words, but each chapter stands alone and is <5k words.

there are TONS more fics in the universe but those are IMO some of the best.
