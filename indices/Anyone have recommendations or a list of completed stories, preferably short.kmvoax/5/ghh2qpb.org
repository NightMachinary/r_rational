- Worm, by Wildbow. It's extremely long, but is the magnum opus of rational fiction in my opinion.

- Super Powereds by Drew Hayes. Also rather long, and like Worm it's a reconstructed superhero story

- Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality

Are you interested in traditionally-published fiction as well?
