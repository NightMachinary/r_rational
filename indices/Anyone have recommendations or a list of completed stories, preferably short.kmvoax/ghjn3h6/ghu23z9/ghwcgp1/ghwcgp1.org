I'm glad! They're really some of my absolutely favourite stories and it's a crime that the ponies scare so many people off.

How did you find the "ponyness", as a non-pony-person? I'd seen a season or two of the show so I was familiar with it enough to get most/all the references. Did you have a problem with it?

Also, there's many, many more good FiO stories. I think there's a "folder" of them in fimfiction.
