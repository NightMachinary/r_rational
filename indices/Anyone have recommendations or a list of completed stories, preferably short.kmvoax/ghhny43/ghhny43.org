You should probably read the rest of the fiction stories on SSC, then? I liked that one, and I liked the rest of them as well.

Otherwise, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][/Cordyceps/]] is readable in one sitting, complete, and very very good.

Also, I'm surprised no one ever links [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SddGHeVfcVa5SCDHHTOA4RlKwnef-Q6IMw_Jqw9I0Mw/edit?usp=sharing][/Dave Scum/]] by the same author. It's not /as/ very very good, but awesome anyway. (Edit: I think it might be unfinished?.. When I read it, it felt /completed/ even if not 100% satisfyingly wrapped---but since then, two new chapters appeared. So who knows at this point.)

Out of already mentioned in this thread works, I second /Answer to Job/, /Instruments of Destruction/, and /The World As It Appears To Be/.
