I'm pretty sure that for the majority of those ships he doesn't have four digits of accuracy for their stats at the time they went into the nebula, as opposed to their capabilities out of the shipyard or even the most recent recorded audit.

Also, if there have been THAT many ships (Starfleet or otherwise) encountering such a nebula, without there being a Starfleet regulation specifically covering them, there's something fundamentally wrong with Starfleet.

And he only quoted 3 digits for the plot-armor factor.

So I'm calling shenanigans.
