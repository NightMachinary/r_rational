This might be a HPMOR Omake, or it could be that story with like, every fun fictional character transcending simulations together until they hit a god layer. It has Spock and Vimes and Mr Rogers in it, and it's tied into that book Yudkowsky likes, about Dust Theory or something? Sounds like Chasm City?
