You might be remembering the little vignette in the comments [[http://www.leftoversoup.com/archive.php?num=201][here]] (not sure if this actually the original source but Google thinks it is), where the Kirk-like character challenges the Spock-like character to justify the ridiculously precise probability of survival he just gave, and argues with his assumptions.

I do wonder if and how you could sustain a whole story with a character who has this superpower (and is listened to) without it just turning into a colorful decision theory textbook. Not that there's anything wrong with colorful decision theory textbooks.
