Both would be irrelevant for TWF voting purposes, though the commenting restriction would dash my hopes of attaching reviews to the entries themselves. I'm talking about using Reddit as a simple heap of index cards, a database. You can downvote "Bob's Elf Story" till the crack of doom, and it will still exist and be linkable as the info page for "Bob's Elf Story" on TWF. A bigger issue would be that you'd need a proper database for the links of TWF themselves.

Now, on reflection, a simple out-of-the-box forum would work better for that anyway, without the weird restrictions; I'm spitballing here. The advantage of Reddit would be sidestepping the maintenance-costs issue, which I could see being a problem.

Ultimately, this may not have a solution, because WFG is a bit old and decrepit to save and the people helped most by TWF at this point are giants like Wildbow, or Royal Roaders, who have long-established fanbases and don't need it. It's very nice, and more important, for little fish like me, too, but I for one don't have the spare time or skills to set up and maintain a real solution. So we're all sitting around talking about all the different ways somebody else might bell the cat.
