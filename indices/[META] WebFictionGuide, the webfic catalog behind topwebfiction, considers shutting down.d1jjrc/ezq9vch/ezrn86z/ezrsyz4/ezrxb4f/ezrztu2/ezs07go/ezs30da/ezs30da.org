No, Reddit's a totally different animal designed to capture a much more ephemeral kind of opinion, and besides, it requires logins. The beauty of TWF is that it takes two seconds and no effort to vote, and the stakes are too low to be worth elaborate rigging with IP spoofing or whatever.

But I do think I'm back to square one here, and I'm not confident that anyone has a lot of skin in this game. There'd also be the issue of coordinating with WFG's owners to implement any solution. Probably some sort of replacement will emerge organically in the coming months or years to fit demand. Or maybe that's magical thinking on my part.
