Crossposting my proposed solution from the forum:

"Revised suggestion: create [[/r/topwebfiction][r/topwebfiction]]. New entries for the queue are posted to it by authors. Moderators index the posts as entries on topwebfiction--meaning that, when you click the info button next to The Wandering Inn on topwebfiction, it takes you to its original submission post on [[/r/twf][r/twf]]. Anything but index submissions as top-level posts on the reddit would be deleted by moderation. Reviews are posted as comments. Possibly a secondary subreddit would be needed for update announcements and ongoing discussion of the stories in progress.

This is an extremely hacky solution, but uses in-place architecture that requires no maintenance and minimal pay (just to maintain topwebfiction's domain), and will avoid the annoyance, disruption, and debugging involved in a custom coding effort. The big disadvantage would be a period of anarchy as we transition from the old site to the subreddit, but once the dust settled we'd have a perfectly functional system that will last until Reddit goes bust."
