It'll probably go like this:

- A lot of people volunteer.
- It starts off, with a bottleneck.
- People drift off and away, as they can't help.
- More opportunities to contribute arise.
- Somebody advertises here again, this time explicitly.
- A lot of people come to help.
- A few new people submit pull requests.
- Some of them stick around.

This prediction is loose; I only assign roughly a 30% probability to this happening, conditional on somebody posting on [[/r/rational]] at that point in development. But I reckon something /like/ this will probably happen.
