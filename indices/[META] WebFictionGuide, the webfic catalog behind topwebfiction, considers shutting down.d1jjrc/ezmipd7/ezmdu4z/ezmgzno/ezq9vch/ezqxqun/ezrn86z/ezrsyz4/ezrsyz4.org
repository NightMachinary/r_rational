Sorry, not following you. I'm new at Reddit; do old posts simply disappear entirely/get erased? The original ad for PB from two months back is still searchable and open to comment, so I assumed not. If that's not correct, then yeah, this whole scheme goes bust.

Just in case it's not clear (don't mean to condescend, just not understanding your objection and want to eliminate uncertainty) I'm thinking of using Reddit purely as an index here, with the upvote/downvote system irrelevant to TWF's existing voting system. TWF's info link points you to the original Reddit post even if it's four years old and listed at -27. Community aspects (update announcements, discussion, etc.) would go in a separate forum and function normally.

Again, this is kludgy as hell, and one major downside I've heard is that Reddit's search function isn't terrific; however, I have little faith in crowdsourced volunteer programming efforts, based on past experience, and the important thing seems to be preserving TWF, not WFG which is already pretty well dead.
