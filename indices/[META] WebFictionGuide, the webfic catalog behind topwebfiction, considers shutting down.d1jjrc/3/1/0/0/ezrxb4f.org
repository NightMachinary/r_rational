  the upvote/downvote system irrelevant to TWF's existing voting system
#+end_quote

- You cannot vote/comment on posts older than 6 months
- Votes themselves are weighted by recency. If you see a post with 400 karma, that could be either 600 or 200 people upvoting it, depending on how old the post was at vote time.

Unfortunately, it wouldn't just be kludgy, it would be non functional
