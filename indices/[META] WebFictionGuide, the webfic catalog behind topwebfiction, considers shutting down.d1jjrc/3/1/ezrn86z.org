Seems like a pretty big downgrade, tbh. Part of twf's charm is that it's a great barometer of what people are currently reading. Unless all the posts were cleared every week, and the authors reposted their fiction and updated the links, it would be a one-time popularity list.

The alternative is that fictions more than a 6 months to a year old (whatever reddit's archival time period is) would also be unable to be voted on, the front page would just be whatever the 25 newest fictions are, and the community would be very bad for good fiction listing (because reddit's algorithm is far from equal voting weight over time).

At this point, a weekly strawpoll would be similarly sustainable alternative.
