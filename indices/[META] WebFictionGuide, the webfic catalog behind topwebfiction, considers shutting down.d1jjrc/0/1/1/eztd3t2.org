Essentially yes, but public coding projects do pretty well at not "evaporating" they usually just grind to a halt if they lose support. If things are well outlined non invested people can chip in and do the smaller projects then leave, letting the people who are devoted focus on putting everything together. How good this is depends on the volunteer quality and style but ideally it shifts the workload away from very skilled people so all they can focus on complicated parts and tying things together.
