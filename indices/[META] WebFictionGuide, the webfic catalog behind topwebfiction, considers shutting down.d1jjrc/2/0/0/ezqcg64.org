Scribblehub, from my experience, is just Royalroad except worse. Lower quality submissions, and smaller, less active community. You merely have to glance at the front page to see it's just the usual webnovel schlock.

If you're considering Scribblehub, Royalroad is better in about all aspects. Which isn't an endorsement; Royalroad is pretty bad.
