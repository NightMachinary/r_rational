  Given the nature of your question, it wasn't clear how obvious.

Hah! Right you are, sorry for being snarky.

  I suspect Rain's inability to access his soul is separate from his fragmentation issue. Most people in Delveworld don't access their souls outside of their interface.
#+end_quote

Possible. I'm guessing that the soul fragmentation is the "chaotic energy" which pushes him out, and that if his soul was not fragmented, he would be able to access more easily. This guess is based on some assumptoin that clarity/focus facilitates the soul access process, which is a very weak assumption given current evidence. In general, I find it odd that very few people try to access their souls, desipte their presence appearing to be common knowledge. But many people in Delve are stupid so there!

  What Rain does have a problem with is binding and using additional Accolades. These are apparently external to his soul, and interface - at least initially - through the paling. His attunement to objects such as his armor have not yet shown an impact, but it's possible that his ability to attune to additional objects has been damaged.

You're probably right on all accounts.

#+begin_quote
  The terminal's ability to communicate with him has certainly been affected.
#+end_quote

Actually, the terminal only quoted the paling integrity as a warning, whereas several other values were errors. If I was going to guess, it is those values which drove the issues. We know from other text that it is expected that low-level individuals are not expected to be able to interface with the device (is this because of low clarity? low focus? low soul level? something else? unknown). This has been shown with both the barrier and the DKE Link.
