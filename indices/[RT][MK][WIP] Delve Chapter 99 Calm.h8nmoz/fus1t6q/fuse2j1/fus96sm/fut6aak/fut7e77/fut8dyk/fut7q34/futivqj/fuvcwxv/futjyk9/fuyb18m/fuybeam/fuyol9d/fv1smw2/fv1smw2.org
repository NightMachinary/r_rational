  This is obvious.

Given the nature of your question, it wasn't clear how obvious.

I suspect Rain's inability to access his soul is separate from his fragmentation issue. Most people in Delveworld don't access their souls outside of their interface.

What Rain does have a problem with is binding and using additional Accolades. These are apparently external to his soul, and interface - at least initially - through the paling. His attunement to objects such as his armor have not yet shown an impact, but it's possible that his ability to attune to additional objects has been damaged. The terminal's ability to communicate with him has certainly been affected.
