I wonder how he's going to handle the soul fragmentation and paling integrity once he's in the state of mind to tackle that. Will the terminal be able to direct him, or is going to basically have to use it as a check while makes his own ad hoc defragmenter? Plus that whole Core Level: 18 Error Threshold thing proves he's not actually level 18. But whether him displaying as 18 is due to his own preexisting assumptions about how all this works or due to something inherent to the world is still up in the air. Personally I would find it hilarious if this entire time all he had to was "Free his mind" and make some alternative leveling macros to bypass the blue restriction
