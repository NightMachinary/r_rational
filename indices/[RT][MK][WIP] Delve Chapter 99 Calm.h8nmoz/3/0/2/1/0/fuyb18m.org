Computers have an issue with drive fragmentation. Every so often, a hard drive or other storage device needs to be defragmented, or else errors and poor running performance result. This becomes more and more of an issue when the drive fills up.

Working from this analogy, Rain has a core level 18 soul which is nearly capped on skills, on top of which Rain has heavily modified the UI and greatly improved his synchronization.
