Can't remember if its been explained but I don't think it has. Where do monsters come from? Did they evolve? Someone create them? Or do they just keep popping out of some portal at the bottom of the Dungeon? Also what is the dungeon? Did people build or the Gods build it. Anyone ever explore all the way down to the bottom?
