The closest answer is the story of the Dragon Bellow, who was destroyed by the gods and had its corpse used to create the world. The dungeon is claimed to be the veins of the dragon. The story also claims his heart is still beating at the center of the world and some times pieces of it flake off and become monsters.

That's the mythology anyway. There's been no confirmation on whether this is actually true.
