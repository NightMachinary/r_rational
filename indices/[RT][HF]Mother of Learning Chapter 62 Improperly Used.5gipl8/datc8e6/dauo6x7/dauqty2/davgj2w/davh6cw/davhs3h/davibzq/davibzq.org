It was cool. I suspect trying to get that to work on their own terms might take longer that the cycles they've got left.

And that's just one piece. They also need to get the other pieces and at least a couple are probably going to require a similar amount of magical and military effort to repelling the invasion and attacking the Well of Souls. Alanic can put together a strike force for one of these, but can he do it like three times in one month? Learning to expel is a must.
