We don't yet know whether they have to present all five pieces at the same time. I wouldn't be surprised at all if bringing a single piece to the Guardian gets them something, eg telling them how to use their Controller powers (apart from the ones built into the marker). It's possible that bringing them all sequentially would be enough to give them authorisation.
