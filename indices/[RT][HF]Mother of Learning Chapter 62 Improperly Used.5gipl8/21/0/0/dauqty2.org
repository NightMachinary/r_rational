There is a gate, though, to wherever QI's base probably is, isn't there? And the necromancers, without QI, haven't posed a tremendous challenge for a while now, especially if Z&Z get the backing of Alrick's forces again. Especially if they spend a few cycles expelling who they can and weakening their forces.

Besides, unless they're willing to put off taking the last piece of the Key until the last few hours of the cycle, they'll probably have to fight QI on his turf anyway.
