  Yes, and at the start of the month it will be surrounded by the main body of the invasion force. And it leads to Iasku Mansion, but I don't recall Zorian ever finding the next link in the chain.

You don't need to expel them at the start of the month. Zorian had already spent a month hunting them in the caverns before. Next month, most of them immediately flop down, aranea-style, they're probably reinforced, a few more purges like that and investigating the gate might work. But QI needs to get expelled first.

And, again, the alternative is fighting them all anyway, but at the end of the month, when they're in full combat mode and with hours left on the timer.

I'm not saying it's easy. I'm saying the other options suck a lot more. At least, using the tools we know of so far. I mean, sure, they could find a "bitch slap QI to death reliably and with ease any time they want" spell, then they can just do that. But that would... not be amazing storytelling.
