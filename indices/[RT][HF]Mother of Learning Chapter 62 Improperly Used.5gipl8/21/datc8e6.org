Fantastic chapter, as always.

Red Robe being Zach's simulacrum and possibly wearing Veyers' body sounds spot on to me, a great theory. It does raise some questions, though. For instance, Red Robe actually knows the Simulacrum spell:

#+begin_quote
  For a moment, the matriarch was afraid that they had killed the man, making all her preparations and plotting meaningless... but the reality turned out to be far worse than that. Instead of erupting into a shower of blood and gore, the robed man simply... turned into smoke.

  The opponent they had been fighting hadn't been the third time traveler in person. It had been merely an ectoplasmic shell infused with some of his skill and magic. A simulacrum, meant to test the waters and distract them.
#+end_quote

And the simulacrum seems willing to die for him. Plot hole or clue? If Red Robe was a rebellious simulacrum, surely his own simulacra wouldn't be terribly obedient? Has RR also learned how to control them? Also, Zorian remembers Zach being chill even before the loop. Red Robe is, to put it mildly, somewhat of a dick. Did SZach just freak, like Alrick said they sometimes do, when he realized he's a simulacrum? The freak-out, combined with having to do whatever fucked-up shit he did to save himself beyond the loop reset and to wipe Zach's memory, would have pushed him along a darker path. Also, like Zach, Red Robe seems talented in many ways, but not that... clever. He bought the arenea misdirection hook, line and sinker, and then just brute forced his way through the problem.

I also have some general thoughts about the story far. (Notice me, senpai!!!) Personally, I am looking forward to Z&Z investigating the lesser markers and the expel from loop spell further.

Expel's utility is obvious - they're going to have a hard time reliably getting all of the pieces of the Key without it. For example, getting Quatach-Ichl's piece. First few loops, assaults on him, trying to hit him with the expel spell. (Speaking of which, has the expel spell been shown to be blocked by magical defenses and wards or, since it's kind of an higher-level admin tool, if you're hit you're done?) The next few loops after that, an assault on wherever his remains are at the start of the loop and expelling whatever resistance there might be in the location. Every loop after that - wake up, teleport, grab it, check mark on the list, go grab a coffee.

And the lesser markers would be crucial in arranging this. Getting Xvim and Alrick in on it for multiple loops at a time would save Z&Z days of getting them to believe them and weeks of getting them up to speed and getting them to fully trust them. As for the ethics of it, well, they've already told them that they are copies of themselves who get wiped out once a month and that's like 90% of it. Personally, I think if I was made aware of being in someone else's time loop, I'd prefer to have six months over one. Xvim and Alrick seem like the tough, old, responsible bastards who, if asked, would agree to it for the cause. I wouldn't use it on the rest of Z&Z's close circle, though. That would suck.
