Hmm. Just reread chapter 27, and it seems like yes, a lich's soul is physically located in its body - but firmly anchored to the phylactery, so in the event of disconnection from the possessed body for whatever reason, it snaps back to the anchor.

Presumably things are a little different with a simulacrum, since the soul remains in the caster. A simulacrum's connection to the soul is remote - which might, perhaps, impact on the plan to have an army of mana-assimilating simulacra replenishing your reserves almost instantaneously. On the other hand, it might still work so long as the caster (and thus the soul) remains in an area with plenty of ambient mana.
