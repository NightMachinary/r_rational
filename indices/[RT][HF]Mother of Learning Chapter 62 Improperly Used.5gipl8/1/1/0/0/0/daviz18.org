That's interesting that the soul can be tossed about like that, implying that the two steps too becoming a lich are being able to create alternate minds for yourself and being able to successfully remove souls from the body. Much like Zorian has had done to him to train his soul sense.

They mentioned a flaw to that ambient mana plan in the chapter. It was that the caster can't just draw directly from ambient mana without the risk of going insane or damaging their body, they have to wait for their soul to assimilate the mana, which takes some time.
