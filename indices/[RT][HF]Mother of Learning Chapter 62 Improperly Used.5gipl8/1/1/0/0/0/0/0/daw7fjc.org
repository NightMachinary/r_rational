At the end of the day, there is only one soul assimilating ambient mana, no matter how many minds you dedicate to the task, so no - having multiple simulacrums assigned to assimilate mana wouldn't do anything.

Putting a single simulacrum on top of a mana well or something and dedicating them solely to mana assimilation would work, though. Assuming the simulacrum didn't get bored and walked off to do its own thing, anyway.
