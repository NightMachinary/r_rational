No, but see chapter 23, "Apparently there was a way to assimilate ambient mana faster if you sat completely still and focused on doing absolutely nothing else." So it ought to at least be possible for one simulacrum to do some mana meditation while Zorian is busy doing other things (or vice versa).

It's not clear whether there is a hard limit on the soul's assimilation rate, or whether having multiple attached minds would give further benefits.
