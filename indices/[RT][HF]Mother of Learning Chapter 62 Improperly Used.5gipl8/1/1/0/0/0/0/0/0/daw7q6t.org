Fair enough :). Potentially useful, but not sudden omnipotence.

Might be helpful to have one Zorian doing that while the other is in the Black Room; even at 30x time dilation, it's still better than nothing. Though I'm not sure how they'd agree on which one should do which job; one gets a day of meditation, the other gets a month cooped up with Zach, but also gets first dibs on whatever they learn inside. It probably makes more sense for the original to go inside so he can practise shaping.

Do simulacra need to eat?

EDIT: Thinking it through some more, this probably wouldn't work. First, because the Black Room is designed to isolate the inside from the outside, which is likely incompatible with the connection between simulacrum and soul; second, if the original Zorian goes inside, then his soul is in a zero-mana zone, and no amount of meditation will help. Oh well, they have crystals for that.
