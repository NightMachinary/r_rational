If the simulacrum was good enough to also be capable of memory packet creation, and if the original and the copy both carry telepathic relays, then they might be able to update each other in near-real-time, plus the simulacrum might be able to 'upload' itself back to him if it was backed into a corner and had to commit suicide.

For that matter, since the simulacrum is attached directly to his soul, can it keep functioning after his death? I guess that's the further step of becoming a lich. Hmm...if the caster of a simulacrum was killed, but then a necromancer immediately trapped their soul in a jar, /probably/ the simulacrum would continue, at least for a time.

And can a simulacrum make use of his limited-range Key detection ability?
