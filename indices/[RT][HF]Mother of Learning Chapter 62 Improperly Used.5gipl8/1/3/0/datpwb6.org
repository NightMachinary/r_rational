A few reasons.

First, I would expect better bandwidth, and maybe better transmission fidelity, by having a simulacrum embed a memory packet. Assuming it's a high-quality simulacrum.

Second, I think it would be politically advantageous to have a simulacrum assemble whatever memories are important to it, and package them up for transfer to the next loop. He's been doing this for a bunch of friends and spiders, so it should feel relatively natural to his copy, and might ease its existential angst.

Third, whatever's in a packet, you don't forget.
