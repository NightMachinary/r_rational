Yes, I would expect Zorian to be able to achieve something with his mind magic, eg a memory packet. However, he's nowhere near the level I would expect him to need in order to attempt any kind of personality integration, even with quite small divergences. He may be a master mind mage by human standards, but remember his reaction to opening the Matriarch's memory packet. He's way behind true masters.
