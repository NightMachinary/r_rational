So simulacrums don't generate magic of their own, +and need ambient mana to sustain themselves.+ I wonder if the fact that they can absorb ambient mana at all means they are capable of taking in more mana than they use.

If Zorian had one or more simulacrums above say, the Cyorian well (the highest ambient mana generator in known in the world, IIRC), would he be able to increase his regeneration speed like Naruto putting clones in sage mode?
