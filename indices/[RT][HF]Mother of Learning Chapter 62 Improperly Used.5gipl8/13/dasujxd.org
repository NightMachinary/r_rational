Zach says he's a natural magnitude 50 with the shaping skills of a natural magnitude 25.

I'd been wondering if it was possible for Zorian to merge his loop soul with his real soul, I think this makes it a lot more likely. I assume that Zach's soul was duplicated initially just like everyone else, the Guardian then merged his actual soul into the loop soul.

Possibly, if Zorian's real and loop souls are merged, it will double the strength/range of his natural mental magics as well, since those are an aspect of his soul. Zorian's a base 8, with the black room, he'll probably hit his max of 32, upon leaving he might be either a 40 or a 64, depending on how it works.
