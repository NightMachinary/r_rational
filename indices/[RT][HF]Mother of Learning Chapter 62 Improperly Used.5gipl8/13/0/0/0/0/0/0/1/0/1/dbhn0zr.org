  Also, the Marker itself must modify the world template in regards to the Controller's soul, similar to the "soulkill" function, that would explain why Zorian isn't constantly placed into a body that already has a soul in it at the beginning of each loop.

This is a good counter-point against your theory in general. If the marker prevents the Gate from copying a person's soul, then it should have prevented Zach's soul from getting copied (then merged with his original soul).

I still like this theory, but

  "Because only the Controller has their real soul pulled into the time loop," the Guardian said. "Everyone else is a copy.

suggests to me that the marker's soul is probably not duplicated and merged by the Gate. Maybe Original!Zach found a different way to double his soul. 50 mana for the control of 25 mana is very suspicious.
