Everything in the world was copied, why not the Controller's soul too?

The Guardian's AI wasn't designed with clarity in mind when communicating with people as a high priority (as far as I can tell), so I don't think the "plain meaning" of its statements should be taken at face value. "Everyone else is a copy." (Guardian's chapter 55 statement) doesn't preclude "Everyone is copied." (my theory), because the Guardian already told us that the Controller's original soul is brought in to the loop. If it was combined with the copy soul, the Guardian would no longer consider the Controller "a copy".

And Zach has twice the mana reserves he should for the degree of mana control he has, it's not undeniable evidence, but it is evidence in my favor.
