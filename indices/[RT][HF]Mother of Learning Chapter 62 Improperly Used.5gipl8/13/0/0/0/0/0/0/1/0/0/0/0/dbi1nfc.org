I really don't think that the marker would have the degree of responsibility that you're assuming. It isn't /smart/. Mostly it just seems to send signals to trigger Gate functions. The most advanced independent thing we know about is the Key detection, and that is a relatively simple feature. Anything that involves manipulating and swapping souls would almost certainly be handled at a higher level.

The Guardian's statements make clear that it is capable of anchoring and de-anchoring souls at will, monitoring them for damage and possibly other conditions, triggering new iterations, and in general carrying out complex logic. Also, we know that it has been given an overarching imperative: protect the source of the template from everything within the loop. It's the logical place for decisions about which souls go where.
