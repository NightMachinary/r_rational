That's not exactly what I'm saying. I think Zach was copied initially, and then his non-loop soul was removed and merged with the loop-soul, he's not a copy anymore, and his actual body is empty of a soul. So in Zorian's case, the copy soul (the one we've always seen) could be added to the actual soul.
