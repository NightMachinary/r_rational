  I'm interested to see what Zorian is going to use his simulacrum for.
#+end_quote

The "end game" that comes to mind for me, is that if they need to gather a bunch of geographically dispersed bits of key (and get all of them in one turn of the loop), it would be awfully convenient to have some additional manpower to go running around the place to grab multiple bits in parallel.

Although, sharing a single Zorian-sized mana pool would be a bit of a tight constraint (unless they send out simul*Zach*ra instead)... and given he can teleport to eliminate travel time, it's not necessarily possible to get very much of an advantage by having simulacra get individually "into position" before doing the mana intensive bits in sequence.

Unless of course they're able to devise low-mana strategies for obtaining the MacGuffins, in which case we're back to potentially sending out an army of Zorian clones.
