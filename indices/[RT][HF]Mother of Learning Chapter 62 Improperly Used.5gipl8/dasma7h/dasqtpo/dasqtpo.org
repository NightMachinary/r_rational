  I'm interested to see what Zorian is going to use his simulacrum for.
#+end_quote

Anything that involves gathering information, rather than increasing skills, could be a candidate. So, browsing the library (including stealing a pass and getting into restricted areas), helping Kael with alchemy, investigating cultists, that kind of thing. It might be worth equipping his copies (why make only one?) with telepathic relays, so they can report on anything important or call for backup.

I doubt that a simulacrum of Zorian would mind that kind of job, either. They're things he wouldn't mind doing himself if he didn't have other priorities.
