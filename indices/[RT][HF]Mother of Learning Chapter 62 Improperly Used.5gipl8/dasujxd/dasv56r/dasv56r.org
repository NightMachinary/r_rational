  I assume that Zach's soul was duplicated initially just like everyone else, the Guardian then merged his actual soul into the loop soul.

No, if you re-read chapter 55, you'll see that this isn't the case. The Guardian explained that the Controller is /not/ a copy, and that is why it's OK for him (or her) to leave the loop: there is an empty body waiting for the Guardian to re-anchor the original soul.
