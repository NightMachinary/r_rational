I'm not saying that Zach is a copy, I'm just saying that his soul *was* copied, just like everything else in the world was copied, and then his soul from outside the loop was merged into it.

Nothing the Guardian said seemed to exclude that possibility.

  "Because only the Controller has their real soul pulled into the time loop," the Guardian said. "Everyone else is a copy. For a Controller of the loop to leave, I only have to re-anchor their soul back to their original body. For one of the copies to enter the real world, I would have to switch their soul with the soul of the original. This would effectively kill the original."

Hell, there could even be a function of the Marker that allows the fusion of souls, instead of the Guardian doing anything itself.
