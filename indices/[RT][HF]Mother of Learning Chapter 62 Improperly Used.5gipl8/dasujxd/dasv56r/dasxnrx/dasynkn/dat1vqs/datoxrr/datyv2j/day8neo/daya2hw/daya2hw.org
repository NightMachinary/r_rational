Alternatively, the Guardian doesn't have the ability to merge the souls, but the Marker itself does. The Guardian really can't do anything with the copies' souls besides swapping them out. After some thought, I think it makes more sense for Marker to have that ability, since it is constructed deeply into the soul.

Also, the Marker itself must modify the world template in regards to the Controller's soul, similar to the "soulkill" function, that would explain why Zorian isn't constantly placed into a body that already has a soul in it at the beginning of each loop. Not especially relevant to this, outside of supporting the argument that the Guardian never actually takes a soul out a body to put it "nowhere", or modifies the template itself to delete the initial Controller's (Zach's) soul.

And I think Zorian will have a huge headache after leaving the loop, since his soul has accumulated a bunch of experiences inside the loop, merging it with his original soul would probably be a lot worse than for a Controller's soul entering the loop. He might want to stay away from any enhancement rituals while inside the loop as well.
