Er...it seems to me like this theory is ignoring the plain meaning of the Guardian's statement ("the Controller has their real soul pulled into the time loop. Everyone else is a copy."), and replacing it with an idea ("his soul was copied, just like everything else in the world was copied, and then his soul from outside the loop was merged into it") that is unsupported by evidence.
