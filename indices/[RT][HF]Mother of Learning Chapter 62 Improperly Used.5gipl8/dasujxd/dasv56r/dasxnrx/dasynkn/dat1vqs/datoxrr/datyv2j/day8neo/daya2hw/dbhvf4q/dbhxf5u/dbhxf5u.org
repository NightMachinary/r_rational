I'm not sure if that should be the responsibility of the Guardian or the Marker itself.

Is the Guardian really responsible for overseeing template and its copies? Its title is "Guardian of the Threshold" after all, I'm not sure it has any duties besides the answering some questions, overseeing the connection between the Sovereign's Gate and the real world, and transferring the Controller's soul at the beginning and end of the loop.

Stopping the soul duplication at the beginning of the loop might be a function of the Marker, or the temporary marker in the case of anyone the Controller brings in.
