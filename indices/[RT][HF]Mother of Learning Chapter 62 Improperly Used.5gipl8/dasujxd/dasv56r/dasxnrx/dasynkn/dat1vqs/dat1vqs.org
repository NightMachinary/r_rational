I think it's easier for the Sovereign's Gate to just copy everything, including the Controller's soul. There's no reason for it exclude it, since it could just get overwritten or combined with the real world soul, depending on the mechanism of transfer from the real world and insertion of the original soul into the loop. And in this case, I'm assuming combination instead of an overwrite. Why not give the Controller one more advantage while they're inside the world of the Sovereign's Gate?

If the souls are combined, it neatly explains Zach's comment about his actual natural reserves (50 magnitude) vs his natural shaping skills (25 magnitude) this chapter.

If Zach is anything like Zorian, he probably didn't have a good grasp on the size of his reserves before this year. Zorian was a better student, and he didn't seem that aware of what his natural reserves were, or how the maximum increases after years of usage. So I don't think Zach actually knew what his reserves were before the loop. He's not particularly clear about it in his conversation with Zorian this chapter.

I think it makes more sense than Zach's reserves being some heretofore unknown bloodline ability of the Noveda family. Bloodline abilities seem to just that: "abilities". Not much like a doubling of mana reserves.
