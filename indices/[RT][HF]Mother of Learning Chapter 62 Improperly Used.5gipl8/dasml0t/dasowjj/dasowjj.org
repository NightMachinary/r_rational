  Unless the mana limit applies to kids too.

Of course it does. The reason for the mana cost is because the abilities need mana to function. If you expend all of your mana reserves on abilities, you've effectively given up all possibility of generic spellcasting in favor of a fixed set of abilities. And your children will inherit that choice.

And if they happen to have smaller mana reserves than you, they'll probably die in the womb.
