  Depending on the sophistication of the enhancement ritual, the quality of the materials used in the procedure and the skill of the mage conducting it, the enhancement could either cost you half of your maximum mana reserves or a mere tenth of it.

Say a particular enhancement might cost a particular mage half of their mana pool, with better conditions, it might only cost a tenth. For Zach, however, it'd likely only cost a twentieth, but with better materials a mere eightieth.
