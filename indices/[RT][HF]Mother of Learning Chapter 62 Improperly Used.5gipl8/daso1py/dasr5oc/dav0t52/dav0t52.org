I think that you may be exactly right about how a lich works. I remember an earlier part of the story, where the alchemist made Zorian the coin to destory the lich, he said that the lich's soul would return to the tether. Meaning that if a soul was anchored somewhere else it might be possible to make a simulacrum that acted as the real body.
