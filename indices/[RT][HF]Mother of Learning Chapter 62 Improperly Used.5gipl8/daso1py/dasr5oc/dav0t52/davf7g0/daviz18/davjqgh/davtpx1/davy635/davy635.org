Actually I was referring to the phylactery, which is not exactly a fallback; it's the main anchor. Connecting your soul to a mobile body is highly desirable, but connecting it firmly to the phylactery is essential.

Given that the Ibasans hero-worship QI, I expect that his phylactery is somewhere extremely secure.
