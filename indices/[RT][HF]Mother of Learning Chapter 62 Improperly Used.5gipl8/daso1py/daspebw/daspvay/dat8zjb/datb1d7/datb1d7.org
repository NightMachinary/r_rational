  Spear of Resolve seemed to have found a way to turn part of her mind into a magical calculator, could somehow temporarily separate her mind into multiple parallel threads of thought and could integrate perceptions of multiple araneas into a unified, coherent whole. And that was just the stuff he could figure out in the short time he had been given.

Considering he hasn't even done the more simple mind modifications mentioned in chapter 54, he seems to be pretty far behind when it comes to the Aranea. Maybe when he opens the secret door in the Cyorian Aranean Treasury, he'll get some useful information like integration of perceptions which could help with simulacra.
