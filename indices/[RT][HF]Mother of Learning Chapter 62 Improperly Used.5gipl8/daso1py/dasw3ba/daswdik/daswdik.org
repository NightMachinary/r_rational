Well, it's not as powerful as that. Zorian's mana reserves are small, so he wouldn't be able to make many, and Zach (even after he develops enough of a soul sense) isn't psychic, so he wouldn't be able to retrieve information from them except by having them return in person. Also simulacra can become too independent if you keep them for very long, so you have to re-cast it, further increasing the mana investment needed, and they won't do things you dislike.

But it's definitely a big opportunity for Zorian.
