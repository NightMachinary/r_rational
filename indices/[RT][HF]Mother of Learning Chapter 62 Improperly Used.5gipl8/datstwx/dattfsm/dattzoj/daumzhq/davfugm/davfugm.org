  Self-casting items like blasting rods don't actually store mana iirc, they just channel whatever ambient mana is around.

Then why would he need five of them? If they just use ambient mana directly, without storing it, wouldn't one be sufficient?

My guess is they either fill up a reservoir with ambient mana over time, or use mana crystals.
