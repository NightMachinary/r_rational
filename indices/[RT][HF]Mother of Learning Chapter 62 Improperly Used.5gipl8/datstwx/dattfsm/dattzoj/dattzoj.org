  But what makes you think simulacra need ambient mana?
#+end_quote

Ugh. I conflated the bit about magically enhanced beings needed ambient mana (or reserves) to survive with the simulacrum. I should have gone back to double check before posting--my bad.

I knew the simulacrum had to draw from the caster's mana pool to cast spells, but thought I had read that they could absorb ambien mana to pay for their upkeep, and possibly spells.

Now I'm not sure they can use ambient mana at all. You might /need/ a soul to do that. Well, to share with a human anyway. People can't just use ambient mana--absorbing it without converting it first is harmful.

/However/, I'm pretty sure Zorian has created devices that cast using stored reserves of ambient mana. They /could/ have used crystallized mana, but I thought there were ones that basically just had a storage chamber of some sort.

He used them for defense in one of the invasions of Cyoria, IIRC, but I'm not terribly confident in my memory after my earlier mistake. I'll re-read to look for it after Finals week, I guess.
