Actually, this gave me an idea. The damage affects the body and mind, but not, I think, the soul. So a simulacrum using it shouldn't, in theory, poison real!Zorian.

Of course, it's a very bad idea to have an insane simulacrum running around sharing your skills, your mana pool, and your face. So this would only be helpful when the simulacrum is about to be dispelled or the loop reset.
