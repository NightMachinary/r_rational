I actually speculated on this elsewhere in the thread. But what makes you think simulacra /need/ ambient mana? They are tied to the caster's mana pool and can cast spells from it.

If they can assimilate ambient mana, though, then we can be pretty sure that the potential rate of assimilation (which can fill a mage from empty within hours) exceeds the maintenance cost (because simulacra can be maintained for days).
