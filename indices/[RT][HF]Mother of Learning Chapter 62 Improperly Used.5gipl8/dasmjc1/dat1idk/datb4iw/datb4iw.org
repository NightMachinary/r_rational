I'd like to see where you're drawing the conclusion that realworld!Zach is physically touching the Gate. We don't even know if Zach is the original looper, though it seems likely. But even if he is, the loop mechanics imply nothing of the sort. The only thing we can reasonably assume is that realworld!Zach (if he is indeed the original gate user) has a marker on his soul and that /someone/ activated the Gate and we know there are some agents (angels, most likely) that have that power. As for the looper, nothing is needed besides the marker itself.

Unlike any other cases, the simulacrum has /exactly/ one month to and one attempt to rebel, subdue Zach, /craft himself a soul/ and get himself a copy marker, then erase Zach's soul magic skills (remember, Zach /can not/ cast the spell, he'll need more lessons from Alanic). That's just too complex for my taste.

The competing theory that Zach being a careless goof that he is, told a high ranking cultist about time loop and paid dearly for it is much simpler. Cultists are necromancers check, cultists dabble in mind magic check (the want to subdue a primordial!), cultists are in secret high ranking officials check, Zach told multiple higher ups about the invasion check.
