There are a few ways I could see a time-looping simulacrum, and after this chapter I'm back to thinking that is what's going on. It depends on stuff like how hard it is to change your "starting point" in the loop (Zach's real body is touching the Gate but his loop-self wakes up in bed, so it's possible), if simulacrums have read-write access to the shared soul, how hard it is to duplicate a soul and other minor quirks of how the Gate handles edge cases.

But the real important stuff here is the information about simulacrum being half of what's needed to become a lich. Between that, comments made about spirits and the one time we've seen a simulacrum burst, I'm pretty sure you can transfer your soul into one, effectively making it your "prime body" instead of having it be a spin-off self. So long as Zorian can reach the point where he can cast simulacrum as a soul (thanks to endless shaping exercises) and keep his soul from passing on for a few seconds (not yet, but with further out-of-body practise...) he has a solution to his lack of a body when escaping the time loop.
