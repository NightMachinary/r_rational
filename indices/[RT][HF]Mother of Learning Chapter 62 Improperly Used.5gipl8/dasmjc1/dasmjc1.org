I guess simulacrums having no souls means an end for /Red Robe is Zach's rebellious simulacrum/ theory. Even though simulacrums can rebel, no soul = no looping.

Unless it wasn't a real simulacrum but rather one of those fake spells Alanic mentioned.

Now that the rules of blood magic are outlined it doesn't seem that OP. No stealing bloodlines, and no chance to hijack the time loop marker either. Booooooooring. Well, not boring, but... Not OP, 3/10 would not recommend using unless you want to /start/ a new bloodline.

Also as I understand it is implied that Zach had enormous mana reserves even before the loop and it's not Noved bloodline (he makes a convincing argument). However if the effects of Noveda bloodline are distributed between members of his house, Zach's argument turns against him. Novedas weren't freakishly powerful mana-wise because they enjoyed only a moderate boost when there were even 10 of them. Concentrate that for the sole heir of the house and boom! Huge mana reserve. Buuuut bloodlines probably don't work like that.
