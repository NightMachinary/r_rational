Irrelevant. No matter what you do to a non-Controller soul, it gets thrown away at the end of the month and a new one is created from the template.

And if you're saying that a simulacrum devised a way to replicate Zach's marker, well, it would have all the same problems as any other suspect, plus it would mean that Zach /must/ have previously known a lot of mind magic and soul magic.
