  I guess simulacrums having no souls means an end for Red Robe is Zach's rebellious simulacrum theory. Even though simulacrums can rebel, no soul = no looping.

I'm thinking the opposite. I had never considered (or heard of) this theory before now, and this chapter made it feel as if it was being hammered into my head.

I think the reason for Zach's large mana reserves is because he had/has a long-term simulacrum using his mana. Note how he mentions that he has exactly twice the mana his shaping skills would suggest.

Also, note that since Red Robe has no soul of his own, the search spell Zorian cast would naturally only find Zach.

I don't think there's any doubt Zach would summon a long-term simulacrum - he clearly hadn't considered the dangers this time around, he wouldn't do so before. And the soul/looping issue is something he would have to solve in order to make a truly long-term companion for his looping, anyway.

I'm now thinking it very likely indeed that Red Robe is Zach's simulacrum that wiped his memory. Though questions as to the exact mechanisms of how it intends to escape the time loop remain, of course.
