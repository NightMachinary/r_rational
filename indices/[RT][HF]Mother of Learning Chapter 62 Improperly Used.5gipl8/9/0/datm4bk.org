I think it's the chapter that really kills this theory, not reinforces it.

No soul = no looping. No other magical spell or effect persists through the resets, so UNLESS there is some narrativium injection, neither should simulacrums. In other words, Zach and Zorian will have to recast simulacrums each month. Your theory means that Zach (who is presently /unable/ to cast it) mastered soul awareness, mastered and cast the spell, creating a simulacrum that successfully rebelled within one month, mind wiped Zach, skill wiped Zach, and gained a soul and a marker to not be erased by the loop. That's a tall order, especially that only perfect simulacrums rival their masters, and it doesn't seem that Zach was dabbling in mind magic to begin with.

The competing theories are way less complex.
