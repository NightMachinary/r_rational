Is anyone else thinking about all the possible foreshadowing with the simulacrum?

I mean e.g. If the simulacrum turned on Zorian at the very end, how much doubt could that instill in Zach? I can just picture him going paranoid, and Zorian getting really uncomfortable with his own status as an ensouled copy.

And while I'm on that track, I keep expecting Zorian to try and pull some sort of soul/mind magic trickery to get past the guardian and with the simulacrum spell being the basis for being a Lich? Sneaking past the guardian and then body snatching something/Someone in the real world becomes a real possibility.
