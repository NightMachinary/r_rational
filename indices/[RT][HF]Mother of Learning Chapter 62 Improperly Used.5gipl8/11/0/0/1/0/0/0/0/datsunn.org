Well, for further evidence: if creating an ectoplasmic simulacrum body is halfway to creating a lich body, then it seems probable that the connection between simulacrum and soul resembles the connection between lich and soul. And the author has stated on his blog that there is no loss of power by becoming a lich, so surely liches can assimilate ambient mana.

Of course, if having an army of mana-assimilating simulacra was not anticipated and would be a story-breaker, then it would be reasonable for the author to declare that the simulacrum connection is more limited than the lich connection and only allows one-way mana flow. But at this point we've been given no reason to think so.
