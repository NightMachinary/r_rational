If I were a simulacrum of Zorian, give me some stuff to spell formulas to work on, a bunch of food, a decent chair, and a wide table, and I'd definitely hang out at a mana well all day so Original!Zorian could battle the main guys for a bit.

Just promise me you'll come back and steal all my memories so I'm not working for nothing. I would be totally fine dying after that because, in all the important ways, I wouldn't really be dying.
