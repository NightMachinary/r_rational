It makes more sense if you think of things in terms of programming, particularly in terms of scope and controlling mutability. What that means is that some spells create a mind that can write information onto the soul, whereas others do not.

*Magic Brain (a la Alanic)*

This spell is specifically designed to create a single mind that can write information to the soul. Alanic had to cast the spell in such an isolated environment---indeed, even isolated from light---and this spell may be one reason why. This would mean the spell is very difficult, dangerous, and fragile.

*Simulacrum*

(We know that simulacra share mana, but not memories, so their mechanism is likely different. This may be because mana is more or less a binary thing---do you have enough or don't you---whereas memories are more complicated. This discussion is aimed at how memory information is dealt with rather than mana information.)

Simulacrum is designed to work with at least two concurrent minds. The mind reads and writes information to the soul. With two minds, this back and forth process can get complicated and may create conflicts. (This is a headache familiar to programmers who program for multiple cores when they allow for mutability.)

For example, what if one mind improves shaping and the other mind improves mana capacity (which limits shaping ability) and then the soul tries to read that information? The result would be a conflict. One solution is a complicated set of rules, perhaps with bugs or loopholes, for how and when to mutate information from the minds. Another solution which eliminates /all/ of that complexity is to not have the simulacrum change the soul at all.

Also, taking into account the magic brain spell Alanic used, there may be a source of difficulty other than the information safety problems I mentioned above. It may simply be very hard to make a mind that can has write access to the soul, and that's why Alanic needed a special ritual that was isolated from the rest of the world. Those kinds of connections may be more delicate, which might limit the usefulness of a simulacrum spell.

Aside: Alanic said that half of becoming a lich is learning the simulacrum spell. In other words, it's a spell that allows the user to give a separate brain access to your soul's mana pool. Perhaps another piece of the puzzle for the lich ritual involves giving that mind access to the soul's information storage as well. I would guess there is a lot of additional modification to the spells that needs to be done as well . . .

The other issue with the simulacrum having continuous read/write access to the soul is that the minds of both the caster and their simulacrum would have to deal with two sets of sensory input. If memory serves me, even Zorian struggles to actively control of his own body /and/ get sensory input from another body. Usually, he has to concentrate to see through the eyes of another being and he able to use mind magic to filter the information. If both a caster and their simulacrum were getting straight information dumps, it might be harder to focus, which would make the spell more difficult to use.

It would still be nice to get an information dump when a simulacrum passed away, and that might be a possible modification of the spell (I can see that feature being important to a lich), but that would also be a dangerous feature. Say you're in a battle and your simulacrum is eviscerated and you suddenly get a day's worth of memories plus a ton of pain dumped into your brain. The distraction might give the enemy the chance to kill you.

*The Gate*

I'm guessing the Gate creates a normal connection between the souls it creates and the minds they work with. Souls that are marked get shunted into the new pocket universe and are connected to the new mind. When the Gate finally deactivates, the soul is reconnected with the original mind.

I wonder if [[/u/nobody103]] has any insights he can divulge at this point in the story . . .
