If a simulacrum didn't have the ability to lay down new memories, then it wouldn't be able to become independent and go rogue.

And if it has read-only access to the caster's memory storage, then it ought to be able to pick up everything the caster is experiencing in real time.

I wouldn't expect a memory dump from a destroyed simulacrum. I might expect its memories to continuously appear while it exists, so you wouldn't have extra sensory input, but if you think back, you realise you have two sets of experiences.
