So... this seems to me like an anomaly.

It's clear that in MoL-verse, minds and souls have separate existences. You can have mindless undead powered by enslaved souls; Alanic had to create a magical brain in order for Zorian to retain self-awareness while disembodied; and now we've established that you can have multiple independent minds attached to the same soul.

So.../how does the Gate maintain continuity of the Controllers' minds/, if all it retains is the soul? (Remember that the Guardian didn't seem to have any awareness of Red Robe as an individual; it only pays attention to the soul marker.)

Is it simply because their souls contain all of their memories, so they're actually newly-created minds, but running on all the old data? If so, then why aren't simulacrum memories likewise imprinted on the soul? The author has explicitly stated that simulacra are /not/ automatically reintegrated with the caster; but if the soul contains a record of everything the attached mind has experienced, how can that be true?

Especially since we are told that simulacra resemble liches, and surely when a lich's magical brain is destroyed, and its soul snaps back to the phylactery, it will remember what happened to that brain.
