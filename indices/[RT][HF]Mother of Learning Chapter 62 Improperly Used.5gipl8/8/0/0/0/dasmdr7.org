Zach's spent most of his time all over the world, finding all sorts of interesting things to do and try. Even Zorian's gone many places and met many people along the time loop.

The black rooms are just ...rooms. There's nothing in them except each other and, for the most part, books. For Zach, who's not fond of reading, there's basically nothing interesting at all to do. Even for Zorian, though, you can only do so much reading before you start itching to go do something else. And in this room, there is nothing else.
