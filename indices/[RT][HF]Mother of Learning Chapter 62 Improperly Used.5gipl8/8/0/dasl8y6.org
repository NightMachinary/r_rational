They are already at maximum dilation for current technology. The only way to get more time is if they get access to black rooms elsewhere on the continent or build their own. It would also be possible to increase the dilation if they made a pocket dimension, but that might get a bit wonky within the loop's mechanics. Kind of like a space bag inside a space bag.

Probably not good for their sanity if they use it too many times though.
