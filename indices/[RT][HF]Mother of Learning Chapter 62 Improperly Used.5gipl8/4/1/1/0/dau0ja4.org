  soul magic having no effect on simulacrums (because simulacrums lack souls)

Actually we don't know that.

In terms of moral weight, simulacra don't have /their own/ souls, so they don't count as human beings. But in terms of magical effects, they are connected to the caster's soul, so any soul magic targeted at them might very well hit Zorian.
