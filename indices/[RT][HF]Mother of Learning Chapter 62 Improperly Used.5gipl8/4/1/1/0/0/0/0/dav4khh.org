Oh, sorry, I managed to miss that he made one, or I probably would have picked up on that. It's interesting to know that that's his view, though. Maybe it means that simulacra are P-zombies after all. It could be the religious order's dogmatic position I suppose, but the priests Zorian has met and Alanic in particular have generally been right about things so far. And in a world where people have souls and can have experiences independent of their bodies, I suppose the theory that soulless minds aren't really conscious becomes much stronger. I'm interested to see what happens with this.
