| I doubt he's quite that skilled.

Yes, /but/, remember when he was attacking all those people in order to get practice reading memories, and why that was hard? How much easier will it be if they're his own memories - and will that be an effective form of practice?

There's part of me that's expecting him to keep a sub-mind for the simalcrum, as some further evolution on the memory packet, which eventually gets built up into a cheese way to both loop more people with them, and to get those people out of the loop.

AFAIK, if he can pull off full sub-mind storage and injection, then the only thing they couldn't carry out of the timeline "in" Zorian would be the soul growth (mana reserves, etc); but, "two is a silly number" - if they can get even one person out after Red Robe, stands to reason they could get two (or more).
