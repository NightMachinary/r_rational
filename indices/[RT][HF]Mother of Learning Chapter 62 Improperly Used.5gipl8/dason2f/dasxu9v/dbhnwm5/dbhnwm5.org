Multiple simulacra probably do not increase the amount of mana that can be assimilated. I think [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/12/13/basics-of-magic-mana/][nobody103 mentioned this in the comments on the world-building page]].

Imagine that a body has a virtual pipe that attaches to the soul. A simulucrum has its own pipe. If Z is Zorian and S is his simulacrum, then . . .

#+begin_example
  Z   S
  ╚═╦═╝
    ║
    ║ The width of the pipe HERE determines mana regen rate.
   Soul
#+end_example

If the above diagram is a good metaphor for how this works, a simulacrum sitting at the bottom of the mana well would increase mana regeneration to Zorian in a mana-poor environment. However, this mana regeneration rate would still be Zorian's natural maximum rate.
