  one that sanitizes natural mana for spellcasting use

Hang on, can a /simulacrum/ do that? It's linked to the same soul, and has essentially the same skills, so I would think it can?

And...we know that there is a running mana cost to maintain a simulacrum, but we also know that it's not large, because it's possible (however inadvisable) to maintain a simulacrum for days. Whereas a mage in Cyoria can fill up his/her reserves in a few hours, even less with concentration and the right technique (which Xvim taught to Zorian).

So a simulacrum in an area with plenty of ambient mana could in theory represent a net mana /gain/...which means that the only obstacle to using multiple simulacra would be the politics...and with enough of them, you could assimilate ambient mana as fast as you could expend it...

Am I missing something here?
