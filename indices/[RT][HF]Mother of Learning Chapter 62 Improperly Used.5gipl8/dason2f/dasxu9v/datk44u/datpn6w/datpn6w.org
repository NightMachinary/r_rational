Actually, Alanic said that the simulacrum is tied to the /caster's/ soul, which is why it can cast spells.

And we know that it's possible to increase the assimilation rate with the right focus. Xvim taught Zorian that.

So, a simulacrum sitting in the Hole and meditating should represent a net mana gain.

Or, if it objects to that idea on the grounds that it's boring, Zorian can do the meditating himself and send the simulacrum out to do the dangerous work. Or they can take shifts.
