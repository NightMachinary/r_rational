Simulacra are definitely attached to the caster's mana pool, which is part of the soul. They use it to cast spells. If they can draw from it, why wouldn't they be able to fill it?

They don't have their own souls, and their dispersal doesn't release a soul (so priests don't count it as a human death), but their connection to the caster's soul seems not unlike the caster's own connection. They just have more tenuous bodies, maintained by mana, that's all.
