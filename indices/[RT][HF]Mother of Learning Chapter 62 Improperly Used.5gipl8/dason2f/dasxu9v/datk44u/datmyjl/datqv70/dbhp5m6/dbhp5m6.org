And if Zach, Alanic, and Xvim can learn simulacrum, then they could have several copies simultaneously collect the Gate keys in a very short period.

1. Each team teleports to the location near the key.
2. They all rest up to regain all the mana.
3. If they have enough mana to get two or more keys simultaneously, then great. Otherwise, they do short rests in between attempts, allowing for each person's soul to regenerate to full. It would still allow them to get all the keys in one day and with minimal rests due to casting teleport five times.

They could just forgo the simulacrums and teleport between each site, however seeing how the Royal guards tracked Zorian and Zach, using simulacrum to steal the artifact, hide it somewhere, and then die might be safer.
