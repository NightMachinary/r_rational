If magical creatures can sustain themselves with ambient mana, why can't mages? Or if mages CAN sustain enhancements with ambient mana, why can't they safely cast spells with it?

Is it possible to construct an enhancement that runs on natural mana, or better yet one that sanitizes natural mana for spellcasting use?
