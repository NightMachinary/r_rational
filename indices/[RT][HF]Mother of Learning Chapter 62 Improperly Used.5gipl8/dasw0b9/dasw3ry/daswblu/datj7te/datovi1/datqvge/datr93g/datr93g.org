Simulacra are not shadow clones. Zorian doesn't get automatic personality reintegration when they disperse. If he did, then sure, that would be highly efficient (and OP). But given the actual magic system, where you have to ask specific questions to probe someone, it's faster and more reliable to just let them talk.

Mind magic would make the process more effective by reading surface thoughts and emotions, but not by deep probing.
