Well, the simulcrum spell may actually give them a way out of the pocket reality they are in. If they can create simulcrums outside of the time loop (or send them out souless), then transfer their souls to the simulcrums, that is a plausible way of getting bodies in the physical reality outside. It may cause some security concerns for the people running the Dungeon facility though. ;)
