ehhh...i can kinda see it, but i mean, if no one else understands what they've been going through for so much of their lives with this time loop business except each other...and if when they leave the time loop they still look like fifteen year olds rather than their true ages...

Well, if there is literally nobody else in the world who is in their league, and they have no other options, then of course they're going to end up together. But seriously, having no other options but each other isn't romantic, just sad. After all, there's always the chance that one or both of them are straight, and in that case they really will be alone for a very long time.
