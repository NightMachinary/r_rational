Not quite a typo, but this is the third chapter where the word 'simulacrums' has been used (chapters 51 and 57 are the other ones). I wince every time I read it.

(Of course, nobody103 is welcome to use whatever plural he wishes for one of his spells, but IRL it's definitely a non-standard alternative to 'simulacra'.)
