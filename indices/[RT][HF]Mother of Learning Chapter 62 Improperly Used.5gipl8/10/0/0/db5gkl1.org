[[http://i.imgur.com/Pi74gS0.png][Plurals]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacrum#Word_usage][Simulacrum]]

The alternative doesn't really matter when you use native plurals; people are used to them and they're generally preferable. Cf. [[http://i.imgur.com/lURE5iB.png?1][Merriam-Webster's dictionary]].

EDIT: Not that're you're wrong---/simulacra/ *is* the preferred plural, it's just that I thought this was worth the clarification. This is also evident by how /simulacrums/ was on second place in the dictionary; generally, the preferred form gets the first place while honorable mentions get +to suck a dick+ second place.
