I am pretty sure the narration was translating the issue into amounts relative to his mana pool because we haven't seen absolute quantities for mana costs the way e.g. /The Waves Arisen/ has.

Furthermore, that segment comes on the heels of this:

#+begin_quote
  Every magical creature needed a certain amount of ambient mana just to stay alive and fuel their magical abilities. The more powerful they were, the higher the ambient mana levels had to be to support them. Stepping into an area too thin in ambient mana to support them wouldn't immediately kill them, but they would find themselves quickly weakening and wasting away. This was the main reason why powerful monsters from the deeper levels of the Dungeon didn't overrun everything -- they would effectively starve to death outside their home areas.

  A human, regardless of the manner in which they acquired their magical abilities, also had to pay the price to maintain their existence. A portion of their mana reserves was effectively lost, permanently tied down in the maintenance of the magical enhancement. Their mana reserves maximum would be permanently lowered.

The cost for magical creatures is flat. The cost for humans is explicitly compared to that. So I read the cost for humans to maintain enhancements as also being flat, just subtracted from their mana cap, and depending on how large your mana cap /is/, that could range from a minor annoyance to a massive hobble. Since Zorian has below-average mana cap, he's interested in eking as much efficiency out of the ritual as possible.
