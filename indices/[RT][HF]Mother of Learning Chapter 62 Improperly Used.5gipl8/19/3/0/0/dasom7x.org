I don't follow your logic. Hypothetically, after performing a blood magic enhancement ritual, a portion of your mana is now locked away in maintaining this enhancement. Of your children that do inherit this enhancement, a portion of their mana will also be locked away in the maintenance of the now hereditary ability.

By locking away 99% of your mana reserves you are essentially fucking over your children that do inherit your abilities, if they ever so decide on becoming a mage.
