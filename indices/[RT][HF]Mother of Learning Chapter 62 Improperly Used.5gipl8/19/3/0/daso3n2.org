Theoretically I agree with your first comment, and I'd like to think that if I was cloned or had my own simulacrum-maker that I would be willing to throw my life at their feet. But I think that once you check for your soul and find it absent it might be harder to come to stock with the fact that your life is now forfeit than you first thought.

So yeah, no risk if you do have that philosophy but no way to test the reality without risking it. I guess you have to clone yourself, give your clone a gun in a sealed room, and tell them to kill themselves.

  Also, it would not make sense for mana consumption to simply disappear just because of a hereditary trait.

I agree but then I'd expect more bloodline traits. You only need one pair of parents to give up 99% of their mana and their children will have an enormous advantage.
