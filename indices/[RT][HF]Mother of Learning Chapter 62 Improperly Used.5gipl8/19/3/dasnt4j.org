If you developed a habit of checking whether or not your soul is anchored in your physical body, the simulacrum issue can be avoided provided that you have a firm belief that your personal identity is tied directly to your original body. This way, when you create a simulacrum, because it is a reflection of yourself, it will also periodically check whether or not it has a soul. Once it finds out it does not have a soul anchored to its body, it would realize that the best course of action is to better the original body because it also believes in the views on personal identity as the caster.

So in limited cases, the simulacrum could work without risk. The former criterion can be developed easily, but the latter is much harder because it requires one to have a certain philosophy which is arguably harder to change/develop.

Also, it would not make sense for mana consumption to simply disappear just because of a hereditary trait.
