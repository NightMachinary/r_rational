If the simulacrum has Zorian's abilities, then it should also get his soul sense. If so, then it would immediately realize that it has no souls.

Although it might create an existential crisis for him, he should also have all of Zorian's memories, therefore leading it to accept the reason why it was created.

We'll just have to wait and see how rational and detached the author decides to make Zorian's simulacrums.
