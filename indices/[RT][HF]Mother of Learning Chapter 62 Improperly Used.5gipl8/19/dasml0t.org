  It was a heavy price to pay, especially for a mage already suffering from below average mana reserves, such as Zorian. Mages interested in magical enhancements had to think very carefully about whether a particular enhancement was worth the price they would pay for it.

Why would it be a proportional system? If it's used to sustain it then it should just be however much mana it needs so that Zach could get lots of enhancements.

Also the whole blood line thing, why not once you're old or about to have kids if you're a woman, enchant your blood line to the max (diminishing returns means you'll always have some mana left anyway 10% of 10% of 10%... is never zero) and then have a bunch of kids? And then those kids do the same thing.

Unless the mana limit applies to kids too.

Also if demons just value life force why not use non sapient or evil magical creatures in the summoning rituals, or stock up your life force like you'd give blood. You could carry life force crystals like mana crystals no?

Also the simulacrum sounds incredibly dangerous. Would you be ok being bossed around by someone who claimed to be yourself? You know you're the real version, but this other person who looks like you is telling you to do what they say. Alaric's right and makes me really surprised it works with Liches because who is more independent than Liches. You really need a real desire to kill yourself to save yourself. Since every simulacrum knows their life is forfeit from the moment they're born. They won't get the pleasure of knowing that they will revive in another time loop. Even ignoring that if you were intending to end the spell in a day then they know they only have a day to live unless they can change your mind.
