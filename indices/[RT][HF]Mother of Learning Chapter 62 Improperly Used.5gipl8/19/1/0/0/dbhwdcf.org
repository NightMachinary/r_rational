Wouldn't this become noticeable, though, as your reserves grow? Someone on DarkLordPotter pointed that out. If your magnitude would be, say, 15, but you have magical enhancements consuming 5 Magic Missile units (1), then wouldn't your reserves eventually grow to 55? Which you might notice if you were expecting 40.

(1) Not to be confused with Mibi Missile units, an attempt to standardize usage in a way that takes efficiency into account.
