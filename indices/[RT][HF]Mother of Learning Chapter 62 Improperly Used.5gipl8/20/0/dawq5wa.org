Having previously soul killed a cultist /would/ make for a remarkably straightforward way to acquire a robe. Just show up where his body is and take it off him. It is clean and doesn't require the cult to have previously let a volatile candidate breach their inner circle.

The problem with that theory is that Veyers was willing to work with the invasion for so long. Working in close proximity to so many "real" red robes seems like an oddly volatile path to try to manage.
