I mean, does it have to be an extensive answer? Could just be a paragraph of backstory explaining the dungeon and how monsters come out of it.

There's probably some hint of truth in that mythology, like instead of veins its just the complex/storage/prison building that houses the remains of the dragon and instead of heart flakes its just some hyper intense ambient mana surrounding the remains mutating whatever comes near it or something.
