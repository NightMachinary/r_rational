I believe the Sovereign Gate actually creates and destroys souls.

To be honest, I was banking against this possibility from the start, but the author went in that direction. I'm not saying it's a bad direction---it just wasn't my pet theory because the alternatives created interesting complexity to the mechanics of the Sovereign Gate, meanwhile preserving the indestructibility of the soul, which I liked for some reason.
