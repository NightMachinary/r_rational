  What would original Zach do when he found out that only one person would be making it out of the time loop, and it wasn't him?
#+end_quote

His reaction might be that both people should find a way out. But if one of those people were a simulacrum, my guess is most people would probably not value the "right to life" of the simulacrum.

Red Robe as Zac's simulacrum is a possibility if there is some way to get a semblance of a soul. I still feel simulacrum!Zac would be pretty genial, but it's possible he might have, for example, incorporated the soul of Veyers somehow, leaving him somehow unhinged.

The main issue is that simulacrum!Zac has only one loop to get a soul and a marker. However, the original looper can add people to the loop, and would know the other functions of the Sovereign Gate. This knowledge might have been enough to allow simulacrum!Zac to make himself a looper.

- Zac creates a simulacrum.
- Zac and Simulacrum find him a soul somehow.
- Simulacrum marks its soul for temporary looping.
- Simulcarum makes the mark permanent.

With Zac's prestige and power, simulacrum!Zac may have been able to swing all this.
