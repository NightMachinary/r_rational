Hm, in hindsight I think I made the assumption from chapter 46:

#+begin_quote
  In fact, [Zorian's magic missile] was so mana-efficient at this point that it was playing merry hell with his ability to judge how far his mana reserves had grown. He could cast about 35 of them in quick succession, which was more than four times the amount he could cast before the time loop -- that shouldn't be possible, especially since he was sure his mana reserves still hadn't topped out yet, so the most logical conclusion was that his magic missiles required significantly less mana now than they had in the past.
#+end_quote

I noted the flawed logic ("I can cast 4× more MM than I could, therefore they must be 4× more efficient than they were") and assumed that at least part of the disparity was from an increase in mana capacity.

I don't recall the story contradicting that in later chapters---it largely veered away from hard numbers about his capacity---but I admit that I'd forgotten my initial reasoning for my conclusion, which led to me thinking it was justified in the text itself.

Frankly, if there is such an extraordinary variance in the efficiency of magic missile then its use as a basis for an objective ranking for capacity is minimal, as Zorian himself noted. If that's truly the best method then we can't be sure that Zach is magnitude 50 either; though his missiles are at the very least far less efficient than Zorian's, they may still be more efficient than the average mage (and the fact that shaping skills, tied indirectly to efficiency, are related to capacity further compounds the issue).
