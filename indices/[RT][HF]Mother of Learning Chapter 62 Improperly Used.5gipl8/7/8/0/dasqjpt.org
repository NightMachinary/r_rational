  grew to hate zach enough to try to end the loop

That doesn't fit RR's actions. He overpowered Zach once in front of Zorian, but didn't bother doing him any lasting harm, just obtained some information and went off to deal with (what he thought was) his competition for exploiting the loop. So, he cared about looping, and didn't care much about Zach.
