As far as we know, Zorian is the only natural mind mage in his immediate family. Not his father, not his mother (who is most likely to have passed on the ability to Zorian), not Kirielle, and not Fortov. The only other potential candidate that could have it in his family would be Daimen and his grandmother, but we've yet to meet either of them inside the time loop.

So even if the outrageous mana reserves were a Noveda bloodline ability, it's entirely possible that it could be only randomly occurring one like Zorian's, and that the dormant version is either a very slight increased reserve, or completely imperceptible one that would be contained within the normally occurring variance in reserves.
