What if the noveda bloodline is getting the mana reserve "from" somewhere? Like saying "half of this dragon/demigod/artifacts mana is redirected to all living members of the noveda bloodline". That would explain how the mana capacity is paid for, and why it concentrates when the family dies off.

If he is blood linked to get his mana from another human family, like a nonmagical servant family, that could explain red robe getting mistaken by the guardian. The blood links two mage families together by blood, making one nonmagical and one supermagical. By infiltrating that link, one could pass as being that person to a non sentient guardian. Though I am less confident of this secondary theory.
