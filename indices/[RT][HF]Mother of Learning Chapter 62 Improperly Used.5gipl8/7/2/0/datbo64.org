Well that sort of external battery that Novedas share access to was more or less the idea, yeah. But that sounds more like some divine blessing rather than a bloodline that is more inherent to genetics: someone other than Novedas is responsible for creation and maintnance of that battery. Similarly, someone could destroy the source and Novedas would lose power even without formally losing access. So I wouldn't call it a bloodline, more like house blessing.

edit: buuut then Novedas were in possession of a truly unique artifact probably of divine origins. Maybe their house /was/ given some divine favors.
