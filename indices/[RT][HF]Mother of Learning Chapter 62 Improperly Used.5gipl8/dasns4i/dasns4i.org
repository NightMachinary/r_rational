My somewhat discarded [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4d88fl/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_51_out_of_control/d1omer4/][theory]] of red robe being a rogue simulacrum of some sort has come back full-force. What are the chances that Zach's simulacrum mind wiped Zach of knowledge of himself and then possessed Veyers' body?

As is, Veyers is IMO not a particularly compelling antagonist. That could change as we learn more about him, I suppose, but having Zach's "evil twin" be the true arch-nemesis would be way more interesting. Especially if actual Zach has some kind of sleeper agent thing going on, which would explain the really odd ignorance he has of a time traveller's few vulnerabilities early on in the story, when Zorian was still playing possum.
