New Memories: The simulacrum can lay down new memories in its mind, but does not write those memories to the soul.

Read-only Access: In reality, it doesn't have read-access---it's just duplicating the caster's mind and the information contained therein at the time of casting. In other words, it's second-hand read-access.

Memory Updating: I think that if sensory input from the simulacrum are converted to memories in its magic brain then transferred to the soul, this would update the sensory input for the original caster. I can see what you're saying, but I feel you'd need a filter to prevent the simulacrum's sensory input from arriving continuously in the caster's mind.

Either way, we know from the story that the simulacrum spell copies the mind at the time of casting and does not at any time transfer mnemonic information to the soul.

When programming and you make a copy of something, it's useful to be able to modify that copy and not have the original also change (call-by-value). You can have the copy point to the original as well (call-by-reference), but it can create issues. Both have their place, and I wouldn't be surprised if the lich ritual involves modifying the simulacrum spell to work like a call-by-reference.
