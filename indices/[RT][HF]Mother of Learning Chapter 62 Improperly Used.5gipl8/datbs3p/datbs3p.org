This entire Red Robe situation would be much clearer if we had gotten a better update on the investigation of the 15 inner cult members. Unless Red Robe had previously found an unguarded red robe, it is highly likely that Red Robe is an inner cult member considering the fact that he showed up almost immediately in a restart attacking a sleeping Zach.

Of course, there are two situations I can think of which would allow Red Robe easy access to a red robe. The first being a red robe guarded by wards that Red Robe had previously learned how to disarm effortlessly (the owner of the robe is away) and the second being an inner cult member who was erased from the template (like the Cyorian Aranea) which would allow for easy access to a "soul killed" body donning red robes.

Barring these two exceptions, if they had found all the names and verified the status of all 15 inner cult members, it would be highly suspect if one of the inner cult members is conveniently missing.
