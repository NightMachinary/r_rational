Interesting theory, but I don't think it can explain Zach's reserves adequately.

Zach told Zorian he can cast 232 magic missiles before he runs out. That's pretty specific, not just a guess. Therefore he has tested it.

Now, according to your theory, he was rapidly regenerating mana during the test, throwing off the results. However, if he was concentrating on casting magic missile, then that regeneration would just be the passive soul-generates-mana-from-nothing, not assimilating ambient mana. According to the latest world-building post, that normally takes about nine hours, so our enhanced Zach would take 4.5 hours.

How long is the test? We know he can cast it reflexively, and presumably he tested after reaching that level of proficiency. Let's generously assume he casts every five seconds (it's probably much faster, not even counting swarms). At that rate, he takes just under 20 minutes to cast 232 missiles and exhaust himself. Not nearly enough time for his regeneration to give the impression that his reserves were twice as big as they really are. He would need to regenerate as if he were /over magnitude 600/ to throw his test results out that far.
