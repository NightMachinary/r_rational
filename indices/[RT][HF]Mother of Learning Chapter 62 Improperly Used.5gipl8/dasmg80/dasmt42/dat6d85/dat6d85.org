He is well wiithin the bell curve, but if I remember correctly, compared to his brothers (That was both over average) he's quite a bit weaker. It doesn't mean he got a magnitude 16 if he wasn't an empath, as his shaping skills was better than his peers even before the loop and that is tied to your magnitude.

My point is that with mastery of blood magic he could increase his manapool, even if it's "just" to magnitude 9 or 10, by making the ability permanetly use 1 instead of 2,3 or whatever it is using now. As he said in this chapter.

A base increase of 1 or 2 would increase his manapool by 12.5% or 25%, something I would think Zorian would like quite a bit
