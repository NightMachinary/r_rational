He already got a magical bloodline (Empathy/Open), his brothers got quite a bit more mana than he got, so I infer that his empathy is causing some of his mana to be permanently tied down.

Using blood magic it should be possible to improve on his current empathy, causing it to tie down less of his mana or even increase its potency.
