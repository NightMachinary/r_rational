So what does everyone think: will Zorian want to copy Zach's mana reserves, or not? Massively useful, of course, but he would probably lose his mastery of shaping, and who knows what that would do to his mind magic.

I wonder whether he could copy that bloodline incrementally? You apparently get an unusually good power-to-control ratio, so even a little of it would be nice to have.

And if Zach gets over his squeamishness, he could really load up. Soul sight from Kael, mind magic from Zorian, and if the Alanic Boranova theory is correct, maybe fire magic. Any other powers I've forgotten held by potentially-willing donors?

And do you think Zorian might even learn how to stabilize Veyers?
