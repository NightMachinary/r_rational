Presumably you would only be able to design a magical enhancement that does something you already know how to do, just like with golem creation.

So, I guess the advantages of making it an enhancement ritual would be that you can use it faster, more reliably, maybe unconsciously (eg with fast healing). You'd definitely only want to use it on things that you cast all the time.

Or for powers (like soul sight) that you're able to copy from others, but wouldn't know how to cast as regular spells. Clearly the Noveda bloodline, if it exists, is not a regular enhancement, since it massively increases mana reserves rather than tying them up.

Incidentally, if it is indeed feasible to copy bloodline powers through blood magic, then that bloodline would be amazingly valuable to any blood mage. They wouldn't even necessarily have to be evil; I'm sure there are non-fatal ways to use blood magic on a willing target.
