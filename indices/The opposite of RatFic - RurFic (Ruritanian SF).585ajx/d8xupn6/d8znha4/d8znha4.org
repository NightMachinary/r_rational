That's a little unfair to HPMOR - that ability was foreshadowed, and it is at least a /logical/ conclusion to come to. It's like partial transfiguration: it relies on the alternate universe of the story, but it is still /internally/ self-consistent.

I mean, if dementors are "death" and they can be killed by the weird transhumanist patronus thing, then I think it makes sense for them to be scared of it. (especially since HJPEV is currently the only one who can cast it)
