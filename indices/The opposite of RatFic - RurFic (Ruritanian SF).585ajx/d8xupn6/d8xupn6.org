I disagree. "Rational fiction" is subjective, but if we use the sidebar definition (characters make thoughtful decisions based on their motivations, the world is sane and consistent), you don't need to explain how the plot-relevant things work to make a good rational fic. You don't even need to describe their precise effects.

You could make a Stargate fic without explaining how the stun guns (or even the gate) work, and it could still be rational, as long as the characters don't forget about the stun gun when they need to capture someone alive, or even worse, invent a new purpose for the gun just in time to solve their problem of the week (I'm looking at you, Harry "Also I can scare away dementors now!" JPEV).

Aslo: we really really need a long running Stargate rational fic.
