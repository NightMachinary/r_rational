I really think the best non-ratfic (irrational fic?) has gotta be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]].

It isn't really an irrational world (any more irrational than Potterworld already is), but everybody mostly goes along with Harry's insane logic and incredible fast-talk, mostly because the people he tries to convince are children. He mostly gets through the plot by saying things very confidently and then barging ahead so that everybody has to rush forward to keep up with him. Though, that eventually stops working as well.
