Fair enough. I'd say the problem with MoR is more that you have no way to guess which ability is going to pop up next: Dementors being unable to be afraid would have made sense too, or maybe Harry could have figured out that accepting Death as an obstacle to be dealt with would have made him immune to dementor's effects. But yeah, MoR is far from the worst offender.
