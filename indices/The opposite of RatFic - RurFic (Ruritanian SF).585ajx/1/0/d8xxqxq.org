  Aslo: we really really need a long running Stargate rational fic.

I would love that. It's really a world ripe for the picking, rather similar to Naruto and Harry Potter. The world-building is awesome and compelling and the characters are at the very least interesting, but it very much lacks internal consistency and thoughtfulness - just like the two fanfiction giants.

I've been watching Stargate recently (having never watched it properly before), and it's been such a strange experience. On the one hand I really enjoy the characters and the overall plot, on the other hand just about every episode makes me want to bang my head against the wall at the ridiculously obvious solutions that are missed or ignored for the sake of manufactured drama.

Thor's Hammer in Season 1 was the one I watched the most recently. There was /no reason/ to destroy the McGuffin that allowed for the removal of Goa'uld. There was no time constraint - Teal'c could've stayed inside the cave while SG made another way through, by drilling through the damn walls if need be. But no! Drama must be created! Bah humbug.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/space-overlord-tactics-stargate-si.433811/][Space Overlord Tactics]] gets an honorable mention here. It's an in-progress Stargate fic that tries to make sense of things a bit. Sadly, it only tangentially touches upon any of the main plot, and is unlikely to change that anytime soon.

(I also recommend all the other works of Belial666 - I found them all to be very enjoyable.)
