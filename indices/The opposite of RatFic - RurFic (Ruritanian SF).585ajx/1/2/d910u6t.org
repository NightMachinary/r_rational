Sane and consistent is really where you'll find the rub if the tech is re-skinned sailboats, because stuff won't line up right. It's technically possible to appease the sidebar with this stuff, but that's going to be an edge case while the vast majority are not what we'd call rational fiction. Reminds me of this one stargate story I was reading where the character was made of nanobots and the writer didn't understand technology beyond "it's magic". Was also scared of travelling through stargates. Never really understood the decision to put someone in that universe and have them not use its defining feature, but I digress.
