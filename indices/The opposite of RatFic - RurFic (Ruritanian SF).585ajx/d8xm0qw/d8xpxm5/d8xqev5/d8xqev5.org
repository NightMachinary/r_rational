Heavily dominated by the rule of cool, an unwritten plan guarantee. The protagonist largely going by gut-instinct and half-remembered plans from previous loops instead of thinking things through. /Constant/ deus/diabolus ex machina.

It's kind of like what I imagine a combination of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Challenger][captain challenger]] and superman would be like.

With a heavy-dose of "badass" thrown in.

In sort, it's a Marty Stu story, the most egregious one I've found that isn't crap and that takes itself seriously.

I don't think it meets a single one of the sidebar requirements, and often does the exact opposite.
