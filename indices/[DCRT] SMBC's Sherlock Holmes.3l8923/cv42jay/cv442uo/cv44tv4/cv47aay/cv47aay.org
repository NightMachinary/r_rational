Doyle was a physician who modeled Sherlock on one of his mentors. However, he wanted to stop writing stories about him and killed off his character in the Reichenbach fall. The general public were so upset about this that they bugged him for years afterward and he gave up and wrote more stories with the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.
