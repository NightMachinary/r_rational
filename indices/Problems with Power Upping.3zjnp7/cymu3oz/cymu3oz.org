What I /think/ has been working for me is a situation much like what [[/u/redrach]] describes for 'With This Ring'

I'm writing a Buffy SI where the SI gets turned into a Vampire. It's set in season 3, so the early parts are all about running around digging up the magic items and stuff that wouldn't normally be found until later. But while the main character (Jack) is easily more 'powerful' as a result... the story glosses over the things where that matters at all.

Instead of drama being derived from combat situations where so and so might die if they aren't strong/fast/tough enough, most combat situations in my story are resolved via gratuitous violence and grenades. *The focus of the story is on noncombat situations where 'power' isn't really relevant.* Such as... Jack's attempts to annoy Buffy as much as vampirically possible, keep his brother Spike from drinking all the whiskey, and help Harmony win homecoming Queen (again, to annoy Buffy)

I should probably mention that my main character may or may not be insane.
