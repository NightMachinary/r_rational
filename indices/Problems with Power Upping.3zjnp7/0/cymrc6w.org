1.1) The protagonist could be gaining power linearly, while each new problem he encounters would require exponentially more power to be solved.

There was a [[https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%90%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B0][series of books]] (warning for Russian) by [[http://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/nick.gorkavyi][Nick Gorkavyi,]] for example, where the technologies were graded by tiers.

  First tier technologies are the most important discoveries made during a year. For instance, some new type of highly efficient light bulb. Second tier technologies are the most important discoveries during a decade --- things like the info-crystals. The third tier is assigned to those technologies that remain significant on the scale of centuries --- the steam engine, the airplane, the telephone, etc. The most significant technologies are important throughout millennia --- printing press, mathematical expression of nature, nuclear energy, spaceships, computers. These are technologies of the 4th tier and they define the focal turning points of history by their arrival.

In this series, even while the protagonist eventually builds herself a multi-billion revenue corporation, her development in terms of economic and political power still doesn't dwarf /all/ of the problems that she has to face, because for some of them (ranging from world-class social and economic issues to the heat death of the universe) even that much power isn't enough when not applied smartly.

- As a real life example for this could serve projects of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation#Global_development_division][Gates foundation.]]

- Another example for this are wars waged at infinite scales (see: [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfAmber][Chronicles of Amber,]] [[http://brainchip.thecomicseries.com/][Transdimensional Brain Chip]], [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/471497/chapters/815855][Time v.3.0)]]

1.2) Or even if he himself is progressing exponentially, the requirements (the problem) just grow by a steeper function.

  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_of_the_Galaxy][Long before space travel,]] when we hadn't even filled up Terra, there used to be dirtside frontiers. Every time new territory was found, you always got three phenomena: traders ranging out ahead and taking their chances, outlaws preying on the honest men --- and a traffic in slaves. It happens the same way today, when we're pushing through space instead of across oceans and prairies. Frontier traders are adventurers taking great risks for great profits. Outlaws, whether hill bands or sea pirates or the raiders in space, crop up in any area not under police protection. Both are temporary. But slavery is another matter --- the most vicious habit humans fall into and the hardest to break. It starts up in every new land and it's terribly hard to root out. After a culture falls ill of it, it gets rooted in the economic system and laws, in men's habits and attitudes. You abolish it; you drive it underground --- there it lurks, ready to spring up again, in the minds of people who think it is their 'natural' right to own other people. You can't reason with them; you can kill them but you can't change their minds. The Guard is just the policeman and the mailman; we haven't had a major war in two centuries. What we do work at is the impossible job of maintaining order on the frontier, a globe three thousand light-years in circumference --- no one can understand how big that is; the mind can't swallow it. Nor can human beings police it. It gets bigger every year. Dirtside police eventually close the gaps. But with us, the longer we try the more there is. So to most of us it's a job, an honest job, but one that can never be finished.

2) The protagonist encounters such a problem where all his accumulated power is useless simply because it's inapplicable. E.g. reaching certain goals would be a very difficult and slow process for a world leader if he doesn't want to convert his political system to dictatorship simply because the human factor will obstruct his efforts --- some of his citizens just won't be ready to accept the changes quickly enough.

3) limitations --- tropes like “ascended beings have to act only through avatars\proxies in a single world”

3.2) bottlenecks --- “an ascended being can only apply a small amount of their power per unit of time for various reasons”.
