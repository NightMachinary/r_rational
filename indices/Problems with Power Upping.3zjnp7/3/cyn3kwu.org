I think the important step is to differentiating challenges from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma][dilemmas]].

In real life, and in a lot of meatier stories, there are problems which have no ideal solution. No matter which choice is made someone will be disappointed, something will be lost, some aspect will resolve in failure. We, and the characters in those works, are forged and defined by which particular sacrifices we are willing to make for which particular rewards.

There really are some things money (and power) can't buy. Mistakes accumulate. Responsibilities, too.

If the story is /about/ leveling up then, yes, you reach a dead end when there's nowhere left to escalate... but ideally there was always an undercurrent about /why/ the protagonist was escalating, and their success or failure in that relatively mundane goal determines whether it's a comedy or a tragedy.
