Yeah, the worldbuilding problems inherent in continuous escalation can get pretty serious. Eventually power (of any kind) gets to the point where it should be warping society around it, and if the antagonists are pre-existing then it doesn't make that much sense that society isn't already warped.

You can do a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace][Lensman Arms Race]] depending on what kind of story you have going on, but that still leaves you with a problem of running up against a wall sooner or later (probably sooner), and then you probably have to deal with warping the setting around the ever-increasing size of the conflict. (You can tie the escalation of conflict and power together in a variety of other ways as well, but Lensman is one of the most popular.)
