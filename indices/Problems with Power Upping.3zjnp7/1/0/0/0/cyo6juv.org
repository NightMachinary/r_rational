Fortunately I was sort of going into it from the perspective of the protagonists being society warpers from the get go, so having the proper 'ramifications' of every boost in power fit well.

At one point a character was taking in volunteers to become unsleeping hyper rational high octane transhumans (with the disclosure that said procedure was effectively agreeing to shortening your life span to at most ten years).

This was necessary to have sufficient skilled and inter-cooperative labor to construct an ICBM infrastructure capable of simultaneously attacking the enemy kaiju as well as lifting the population and necessary life support into orbit.

It was a really fun story/setting and I kind of want to revisit it and tell much more narrow stories about each of these various eras.
