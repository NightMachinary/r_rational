The central question is /why/ they lose their charm, which I think needs an answer before we try to get into how to keep that from happening. (Technically we should first question whether it's true that they lose their charm. But I'm already in agreement on that and think we can take it as a given.)

If the story is only interesting /because/ of the escalation of power, then the problem can't really be avoided. Eventually you would have to escalate power to the level of city-wide (or planet-wide) destruction, and humans are bad at scale, so that doesn't even help you all that much.

So yes, you can shift your focus to some domain that hasn't been escalated; Punch-Harder can punch his way through walls, but he can't punch his way through hearts and minds (except in the very literal sense). But if you're going to do that, then the power escalation just sort of turns into fluff. If our central conflict is Punch-Harder trying to get elected to public office, do we really thousands of words about how he discovered his power and trained himself up to being able to punch down buildings? It tends to feel like a bait-and-switch to me, unless done really well.

You can walk back some of the power escalation in a variety of ways, but that's an even worse bait-and-switch. Don't do that.

If you keep escalating conflict to match or exceed the escalation in power, you're still going to run into problems /eventually/. Sometimes these will be worldbuilding problems, but other times they'll be human empathy problems. If Punch-Harder starts off saving a man getting beaten to death in an alley, then eventually he has to save multiple people, and we start caring less about people when they're in the aggregate. We can't really appreciate the difference between a thousand people being at risk and two thousand, not on a level that it works in fiction. Same goes for a fight; we can't easily conceptualize differences in power level unless they're quite large.

You can escalate the personal stakes for Punch-Harder, like his wife and daughter, but you can only do that so many times.

I think a better solution is to just stop before the story loses its charm. For my tastes, there are a lot of stories out there that are just too long, not just because of a lack of editing, but because the author just wants to play in the world. If power escalation is one of the primary ways that the story is delivering hedons, then figure out a way to end the story once the power escalation is done. Otherwise the story is just dragging its feet.
