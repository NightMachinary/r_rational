Dunno how effective this is or how good an idea it is for some one to try to pull this off but one thing I did is make the 'sorting algorithm of evil/suspiciously balanced escalation of the enemy' fit into the narrative.

Several characters became aware of this happening in the world. But the stakes of 'NOT' playing along to the escalation of the enemy were too great.

that said I also ran into problems of escalation and it kind of lead to tone shifts that don't quite fit harmoniously into the entire story.

The whole project could use an editor pass to clean up a lot of those plot points and give a sharper punch on things.
