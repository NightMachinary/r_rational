With This Ring is an interesting example, although some people dislike its approach. In that story the protagonist mysteriously finds himself in possession of an extremely powerful xenotech device but the world he's in is already so full of beings on a similar level that no matter how far he's come he's still very far from breaking the system. The story's less about him getting godlike power (which he basically has from the onset) and more about the connections he makes with other people and how he uses his powers to solve various problems. It's a very episodic style compared to other stories, and that's what turns some people off it. I like it though.
