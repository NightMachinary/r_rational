I read this book months ago when it was posted once before on this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/55all1/we_are_legion_we_are_bob_bobiverse_book_1_rthsf/][subreddit]].

It got boring when the narrative split into multiple threads to 'show' Bob's expansion through the universe and I just couldn't keep up any motivation to keep reading.

The plotline is very interesting, but the prose is written in a very monotone manner and I couldn't empathize with the character or care about their achievements. It was as if the characters lacked a 'voice' and I was reading a dry history text book.

It also seemed to be incapable of making up its mind whether it wanted to focus on the intellectual physics problem solving or be an action-packed battle between opposing Von Neumann swarms, and kept jumping back and forth between the two.

I personally think the structuring/pace of the novel was jerky. It was either slow or fast in places especially when transitioning from one character to another. 2/5 with most of the enjoyment coming from reading the summary of how the novel came out. Brilliant ideas, horrible execution.
