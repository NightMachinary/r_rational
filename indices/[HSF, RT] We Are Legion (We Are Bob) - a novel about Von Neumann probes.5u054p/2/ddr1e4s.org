From reading these reviews, this novel sounds like an akward-in-the-morning drunken encounter between Jack Williamson's /Manseed/, Larry Niven's /A World Out of Time/, and Greg Egan's /Diaspora/. I guess the first two are old enough to be generic influences and the third is young enough to be topical.
