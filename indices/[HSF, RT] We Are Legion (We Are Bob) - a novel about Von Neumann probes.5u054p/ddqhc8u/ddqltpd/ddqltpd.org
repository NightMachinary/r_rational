  these do not seem to be things that could meaningfully be used.

The way I interpreted these was that they were effectively preserving lineages - although when you "restore from backup" you're not actually going to get the same individual back, it does ensure a continuity of memory that you would otherwise lack, and as a result the newly created Bob will be closer to the cloned Bob than one from another lineage.

  plays with the idea of resource constraints for reasons that are never satisfactorily explained IMO
#+end_quote

The only place where I found the resource constraints very unconvincing were in the sol system, which was supposedly because it had already been heavily mined out. In the rest of the book the constraint seemed to be how quickly they could grow production capacity rather than resources per se (and one other place where there was another plot element causing it).
