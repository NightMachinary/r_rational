  The way I interpreted these was that they were effectively preserving lineages

This would make sense, but they specifically use the term 'backup' which made me doubt this interpretation. I think it could have done with a line or two clarifying the purpose of these. Perhaps something we'll see in the squeal as as far as I recall, no backups were 're-instanced' in the first book.

  The only place where I found the resource constraints very unconvincing were in the sol system, which was supposedly because it had already been heavily mined out
#+end_quote

heh, I was avoiding mentioning the location to avoid more heavy spoilers, but yeah I though the same. If anything it seemed to me that whatever infrastructure survived in the Sol system could be used to 'ramp-up' production even faster. Although I seem to recall resources being an issue a couple other times with systems only supposedly having enough material for X 'Bobs.' (aside from the system with the that other plot element you reference).
