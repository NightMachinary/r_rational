This review may contain minor spoilers.

A good book, my brother and I both enjoyed it. I'd rate it pretty highly as far as 'rationality' go. It features a protagonists who acts (IMO) both rationally, and (importantly) still retains their humanity (which is ironic given the subject matter).

However, I'd rate it as only fair in terms of literature. The prose is passable and the dialog (and monologue) are both decent (IMO being decent is fair praise, as decent dialog/monologue are not easy to do). The protagonists has a relatable and entertaining voice. However the novel quickly splits into several narrative threads which only very loosely interconnect. The novel lacks any significant dramatic structure after the first 'act' (departure of the probe), which is unfortunate because the dramatic structure is handled very well in the first act. After this, while many interesting events happen, the split up of the narrative seems to thwart any kind of rising action and climax. And ultimately the novel ends kind of abruptly (although a sequel is certainly in the works).

As far as objections to the science go, my only major one is how the novel handles the idea of 'resource constraints' on Von Neumann probes. As far as I can tell, within the setting of the novel there shouldn't be any. There is no call out to some specific resource the probes need that might be limited in quantity, or that only a certain fraction of a systems resources are accessible to the probe for some reason. Given the absence of those two limitations, it would seem an 'average' system would contain basically unlimited resources. However the Novel plays with the idea of resource constraints for reasons that are never satisfactorily explained IMO.

A more minor quibble is about the Bob 'cloning' process. For whatever reason, whenever Bob creates a copy of himself, the copy is slightly different for some reason. Fine, I can accept this as a worthy hand-wave for artistic reasons, as it enables the creation of a more 'diverse' cast of 'protagonists.' And in fact its a good way of dealing with the 'immortality' problem of "Mind Virtualization" since a mind cannot be meaningfully be restored 'from backup.' The restored mind, while it will retain the same memories and will be very similar, will also be materially different from the original mind in ways that would be significant to the original mind. /However/ the novel still has the 'Bobs' sending back 'backup copies' and 'deltas.' Even though, as I understand and pointed out above, these do not seem to be things that could meaningfully be used.

Quibbles minor and major aside, I'd give the Novel a 4/5. The ideas are good, its pretty rational, and the writing is entertaining. I could wish for a better dramatic structure to hold it all together, but I'll happily take what I was given. I eagerly await the sequel.

--------------

Bonus ideas I think would have been great for the author to include (or put in the sequel).

- Tracking the ages of 'Bobs'. The Novel has a lot of elements that can adjust how the Bob's track the passing of time. They have the ability to travel at relativistic speeds and the ability to adjust their 'clock rate' which basically adjusts their subjective perception of time. As such it might be interesting to keep track of how 'old' the various Bobs are, both by their 'objective' time (well that is the subjective measure of a clock that was traveling with them :P) and their 'subjective' time (the amount of time they have subjectively experienced).

- Tracking the linage of Bobs. As you have Bobs splitting off and making copies of themselves in turn, it might be interesting to track some of the linage of these various 'family trees' of Bobs. As each copy varies slightly from the original 'Bob' might it be possible for the various Bob lineages to develop some interesting 'traits' that distinguish a Bob of one tree from a Bob of another?
