I agree with your rating. My main issue was the absurd, unrealistic lengths the author goes to maintain narrative tension. Besides the unexplained resource constraints the other commenter touched on, the part I just couldn't get over was when Bob was observing the Deltans. [[#s][spoiler]] Watching this AI capable of interstellar travel being nearly defeated by some stupid shit-eating brutes incapable of making fire or even speech... Maybe 2/5 is too much, even.
