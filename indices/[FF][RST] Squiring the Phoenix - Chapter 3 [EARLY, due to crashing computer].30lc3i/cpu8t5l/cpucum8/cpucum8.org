The math was presented wrong. Each of the 100 wizards was paid 1,000 galleons per day, total of 700,000 for the whole group.(*). 50 GBP/galleon makes that 3.5 million pounds. There was a change between first and second draft that changed the number in one place and not the other. Final edits didn't happen due to a graphics card that decided it wanted a virgin sacrifice or a bit of a lie-down, one or the other. It's at the fumigators now, but I won't be getting it back for a couple weeks. I figured it was better to post an insufficiently edit chapter than nothing.

(*) Slightly less, as Dumbledore refused payment. He just wants his school back and doesn't need the money.
