I think arithmetics is failing one of us. Here's my calculations:

1,000 galleon per day per wizard for 100 wizards for 7 days gives us 700,000 galleon total (as you said here). G700,000 * £50 = *£35,000,000.* And I've googled around, and it appears that in 1992 the USD/GBP exchange rate was about 1.8-1.9, so it's about *$65,000,000.*
