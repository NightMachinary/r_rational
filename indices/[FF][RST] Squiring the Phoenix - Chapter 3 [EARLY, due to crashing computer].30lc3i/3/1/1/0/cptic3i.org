In plain English, it's "equals the set of all lengths to which you cannot provably compress strings", where "you" is some Turing machine M. It's a play on Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem, which I'm trying to slowly, steadily investigate to see where it gets that famous "constant" L that's supposed to be a function of the size of the Turing machine =K(M)=, and thus build a whole construction to work around the Theorem, sorta-kinda.

If it works, it might be helpful for Certain Things.

But also, it just says in a mathematical way, "I am eldritch stuff you cannot comprehend", which is always lulz.
