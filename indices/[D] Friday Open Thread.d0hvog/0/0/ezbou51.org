This already exists, in a certain sense. Photosensitive epileptic individuals can be sent into seizures if they view flashing lights, such as what may be displayed on a television screen/monitor. The Porygon episode of the Pokemon anime (season 1 episode 38) is a famous example of this.

Looking at the real-world example, we can observe that adding strobing lights to videos is widely avoided for this reason. Translating that to your hypothetical infohazard, it should probably be treated similarly.
