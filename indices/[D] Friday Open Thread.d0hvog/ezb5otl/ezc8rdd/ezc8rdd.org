Someone recently asked about 'big wins' of statistics in [[/r/slatestarcodex][r/slatestarcodex]], long story short these two links - [[http://www.sustainable.soltechdesigns.com/Feynman-Uncertainty.pdf][one]] [[https://library.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/ft/gg/GG_Mindless_2004.pdf][two]] - have made for interesting reading. Got me wondering why stats isn't taught more symbolically in the first place, i.e. start with P(data | hypothesis) and /then/ give it context in the form of a soliloquy, rather than the other way around.
