Well, when I think of losing entropy I think of self-organizing structures, like crystals. Crystals are lower-entropy than their dissolved state, but you need to put in energy to evaporate the solvent, which leads to higher entropy everywhere else.

So for some fantasy universe, I'd have some crystals that have the ability to reform when shattered, and the eerie ability to slowly move towards other crystals. So sort of like the Iron Giant.

At least that's how I think it works.

Alternately, you can just have some fixed-temperature substance. That always messes everything up.
