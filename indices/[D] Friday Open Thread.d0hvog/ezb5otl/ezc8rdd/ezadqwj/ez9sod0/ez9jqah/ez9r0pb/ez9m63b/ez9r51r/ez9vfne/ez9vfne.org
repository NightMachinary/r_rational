Individual stocks are, certainly. Sometimes whole industries. But the more you zoom out and bet on index funds, the less of an issue black swans are, especially if you invest globally. Sure, exact timing is still hard to predict, but the fact that Warren Buffet and people like him are holding a higher proportion of cash than he has since 2008 is a strong indicator that the most successful billionaire investors are expecting the stock market as a whole to go /down/ in the next year or three.
