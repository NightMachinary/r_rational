Hello all!

I've recorded [[https://storiesbysky.podbean.com/][Chapters 1&2]] of the Seventh Tower Book One.

I'd love some more feedback on it.

I've tried adding more cadences and tones to my recording. The primary concern I got from the prologue was that it felt too much like I was just reading it flat off the book.

I also attempted to do more character voices, although I feel like I might have messed up Tal's voice at the end of chapter 2.

Furthermore something is off with the pace of chapter two but my own bias is stopping me from identifying or putting it into words properly, so sorry about that.
