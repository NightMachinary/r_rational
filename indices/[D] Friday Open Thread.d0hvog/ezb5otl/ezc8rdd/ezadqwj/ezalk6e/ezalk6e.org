I think taking the right supplements is more likely to help with the symptoms of aging than any mental exercise. I mean, it's a good idea to stay mentally active, but presumably by working and dealing with life's everyday problems you're already doing that.

I've recently been looking into molecules that are produced by the human body but tend to be produced less and less as we age. Insufficient quantities of some of these are suspected to be responsible for a host of diseases associated with old age, or even with 'normal' senescence.

The most important one that came up is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione][glutathione]], probably the most essential antioxidant and cell detoxifier. Unfortunately taken as an oral supplement it mostly gets destroyed in the stomach and gut, so it's recommended to take NAC (N-acetyl-cysteine), the main precursor of glutathione, instead. There's also sublingual glutathione which goes directly into the blood stream, though it's much more expensive.

Two other, less important anti-oxidants which I also take are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoic_acid][alpha-lipoic acid]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenzyme_Q10][coenzyme Q10]].

Other things that might help: Reducing the amount of carbs you eat, cutting down on processed foods as much as possible, intermittent fasting, a bit of cardio every day. Taking enough vitamin D supplements to reach a blood level between [[https://www.vitamindcouncil.org/about-vitamin-d/testing-for-vitamin-d/#.XXLGHihKiUk][40 and 80 ng/mL]] (by the way, if you take more than 5k IU of vitamin D daily, also take the recommended daily dose of vitamin K2 to avoid any risk of calcification). Having your DNA analyzed at [[https://23andme.com][23andme.com]] and sending the raw data to [[https://mygenefood.com][mygenefood.com]] for information on which foods you might be better off avoiding (usually this turns out to be the most commonly inflammatory foods such as dairy products and gluten).

Good luck!

*Edited two months later, in case anyone is reading this post*: I have stopped taking glutathione and alpha lipoic acid on a daily basis. I now only take them occasionally when I feel the need. My concern is that taking glutathione might induce the body to produce less of it. Also, glutathione is a heavy metal chelator, and I'm fairly certain that it made me zinc deficient after taking 300mg every day for 6 weeks. Alpha lipoic acid is... probably safe, but it's also a heavy metal chelator, and I'd rather not take any risks.

I still take NAC (200 mg per day), CoQ 10 (100mg per day), vitamin D, and vitamin K2. I've also begun taking 250mg/day nicotinamide riboside (as the Niagen brand) for its anti-aging effects, along with TMG, vitamins B6, B9, and B12, as well as 400 mg resveratrol per day (to prevent possible negative side effects from Niagen). And I should mention I've been taking 400 mg Longvida curcumin extract and 2g good quality fish oil (from Nordic Naturals) daily for a while now.

One last thing: Instead of the rather expensive, and not all that useful genetic report produced by [[https://mygenefood.com][mygenefood.com]], I strongly recommend Dr. Rhonda Patrick's report for a mere $10:
