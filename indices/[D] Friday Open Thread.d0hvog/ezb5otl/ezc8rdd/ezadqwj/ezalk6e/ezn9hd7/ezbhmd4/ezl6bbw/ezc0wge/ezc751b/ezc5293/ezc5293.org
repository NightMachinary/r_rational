  The problem is that the gyms with the good classes tend to be expensive, particularly if you're looking for the sort of inclusive and non-judgmental gym that introverted nerdfaces who browse subreddits like [[/r/rational]] would do better in.

  Basically, if you wanna live forever, the first step is to not be poor.

I turned 30 in the last few months. I still live with my mother and my younger brother. Owing to threat of foreclosure, my mother sold the house we'd been living in for the past 2 years, and now the three of us are living at my grandmother's house, with my aunt. 5 people in a 4-bedroom house. My mom has been living in the living-room for over a year-and-a-half.

We went on foodstamps for a few months. I have an exceptionally high IQ. I did a few hours of research and figured out how to get +120g protein and +2200 calories (with micronutirents /and/ fiber accounted for) for /less than a single dollar per day/. It involved rice and pinto beans and chicken and eggs and bananas and some vitamins I had already had laying around. My IQ is in the 99.5th percentile. Our household income is in the fifth percentile (probably lower, I really don't want to check). I've been losing fat and gaining muscle even in the depths of poverty. Being poor is not an excuse.

My musculature/fitness is in the top 85%. I look /huge/. I've gotten there with nothing but a doorframe pullup bar ($25 bucks at Wally World) and two dumbbells ($40 on sale - that's a 3lbs bar/bolt combo, plus four 2.5lbs plates plus four 6lbs plates. I lucked out and found four 5lbs plates at Goodwill. That let's me make two 8lbs, two 13lbs, two 15lbs, two 18lbs, two 20lbs, two 25lbs, and two 30lbs dumbbells).

I'm actually doing a risky experiment right now. I'm doing a full-body (pullups/pushups/squats) workout) once a week, and doing Farmer's Walks / Farmer's Carries / Loaded Carries twice a week.

Too much. 8hrs sleep / 16 wake, I'm already up 16hrs, and I've drank 1/3 bottle 80proof aristocrap in the last two hours. Somebody's already PM'd me about designing a plan. Need more? PM me.

EDIT:

/Wow,/ Liz. You're a piece of work, you know that?

EDIT:

Y'know, if you /had/ to mention IQ (/twice/) you could've at least checked the accuracy of the income percentile. You /moron/. Not that anyone's going to see this, but I feel obligated to point out that it's just over the 20th percentile, not "probably lower than the fifth percentile," we're only like a thousand bucks below the poverty line.

I really ought to cut back on the drinking.
