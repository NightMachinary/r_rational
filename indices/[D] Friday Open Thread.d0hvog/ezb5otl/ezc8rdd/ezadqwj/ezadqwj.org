Now that I'm older I have noticed that my body doesn't heal as fast as it used to. Particularly after a long night working. Where I used to wake up the next day like nothing happened, now I wake up feeling like I got hit by a truck and my head is full of fog. Coffee no longer helps me as well either.

And so as I'm pondering about aging, wonder. What exercises could be used to maintain the brain in old age?

I think the main issues are slower processing so I'm thinking maybe tetris? Here's where I'm lacking ideas.

And for memory the good ol' enough rest hours, reading books and memory exercises.

Have you ever thought of ways to slow down the inevitable?
