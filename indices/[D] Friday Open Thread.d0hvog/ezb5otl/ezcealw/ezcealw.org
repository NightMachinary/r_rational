I think to a certain point it makes sense to both explain what it is and why it is an infohazard. Like in comparison there's been a relatively recent trend of explaining how say fireworks can trigger the PTSD of a previous service man, or that a certain percentage of people are more likely to kill themselves, and others incidentally, from the news of people dying in car crashes or as CosmicPotatoe said suicide.

If it has already breached containment then having the information to ameliorate its effects should be put out and made as available if not more available than the infohazard itself.
