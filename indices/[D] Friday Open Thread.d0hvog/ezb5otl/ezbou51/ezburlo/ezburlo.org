Sounds like suicide. Suicide rates skyrocket after someone famous suffers from it.

It is probabalistic though, where a person's risk of suicide increases rather than being guaranteed like fictional infohazards tend to be.

Also only really applies to at risk populations. People with suicidal tendencies and/or depression.

Look at how rational minds argue we should treat suicide in the press.
