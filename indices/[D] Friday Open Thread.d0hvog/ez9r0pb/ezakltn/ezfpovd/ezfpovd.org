Have you watched all of season 1? I was reading Worth the Candle while rewatching it and therefore thinking more than normal about the hero's journey and found this entertaining:

In episode 8 the writers go out of their way to evoke the hero's journey explicitly in the coma/dream conversation where Townes gives her the sword and tells her she needs to save her younger self from the monster. Soon after she wakes up she descends into the underworld in the dramatic house fire and she returns to her house (via a magic flight) with the boon which is a Boone (Clay).
