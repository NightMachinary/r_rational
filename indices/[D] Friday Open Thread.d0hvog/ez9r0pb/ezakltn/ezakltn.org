The books are better. /Exo/ in particular features a lot of science and engineering that I think would appeal to this subreddit. The writing is still a little YA for my tastes, but it scratches the itch as far as powers exploration/exploitation goes.

Exo spoilers: Much of the plot of the fourth book is taken up with Cent starting a one-teenage-girl space agency that can teleport up into LEO and deorbit debris, place microsats, or inspect satellites for damage. One of the early chapters has her getting a call from the sat phone company, which is quite puzzled by the glitch in their system that indicates that she's moving at seven thousand miles per hour. I had a huge grin on my face reading that.
