A question for anyone interested in the stock market: Is there an expert that you trust to have a good enough understanding of economics and a good enough read on current politics to make (probably) accurate predictions about the stock market? Someone rational and well-informed, with an above average track record.

/Edited to add/: Or if you have your own predictions please feel free to post them there, I'd love to read them!
