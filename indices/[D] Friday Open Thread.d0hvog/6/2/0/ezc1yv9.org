Funnily enough, the guy who predicted the CDO bubble is now saying that [[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-04/michael-burry-explains-why-index-funds-are-like-subprime-cdos][he thinks there's an index-linked fund bubble.]]

People are getting into a lot of fights about it, but I think his argument makes sense - it's more like a mathematical existence proof than anything else, so it's super philosophical.

The basic idea is that there's not actually a ton of volume in the indexes. He's saying that 250 stocks with less than $450 million in trade volume (the bottom end of the S&P 500) do not have sufficiently accurate prices for us to be pinning billions of dollars in index-backed funds to them.

It's a neat argument and I think it makes sense, but the problem is that it's got like zero predictive utility. Pretty much the only thing I take from it is that maybe we should invest in total market or small cap ETFs.
