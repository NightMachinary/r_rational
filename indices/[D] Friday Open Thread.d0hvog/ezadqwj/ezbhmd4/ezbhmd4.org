I'm not going to cite any sources. You can either believe me or not believe me or Google all this stuff yourself.

1) It has been shown that all forms of "brain training" games cause an improvement in a person's ability to perform "brain training" games. That is the extent of their usefulness. If you play Tetris then your Tetris-playing skill will improve. That's not going to help you maintain a sharp mind and a healthy body into your 80s and beyond.

2) Start eating a bunch of eggs first thing when you wake up. Like, at least like 4. Every morning I eat 4 soft-boiled eggs (I have a Perfect Egg Maker so it's easy) which I salt and pepper, and two slices of ham on wheat toast with mayo. That's 40 grams of protein and about 550 calories right off the bat. Increasing your daily consumption of protein will provide your body with the resources it needs to repair itself.

2a) Eggs in particular are a rich source of choline, which your brain uses to make acetylcholine - an important neurotransmitter associated with alertness/attention/learning/memory, which are all things you should want to improve if your head is full of fog. If you're allergic to eggs, you can take CDP-Choline or Alpha-Glycerylphosphorylcholine (sold as Alpha-GPC) supplements daily.

3) Take a daily fish oil / Omega-3 supplement.

4) Eat a combination of protein *and* carbs after strenuous physical activity, because that combination is better at carrying resources into the muscle tissue. A cup of protein powder right after you get home from work would work in a pinch. Speaking of...

5) Start adding a cup of protein powder once a day to your daily habit. Friction makes people less likely to do things. Don't create friction. You don't need a blender and fruit and whatever, it doesn't need to be a protein shake. Just get a shaker cup, scoop a scoopful of powder into it, add water, shake it thoroughly, and drink it. Strongly consider adding a scoop of creatine before you add water. Creatine will help immensely with your brain fog.

6) Yes, duh, /read literally all the books/. Or at least try to read for an hour a day.

7) Lifting weights and doing cardio has been shown to preserve the brain's white matter - y'know, the stuff that literally shrinks and shrivels up in dementia and Alzheimer's. Lifting weights is the single most important thing you can do to maintain the brain in old age and slow down the inevitable. Cardio is a close second. I think a compelling argument could be made that you aren't really a rationalist/transhumanist if you don't exercise at least twice a week. What good are transhuman technologies going to do for any of us if we die 15 years before they're invented?

TL;DR:

If you'd like to maintain a healthy body and a sharp mind into your 80s and beyond, then get your work-related fatigue under control by spending the next few weeks ramping up your protein consumption (you /must/ consume /at least/ 120 grams of protein every day - I bet if you eat like normal tomorrow and track it, you'll find that you're only eating about 60g of protein).

Once you've got that under control, start doing pushups and squats on Monday and Thursday (or Sun and Wed, or Tues and Fri, whatever, figure it out in relation to your work schedule). They're simple bodyweight exercises. You can go to Google and YouTube to look up proper form (you /must/ use proper form to avoid injury), and you can start by doing just two or three of both on your first day. Do more research. Within a few weeks you'll want to be at the point where you can do three sets of 8 bodyweight squats and three sets of 3 pushups, and at that point you'll want two 10 pound dumbbells so you can add bent-over rows and bicep curls and dumbbell chest press.

If you do actually start working out, feel free to send me a PM here on reddit. I would be more than willing to design you a personalized work out plan and a nutrition plan based on your starting position (height/weight/sex/age) and your goals.

*That offer is open to every person on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], even if you and I have been in heated arguments.*
