If you can afford it, going to a gym that does classes is a /great/ help.

Not just because there'll be a trainer who can teach you to do the movements properly, but because having a bunch of people who expect you to be at the class provides a great deal of societal pressure to actually, you know, go.

It can also have a lot of knock-on effects, particularly in terms of networking; someone who's spotted you at the gym is probably willing to refer you for a job you're interested in.

The problem is that the gyms with the /good/ classes tend to be expensive, particularly if you're looking for the sort of inclusive and non-judgemental gym that introverted nerdfaces who browse subreddits like [[/r/rational]] would do better in.

The other thing that really helps is working cardio into your routines; instead of driving, why not walk or ride a bike? If everything's too far for biking, consider getting an e-bike. You can go a /lot/ further on one of those, and the cardio's just as good. They also really help you get over the "but it's gonna suck on the way home" hump.

But again, e-bikes (and bicycles that are nice to ride in general) are expensive.

Basically, if you wanna live forever, the first step is to not be poor.
