  Breakfast isn't so bad, but for lunch and especially dinner you probably want something more varied than eggs. And learning how to make good food, or even just making good eggs, can be an investment of time that some people don't want to make.**

Wally-World again, you can get a box of 12 Sam's Club brand burgers for 12 bucks. That's $3.25/lbs. I get that and the 5lbs chicken breast at $1.99/lbs, and other than ham/turkey/deli meat that's all the meat I get for the week. You seem to have your ish on lock, so you probs don't nneed the advice.

Please do me a favor and don't react until tomorrow, I can't kee preasponndinng, that aristorcrap is too mcuh.
