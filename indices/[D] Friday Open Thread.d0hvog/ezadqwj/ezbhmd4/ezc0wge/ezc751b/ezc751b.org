Biking or walking places sounds extremely nice for places that don't regularly hit 100 degree on the heat index, or for places who consider pedestrians better than second class citizens.

I think the time and effort investment is greater than the monetary investment. Gyms can be like $10 a month if you aren't doing classes, and even the nice ones aren't all that much more than that. Eating well isn't super expensive either, beans are great for you and cheap, and eggs are tasty, useful, and healthy. But the time to go to the gym regularly, the time to cook meals instead of eating stuff you can shove in a microwave, and the effort to do the above, those are the real kickers. Especially when you just suck at exercising or cooking, it's hard to make the initial investment. I don't have any hard numbers, but I imagine quite a lot of people go to the gym for like 2 weeks, get hit with the awful soreness, don't see enough results for the pain, and stop going.
