You might want to see a doctor. If you wake up not feeling refreshed it's possible you have sleep apnea or something. Sleep apnea can also affect memory. Also, you might want to not drink any coffee in the afternoon or evening since it can interfere with sleep. And other basic sleep hygiene type stuff like not eating chocolate before bed, not using the bed for anything other than sleep and sex, waking up at the same time every morning, setting up blue light filter apps on your phone and computer, and using a lightbox in the morning.
