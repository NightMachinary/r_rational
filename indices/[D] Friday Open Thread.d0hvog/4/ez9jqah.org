What would a substance that tends to /lose/ entropy look like (if we're talking about a hard fantasy universe, so we can make new rules of physics ad hoc)? Does such a substance even make sense? If so, then what could some of its properties be? I'm fine with dropping off more precise models of physics (eg. ignoring quantum mechanics) if those models entirely preclude the concept from occurring.
