  How many people have you been in heated arguments with in this subreddit?

Maybe a dozen? Maybe two dozen? Idk, over a year ago I started to purposefully ramp down the argumentativeness and only argue when I feel a moral compulsion to do so. I really don't remember having argued with you.

You're more than welcome to PM me. I've only got one person so far, but he's worked out today and is going to workout again Tuesday and has already ordered a doorway pullup bar.
