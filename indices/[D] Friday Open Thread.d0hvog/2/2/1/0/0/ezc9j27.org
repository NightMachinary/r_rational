  Biking or walking places sounds extremely nice for places that don't regularly hit 100 degree on the heat index,

I regularly walk in +90 degree weather two or more times per week (and that's between 11am and 1pm - I wear sunscreen), I just do laps in my yard.

  the time to cook meals instead of eating stuff you can shove in a microwave

The trick is to begin cooking an eff-ton of eggs as soon as you roll out of bed.

  I imagine quite a lot of people go to the gym for like 2 weeks, get hit with the awful soreness, don't see enough results for the pain, and stop going.

They probably try to go too hard too fast, or ramp up too quick. If you've never gone to the gym and immediately jump into some ish, that's gonna hurt. If you start out just trying to do three pushups (and I mean literally not spending more than 10 minutes on your first workout when you start out) then you're gonna make a lot more progress than somebody who tries to go from 0 to 60 in 0.5sec.
