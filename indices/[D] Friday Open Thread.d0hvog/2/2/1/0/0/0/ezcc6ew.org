  They probably try to go too hard too fast, or ramp up too quick. If you've never gone to the gym and immediately jump into some ish, that's gonna hurt.

That's kind of what I mean when I say people being bad at exercising. A lot of people have this perception of "working out" being this hours long thing, multiple times a week. One guy I introduced to the gym was amazed that you could get significant results with 3 hours a week of working out (3 1-hour sessions). Granted, you'll get better results if you do cardio as well and various other things, but you can get to the level of people asking if you work out with just a few hours a week.

The idea of studying the science of picking things up and then setting them down is foreign for most people.

  The trick is to begin cooking an eff-ton of eggs as soon as you roll out of bed.

Breakfast isn't so bad, but for lunch and especially dinner you probably want something more varied than eggs. And learning how to make good food, or even just making good eggs, can be an investment of time that some people don't want to make.
