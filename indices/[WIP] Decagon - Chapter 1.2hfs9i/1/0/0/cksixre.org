Yes, I didn't make that very clear, did I? I apologize.

Shortly: People start developing super-powers in a fictional city named Roosetown, including a group of ten teenagers, and then super-powerey stuff starts happening. It's similar in a way to Worm in premise, but with a few changes: This details the first appearance of superpowers and what happens afterwards, rather than being set in a world where the powers already exist.

I have pretty much the entirety of the story arc planned out, more or less, and it's going to be rather long, and it's going to discuss super-power tropes quite a bit.
