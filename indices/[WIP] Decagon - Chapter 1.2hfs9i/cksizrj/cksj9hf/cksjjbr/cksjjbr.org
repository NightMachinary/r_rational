Thank you for the advice. However, at the beginning of Worm, it doesn't /seem/ like the bullies have a lot going on other than to be bullies, or at least that's how I felt reading it. They just become more important later on. However, I can definitely see the jocks being something like plot pieces rather than characters in this, and definitely see that I should expand on the scene. I suppose I will go back and do so. Thank you, again.
