Read the other one, too. I like where you /can/ go with these, but right now I feel like I'm just spending a lot of time reading about things that won't be that important. You should try removing more, or answering: How does the reader know to feel like this is important?

I did like internal monologue explaining the guy's misanthropy, but not the encounter with the jocks, who don't feel like characters, or characters that could possible matter. Worm's bullies - a short lived role in the plot - have a great deal more going on than as a mere foil for characterization. HPMOR's bully scenes - wherein the bullies are, effectively, nameless characters - don't actually have anything to do with the bullies. The first is actually a scene between Harry and Neville, the second between them and Lestrange, and the SPEW encounters are about the interactions between the team members.

I like the confused timeskipping, but, if these are meant to be rational characters.... there's a deep lack of curiosity in something very strange, there.
