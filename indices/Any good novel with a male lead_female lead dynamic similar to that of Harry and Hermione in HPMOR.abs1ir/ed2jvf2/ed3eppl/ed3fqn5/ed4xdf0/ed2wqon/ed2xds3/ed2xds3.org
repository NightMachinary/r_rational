I suppose they mean friendly, and with more than a hint of rivalry, but not necessarily romantic (though everyone around them seems to expect that to happen).

Can't think of anything really out of my head. "UNSONG" had a lot of stuff going on, but the MC and his not-girlfriend had certainly a good and interesting relationship going.
