Well if there were no upper velocity value that would mean it would be unnecessary to relate space and time to ensure that the basic concept of force remains a meaningful concepts no mater any particular reference frame, so time dilation and spacial contractions for fast moving bodies would be completely unnecessary. Retaining the interpretation that the "speed" of light was an upper boundary on all speed would "technically" be true, but all the relativistic translations of these processes would be infinitely negligible, and thus not worth considering. But must people already considered that quite fantastic.

The more interesting thing would be that while we know that light acts as a means of propogating information concerning the acceleration of electromagnetic charges, because its wave-like properties are a consequence of the time delay associated with anything propogating at a finite speed if there was no time delay there would be no wave-like properties to speak of. The reason for that? Well the relationship between the speed of a wave to its wavelength and frequency is that the wave's speed equals its wavelength divided by its frequency or the length between the two closest peaks or troughs of the wave divided by the frequency with which those peaks or troughs take place with respect to time.

That implies just an instantaneous transferring of electromagnetic force would take place in the absence of an intermediate body of some kind introducing some kind of time delay while processing each input.

And if that weren't the case that would imply a very non-wave-like transferring of forces through various bodies. For example, if you were to press on a pole of any length the force being propogated by the repulsion of the like-charged electrons composing it would propogate that compressive force (not 'wave') in a way that allowed you to feel the effects of whatever was on the other side of the pole pushing back instantly. But that wouldn't be the only time that happened though. It is ridiculous just how much would be different because of that. That instantaneous transfer of electromagnetic force principle would apply to everything. It may even apply to other forces of nature, although I'd really have to look into it.

It would take me a long time to completely deconstruct and determine just how much you would have to counterbalance those implications to make it less removed from everyone's day to day experience to fully appreciate just how "not like here" that world would be and I'm pretty sure I don't have time for that today. Sounds interesting though.

Anyway, that's all I really had to say. Laters.
