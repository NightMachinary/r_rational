Wow I've been gone a while. I'm just gonna say that I don't really think that there would be no intermediate values for energy that can be transferred by this "insta-light" we are talking about. Basically, I'm saying that the idea I had doesn't actually seem to follow, which I really ought to have noticed at the time, but ah well.

In addition though, it has made me wonder how much the sky would be filled with light of different "wavelengths' and what not given the way that light propogates might vary. If matter actually took a finite time to "process" or receive and re-emit light and/or the energy associated with this process were lost during the process of absorption and re-emission.

For example, different warpings of light being "slowed down" due to their energy content and the kinds of emissions matter could and couldn't accept, allowing for something along the lines of wavelength specific time dilation of otherwise instantaneously transferred electromagnetic forces. Actually this consequence of basic optics could be used as an energy sink if a "toll" of sorts came into play, keeping the universe in balance and making this whole premise less universe breaking.

Granted, with electromagnetic forces being capable of being transferred instantaneously while other forces maintain a finite speed the instantaneous cancellation of these forces using various machines still seems imminently doable, so I'm thinking tractor beams are a much more practical idea when done right

Still, I'm just not sure about how well I can maintain the absence of privileged frames of reference on a universal scale given the possible direct consequences of [[/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olbers%27_paradox][Olber's paradox]] and how it tosses out certain models of the universe containg infinite stars, but there's probably a work around for that, it just adds even more complexity to the whole arrangement.
