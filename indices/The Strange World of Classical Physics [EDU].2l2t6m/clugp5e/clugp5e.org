This explains why a world with finite c has to use SR, but I wonder - what would a world with infinite c be like? Since Classical mechanics is a good approximation to SR when v<<<c, which is always the case for infinite c, how would physics in that world break down?

Similarly, if h_bar were zero, how would physics break down?

Edit: apparently, [[http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/ORTHOGONAL/ORTHOGONAL.html][this]] is supposed to be a good answer for the c -> inf case.
