I spent some time thinking about my own proposition, and concluded that everything would be invisible, and anything that could 'see' would instantly explode. This mostly stems from the same argument you made regarding wavelength.

An infinitely long wavelength would be permeable to all things, and never scatter. Since photon scattering is the basis of E&M interaction, this means all E&M would be impossible. As a side effect, all things would be invisible.

The other interpretation - that of infinite frequency - implies infinite energy. Anything which can pick up such photon (see it) will get instantly annihilated in an ungodly explosion... or does whatever it is that something which gains inf energy will do.
