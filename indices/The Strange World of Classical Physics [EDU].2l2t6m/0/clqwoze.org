Read this in high school and felt like revisiting it given I am currently taking University Physics had started reading through Yudkowsky's 'Quantum Physics' sequence recently.

The article presents the reader a uniquely imaginative and straightforward sense of why the theory of relativity (or the theory of the constancy of light) came to be and actually makes sense within the context of our real world through various thought experiments.

Hope you guys enjoy. Laters.
