Thanks very much for writing this! Things I appreciated:

- Fast pacing
- Disney references ("Olaf has a genie now?!")
- Exploration of the consequences of an intelligence explosion and self-replicating technology
- Real-feeling motivations and dialogue for Elsa, the Duke, Jack, and Olaf

Reminds me of Friendship is Optimal in the emotional effect it had on me. Bravo and thanks again :)
