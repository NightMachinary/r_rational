I'm spacing out the updates a little bit so that I can edit the chapters one by one as they get put up, but this is complete - the full story should be completely up by next Monday.

Hope you enjoy - comments, criticism, or reviews are welcome. It's not a complete "optimize the world and exploit everything" fic, mostly because I find it really hard to make a story that can actually survive that, and I'd rather write a story than just an exploration of ideas through conversation.
