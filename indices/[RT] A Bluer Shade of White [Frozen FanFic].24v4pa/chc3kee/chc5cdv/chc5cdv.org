Yes, that story is the original Snow Queen.

I get what you're saying about gender roles, but it's mostly a result of how I conceive of Elsa. She starts out the movie being very restrained and proper, a creature of order afraid of hurting people and losing control. Mid-movie, she basically just says "fuck it" and abandons her kingdom, responsibilities, and only family, swinging the pendulum pretty damned far in the other direction. Her motivation there is twofold - one, she thinks that she's going to hurt someone, and two, she's been bottled up so tightly for so long that she needs a release. And then at the end of the movie she swings back towards synthesis, takes up the crown again, and tries her best to live in harmony with her power.

But I have to believe that the end result of all that is that Elsa is a fundamentally cautious person. If Anna hadn't made it to the ice palace to tell her about the eternal winter, everyone in Arendelle would have died. Elsa has to think about that from time to time, especially given that her early life was shaped by a similar accidental use of her power when playing with her sister.

So it's not that Elsa isn't rational, it's that she's very wary of using her power, and cautious about upsetting the status quo because of how easily things could spiral out of control. I'm somewhat prejudiced to thinking that caution here is more than warranted; I'd like someone to figure out how to make a superintelligence safely before we actually try to make a superintelligence. The duke is supposed to sort of be a foil for her caution, and while he might be imaginative, that imagination is very optimistic about what the end results will be. I was originally going to try having Anna occupy that role, but I think that it fits Anna less well - she's impulsive by nature, but focused on people and relationships more than governance, economics, warfare, etc., and this way she gets freed up for a different role.

Anyway, I'll try to make some of that clearer in the coming chapters, and might go back and edit the first two. Elsa is (supposed to be) pretty smart and mostly rational, but she's more the kind of person who wants safety and security than the kind of person who wants to optimize everything as quickly as possible.
