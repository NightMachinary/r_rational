I like what you're doing with the story, especially how you continue the existing story, rather than having an earlier point of departure. What I also like is that there seem to be more than one thing going on, not just the improvement of Olaf.

My only criticism so far is that you've written it so that the idea of improving Olaf comes from a male OC. This might seem like pedantry, but HPMOR (and Less Wrong as well) already get the criticism that they make it look like rationality is something men do. It would have been easy enough to have the idea come from Elsa. It doesn't ruin the story, but it's something that jumped out to me.

The story with devil and cursed mirror is the original Snow Queen, right?
