I find I absorb info better visually, but audiobooks are just very enjoyable because they are passive. I can listen to an audiobook while I work, drive, play video games, while resting with my eyes closed, etc. Listening to audiobooks has let me consume so many more books than I did before, and there is something extra you get with a good narrator. In my head characters don't tend to have different accents, nor do they emote as strongly because that's not really something I understand very well. It is interesting to think about how a narrator's rendition of a book colors the experience (do they choose a voice based on fore knowledge of a character, and does that give hints about that character you would not have picked up on otherwise? Do they add inflection that's not technically in the description of just... so and so said?) anyway that's a tangent. I totally understand why someone wouldn't prefer audiobooks, but I'm a bit defensive because some people tend to look down on audiobooks as somehow less “intellectual” than visual reading. I guess the comments, “I have less than zero desire for an audiobook” and “I have no interest in listening to an audiobook for any reason EVER” came off as like, inherently close minded and made me feel like that person had some specific beef with audiobooks rather than just preferring a visual medium.
