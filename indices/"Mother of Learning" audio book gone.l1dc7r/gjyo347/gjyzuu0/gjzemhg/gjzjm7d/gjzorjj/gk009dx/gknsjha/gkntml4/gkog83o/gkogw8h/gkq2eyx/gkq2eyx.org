I'm not the GP, but I'm pretty anti-audiobook.

Personally, it's because I'm a “visual learner”, i.e. someone with an auditory processing disorder and/or ADHD who needs more time to parse a sentence (and think through its tangential implications) than a narrator/lecturer will tend to give.

I tend to turn on closed captions on every video/film/TV show they watch, despite in theory “understanding” what is being said. I find I can keep up much better with comprehending the words when reading them, than when listening to them.

But! It's not actually hard for me to absorb information presented auditorily (i.e. I'm not hard of hearing); I'm just /slow/ at it. I find that voice-acted dialogue /in video games/ is just fine for me --- because in those, you usually need to “press to advance” between message boxes, so I get the time I need to absorb each sentence/paragraph.

Slide presentations can work as well, if done well (i.e. when you have slide-wise control over the presentation, and the audio is split up such that the audio for the slide plays from the beginning when you focus that slide; rather than effectively being a video with “linear audio”, where the transport controls jump around in the audio stream, and slides stay in sync with that.)

But it's very rare for people who want to present large amounts of information to bother to put it in either of those formats. So I tend to just ask for a transcript instead. :)
