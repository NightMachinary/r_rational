Not sure about Spotify, but the man himself links each chapter on [[/r/Voraces]]

Edit: I just checked the links, and they're all 404 now. idk what's going on with it.

Voraces does have nobody103's permission for the recording, so I'm guessing it's just some sort of hiccup, but I don't know.

Edit 2: the most recent chapter shows this comment:

  Thank you everyone. It has truly been an honor to narrate this story for you. I hope you will enjoy the new project and maybe check out the other podiobooks narrated by me:

  [[https://seabornaudiobook.podbean.com/e/seaborn-audiobook-chapter-1/]]

  I look forward to bringing the definitive Mother of Learning audiobook to you soon on Audible.

I guess maybe the project is taken down because nobody103 and/or Jack Voraces are going to monetize, but that's just speculation.

Edit 3: from Voraces' Discord:

  @everyone Mother of Learning anouncement: As many of you already know from the livestream yesterday, the Mother of Learning Podiobook is finishing at chapter 87. The author is currently signing an exclusive deal with a major publishing company and they have asked for the podcast to be taken down. All episodes appart from 87 have been removed already. There is good news however, the publishers have agreed to have me do the official audiobook for Audible! We WILL get to finish this book, just not through the podcast.

  We are starting a new project that is a little challenging but has the potential to be aweseome. Check out the Book to New Worlds channel and #chapter-links for the introduction episode.
