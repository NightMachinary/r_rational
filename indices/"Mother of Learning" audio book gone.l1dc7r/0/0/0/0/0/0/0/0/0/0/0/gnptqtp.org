To each their own, but just FYI, most audiobook and podcast apps have pitch-corrected speed controls. I listen to most things at 1.5 or 2.0 speed and find I'm pretty much listening as fast as I'd be visually reading something that I wasn't skimming through. And of course, sometimes with books or parts of books that I'm particularly relishing, I'll dial it down to 1.0 to slow down so I can fully savor and appreciate a good scene or chapter. At other times I might dial up to 2.5-3.0 to skim through parts I'm not so crazy about.

I still visually read plenty, but I go through a surprising number of books annually via audiobook format alone just due to all the immense amounts of time that stack up between driving, working in the kitchen, cleaning, exercising, etc.
