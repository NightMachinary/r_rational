I loved the wonderful detail near the beginning of the story where Gilead writes an address label to an address in Chicago, then carefully hand-draws a postal bar code to a different address so when the mail robots read it, it will go somewhere else.

All of that was written not only before there were postal bar codes, but also before there were even zip codes.

Yet Heinlein not only gets his future tech correct, he explains it so someone living in the '40s can understand it.
