Probably comes as no surprise that I was quite put off by the characterisation of the female characters: even the Superhuman lady seemed to have an oddly 1950s sensibility about her.

The technology/etc all seemed pretty consistent with golden age sci fi. I loved the barcodes on the vacuum tubes that Joe was posting. Just all of it. So retro. It was adorable.
