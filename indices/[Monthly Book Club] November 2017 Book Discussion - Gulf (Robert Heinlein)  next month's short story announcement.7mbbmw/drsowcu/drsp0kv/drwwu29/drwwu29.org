  amount of information communicated per second is about equal. I'm relatively sure this is wrong. After WWII Americans did some studies on pilot reaction time, and transmitted information, like how much time do you need to transmit a set of orders to a pilot. And they concluded that japanese took about 1.5 time longer then English.
