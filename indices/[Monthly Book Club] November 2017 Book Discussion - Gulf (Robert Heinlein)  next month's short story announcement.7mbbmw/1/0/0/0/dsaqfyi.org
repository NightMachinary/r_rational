Switching every month would be great! Thanks so much for offering!

I was trying to do the "variety of tastes" thing, but solo, which didn't end up working out great for me.

Did you want to select a book to talk about in February and email/PM it to me (email probably better as it will be easy to track down) and then in a few days when I make the January thread I can put it in?

Should also add some boilerplate for "want to be the czar one month? want to be part of the regular rotation? then let us know! being the czar requires you select the book but also that you try and encourage discussion in the thread by posting a variety of your thoughts on the book" or something
