The first and last thirds were kind of boring action stuff that I don't personally really care for. The part with the cards was pretty neat and then when Kettle Belly has Joe come to his secret hideout and Joe learns speedtalk was all really, really good. Then the last third where they try and save the world was again just kind of boring generic action to me.

It makes me want to read more Heinlein though - I'm polyamorous and apparently there's a bunch of stuff like that in his books from the 80s though I'm not sure if I'd want to read all the "boring action" to get to it - does anyone have a "quiet" book of his to recommend? But I'm a bit concerned that even in the 80s the traditional gender roles would maybe put me off the stories a bit, so I'd be equally interested in any "non-traditional relationship" aspects in stories from more modern authors. I keep meaning to read /The Expanse/ because one of the main characters is the child of a large polyam family but I watched part of the TV series and while I really enjoyed it I didn't get caught up in it because detective stuff isn't so much my jam. (I think I'm just fussy in general, go figure!)
