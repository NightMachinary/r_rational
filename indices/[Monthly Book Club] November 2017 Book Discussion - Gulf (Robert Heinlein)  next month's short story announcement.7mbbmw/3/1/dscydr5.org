I think I mostly appreciated the fact that the author took a good stab at what being superhumanly smart might actually involve. It's dated, certainly, but he didn't just declare characters to be smart, he broke down the patterns of speech and problem-solving and behavior that they would use. It's thought-provoking even if it's wrong.
