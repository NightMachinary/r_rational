The Moon is a Harsh Mistress depicts a lot of the social aspects of having a penal colony on the moon with a highly disproportionate male to female ratio. Families are typically centered around one woman with many husbands.

IIRC, there's a whole bit that if a lunar woman accused a man of rape, it's expected that he'd be thrown out of an airlock by an angry mob pretty much immediately. From my understanding, Heinlein really bought into the "Battle of the Sexes"-narrative that women exert power over men by controlling the sex supply.
