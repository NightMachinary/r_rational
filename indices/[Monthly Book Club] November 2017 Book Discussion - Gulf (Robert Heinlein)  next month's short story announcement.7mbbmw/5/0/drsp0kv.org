I found the whole thing silly to be honest, I get the benefits of something like Basic English, but the amount of work it would take to remember all that not to mention producing new-to-your-vocal-tract sounds (an ability I think we more or less lose after childhood)... well, you'd have to be superhuman: and I guess they are... I'm not entirely sure I get the benefits. I remember reading somewhere that more dense languages tend to be spoken more slowly than less dense languages so the amount of information communicated per second is about equal across all languages. I wonder if speedtalk would suffer from that?

I suspect it's the reason that when I last checked a few years ago there's nobody who can speak lojban to any reasonable degree of fluency - the sentences are so dense that you have to overthink everything you say to a ridiculous degree. But maybe I'm mistaken?
