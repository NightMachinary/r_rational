There's people on fora who like learning and speaking languages, I know somebody who speaks toki pona actually and that's where they use it.

Now I have it in my head that the story was written in 1949 with respect to the level of knowledge, the stuff about language is less "bad science" and more "vintage science", so I give it more of a pass. Thanks for pointing that out!
