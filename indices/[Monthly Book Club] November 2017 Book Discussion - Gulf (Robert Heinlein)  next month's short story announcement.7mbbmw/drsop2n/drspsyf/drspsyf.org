Next month will likely be my last time posting the book club, if anyone wants to volunteer to post in Feb then please do. It gives you the powers of the book club czar which means you can select the book you want everyone to read. You're more than welcome to "host" as a once-off rather than taking it as a long-term commitment.

I'm happy to continue to make book club posts, perhaps every second month, if one or two other people would like to participate in it regularly.
