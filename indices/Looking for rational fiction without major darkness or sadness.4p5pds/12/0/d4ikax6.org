You mean the story where people go pretty much insane in their own personal time loops that rarely combine with each other and where one of the time loopers tortures/conditions the point-of-view character to enslave herself at the beginning of each time loop, then everything goes pear-shaped and trippy?

I'm pretty certain what you call light-hearted/upbeat and what I call light-hearted/upbeat do not intersect very often, if you're calling Time Braid light-hearted.
