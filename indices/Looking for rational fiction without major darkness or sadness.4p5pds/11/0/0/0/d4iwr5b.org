Um, I wouldn't have expected this to be a controversial premise. It seems obvious to me that /Luminosity/ (taken by itself---I didn't read the sequel) is a tragedy. [[#s][By the end of the book]] Made all the more upsetting because this was supposed to be a rationalist work. When /that's/ the ending for your rationalist protagonist, it doesn't feel like much of an advertisement for rationalism.
