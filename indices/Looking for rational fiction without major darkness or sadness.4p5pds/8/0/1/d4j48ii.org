Pact's magic is one of the most well-thought-out, amazeballs set ups I've encountered. The universe /literally/ runs on narration, for good and ill of the main character. People seriously exploit that fundament.

I'd argue it's "harder" than pretty much anything else out there. Runners-up are probably Dresden Files, Codex Alera, and Name of the Wind (at least that come to mind right now). Each of those have really solid setups /internally/, but I couldn't tell you how to cast a Dresden spell, or make a magic item in NotW. I /can/ tell you how to cast a Pact spell.
