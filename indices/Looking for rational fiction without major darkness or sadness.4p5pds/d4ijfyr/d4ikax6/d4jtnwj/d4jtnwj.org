Hmm All the things you mention do happen, but at least in my opinion the thing that makes it fairly upbeat and no really dark is the approach of the characters. The story is never about "god how could we possibly deal with this", its always about how the characters can grow and become stronger. And that combines with a world where this is possible.

Its similar to the difference between dragonball z and for example worm. sure, people are dying left and right on both, and they suffer on the way plenty of time, but dbz is lighthearted because the characters don't actually dwell on it. they just push on, and the world is built in a way where they actually -can- push on. On the other hand worm is not upbeat, because the characters do take note of their pain, and the world is -not- built in a way where they can just go on and overcome everything thrown at them.

Even when Sakura was a hostage in her own mind the narrative was not really "ohhh the sufferingggggg", it was "ok, so how am I getting outta here".
