And [[http://hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] by Eliezer Yudkowsky of course! It has some parts of sadness on the first read through but it has more light in it than any other book I've ever read. Doesn't matter if you're more into fantasy or science fiction. It is a combination of both. A real page turner :D!
