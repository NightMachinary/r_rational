I'll second Mother of Learning. With This Ring is pretty lighthearted, too, and has lots of optimization. Also, if you don't mind self-promotion, you might like my own books. (First one is [[http://amazon.com/Forging-Divinity-War-Broken-Mirrors/dp/1505886554][Forging Divinity]].) That said, all these choices are at least mostly rational, but not rationalist. Rationalist stuff is much harder to come by.
