I agree that I had been a little extreme in that statement so sorry for that.

However, I feel that it's a very serious responsibility at being a hero. Most of the time, the whole world depends on them so no, they cannot be naive, they have to be clever and as perfect as possible.

Just imagine that you're having a brain surgery and your life depends on that surgeon, will you want him to be human and make mistakes? 1 life and surgeons have to make sure to not make mistakes. Heroes have to be responsible for millions of those.

Obviously stories are just that. Stories. And I often find myself enjoying something much less serious. So I'm definitely in your team about liking innocence and naivety in our protagonists :) I stand by my word though and that's why I deeply respect this genre for making people realize the consequences of having the fate of the world dangling on a few people.
