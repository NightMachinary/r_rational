There's a list of noteworthy rational works in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][wiki.]] My personal favorites are:

- Friendship is Optimal: Hanna, the CEO of Hofvarpnir Studios, just won the contract to write the official My Little Pony MMO. Hanna has built an A.I. Princess Celestia and given her one basic drive: to satisfy everybody's values through friendship and ponies. Princess Celestia /will/ satisfy your values through friendship and ponies, and it /will/ be completely consensual. (Copied from the description. It's extremely good even if you, like me, have no other interest or background in the MLP fandom.)
- Pokemon: The Origin of Species: A rational take on Pok√©mon Red/Blue, seen through the lens of three very different protagonists.
- Worth the Candle: Most of the time, LitRPG is about as un-rational as it gets. WtC, however, is a brilliant deconstruction of the genre that plays with and subverts most of its key tropes.
- Worm: Arguably the best web serial in existence, Worm isn't /technically/ rational, but features many of the same themes. It's a reconstruction of the superhero genre with some of the best worldbuilding and characterization I've seen in fiction, and I rarely miss out in a chance to recommend it. The sequel, Ward, is in progress. (Avoid [[/r/parahumans][r/parahumans]], though, as it tends to be very spoilery. The same goes for the subreddit of...)
- A Practical Guide to Evil: If you're familiar with TvTropes, you'll appreciate this one. In the guideverse, common tropes and patterns in fantasy, such as heroes being guaranteed to survive long falls off cliffs and villainous monologues signaling imminent failure and/or death, are intrinsic laws of the setting. Meaning they can be exploited by anyone enough savvy enough to recognize them...be they heroes or villains.
