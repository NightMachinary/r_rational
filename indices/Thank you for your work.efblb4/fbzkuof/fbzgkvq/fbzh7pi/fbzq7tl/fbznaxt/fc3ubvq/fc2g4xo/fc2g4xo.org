Klein from [[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html][Lord of the Mysteries]] is one of my favourite rationalist MCs in that he often walks the reader through his thinking processes and leaps of logic. The guy's personality also shines pretty easily through his actions: a stoic miser with a strict moral code, a paranoid yet lonely fellow who keeps getting himself dragged into deadly situations (mostly of his own making) yet thrives in total chaos with his Batman levels of preparation, ability to think in his feet when plans inevitably go wrong and great talent at misdirection.

I've managed to get a few people here reading it over the last few months and it was mostly well received, with a few cultural/translator poor word choice issues due to being written by a Chinese author. I think you might like it too.
