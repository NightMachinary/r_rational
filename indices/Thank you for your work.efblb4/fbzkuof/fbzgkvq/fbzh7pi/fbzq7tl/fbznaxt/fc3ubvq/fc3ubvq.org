  Like most humans on the planet, I don't agree with stupid "heroes".
#+end_quote

I don't agree with that sentiment at all, because I don't expect perfect decisions from protagonists.

In fact, I love idiot heroes. I love characters who are bumble-kings. Characters who stumble and fail their way to victory. Because characters who aren't perfect, who are flawed, who have limited information, who don't always get what they want, who make terrible choices, are /fascinating/.

Because they're /human/. Certainly moreso than characters who make correct decisions every time, all the time.
