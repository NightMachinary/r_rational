Why would you expect a "hero" to be someone who is perfectly equipped for the task at hand? That's stupid. People don't do good works because they think they're a perfect fit for it. They do it because they /have to./ Because sitting by and doing nothing would be unthinkable.

By your logic, every heroic fantasy would be dead on arrival, because the villain would just run roughshod over everyone, while the goodies sat around with their thumbs up their asses, waiting for the perfect hero to show up and fix all their problems. Which will never happen, /because perfect heroes don't exist./

That's why I like flawed heroes. Because they're /real./ Because they're people who are determined to do good, despite their limitations. Because they're people who deal with the world in front of them. Because they're people who are scared shitless of failure, but try anyway.

Of course I'd want a brain surgeon to be a perfect, error-less robot. But they're not. They're human beings. They are going to make mistakes. Surgery is hard, and people die in hospitals all the time, even with surgeons and doctors doing everything they can to prevent that.

Medical professionals know this. And yet they still turn up to work, every day. Because trying to help, and sometimes failing, is still better than not trying at all.

You can make all the best moves and still lose. That's not weakness. That's life.
