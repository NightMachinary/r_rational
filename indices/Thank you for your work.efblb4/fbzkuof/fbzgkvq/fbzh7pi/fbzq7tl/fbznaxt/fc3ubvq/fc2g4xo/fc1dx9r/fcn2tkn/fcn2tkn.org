Well, I'm partial to [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-fourteen.8938/][With This Ring]], though it's certainly not to everyone's taste.

Pros:

- The author attempts to keep comic book powers more or less self-consistent.
- The protagonist pays attention to the potential uses of superpowers. If a cosmic rod can create force fields and take a man into orbit, powered only by cosmic radiation, then there ought to be cosmic converter based electricity stations. If gnomes can steal people away through fairy rings, then they have an instantaneous and non-polluting form of mass transit.
- Updates daily, almost without fail.
- Multiple alternate timelines (Paragon, Renegade, Common Sense) give different perspectives on similar events.
- Characters and events are included from all over the DC universe, typically with accompanying wiki links to introduce them.
- The author is quite active in the accompanying discussion thread.

Cons:

- The style doesn't suit everyone: very slow paced (over two million words and counting), episodes are somewhat self-contained (but can have ripple effects), first-person present tense.
- The main timeline, Paragon, sometimes comes across to people as a Boring Invincible Hero.
- Renegade takes a while to hit its stride, and some people just don't like it at all.
- Won't be finished for decades.
