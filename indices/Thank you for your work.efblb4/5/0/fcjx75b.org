I think you're going too far on the opposite end.

People like competence, like rational thinking, like protagonists showing off intelligence as long as it is /realistic/. Realistic being defined as people making the best decisions they could (at least, better than what the average reader could think up in short time) given the limited amount of information at their disposal, in pursuit of their short and long term goals.

Rational protagonists are not emotionless robots nor perfect, they can very well have personal flaws, weaknesses and certain biases. They are merely those who make decisions that the reader can recognize as brilliant or ingenious occasionally, and arrive at their decisions in a way that can be easily followed along.
