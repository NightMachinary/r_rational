I personally stopped reading (and won't continue) reading A Practical Guide; not because of anything against it (in fact I think it's a really good story) but you can sort of learn the same lessons by actually reading the original stories where the tropes are from too. Plus to me it's kind of the same "journey" as WtC and I just prefer that one, so I read that instead.

Agreed on Worm. One thing I would like to see in the world is a faithful take on Worm as a movie or TV series, because I think making it that visceral would be beneficial to people to see just how bad a world that requires "superheroism" actually is.

Also, historically I effectively paid about $16,000 just to read it and learn a bit about how statistics was typically taught, which in hindsight is probably the best bargain I ever made (despite lack of academic achievement 2014 was a good year for me) and so I'm hoping that the author will make a significant amount more money from the work than they have.
