There are some questionable word choices I dislike from the translator but it only turns what is a 9/10 work to a high 7/10. Still very readable because the plot and characters carries it well, but I only wish the translation was better and didn't turn off people who can't stomach it.

Other criticisms of this story I've heard from friends include long chapters describing hermetic rituals in detail by the author "showing their work" and fluffing up the background, and many named characters being introduced in the first volume which can be overwhelming (some of the Western names are sort of anachronistic as well, as expected of a non-Western writer). All of this is restricted to the first volume though, after which the story takes off and goes crazy (in a good way).

Resist the urge to get spoiled until you caught up, seriously.
