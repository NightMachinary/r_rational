Oh, one other thing I wanted to mention.

Portal fantasy is a convenient genre, because it's inherently a fish out of water scenario where the audience identifies with the fish and sees things through their eyes. The audience enters into the new world along with the protagonist, and learns things as the protagonist learns things. This is very helpful for the purposes of getting exposition out.

In contrast, you don't get those benefits from a reverse portal fantasy. Any worldbuilding of the protagonist's homeworld has to be done in short order, usually within a chapter or two at the beginning, or a very brief scene in a movie. I think that might be one of the reasons that reverse portal fantasy is very often media-aware; it allows authors to quickly sketch out a homeworld that's intentionally generic or a riff on things that the audience is already aware of. That keeps the writer from having to frontload too much exposition.
