[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/emergence-rwby.308628/][Emergence]] is exactly a story about that.

Cute girls(team RWBY) who are learning to kill monsters are dropped into our worlds with no way to get back home. Our beleaguered friendly and ordinary group of Earthlings decided to help them out, sometime risking serious life and limb and jailtime. It's an adventure story led by perfectly ordinary characters with mostly helpless main protagonists of a different series.(they can fight, but what can you really do when confronted with unfamiliar culture and language and people?)

Then the government found out and gave them the opportunity to go to school, have an identity, and so on, and took it off from said ordinary Earthlings.

Then it morphed into a slice of life school fanfic for a while.

Finally, that phase ended with another set of team(JNPR) coming through, along with the villains(they had a confrontation), except the the boss got a screw loose here and there, and proceeded to eventually blow the masquerade wide open into a military thriller.

Said military thriller then become a first contact fiction as well, as the big bad behind the villains are revealed, and they wanted to invade Earth.

Overall, it's an enjoyable read with some uneven quality. But I recommend it for anyone who's interested in a thoughtful exploration of the concept.
