Charles Stross' The Nightmare Stacks came out last Tuesday, but is otherwise EXTREMELY qualified for this challenge. It is also REALLY, really good. Not really rationalist, which is why I made my thread praising it [[https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/4qf4c9/charles_stross_nightmare_stacks_laundry_files_7/][over in /r/printsf/]] rather than here, but if this trope interests you at all you should check it out (though the Laundry Files are best read with the context of having read earlier novels as well).
