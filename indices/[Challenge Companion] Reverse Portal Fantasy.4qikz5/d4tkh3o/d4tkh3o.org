Man, there are so many of these in MLP fanfiction it's ridiculous.

Here's a few links from my favorites on fimfiction (that is, complete stories):

[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/23693/this-isnt-my-house][This isn't my house!]] - [Comedy]

[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/76290/celestia-sleeps-in][Celestia Sleeps in]] and it's incomplete sequel [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/132779/onto-the-pony-planet][Onto the Pony Planet]]- [First contact - my favorite of my favorites]

[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/23103/the-roommate][The Roomate]] - [Rainbow Dash is an exchange student]

[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/112663/pillow-case][Pillow Case]] - [OC pony is an exchange student]

[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/159150/the-eagle-has-landed][The Eagle has Landed]] and [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/164531/the-eagle-is-sealed][The Eagle is Sealed]] - [The apollo mission finds Princess Luna]

[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/95264/the-seventh][The Seventh]] - [Celestia on earth]

There are also a truly massive number of "x pony appears in real life, person tries to hide them from the ebul gubmint stories" but I don't have any complete ones on my favorites list.

MLP:FiM also has a pretty staggering amount of regular portal fantasies as well.
