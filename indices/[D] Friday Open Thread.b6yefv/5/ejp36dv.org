My husband got offered a job last night (YAY!!!) and... the employment contract says "you'll be working 38 hours a week. you may be required to work additional reasonable hours on evenings, weekends, and public holidays. all additional hours are reasonable"

And I'm telling him to nope the fuck out of that last sentence and don't sign the damn thing if they don't accept that. They literally say he might have to work "reasonable" extra time on nights, weekends, holidays.... and then in the same breath say that "all time is reasonable"?!?! I think our labour laws say that reasonable additional hours are OK to make someone work, but there's [[https://www.fairwork.gov.au/how-we-will-help/templates-and-guides/fact-sheets/minimum-workplace-entitlements/maximum-weekly-hours][a definition of what makes something reasonable]] - not a blanket fucking statement that his employer's every whim is reasonable.

So now I'm going through employment law rabbithole (thank you union for teaching me enough to know what to google!), and I think I found the award he'll be employed under (or similar): [[http://awardviewer.fwo.gov.au/award/show/MA000065]] so at least I can work out what the minimums are... though of course that document doesn't actually contain any provisions about hours worked/etc so it's actually not that helpful ugh.

EDIT: they wouldn't remove the ridiculous clause from the contract so fuck 'em, he's turned the job down
