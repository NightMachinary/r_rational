Yeah, I've noticed a lot of people are unsatisfied with how the plot is unfolding after 136, which is pretty understandable.

But, in my opinion, the author has managed to accrue a lot of goodwill with me over +130 chapters, so I'm willing to give Aka the benefit of the doubt and see where it goes. We do know that everything is building up to the Christmas party, and it doesn't look like he's stalling until then, so I'm cautiously optimistic. I'm just hoping that the payoff is good.

I actually do like the Ishigami and Miko segments, especially their big climactic moments (election and the sport festival). I do think Miko is a bit underdeveloped, but it looks like that's going to change soon, given the increasing focus on her now.

The french kissing thing is just Hayasaka being an embarrassed idiot, mixed with some jealousy I imagine.

Oh, and someone translated a recent volume extra (can't find it for some reason) which basically had the author apologizing in advance for the stupidity readers were about to witness and advising them to come back in three days (Christmas).

As the author seemed to be able to prediction people's response to recent chapters, I'm guessing he has a plan, so again, I wouldn't worry too much.
