After enjoying the Love Is War anime so much I decided to read the manga (my first ever, what a milestone!). These were my thoughts, as of the latest issue:

*The Good:*

- They didn't let the Kaguya/Miyuki 'conflict' grow too stagnant, and even though they were both trying to get each other to confess still after 100+ issues it was still possible to feel the progress in their relationship. They managed to make this changing dynamic work well with the humour too, i.e one of my favourite new gags was Kaguya trying to get Miyuki flustered, such as trying on a cute cosplay, and instead of Miyuki getting flustered he straight out admits what she's after/tells her how amazing she looks and /she/ ends up being the one flustered.

- The central conflict in general was handled well (up until after the climax) and the climax at the Culture Festival was great. The scene had a lot of feeling and was a great payoff.

- Whenever the side characters were featured /in conjunction/ with one of the main two, or when the entire student council as a whole as assembled, I thought they were used to great effect. Bonus points if they had their own little character arcs worked into the protagonist's arcs such as Hayasaka's, which was a personal favourite of mine. On the other hand when the side characters functioned as their own protagonists in an issue...

*The Bad:*

- ...When one of the side characters, most notably Ishigami or Miko, were the protagonists of an issue the story turned from this unique take on a rom-com with scheming, mind games, insightful social dynamics and comedic absurdity into...some cookie cutter generic high school angst story. Fujiwara and Hayasaka were great examples of side characters being used to better explore the main two protagonists and in the doing, to have their own hilarious character moments. Ishigami and (very occasionally) Miko were used like this at times but when they went off on their own they couldn't hold my attention without the core cast.

- What on earth is going on post-climax? What is the gimmicky garbage filling my once great manga with 'Chiba'(?) Kayuga and then some personality-shifting-ice-princess-contrived-drama bullshit? I was so incredibly disappointed reading the latest issue (142)(though the cold hands gags was genuinely funny) and hope it's not a sign of things to come. There still so much they can do with the two characters even after they've all but confessed; there's power dynamics at play in every relationship and there's a bunch of hurdles and milestones, especially in a first time relationship, that would make for great content. There's no need for such suspension of disbelief breaking contrived rubbish.

*The 'Wut?':*

What's up with how French kissing is treated? Is this a convention of anime/manga that French kissing is almost the equivalent of sex or is this some sort of Japanese social norm?

Overall the good certainly outweighed the bad and I intend to keep reading.
