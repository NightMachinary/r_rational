For me about French kissing, these are Japanese teenagers. It's not a convention of anime/manga because usually they don't even GET to French kissing in anime/manga. There's a reason why the "handholding? LEWD!" meme exists. Japan is generally very conservative about PDA. So the implication is that if you French kiss you're probably already so physical you're close to having sex. But in general, they're teens, and teens with a poor sex ed at that, they're just figuring this shit out as they go.

About the last developments, I think it's intentionally frustrating and it'll get solved soon. I don't mind for now, Chibi Kaguya was funny and probably meant as a gag 'breather' chapter. It's a pattern, after the huge climax of an arc you have some kind of unwinding, and that's where we are right now. I think there will be a better resolution soon enough, and hopefully we can move to more interesting interactions. Though I dread where the Miko-Ishigami thing will go, because honestly, I just don't see them as a good couple at all.
