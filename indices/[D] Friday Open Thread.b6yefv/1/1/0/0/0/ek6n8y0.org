My problem with 'weed-out' courses is multi-folded.

Generally, I find that they are often taught by people not actually pursuing that field of knowledge. Specifically, my organic chemistry and Physics 2&3 courses were taught by professors that were at the University to do research and were required to teach a course. As they couldn't find anyone to teach what was considered the hardest 'weed-out' courses, they taught those.

Additionally, they often only teach the simplest aspects of a course in class and expect you to do the grunt of the legwork yourself without explaining how to combine simpler theories into more complex ones, as if everyone should just naturally be able to do so and has practice doing it. Then they get condescending when asked about the thought process on reaching the conclusion. This was never an issue for me with organic chemistry as it is my favorite subject, but I struggled mightily with physics and was looked down upon for it.

Often times I found that the higher level courses taught basic concepts much more pricesly and succinctly than the 'weed-out' courses required to reach those classes.
