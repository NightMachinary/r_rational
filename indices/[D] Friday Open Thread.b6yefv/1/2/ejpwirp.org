I recall doing a physics course in university, which was taught by two separate professors with very different exam styles. The first professor would expect you to memorise the relevant equations and simply (mechanically) apply them to the questions as given - finding a faster but equally correct way to reach the same answer was given only partial credit.

The second professor would give you a sheet containing the equations in the exam, but then require you to use them in innovative ways to find the answer.

...my grades went up /significantly/ when the second professor took over.
