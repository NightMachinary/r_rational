Reminds me of my first Computer Science classes at University of Rochester a little bit. Let me share my horror story of badly taught college classes.

My professor was due to retire literally the next semester so the class that he was teaching was the very last class he would ever teach. Hence he had a bad habit of getting bored with what he was teaching and meandering off into tangents that was barely related to the material he was supposed to cover!

It was a very frustrating class where we would be doing HW assignments and taking tests on material that were either barely touched on in the class to not at all. The only reason I got a C was because of the amazing TAs who put a lot of time and effort into tutoring the students. I think the only people with Bs or As were people who already knew the material but didn't have AP credits.

To add another note to this story of woe, the very next semester, I had to take a specific CS requirement course that was only offered in the spring and I was all excited for a better professor......and the same professor came back for one more semester of teaching!!!!!

I am a student with minimal experience in CS; please explain the basics before jumping off into material that requires the basics to understand!?!?!

That semester I got a D in his class, and for comparison, an A in an AI Development class which was considered to be harder than the first class.

Whew, didn't mean to go into that much detail sharing my horror stories, but yeah, bad requirements and bad teachers are in every school.
