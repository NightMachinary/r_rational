I had the recent pleasure of watching a high school performance the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seussical][Suessical]] last week. It was cute, but kind of bittersweet. Part of that was my insight into the production - my sisters were on crew, and privy to a lot of the drama going on in the background. Many of the senior actors refused to work in the musical in protest, because it was a step down from the productions they worked on before. There was one backdrop and maybe three or four movable props. This is coming from the school that built a moving car for their production of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEzaMe7Lmew][/Chitty Chitty Bang Bang/]]. As crew members, my sisters have been consistently disappointed in the new stage-director's insistence on minimalist sets, and this was the embodiment of that.

Other than that, the Suessical also feels kind of... slimy? The same way Broadway shows always do, in that supporting a performance of a musical means supporting the theater industry, unless the performance wasn't properly licensed. I'm already disheartened by how copyright works in more mainstream media, so I'm not super psyched that Broadway is allowed to clamp down on the distribution of recordings of musicals the way they do, even if that recording isn't even on Broadway.

I'm nearing the end of my second semester of college, and let me tell you, if you get the opportunity to study Software Engineering at RIT, choose Computer Science instead. I hate that I have to say that, seeing as it's my major, but it's true. Even if RIT has one of the oldest Software Engineering programs around, there are a few really /strange/ prerequisites. I have to take University Physics I and II, and pass both with higher than a C. This is a requirement on a technicality - all engineering majors have to take UP I & II, and Software Engineering is still "engineering" even if it's mostly computers. Knowing this subreddit, you might not think that's a big deal. But UP II is one of the more notorious weed-out classes for the /Physics/ major. So I have to struggle through this elaborate /70%/ fail-rate hazing ritual for physics majors because my degree is tangentially related to the discipline. (To put this in perspective, two of the six people at my table have taken this class and failed before. I'm the only freshman in the room.) If it were enriching /and/ difficult, I would be happier about it. But it's mostly a chore.

The worst thing about it is that, because it's a required course, the college didn't take my AP Physics credits. That's okay in the long-term, because I still had about a semester and a half's worth of credits in AP courses going into college without it, but I'd still appreciate being rewarded for the effort. University Physics I was mostly review of the same material.

EDIT: And if the degree had the general science requirement that Computer Science had, I wouldn't need to take any classical science classes at all, because I carried over like six credits worth of AP Biology. So not only did they deny my Physics credits, they treated my hard-fought biology credits as /electives/. Ugh.
