I'm nearing the end of Baba Is You, which I've been liking quite a bit. (It's a block-pushing puzzler where the words that make up the rules can be pushed, which changes the rules.)

My only real problem with the game is that some of the rules can only be found by discovery, since there's no manual. Normally I like that in a puzzle game, but the game has to teach you the rules in some other way. The Witness was really good about that. Baba Is You ... not so much. Two or three times I've been stumped by some hitherto unknown arcana of how the game works on a programmatic level, with no clear way to arrive at the solution aside from trying stuff until unexpected behavior occurs.

Other than that, I'm finding it really enjoyable, especially since it does that wonderful puzzle game thing of having two levels which are, on the surface, similar to each other, but vary in just slightly different ways so that different solutions are needed. It's also got some really bizarre/abstract puzzles in it that make me laugh before I get to the actual business of solving them.
