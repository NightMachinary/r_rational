Ah, and one more thing before I leave. Years ago, my birth city of Rochester built a ferry to take people from the shores of Seabreeze to the city of Toronto. When it was built, it was touted as a major way to increase tourism in the area. But it turns out that, while people from Rochester wanted to visit Toronto, nobody in Toronto wanted to visit Rochester. So the ferry was sold, and political humiliation for those involved in the project was left in its wake.

Where is it now?
