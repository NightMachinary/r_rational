  The french kissing thing is just Hayasaka being an embarrassed idiot, mixed with some jealousy I imagine.

This was my first thought (even though it would be odd given that Hayasaka has been set up as the knowledgeable and level headed one) but then Kaygua double checked over the phone with that side character who's in a relationship and she backed up Hayasaka.

  I'm guessing he has a plan, so again, I wouldn't worry too much.

I'm not sure there is any way to retroactively make the last few issues less awful but I'd mostly be happy if the author just avoided...whatever it is he's been doing post-climax. I do agree that he's built up goodwill and I'm willing to persevere for a while.
