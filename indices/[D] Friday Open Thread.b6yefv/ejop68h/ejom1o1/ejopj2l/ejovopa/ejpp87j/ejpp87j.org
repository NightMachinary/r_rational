I've been enjoying reading about calvary charges lately. The way the riders hype themselves up to calm their nerves, doing their best to ride as hard as they could while struggling to avoid impaling themselves into a forest of spears, those that decide to abandon all self-preservation instincts and throw themselves and their horses bodily into the enemy formation, opening them up for their comrades following close behind. The mentality and the minute details described by a good writer are so vivid I can imagine the scene as if it was a movie.

Apart from the Sharpe series, I've been enjoying those parts from the translation for the Chinese webnovel the Amber Sword, and the Japanese light novel Girl Who Ate A Death God. The flag waving, lance shining, horses snorting, sheer energy behind a wedge of heavy cavalry cutting straight through men to save the day at a critical moment is exhilarating.

It makes me want to take up a pen too. Then put it back down and play some Medieval 2 Total War.
