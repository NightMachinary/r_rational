Don't be too worried. I'm not in any danger of failing. But still, it's insane that I can put more work into this class than I have into any class I've ever taken in my life and barely scrape by with a C+. I'm far from a dumb student - if people like me have trouble keeping their grades up in a class like this, it's probably not well designed. I really feel like they ought to have split the curriculum for this class in two, but maybe they wanted the symmetry of a two course series over an actually sensible design.
