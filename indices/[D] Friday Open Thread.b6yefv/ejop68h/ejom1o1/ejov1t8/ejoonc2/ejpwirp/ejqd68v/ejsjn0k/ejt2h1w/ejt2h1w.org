The school /definitely/ has a CS/SE separation - there are dedicated Software Engineering courses that focus on things like product delivery, the design process, and the engineering process. And regardless, UP II would still be a tacked on course - it might make me a smarter, better-rounded person, but unless I want to dabble in computer engineering I'm not going to need to know more than I learned in digital electronics class in high school.
