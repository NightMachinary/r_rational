/shrug/ mine did 2 of: Calculus I and II, Statistics, Linear Algebra, Intro to Programming I and II (various languages), or Symbolic Logic (philosphy). For all students.

My point is that there are often reasons, and you should ask around if you care to know why. Maybe get the policy changed for future students.
