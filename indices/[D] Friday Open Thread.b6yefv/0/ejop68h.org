I have been a fan of xianxia genre for a while now and I have noticed I feel an odd sense of [[/r/gatekeeping][r/gatekeeping]] when ever someone recommends the Cradle Series by Will Wight. In my mind I picture the people who recommend it as normis who aren't True fans just because they didn't have to force themselves to read unfinished, badly translated garbage to get into the genre.

I know that it's a silly thing to get annoyed about especially since a well written western xianxia series is likely good for genre and will lead to more high quality works in the future.

Also the people who recommend cradle are likely just as big fans of the genre as I am who are just glad that they don't have to read badly translated garbage anymore..
