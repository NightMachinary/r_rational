I feel an odd sense of gatekeeping whenever I encounter badly translated garbage. Like, who are you to present this series to me as if it were translated when it looks like you just ran it through a machine translator and didn't bother editing it? Some fans put forth time and effort to translate series that they enjoy so that other people like me who don't speak foreign languages can enjoy them too. And some people submit awkward garbage that's barely even gramattical and pretend that it's English. In many cases, it's worse than if they didn't even bother, because if a bad translator claims a series it might dissuade more competent fans from doing a proper translation of that series. And it also wastes my time that I spent looking through it and makes it take longer to find good series with proper translations.

Maybe I shouldn't be too harsh on people, given that I haven't put forth the effort to properly learn a foreign language and am just free-riding on the work of other people. But at least I'm not a negative contributor to a public good.
