  the rules can only be found by discovery, since there's no manual. Normally I like that in a puzzle game, but the game has to teach you the rules in some other way.

I'm having memories of highschool, playing one game on an emulator because my (beige-era) mac was too new for it. It was a huge set of puzzle minigames in an overworld, and /none/ of them had manuals. Some were simple and straightforward, such as the Towers of Hanoi clone, but some (Like the Blackjack/poker derivative) were completely opaque. Figuring out what the question was was half the fun.
