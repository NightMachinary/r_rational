I dare not call this fully "rational" so I didn't publish it in the main thread, as it's mostly silly and the details don't stand much to scrutiny, but I just wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13248803/1/The-cage-of-light][The Cage of Light]], a Star Trek TNG story about what happens when reward systems go... /very/ awry. Hope someone finds it fun!

(also apologies to anyone following The Optimised Wish Project, I know, I've been horribly slow writing and updating recently. I'll try publishing something next week. It's been a stressful time and I've not had much inspiration, or it's been erratic and focused on different things)
