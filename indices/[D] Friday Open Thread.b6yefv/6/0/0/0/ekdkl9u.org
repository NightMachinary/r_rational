  but then Kaygua double checked over the phone with that side character who's in a relationship and she backed up Hayasaka.

See my comment above, they're figuring stuff out as they go, so Kashiwagi might feel like that too, but her relationship is very different from Kaguya. They're not deeply in love or anything, they got together on a whim, and will probably break up sooner or later. My guess is they just were being horny teens, and as soon as it got to the point of them being in condition to French kiss - namely, alone, in a closed space, since that's not the sort of thing you'd usually do in public in Japan - they went all the way.
