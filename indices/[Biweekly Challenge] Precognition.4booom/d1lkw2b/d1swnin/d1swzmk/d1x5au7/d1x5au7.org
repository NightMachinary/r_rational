How does the border work, though? If the border is permeable, why doesn't the ground fall down out of the simulation or the room become weightless, and why doesn't the air dissapate? If the border isn't permeable, what if the environment is moving relative to her - if she's on a train, do the railway tracks bounce off the border and wreak havoc inside the simulation, or are she and the train crushed against the side? Why is there a gravitational potential differential supplied across the simulation, but not an electrical potential differential? More relevant to the story, wouldn't the room run out of air with two people and a diesel generator running in a confined space?

Also, this seems very likely but particularly gruesome, so it bears mentioning: what happens to people on the edge of her range? Does she constantly see people get splinched in half and bleed out in her simulations?
