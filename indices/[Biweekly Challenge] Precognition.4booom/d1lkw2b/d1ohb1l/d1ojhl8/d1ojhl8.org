  Thirty minutes after a simulation begins, when the present catches up to the start of a simulation, is she able to split her awareness attention between her actions in the simulation and her actions in the present without both suffering?
#+end_quote

She cannot split her awareness, but she /can/ "fast-forward" through a vision - which amounts to experiencing 30min in an (objective) instant. Which is a ridiculously broken power, but she kind of needs it to make the story work (otherwise she's just a Coil variant).

  In the first place, how accurately is she able to remember her words from subjectively thirty minutes ago, boredom aside?
#+end_quote

Not very accurately. 1stVision!Mark was already dead by the point the story began. But on-screen!Mark didn't realize that, and Agatha doesn't really care.

  Why spend time playing poker and then bet the winnings on a single roulette number, rather than bring in money and make the same bet on the first winning number?
#+end_quote

Roulette doesn't work very well with her power. The slightest perturbation could make the ball fall somewhere different. Poker is a more reliable money-maker (she can just look at the cards while the other players are freaking out about the dark void). But that day, she just happened to walk past the roulette when, for some reason (e.g. a debris on the wheel) the outcome became predictable. So she jumped at the chance to multiply her winnings.

Same reasoning with the slot machines. Maybe she has a habit of trying out all the machines on her way in just in case.

And yeah, this is a pretty tedious way to make money. I'm sure Agatha's power can be munchkined /much/ more efficiently. Possibly she's just not very smart.

  Also, do the slot machines not require an external electricity supply?
#+end_quote

Okay, you got me there. I did write this story at 4am.
