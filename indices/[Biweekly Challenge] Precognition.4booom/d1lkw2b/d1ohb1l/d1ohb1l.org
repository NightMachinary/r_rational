<snerk> Amusing.

Thirty minutes after a simulation begins, when the present catches up to the start of a simulation, is she able to split her awareness attention between her actions in the simulation and her actions in the present without both suffering? (Or do the simulations not last longer than 30min generally?) In the first place, how accurately is she able to remember her words from subjectively thirty minutes ago, boredom aside?

Hmm. Why spend time playing poker and then bet the winnings on a single roulette number, rather than bring in money and make the same bet on the first winning number?

Also, do the slot machines not require an external electricity supply? Are jackpots frequent enough that she can 'steal' a jackpot that someone else would have gotten, or does she have to tediously try every slot machine a certain number of times to see if one gives a jackpot? (The 'two times': coincidence, or did she come because she already knew from a news report that someone was going to win there? --But how could she hear a news report inside the bounded simulation?)
