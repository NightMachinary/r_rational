  why doesn't the ground fall down out of the simulation or the room become weightless, and why doesn't the air dissapate?
#+end_quote

I decided to just quietly ignore the gravity question (and did not think of the air pressure question). If you want an excuse: maybe the vision runs an extremely low-resolution simulation of everything outside the borders?

#+begin_quote
  If the border isn't permeable, what if the environment is moving relative to her
#+end_quote

Her ability is all but useless in a moving vehicle, yes. The vehicles inside her vision would keep crashing.

#+begin_quote
  Does she constantly see people get splinched in half and bleed out in her simulations?
#+end_quote

Yup, if she's using it in a somewhat crowded area.

But at some point I'll just have to apologize. This was not written with enough care to make it true hard-sf-plus-magic.
