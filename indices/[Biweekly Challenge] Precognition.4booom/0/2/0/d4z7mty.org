  What happens if the void intersects with a person?
#+end_quote

Anything outside her range ceases to exist. So they'd get [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalCut][portal cut]]. Lots of screaming, blood everywhere. Perfect distraction to check someone else's poker hand.

  Or if it intersects with the roof, does it kill her?
#+end_quote

Huh, hadn't thought of that. Yes, that chunk of ceiling would fall and possibly kill her. (Well, only her simulated future self.)
