Thank you for the reply! (This has also been fun to continue to think about.)

A thought: In the Omega box-choosing thought experiment, by choosing a box you can effectively influence the well-informed prediction about which box you would pick. Here, however, if you're real then however much you try to wreck the conversation it will still end well for her. Trying to make the conversation end well only has the potential payoff of preventing a simulation after yours, if you're a simulation.

By the same reasoning, it's arguably in his interests to make a try for intercourse whether or not he's a simulation--it will only happen in reality if she wants it to, but in a simulation it could make a difference to how you spend your last minutes (and for how long, and whether you could build a favourable(?) emotional connection).

Going-well-for-her aside, it should set off warning bells when she's not telling both the simulation and the real that they're real from the beginning, as one would predict she'd try lots of different conversations and choose the one that gave the best results for her by, say, leaving the best impression (and not overly alarming the reporter). The lack of foreknowledge would seem to interfere with this, but that can mostly be handled by running a similar simulation (at least) twice: once for knowledge ('think of a number'), and once with knowledge ('I can tell you your number (and in reality copy how the rest of this conversation is going to go, if there are no problems)'). ((Expectations subject to insufficient-munchkining. Still, again, a conversation feeling.)) --Ah, right, the conversation feeling awkward with him mostly leading and her mostly responding is a warning sign in terms of flow, as the real version might be expected to have her in complete control of the conversation's direction, without unnecessary dead-ends.

The 'threat of making and doing bad things to lots of simulations' is interesting to think about. If there are three people no way to tell which two are copies and which one is real, all three including the real one will choose to kill the real one instead of the two copies in order to raise the subjective likelihood that that one survives. However, if you're the real one and are about to scan your brain, knowing that hour later the scans will be embodied in different planets and (new paragraph--)

A: The embodied copies will die after one day while the original continues living the whole time, or

B: Before the copies are embodied, the original will be killed while fully conscious, but both copies will continue to live, then

it looks as though the original, knowing it will continue to be the original after the brain scan, will prioritise its own survival over that of the copies who will only remember having been it. In that sense, threatening to make and torture copies of you is unwanted, but not as immediately frightening than if you didn't know whether you were real or a copy.
