(--Huh. I misunderstood what you meant about what happened to the Golden Man, and when reading that expected them to make his visible paths 'run and flee gunshots for a few hours in direction A', 'run and flee gunshots for a few hours in direction B', 'unopposedly confidently stride to the euthanasia chamber and be treated like royalty (with the company of a beautiful woman?) for a few hours', with him only later seeing enough to realise that after spending several hours there they were then going to kill him (because he doesn't see or react to things already-planned for past his field of view).)

Ahh, I somehow missed that that was in reaction. In reality, then, she gets his ATM card somehow and with his PIN loots everything he has? That seems as though it would bring the police down on her quickly, however. (--Ahh, I see, or now she can threaten real!Mark with numerous copy annihilation, since she now knows he's scared of it.)

The 'split off' verb is important. A planarium or flatfish comes to mind, but we can think of this as the difference between 'change person to static data, change two copies of data to living matter' and 'take static-data copy of living matter, change one copy of data to living matter'. The first case can also be modelled as the original one dying, but is irrelevant if unavoidable; the decision falls down a level to deciding what happens to the copies, since the survival of the original embodied pattern isn't even on the table. (And, again, the entire thought exercise could be pointless if sleep meaningfully kills the original in the same way, rather than being a less serious state.)

Hmmmm. If it's a portion of the universe cut out as a temporary pocket dimension, it could be a splitting-off scenario. If it's all in wetware, then the physical neurons of real!Mark should never have a future in which they end up in a simulation, even if virtual neurons are later constructed in a configuration which mirrors them. (real!Mark cannot become virtual!Mark, but virtual!Mark is Mark as much as real!Mark is, and both of them will equally remember having been real!Mark. Before or after, though, real!Mark's qualia is reliant solely upon real!Mark, unless we abandon the idea of chonological existence.)

I remember the sleeping beauty problem! It was frustrating that it was much more difficult than it felt it should be. I think I vaguely remember arriving at a conclusion that satisfied me, but annoyingly I can't remember hat it was. <takes a look>

--I can't remember my exact chain of thought at the time, but I think I advocated the 1/2 answer. Sleeping Beauty is going to wake up and be asked the question either way, so only waking up doesn't give her any new information about the way the coin fell (unlike the Monty Hall problem).

To put it another way: In half of all possible universes she answers the question once, and in half she answers the question twice, but in the one where she answers the question twice she should give the same answer about both two days both times. She's answering about both two days whichever way the coin falls, but one coin fall direction she's answering twice...
