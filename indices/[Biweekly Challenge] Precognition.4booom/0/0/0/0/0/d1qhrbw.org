  if you're real then however much you try to wreck the conversation it will still end well for her.

Agatha does have vulnerabilities, but only if you know what you're getting into. Marc is thoroughly screwed, yes.

(Set up a trap outside the space or time boundaries of her power that can't be escaped from within them. This is how Philip K. Dick's [[http://sickmyduck.narod.ru/pkd082-0.html][Golden Man]] gets nabbed, and that story heavily inspired mine. Thanks [[/u/alexanderwales]] for the recommendation!)

  one would predict she'd try lots of different conversations and choose the one that gave the best results for her by, say, leaving the best impression (and not overly alarming the reporter).
#+end_quote

I'm modelling her as pissed off at the reporter for threatening her and forcing her to "out" herself. (Inspired by the recent [[http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Second-Wachowski-filmmaker-sibling-comes-out-as-trans-/54509.html][outing of Lily Wachowski]].)

She's not so much trying to make a good impression as probing for ways to hurt real!Mark and get away with it. But then she stumbles upon vision!Mark's fear of annihilation and decides to exploit it.

  threatening to make and torture copies of you is unwanted, but not as immediately frightening than if you didn't know whether you were real or a copy.
#+end_quote

You may be correct. I don't know. I am confused about consciousness and identical copies. If you know you will be split off into a Heaven you and a Hell you, does it make any sense to say you have "50% chance to end up in Hell"? That's what Agatha's threat relies on. I'm not sure real!Marc can claim he will never find himself in a vision.

I know there's a bunch of articles about the sleeping beauty problem on LessWrong that I should probably get around to reading; maybe someone has successfully demystified this.
