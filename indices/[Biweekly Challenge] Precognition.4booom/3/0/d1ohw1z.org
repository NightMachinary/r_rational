That last paragraph is quite intriguing, in regards to the answer you've imagined.

With the 'willingly given', what was going to happen was easy to predict.

I was puzzled by the very first sentence; if Sam is inserting the Man into that common mental image (out of hatred), why is it 'a drowning Man clings' and not 'the drowning Man might cling'? 'a Man' (rather than 'the') implies others, and the lack of 'might' prompts the mistaken impression that Sam does not view himself as human.
