You can very easily change the world a huge amount on your own, as long as you have access to resources. For example, if you can find a way to access a supercomputer, you can run different scenarios that boil down to simple answers. Used efficiently, you can easily solve some really difficult problems and usher in scientific advances much more quickly, and it wouldn't take decades of your personal time, you could do most of whatever you want all day and just memorize a few boiled down notes and numbers at the end of the day before offing yourself.
