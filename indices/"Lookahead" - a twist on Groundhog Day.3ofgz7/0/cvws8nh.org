I think the answer here is to minimize sleep. If you can function 32 hours without sleep you just effectively doubled your loop time. If the problems caused by sleep deprivation are primarily physical or chemical, rather than psychological, you should be able to brute force a cure for the sleep addiction inflicted on humanity. The best answer we have on why we sleep is "because we get sleepy," and that is unacceptable when you have a superpower limited purely by sleep.
