I'm picturing a setup where the scientific community can register experiments - "today I'll try high-temp rubber formulae 127-217" - and then have their success or failure conducted back in time.

You could only do experiments contrived to last one day; and it might take a few loops to get a handle on the encoding (most experiments can make do with a single bit, if pressed, but I have a rubbish memory.) I suspect the most valuable info might be chip designs? Or maybe a way to encode data directly into some neurons, in a way that carries over.

Yes, it would take a subjectively long time, but I can live comfortably and I think I could live with hanging out in this period for a while. Besides, /I/ can always work on brute-forcing human behaviour or something if I get bored of being rich.
