I think you'd want to sleep somewhat regularly anyway, at the very least whenever you accomplish something difficult to replicate.

It's much like a video game save with a single slot; too incautious and you risk saving at the wrong time (e.g. just before somebody murders you, just after the NSA discovers your ability), too infrequent and you risk losing significant progress to your death.

So I think limiting abuse of your talent to events you can verify succeeded within a single sleep cycle is probably safest. Execute your plan, verify success, save.

You could potentially also take a little risk there and do two attempts.

1. Execute plan, verify success, reset.
2. Execute plan the same, assume it will succeed, save.

This would greatly increase the potential frequency of your missions at the cost of a little risk of divergent outcomes (since "perfectly replicate my previous actions" is not one of your superpowers).
