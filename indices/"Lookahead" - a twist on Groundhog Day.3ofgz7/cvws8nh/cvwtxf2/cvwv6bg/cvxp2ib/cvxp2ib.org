Best drug I can think of would be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modafinil][modafinil]] which has been known to keep people from needing sleep for a /week/ without any noticeable effect. Its side effects are mild and relatively rare, mostly consisting of headaches and mild stomach upset in a minority of users.

I can't remember where I read it, but I think the military's started using it instead of amphetamines for their helicopter pilots and other people who need to be awake and active for long periods of time.

It has a /huge/ LD50 and there are no known cases of it as the primary cause of an overdose death. Not that it'd matter for our super-groundhog here, in any case.

Far from having adverse psychological effects, modafinil appears to be a /mild nootropic and memory enhancer/
