The worst case scenario is that somebody does something that kills you while you are asleep, but you don't die before waking up. Say you get stabbed in the gut and disemboweled. You will wake up from the pain, and die very soon. When you die, you loop back a few minutes to agonizing pain, dying again and again unless you can figure out a way to survive such a wound.
