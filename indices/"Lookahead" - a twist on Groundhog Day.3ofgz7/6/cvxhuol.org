Wake up (make a safe save), read a new book. Then put yourself in a Schrodinger's box (the one that contains the cat) - and bury the box somewhere so that no one ever opens it (make a measure on your alive/dead state).

Quantum-mechanically, you are both alive and dead. Now the interesting question is what you would remember when your woke up from your checkpoint... a superposition of having read the book and not?
