You should be able to fly and exert "super-strength" by decreasing gravitational pull. You might also be able to kill living creatures by pushing them into the air, then pulling them back to the ground. You might be able to use the wormholes to become super-rich through mundane commerce (you need to explore the symbolic implications of being able to generate wormholes through "gravity", because this implies that you have powers over a related domain with regard to general space-time manipulation, allowing you to do things like become invisible, generate radiation, alter relative time-flow, generate vacuums, isolate pocket dimensions, create light-based computers, etc).

You're best off bleeding your powers slowly into related domains (such as light-manipulation through the use of gravity) and getting the DM to accept incremental expansions on your power, gaining the consent to make bigger conquests. You will want to take advantage of the DM's goal to make sure the game is cool, creative, and fun for the players; if the DM does not share these goals, munchkining will be harder.
