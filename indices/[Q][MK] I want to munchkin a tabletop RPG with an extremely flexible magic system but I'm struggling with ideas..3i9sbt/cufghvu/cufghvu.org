how far the wormholes reach? can they be opened inside something/someone?

the average depth for lava is 20 miles and is under /tremendous/ pressure, can you say "lava pressure cutter"? do the same with deep (like mariana's trench deep)water and you can slice, dice and pulp without a fire hazard.

open a portal into orbit and watch the same effect in reverse as the wormhole vacuums your troubles and drops them a couple miles.

the ideal gas law is pV = nRT where the letters denote pressure, volume, amount (in moles), ideal gas constant, and temperature of the gas, respectively. if you can create small scale singularities or just compress /really/ fast any significant volume of gas you get a drastic increase in temperature, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se_y0lScb8o][boom!]] flash cooking enemies! create an outward pushing spherical field and not only create a vacuum but cool the stuff inside too, laugh as their blood sublimates and freezes in their veins.
