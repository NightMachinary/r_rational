Why pin enemies to the ground? Aim that gravity upward and it leaves them a lot more vulnerable.

Find a heavy object, balance it out to zero weight, and carry it around with you. An anvil or cannonball is simple and traditional; a spoonful of neutron star matter (held together by your gravity) is the most extreme.

Building wormholes is many times more exploitable than mere gravity control. For starters, create two tiny wormholes with one end anchored right in front of your eyes... instant clairvoyance.

One observation: for best results, be sure to align with the GM. If the GM wants to prevent munchkins you will be stopped. If the GM says doing a munchkin is unfair to other players consider whether maybe she is right about it. You can also offer the GM to slowly develop your character's powers while also slowly becoming less "good"; culminating eventually in becoming a big-bad-evil-opposition of the campaign and handing the character over to the GM to run.
