One tip for munchkinning past a DM is to find ways to contribute that are much less visible.

This is why focusing on battlefield control and buffs as a Wizard is so potent in D&D. Inexperienced players and DMs will think that doing 30 damage in a round is OP while not batting an eye when you drop a Haste or Stinking Cloud.

Of course, that's harder to do in a rules lite system.
