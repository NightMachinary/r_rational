You control gravity to the extent that you can create wormholes? Wow. You're golden. Here's some stuff you can do:

All the standard portal tricks:

- Open wormhole in front of your gun, put the other end immediately behind enemy's head
- Use wormholes to look through walls
- Open wormhole, toss grenade through, close wormhole
- Open wormhole inside an object -- portal cut?
- Need a flashlight but don't have one? Open a portal outside in the sunlight with the other end pointed where you want light.
- Wormhole with vertically aligned ends -- infinite fall distance. Useful for making an enemy go splat, or for generating electricity by dropping a steel bar through a magnetic field. Use that electricity for something.
- Change the direction of your momentum by having the wormhole entrance and exit facing in different directions. For example, jump off a building, drop into the wormhole entrance going down, come out the entrance going sideways so you can dropkick someone.\\
- Another version of the above: if you're falling a dangerous distance, drop into a wormhole and come out going up. Your fall will slow down; just as you hit zero speed, portal yourself to the ground and land softly.

Various gravity tricks:

- Make it pull from the side to yank someone's aim off
- Slam someone into the ceiling, then into the floor, then into the ceiling...
- Create two point-sources of gravity on opposite sides of something. Tear it apart.
- Switch it from floor to ceiling rapidly so that a metal bar keeps falling up and down through a magnetic field. Gain electricity.

That's what comes to mind first; I'm sure there's a lot more you can do with it. Good luck!
