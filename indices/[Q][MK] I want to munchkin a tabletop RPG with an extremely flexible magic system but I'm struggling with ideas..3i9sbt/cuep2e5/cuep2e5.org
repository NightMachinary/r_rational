Well, first of all, if you're holding people down with their own body weight to the point where they can't lift their arms, then you're also holding their /blood/ down enough that they can't get any to their heads. So everybody you pin that way should black out in seconds.

Second, if you can wormhole but not much else, there's some conceptual stuff going on with the amount of curvature you can create. So lean on that. Conceptually speaking, gravity can:

- Defend yourself from projectiles/beams/bolts/bullets/spells. Everything curves in a gravity well - you just need enough curvature in the right place. Even light curves.

- Float giant chunks of metal in the air around you for shielding
- Macro-scale linear accelerator! Not /quite/ a railgun, but you should still be able to fling rocks at people pretty well.
