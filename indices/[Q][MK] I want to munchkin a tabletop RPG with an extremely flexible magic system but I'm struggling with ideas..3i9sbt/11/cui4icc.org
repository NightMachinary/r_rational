Harry Dresden's gravity hammer. You temporarily turn off gravity in a wide area, then redirect it all in a point at the center of a group of foes. Crushing ensues. For a very low-effort weapon, stopping gravity from affecting a charging foe will cause them to lose all traction, and then a simple dodge will send them going in whatever direction they were originally going.
