Inside a building? Drop the roof over someone.

You can control the gravity? You can probably change the direction too, so throwing anything is lethal. Also always hits if you change the point of gravity to be the target. (and it's not next to a wall or objects so the shot can circle around it a bit.)

The again, just make their heads implode.

Put a wormhole next to enemy, wait until he is halfway gone and close the thing.

You can fly.
