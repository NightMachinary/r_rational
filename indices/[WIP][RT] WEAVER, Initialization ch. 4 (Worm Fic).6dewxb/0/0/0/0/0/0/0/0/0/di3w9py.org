"But it isn't /really/ cruel, is it? They don't have /real/ feelings, just facsimiles." is what I'm arguing against.

It's certainly possible to make a simulation that fakes having qualia well enough to be very hard to distinguish. But it won't happen on its own just from making an upload, and all things being equal you should take people's words for it when they say they have feelings unless you have /concrete/ evidence to the contrary.

The point of the argument is just that if qualia can be subtracted without changing the physical machinery, which is after all what our reason runs on, we have no reason to believe we possess them in the first place. A thing that acts equally in presence as in absence is not evidence.
