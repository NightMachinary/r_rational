  The point of the argument is just that if qualia can be subtracted without changing the physical machinery, which is after all what our reason runs on, we have no reason to believe we possess them in the first place.

The physical machinery is changed, implicitly, in the context of an upload. The runtime is a simulated environment rather than the original. We've already shown that by changing facts you can absolutely subtract qualia.

I suspect in general that philosophy has poisoned the discussion. I've seen a few people talk about p-zombies not being real, because of the p-zombie arguments about physicalism. Those thought experiments rely on duplicated facts. They are not relevant to the discussion as a consequence, because it would be absurd to actually duplicate facts and impossible besides- the fact that they are a simulation on a different run time adds a meta-fact, that goes beyond their own universe and subtly changes it from our own. Or not so subtly, if the creator intervenes.
