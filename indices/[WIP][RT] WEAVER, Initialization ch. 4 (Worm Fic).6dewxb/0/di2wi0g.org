The more upload fics I read, the more I think we need some sort of So You Want To Become An Upload: A Primer In Applied Transhumanism leaflet, with rules like "Don't try and hide bad news from yourself- it never works", "Trust your fork; they have the outside perspective" and "Only fork if you want to take /both/ roles".

[Edit] Let's add "p-zombies and why there's no such thing" and "Why people who can't even cooperate with copies of themselves are the saddest sacks of failure".
