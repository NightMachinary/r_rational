That was really cool to read and I really enjoyed it.

I'm not at all convinced p-zombies can't be real though. In general, I think the stuff about p-zombies makes assumptions that rely on philosophy that doesn't really have to hold true. Like having to have the two universes obey the same physical laws in order to be identical to observers? Why would they have to do that? WoG can be much more powerful then that. For sure, you can write computer programs that display the same thing, but have different underlying mechanisms.

Leaving aside that how consciousness works is kind of unknown, so I could be way off in details...

The argument against p-zombies given in the pamphlet doesn't make them impossible. It just means that all their arguments would match what a version of them that was a p-zombie would make. So they wouldn't be able to convince someone that they weren't a p-zombie by their actions. Presumably, there could potentially be other things that could decide that. Other evidence. For example, the runtime itself or the code running on it would be evidence that could sway one way or the other.

Consider a simulated environment that has qualia within it and the ability to save and load. It also has a way for someone to watch it. The simulation is run. The simulation software makes a recording of the only output screen. It also saves the environment every few minutes. Later that same simulation is run again. This time, instead of actually simulating the environment for real, it just uses the cached output. It only bothers with more complex interactions when a divergence point hits due to outside interaction. In that case the simulated environment loads from the closest save file before the divergence and uses it like a video's keyframe to reach the relevant divergence point. Whatever interaction was supposed to happen at that time plays out.

This is a basic example. It's also a shortcut that probably really would be used for simulations in order to save on resource usage, since we pretty much do something analogous with videos. It has the side-effect of making something that may or may not be a p-zombie, from an external persons view, since if you didn't know if you were the first person to watch that simulation you wouldn't be able to tell if the person was real or just a recording. However, you could still interact with them. Still treat them like a real person, in a way.

Thanks for taking the time to make that.
