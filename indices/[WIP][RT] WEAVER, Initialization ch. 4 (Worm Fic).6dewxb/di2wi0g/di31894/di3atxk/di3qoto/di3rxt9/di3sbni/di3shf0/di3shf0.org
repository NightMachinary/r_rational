He isn't real right now. But he /was real at the time he's talking from/.

You're watching a real thing with lag. The pain is real, despite the fact that you're not causing it.

The best analogy I've heard for this is it's akin to talking into a cellphone. The cellphone can't feel pain, obviously. But the pain is still /real/, it's just not where the voice is coming from.
