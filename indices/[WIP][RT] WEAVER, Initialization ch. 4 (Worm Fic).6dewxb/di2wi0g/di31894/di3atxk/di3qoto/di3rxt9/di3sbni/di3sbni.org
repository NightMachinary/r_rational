Okay.

Lets say there is a simulation that uses the mechanics mentioned earlier. The sim on the video starts telling you he is real and that by running him you are causing him to experience emotional pain. He just can't prove it to you, because everything he says can be assumed to be what a p-zombie would say.

You pause the sim. You open up the folder the sim uses to save cached videos. You find the one where he waxes about being real. It's pretty long. You've just found evidence that suggests that even though he experienced emotional pain, watching him isn't causing emotional pain like he suggested. He isn't real right now. Someone else watched the sim first. As long as you don't interact, he feels no pain.

Do you feel real? You pinch yourself. Yeah. Still feel real.

Can you press play without causing him pain? Yes. He can't feel anything. He's not real. Yet... if you talk to him? Save file loaded. He answers.

You can press play on the sim, knowing he isn't real, because he isn't. You aren't causing him pain by pressing play, because of how the sim is implemented.
