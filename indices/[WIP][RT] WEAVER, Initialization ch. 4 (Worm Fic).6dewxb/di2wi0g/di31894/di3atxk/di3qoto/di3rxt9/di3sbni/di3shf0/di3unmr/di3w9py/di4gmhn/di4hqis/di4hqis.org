  The physical machinery is changed, implicitly, in the context of an upload.

Eeeeeeh.

It's changed indexically but not computationally? In principle, you should be able to do a straight 1:1 upload that goes from "direct physics" to "physics embedded in a computer"; since it's computationally equivalent I wouldn't consider that a change of machinery anymore than running Windows in a VM is a different OS. The simulation ought to "screen off" facts outside it.

And yes, obviously it's possible to just tell the upload that they're in a simulation, but that alone seems an insufficient additional fact to subtract qualia.
