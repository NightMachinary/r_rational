I've just started reading and I'm 5 chapters in and doesn't seem to be like you think, so far.

There are interesting dynamics going on, I'd say, but it doesn't seem to me that "every character is completely evil".

I could be wrong and something may happen but so far it has been enjoyable, it's not TTS but I'm still enjoying it.

EDIT: well seems like everybody is sort of insane but the more I read the more I enjoy the plot.
