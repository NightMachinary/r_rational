Not only is your reply incredibly late, it is also incredibly stupid. My entire point was that the summary portrayed the characters as unnuanced and two-dimensional, making the story sound like poor literature.

If it makes you feel better about this incredibly poor decision you've made, I did later read the story and mostly enjoyed it. The summary is shit and fails to sell the story.
