"Free" energy sounds impressive, but remember; Dracula needs to drink blood. Vampire powers or not, that energy is coming from somewhere, and the cost to keep a Vampire Generator running is measured in human blood. How much blood is a good question; does Dracula need to drink every day? How much? If we assume a pint a day, that's $150/day, which isn't terrible (as fuel costs go). That said, we also have questions like how often Dracula can transform, and how much energy the transformation process releases.

Of course, as a story, those numbers can come out to whatever you like. But I'm a little sceptical; it seems like the energy produced from whatever Vampires do to the blood they drink (which also goes into making them live forever), probably shouldn't make them all that more effective at producing energy than some schmuck turning a crank.
