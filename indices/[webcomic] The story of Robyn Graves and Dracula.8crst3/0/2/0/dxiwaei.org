Maybe he'd be better to set up a rope and pulley from a tall tower of the castle? He could have a seat on one end and let his mass drive a generator as he fell, then transform and a small counterweight would lift him back up.

Apparently his clothes transform with him, so he could wear a suit of armour or weights to increase his output.

It's still not going to generate megawatts though. If there is a 40kg difference in mass between him and the counterweight, and falls 100m, that's 400kJ. If it takes 10s to fall, that's 40kW

You need about half a kW per house, so he could power about 80 houses - not a lot, but enough to provide for his 'needs'.
