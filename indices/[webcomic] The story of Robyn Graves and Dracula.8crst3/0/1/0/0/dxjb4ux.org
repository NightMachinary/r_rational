  Given that you can donate a pint a month

I donated a pint of blood on Friday and I can donate my next pint sometime in June - we've got a three month waiting period between donations. Is it really only one month in (I assume) the USA? Several years ago I lost ~2 pints of blood due to internal bleeding and I was fucked up, dizzy, etc for about a month after that.
