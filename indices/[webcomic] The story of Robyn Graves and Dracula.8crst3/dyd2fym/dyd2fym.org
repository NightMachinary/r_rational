Would the expansion of air be a better source of energy than the change in Mass? If Dracula weighs, say, 200 pounds, and can transform into a bat that weighs less than one pound, he could transfer back and forth to create a perpetual motion machine that uses it's momentum to lift him to the top of a flywheel, where he transforms and pushes the wheel down with his weight. As momentum builds, the machine can change gears until he's maximising his potential energy to spin a turbine as fast as it will go given the limiting factor of friction. Just a thought, if he doesn't want to be in an enclosed box dealing with changing air pressures all the time.
