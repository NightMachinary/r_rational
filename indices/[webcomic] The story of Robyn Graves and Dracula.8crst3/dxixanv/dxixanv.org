And then he tried to murder Robin?

Hardly!

Instead Robin offered him to let scientists study his transformation. She would organize the entire effort, and the scientists would pay in blood for the opportunity to observe and measure how his vampire powers work.

Once a night, Dracula performed his transformation in the lab built near his castle. He spent the rest of his nights watching Brazilian daytime telenovelas and sipping blood, instead of having to go out and hunt and murder people.

Robin got rich selling access to the "Dracula Lab TM" to scientific groups. The small town in Transylvania got rich on the influx of scientists, tourists and weird groupies who got off on Dracula sipping their blood (rule 34 applies).

P.S. Dracula was immortal. As a side gig he sometimes gave interviews to historians.
