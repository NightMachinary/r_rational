I've been a DC fan for a loooong time, it's such a nice comic!

Had my 10 year high school reunion (...2 years ago [[/discshock-in][]]) and had the werewolf/wifwolf comic in my "time capsule". The day I first kissed my now-husband, I'd gone to his place to deliver the dinosaur comics shirts we'd split shipping on an order of. *sigh* memories
