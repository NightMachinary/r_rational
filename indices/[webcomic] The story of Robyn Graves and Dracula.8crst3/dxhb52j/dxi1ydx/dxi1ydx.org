I'm also a little skeptical about how much power you can generate changing back and forth between a person and a bat all day even if you could completely ignore conservation of energy.

If we assume the transformation takes two seconds to complete, you only get 7200 cycles per eight hour work day. Assuming you'd need 100 MW to power a small town [[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=100MW+Day+%2F+7200][Wolfram Alpha]] tells me that one transformation would need to produce 1.2 Gigajoules. That's (also according to WA) in the same order of magnitude as a lightning bolt.
