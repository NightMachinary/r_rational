You could increase air pressure to increase the power, though maybe that would make it harder for him. But there are things you can take advantage of where relativity implies it can't make it any harder. If he turns into a human at the top of a hill, then you can make it worth while if the hill is high enough, but there's no local difference between the top of a hill and the bottom of a valley so his powers won't be able to distinguish it. Or you could stick him on a device that moves back and forth, and have him turn into a bat while it's speeding up and a human while it's slowing down. The extra mass while it's slowing down means regenerative breaking can produce more energy than it needs to speed back up. And the faster it goes the more energy it makes. Since velocity is relative, his powers won't be able to just not work while moving quickly.
