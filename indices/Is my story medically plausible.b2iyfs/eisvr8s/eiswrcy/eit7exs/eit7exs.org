Well, damn. I looked it up and it is indeed a real thing.

The issue here, I think, is that the cause of the disease isn't even known. The explanation that her body is allergic to the water molecule doesn't hold water (heh) because of the obvious questions I asked (and someone else asked about saliva which is an even better question).

It clearly /is/ a thing, but it is pretty damn incredible. If you do write about it, I suggest not delving too deeply into the mechanics of it because they just aren't known, apparently, and it's really easy to be wrong or unbelievable in your explanations.
