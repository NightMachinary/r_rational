Gosh it's so wrong. This is what happens when you try to explain fantasy using very basic and flawed knowledge of chemistry, biology and physics.

For one, immerse a corpse in radioactive, sterile water... And the bacteria in the gut eat if from inside out. The radioactivity needed to destroy bacteria in the gut before they start degrading the body is enough to roast the corpse... And even after that, what happens to a cell that doesn't get supplied with oxygen and glucose/energy metabolites? It uses its reserves in seconds, shuts down all its little pumps and allows water to fill it until it literally explodes like a water balloon.

It's called lysis.

Seriously, theories like 'aliens put them there' are actually more plausible than a corpse turned into radioactive stone and still retaining the fine neurological structure and chemical balances that form memories and instincts.
