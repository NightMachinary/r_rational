That's the tallest living thing. The most massive living thing is Pando, a quaking aspen that weighs around 6000 metric tons.

  What were these natural reactors like? Mostly, they would have seemed like ordinary lakes or ponds, the water hotter than normal, perhaps boiling at times. The shores and waters, due to radiation, would have been normally devoid of life, again due to radiation.

  Of course, wandering animals would have come by to drink. Some of them would have been fatally poisoned by radiation over time and wandered off to die. Some would have died along the shores. And a few would have slipped or been carried into the waters.

Natural nuclear reactors require a higher concentration of U235 than we have now. The only known one was 1.7 billion years ago, so I imagine that's around the necessary age. Animals didn't occur until 600 million years ago. Even multicellular life didn't appear until a billion years ago.

  The Kaiju do not need to breath like we do. Their metabolisms are not based on chemical reactions. No oxygen necessary. They can exist underground, in vaccuum, on land or at the bottom of the ocean.
