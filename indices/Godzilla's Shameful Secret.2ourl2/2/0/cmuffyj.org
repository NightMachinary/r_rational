As a counter point to your interesting arguments,

  Natural nuclear reactors require a higher concentration of U235 than we have now.

This article is clearly about a different world where kaiju exist. That world has a lot more naturally occurring radioactive material.

I imagine it's the same reason that Godzilla doesn't fly even though he likely has the ability. He thinks he can't, so he doesn't. Ergo he thinks he needs to be able to breathe, so when something seemingly removes his ability to breathe, he passes out.

Thanks for pointing out flaws in the article. It was fun to think of counter-arguments.
