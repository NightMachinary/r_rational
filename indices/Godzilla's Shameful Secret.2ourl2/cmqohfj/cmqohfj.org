When I found this site and then tried submitting it to [[/r/rational]], it said that someone else had already posted this six months ago. I decided to post the link anyway since there might be others like me who weren't part of [[/r/rational]] back then.

Which brings me to the question, how long should people wait to resubmit older links? I went with my judgement that six months was long enough, but what should the cut-off date be?
