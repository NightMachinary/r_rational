Worm can be a bit of a slog. And there are sections where the tension keep ratcheting up and up without relief. In that respect, Wildbow's next serial was even more extreme... to the point where I couldn't take it anymore, and I stopped reading it and haven't picked it up again.

But Worm gets very epic at the end. I definitely felt it was worth the effort.

You might like some of the fanfics out there such as Centotaph and Atonement much better.

I'm sure you will like Amy's character arc a lot better.
