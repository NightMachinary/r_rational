I always read the contrast between Taylor and Amy as a lesson in the importance of creativity.

Taylor has the power to control bugs... it doesn't sound like much at first, it doesn't really automatically intimidate anyone, but by god when she sets her mind to it and comes up with imaginative uses for insects she is a force to be reckoned with and becomes feared/respected/successful.

Meanwhile Amy has just been casually handed a power for which the god-tier applications are practically dime-a-dozen. But her own constraints, and failure to think creatively, limit her to acting as a glorified medic.

Further evidence: just about the only good ideas Amy ever has are pretty much directly inspired by or in response to Taylor. But I can't quite remember where in the story they occur so I'm going to shush in case of spoilers.
