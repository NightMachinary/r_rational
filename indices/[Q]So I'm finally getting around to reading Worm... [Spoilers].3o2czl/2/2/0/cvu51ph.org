If she's so desperate to be a fucking hero, here's the easy solution. Make a virus that will:

1. Stop ageing at physical and mental peak. Reverse the detrimental effects for those already past the peak.
2. Cure all diseases and make affected humans highly resistant to future ones.
3. Improve intelligence.
4. Improve rationality.

You could add as many buffs as you like. Since her power is bullshit arbitrary bio-kinesis every item should be achievable to some (large) degree. Give the virus a month of incubation, make it virulent, resistant to mutation and build in a kill switch. Covertly infect some schmuck in Chicago, or another city with a big international airport nearby. Your work is done. You don't even have to take credit.

Naturally, this would cripple the conflict in the story and so it cannot be. I just wish wildbow didn't give such OP powers out at all, instead of making the recipient too mentally ill/mind-raped to use them.
