He was originally planning Worm to be only one of an anthology-style collection set in the same universe - hence why the site is titled "parahumans" and not "worm".

  An author being so flippant with a character that their fate is literally a dice roll is probable only in horror or perhaps horror parody. It's not something I respect for a serious dramatic piece.

Plenty of serious dramatic pieces are also horror, so I'm not sure what your point is here.

That would be astoundly unlikely, even if every character were present for the fight, which they weren't.

Even if it were, Wildbow runs games set in the /Worm/ universe, and he's got a whole process worked out for generating new capes in a few minutes' work. I play, he does it pretty much every day.
