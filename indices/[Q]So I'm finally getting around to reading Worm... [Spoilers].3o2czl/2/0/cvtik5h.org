  I'm not going to give spoilers, but this is due to a mistake you're making rather than the author. Worm is the kind of story where no one gets plot immunity just for the hell of it. If you think a character might die, they seriously might.

Also probably spoiler-free: Wildbow, the author, has mentioned he literally rolls dice in some scenes to decide if characters will die as part of his writing process.

He's even described his plans for what to do if Taylor had rolled badly and been killed by Leviathan.
