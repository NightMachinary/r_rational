Worm was a work in progress less than 2 years ago and there was a point when the author rolled dice to determine the next character death, so no one has any plot armor.

I really liked Worm because it's a crapsack world and really, really dark. It also has excellent world building and is the closest that fiction has got to 'if superpowers really existed'.

Your point about Amy is one of the main reasons Worm is considered rational. IRL, I feel that this is exactly what would happen with an Amy-like character. [[#s][Minor spoilers]]
