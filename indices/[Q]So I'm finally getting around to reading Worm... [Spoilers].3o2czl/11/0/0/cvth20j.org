Personally Bitch was one of my favorite characters. One of the things I love about worm is that there are so many different kinds of people in it and they, and the way they interact with powers, is written realistically. Sure this means that a lot of characters aren't rational but that's how the world works. Some people could have done so much more if they were able to think rationally but that's what would actually happen if random people got powers.

I don't remember how much has been revealed about bitch so I'll keep it light. Bitch is one of the people who has managed to munchkin their powers the most (realistically) because her power is more of a curse than a blessing. She got a superpower as a child which is harmful enough already and it turned out to be....well, that power.
