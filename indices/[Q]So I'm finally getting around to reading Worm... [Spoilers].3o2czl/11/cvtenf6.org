I just want to point that a lot of people here like Worm because of Taylor who's pretty close to being a rationalist (even if the setting doesn't always involve rational actors) and I think that Wildbow nerfed Amy herself just so she wouldn't be so ridiculously game breaking while still allowing her ability to be used in the endgame of the story.
