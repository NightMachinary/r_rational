not a true deus ex machina. bonesaw was already experimenting on that. it was hinted at elsewhere. the success wasn't certain, but possible. bonesaw rolled a natural 20 - or a high roll- to give him that resource, it wasn't grue in this case.

maybe, though. it seems like the point they'd have a survival roll. maybe bonesaw was certain to break his shard that way, but that seems unlikely.

It does seem like there are points where they get lucky and survive where they shouldn't, but it's not a general thing.
