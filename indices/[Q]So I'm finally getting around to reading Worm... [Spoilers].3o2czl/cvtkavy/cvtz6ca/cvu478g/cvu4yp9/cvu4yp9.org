Yes, but she sees the world in black and white. evil people are more likely to indulge in every vice, good people more likely to indulge in every virtue. She self identifies as evil, and therefore thinks she's likely to slide downwards. she also believes power corrupts, most likely, and her power is limited enough it doesn't look like it'd give an immortality at first glance- just a cascade healing for one disease after another, and even that requires stopping and thinking about it. (not to mention the three target more useful people first.) it has arbitrary power levels, but i don't know how high it goes.

maybe it is a mind manipulation, but it could work just as well just that she's being an idiot and not thinking.
