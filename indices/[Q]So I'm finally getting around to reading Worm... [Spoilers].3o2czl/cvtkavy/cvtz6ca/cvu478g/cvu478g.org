I could never understand that type of reasoning from her. I mean, I don't suggest that she tries to self-modify in any significant way, so why the fear of value drift? It's like in her mind it goes:

1. Start trying to meaningfully work towards a better world.
2. Go completely ape-shit bananas and destroy humanity.

Why? There is no logical reason to suspect yourself of suddenly developing the omnicidal urge. Her reasoning is catastrophically and persistently wrong, to the point of an illness. The consequences are dire.
