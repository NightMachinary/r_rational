Yup, Amy's the worst offender in the harm-by-inaction category. It's like she's put in the trolley problem where on one side you have all the people dying from easily preventable biological failure (i.e. almost all of them) and on the other there are her mental hang-ups. And she repeatedly fucking jams the switch as hard as she can to sacrifice untold millions so that she can continue to be the idiotic teenager she is.

It's debatable how much agency she has in this of course. Her family environment and the shard mind-fuckery combine to make everything someone else's fault. That's one of the reasons I despise the simurgh+shard-control combo so much. Can't even hate the character for being a nigh-omnicidal moron, since she's basically mind-controlled into it.
