  I already know before any plotline begins that all of the Undersiders are going to survive (have so far, anyway, no spoilers in case I decide to finish), so the tension feels hollow and contrived.

I'm not going to give spoilers, but this is due to a mistake you're making rather than the author. Worm is the kind of story where no one gets plot immunity just for the hell of it. If you think a character might die, they seriously might.

  I kind of hope Amy will join just because of how much more powerful it will make Skitter, but I also hate her with a burning passion. First, she's a moron. If she could make a parasite that can fix Bonesaw's prion disease, why can't she fix all prion diseases everywhere? Hell, why can't she tweak microbiomes to fix all infectious diseases? She seems stuck in the "I need to touch people to fix them" mindset when she has demonstrated already how untrue that is.

Congratulations, welcome to "if real people had super-powers". Yes it's frustrating to watch, but this strikes me as something that could realistically happen. Most people don't immediately think "how can I munchkin this power to god levels?", and all it takes for Amy to keep herself from her full potential is fear. Doesn't that sound pretty familiar as a way human beings actually work?
