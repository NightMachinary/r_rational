If you're finding it a chore now, I doubt that you'll find it less of a chore in later chapters. I think I finished Worm mostly because I'd already started and wanted to see things through, rather than because I was really enjoying myself. Towards the end, the length became much more of a bug than a feature (something that I think/hope is going to be fixed in editing).

And yes, Amy has the Superman problem, which is basically that she's got an amazing power that has to be constrained by psychology rather than anything physical. I bought it, but I can see where someone would just find it frustrating and a bit out of character. I don't typically like characters holding back because they're afraid of how awesome they are, with only a few notable exceptions.
