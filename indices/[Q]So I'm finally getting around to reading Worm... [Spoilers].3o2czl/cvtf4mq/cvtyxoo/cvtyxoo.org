I think she's foolish, but I also think amy feels much the same way you would, if you randomly became an AI.

You've heard how much of a catastrophe an UFAI could be, right? Now imagine if you've never heard of the possibility of FAI. Every AI is a extinction event, or at least an apathetic god.

Amy isn't quite at that level, but she grew up hearing horror stories of other people- people her power could imitate, outdo. She could be a hero without compare- but the people who're going to fix everything generally get hit by an endbringer

there are no good overpowered characters in worm, for amelia to have as a role model, not with her powers. she's terrified, because she's not a good person, and she doesn't think that she can be a true hero. But she thinks she could be a vilian to end all villians, a force for evil like never seen before.
