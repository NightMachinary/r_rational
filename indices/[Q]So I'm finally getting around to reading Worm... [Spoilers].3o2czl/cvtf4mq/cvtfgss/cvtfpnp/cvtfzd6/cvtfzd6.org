Amy's mental health is extremely dubious, and her emotional health is shit without question. Despite this, believe it or not, even healthy people are usually incapable of acting rationally until they are taught to, and do not act to benefit society or themselves in the long term. It's not like we don't see that every day everywhere, or that we don't specifically have groups and institutions dedicated to teaching people to act rationally or anything. It couldn't be that in the context of this judgment you are suffering from hindsight bias, typical mind fallacy, fundamental attribution error, and ignorance of inferential gaps /yourself/.
