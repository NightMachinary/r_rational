Well, like I said, I bought it in the case of Amy, and I do have some exceptions.

But as a general rule, I think it smacks of an author that wants to have their cake and eat it too. They want Reed Richards to be smart enough that curing HIV would be trivial, but they don't want to upset the status quo by having him actually cure HIV. So in order for Reed Richards not to be a complete monster, the writer has to invent some reason for him to decide that curing HIV is a bad thing.

You can see this in a bunch of speculative fiction, but especially in comic books. It's a result of that tension between awesomeness and the status quo. Whenever I see it, it just stands out as being really transparent to me, so whatever arguments Superman is making about how he doesn't want to solve /real/ problems always ring hollow, unless those arguments are presented in a much better form than I usually see.

It's like if you see someone get dragged off by monsters, but you know that they're going to come back in the third act, so you just roll your eyes at it.
