Amy is terrible. I've seen a fan theory that her powers actually messed up her brain, similar to Bitch, based on - this is probably not a spoiler but maybe a very minor spoiler - the fact that her bio-dad also had arbitrary rules he followed obsessively.

I really liked Bitch, actually. Her interlude totally turned that character around for me; she's /not/ a terrible person, just struggling with a crippling inability to process social cues. I'm surprised you hate the antagonists at all, actually, given the Interlude chapters; one of the major themes of Worm is that people tend to be more sympathetic from the inside than we give them credit for. Taylor is pretty morally dubious herself.

Amy fades in prominence after this arc, for what it's worth, and I don't think anyone with her can't-use-my-powers-clown'll-eat-me craziness shows up again. But if reading it is a chore, I'm not sure the mild genre- and status-quo-shift every couple of arcs is enough to save you.
