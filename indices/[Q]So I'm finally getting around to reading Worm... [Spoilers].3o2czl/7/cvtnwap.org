I was only slightly further than you are now before I stopped reading. Then I jumped back into it a year later and finished the whole thing. I will say this. By my standards, from where you are now there is a slight improvement and things happen faster for an arc or two, then you get drowned in a single fight that takes like three arcs and is mind numbingly boring for the most part, then things moderately improve with some cool twists and developments and we get to know some movers and shakers and then we hit the end game and holy fuck it's awesome I'm so glad I pressed on.
