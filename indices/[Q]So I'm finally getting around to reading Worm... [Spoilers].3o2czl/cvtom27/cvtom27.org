  I'll probably still finish Worm, just because I'm curious about a few things, but I'm afraid it will be a chore. Your thoughts? I'm sorry if this seems too harsh, but Worm comes up a lot here and I'm just not seeing it right now.

I should point out that Worm is a rational setting, not an example of rational characters for the most part.
