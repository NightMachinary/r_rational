Having read what happened to Amy, I don't even think that's true. In what "rational setting" does a disturbed, suicidal 17 year old who has made one mistake get sent to what is essentially Azkaban without trial because she asked to be? Are you telling me that there are no superpowered psychotherapists in this setting?
