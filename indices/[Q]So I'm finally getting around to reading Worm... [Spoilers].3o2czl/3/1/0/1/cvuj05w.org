  They want Reed Richards to be smart enough that curing HIV would be trivial, but they don't want to upset the status quo by having him actually cure HIV. So in order for Reed Richards not to be a complete monster, the writer has to invent some reason for him to decide that curing HIV is a bad thing.

Did this particular one actually happen? What good did he see in HIV? I'm just curious how offensive they decided to be.
