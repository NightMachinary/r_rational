No, didn't actually happen. I mean, yes, I assume that Reed Richards would be able to do it given all the other stuff he does, but it's not canon that he can cure /HIV/ and chooses not to, just that he can do lots of stuff and doesn't use it for Reasons.

I believe the closest that comics actually came was when Jim Wilson requested a blood transfusion from Bruce Banner in order to cure his AIDS (Banner faked a transfusion, Wilson died shortly afterward).
