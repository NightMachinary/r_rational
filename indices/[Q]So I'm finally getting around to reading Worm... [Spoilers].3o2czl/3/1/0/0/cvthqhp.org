So, you're just tired of Reed Richards being useless. It can be aggravating. But there are also the cases where it is entirely desirable to reduce impact, either due to the character's instability, their own biases, high risk or uncertainty in the nature of the solution... It's basically an existential risk at that point, like the problem of Friendliness but with an inconsistent and puny human-like character at the wheel.

I mean, you wrote the Metropolitan Man, for Zod's sake, so I know that you understand this argument. You pretty much wrote it yourself. But the cases where these arguments do not apply definitely have their realism (and enjoyability) take a hit, yes (I just think that in most cases, as with the real world, these arguments would actually apply, and that they just need to be addressed in the story).

^{^{^{^{^{^{^{^{^{Zod.}}}}}}}}} ^{^{^{^{^{^{^{^{^{Teehee.}}}}}}}}}

I should reread Metropolitan Man. That was some good setting.
