  We were talking about realistic not rational, there is a difference.
#+end_quote

Yes, the realistic character is almost always not rational.

  My argument was that a realistic person wouldn't have acted like Panacea. She by definition isn't a realistic character.
#+end_quote

You are arguing that for her character to be realistic, she would act rationally, i.e. using her power to benefit herself and/or society to the best of her ability, and specifically that she would be able to use proper epistemic techniques to decide that what she /was/ doing was /not/ the best course of action, because she did, in fact, think that what she was already doing /was/ the best course of action. Stop equivocating. My entire reply still applies.

  Also your last statement is ad-hominem and irrelevant.

It is an assertion that you are operating under faulty understandings of both human behavior and Amy's own experience. You observe Amy from a biased narrative in the first place, and you add your own bias on top of that. If you took my assertion into consideration, you might be able to consider the ways in which you might be wrong (directed by finding the ways in which the biases I listed might apply), instead of throwing AD_HOMINEM as a semantic stop sign. It is incredibly relevant, in fact, it is half of what I am arguing.
