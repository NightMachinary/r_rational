I think she's put in a different dilema, actually. She could hold herself back, act like she's behaving now.

or she could let her powers lose, gamble that she's a good person, and try to save everyone. but she's probably got an accurate estimation of her power level, so... she could be a salvation event or an extinction event, and she's not confident enough in her being a good person to risk it. she fears she's the greatest villian the darkness ever had or will have, and she won't risk it in the hopes of being the greatest hero instead.
