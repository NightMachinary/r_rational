I have a hypothesis that intelligence is what happens when agents are given the opportunity to make a ton of mistakes and learn from them without being erased. This is why machine learning algorithms make more intelligent systems. You're essentially creating a computer which makes mistakes /even faster and more efficiently/ than a human, so it can catch up to human capacity in an area faster than a human would. This is why adversarial networks are so effective. You're creating agents which make mistakes against each other at incredible speeds, so they can learn to make fewer mistakes in the future.

This also explains human intelligence. We're particularly resilient animals. Even with little to no technology, we can recover from injuries which would spell instant death to most other land animals. We have evidence of humans from 100,000+ years ago splinting broken limbs, 30,000 year old skulls with holes bored in them to alleve intracranial pressure, and evidence of stitches going back almost to the invention of thread. We have insane endurance, can survive absurd amounts of blood loss, and we protect each other. All of this taken together means we are far better at surviving our mistakes than almost any other animal. We can escape predators without sacrificing the weakest member of the herd, recover from heat exhaustion by sharing water supplies we carry with us, and straight-up repair a ton of injuries. If something doesn't kill a human in under 5 minutes, there's a good chance it won't kill us at all.

So we get to make a ton of otherwise lethal mistakes and learn from them, just like machine learning algorithms. The only reason we do this more slowly than computers is that we're evolved wetware, rarher than designed hardware.
