I'd dispute that humans are better at survival than other animals - some people suffocate instantly with a thin mask over their mouths... /s

Seriously, though, the average cornered mouse fights harder than a human with a broken bone, or even a mild sprained ankle. It's just that we're so far atop the food chain that our mistakes don't matter - we have so much surplus energy, time, and intelligence that we can afford luxuries like caring for our elderly which are unavailable to other animals.

Your comment does read a bit like something from [[/r/HFY]], though.
