I ran a game that was specifically designed to be massively derailed by intelligent player decisions and in-character munchkinry. The players didn't act as rationally as I'd hoped, but they did find and fix the major problems of the universe through creative outside context solutions, so I was happy with how it went.

I'm definitely interested in running it again, but I haven't found a group of players that are well suited to it.
