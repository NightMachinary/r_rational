I have. It went ... okay. The big problem is that you need a very good dungeon master if you're planning on going off-script, because it requires improvisation. If you just snub your nose at the plot, you're going to run into some serious issues when the dungeon master doesn't have anything prepared, which can create some real problems. So the first word of warning is that you can't just make your own character who's intent on breaking the world without buy-in from the DM, and probably also from the other players.

I DM much more than I play though, and I always try to make sure that my NPCs have realistic goals, and that the conflicts are more realistic than "creature of pure evil". The villains often have a point, and on a few occasions that PCs have decided that they'd been working for the wrong side.
