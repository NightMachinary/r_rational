The Indie RPG movement has produced plenty of games that can be played with minimal GM activity or even without a GM, usually using some form of collaborative storytelling to let all the participants be both "PCs" and "GMs", both creating the world and its NPCs and playing characters in it.

/In a Wicked Age/, /Fiasco/, and - if you prefer more comedic games - /InSpectres/ are all good examples of games with little or no requirement for a GM, which in turn allows the players to be as clever and rational about their play styles as they care to be. After all, you can't go against the plot if the plot is being written by the entire gaming group during play.
