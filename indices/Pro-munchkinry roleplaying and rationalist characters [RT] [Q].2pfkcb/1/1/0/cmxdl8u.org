It was a whole lot of fun, and the party seemed to really enjoy the weirdness. The players took about 6 months real-time to win (most infinite power loops were non-viable for in-universe reasons), so the record won't be hard to beat :)

I'd expect an rational party to have the game off the rails in the first session, but the scale of the problems to fix is enough that they might not be able to win that quickly. I really want to test this now...
