The most I have are after-action reports, and most of those are in the style of "this is what happened so we can figure it out later". They also tend to only get written when I'm feeling particularly motivated, which means that there are large gaps in the narratives. And sometimes someone takes it upon himself to do stupid things, so sometimes it's an exercise in me trying to keep things spinning. Here's an excerpt, if you're interested:

  It is late August in the year of 1713. The War of Spanish Succession has been almost entirely concluded with the Treaty of Utrecht. Queen Anne, long plagued by illness, lies lame and corpulent in London. Scientific and wizardly advancements abound throughout Great Britain and continental Europe, while colonialism continues to move in full swing abroad. And in the town of Aylesbury, a chance meeting by three people will set into motion events that disrupt the entire course of history.

  Sancho, recently returned to England after decades of travel through India and the Orient, has found himself heir to a number of properties for which he has no need. As they are a drain on his funds, Sancho is selling them off one by one, and aside from the small manor he keeps in London, the last of these remaining is the country estate near Aylesbury. While the sale of the estate would normally be the work of Obed Clarke, the solicitor for Mr. Hamwich, the Aylesbury estate has been plagued by rumors that it is either haunted or possessed. The recent mysterious murder of a groundskeeper now demands direct attention. The initial thrills of a sedentary lifestyle have faded, and Sancho is pleased for the opportunity to once again deal with some unknown force which is trying its best to murder him.

  Myfanwy's numerous letters to the scientist, wizard, physicist, mathematician, alchemist, President of the Royal Society, and Master of the Royal Mint Sir Isaac Newton have gone unanswered. The young alchemist now seeks to distinguish herself in the eyes of her peers, and has come to Aylesbury seeking the journals and equipment of a deceased alchemist by the name of Callum Hamwich. For the past three years, his estate has been shuttered, and the valuable alchemical equipment he owned, as well as the wealth of journals and notes he left behind, have been waiting for someone with the tenacity to acquire them and intellect to make use of them. For Myfanwy, this is a golden opportunity to set herself apart and finally make her mark on the world.

  Nathaniel has fled from the unkind oceans following an unsuccessful mutiny on the pirate ship /Bachelor's Delight/, and has lived in Aylesbury these past years exercising his powers in private, while presenting himself as a minor wizard to those who live in the town. Nathaniel has gradually come to the conclusion that to gain the true powers he seeks, he will have to throw himself into more dangerous and trying circumstances. The news of a malevolent spirit at the Hamwich manor is exactly the sort of thing that is called for. If Nathaniel can ingratiate himself with more legitimate members of society who can lend cover to his demonic powers, so much the better.

I have a huge number of things like this spread all over the place. But it's not really in the form that it's presentable to anyone.
