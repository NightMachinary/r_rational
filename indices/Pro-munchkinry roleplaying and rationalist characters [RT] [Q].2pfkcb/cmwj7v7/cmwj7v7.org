Heh...

Are you ready to still respect your GM's decision when it comes to interpretations of the text/the plot?

From my experience the problem when players try to be rationalist/go beyond the plot is that they usually superimpose their interpretation above the GM's backstory due to one or two words that might have been told in a more absent manner or a small error that was previously made.

In a similar way, you need to check if your actions are contributing positively to the story or if they're closing of details that exist for the other characters instead of all things for one character to solve.

In the end it depends on the GM and if the story is ready for it. Although in most cases most rationalist plots are very hard to be thwarted by a single band of adventurers, so it's very hard for the GM to balance a story which gives the PC's enough rope to work with and not so much that they hang the story with it.
