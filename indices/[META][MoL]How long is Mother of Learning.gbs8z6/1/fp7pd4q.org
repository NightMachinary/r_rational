As per the [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][FictionPress]] page, MoL is 823,563 words long. Contrast with the Harry Potter series, which is around 1M words long.

Average printed page word count varies widely (based on font, margins, etc), but [[https://k-lytics.com/ebook-page-length/][Amazon Kindle]] uses 250-300 words per page for their calculation. That makes MoL between 2.7k and 3.3k pages long. An estimate of 2800 is fair, based on that metric.

Also using that metric, 823,563 / 108 = 7653 - divide that by 250 or 300 and you get 25-30 pages per chapter, which is what you calculated. The math checks out.

A typical genre novel is ~100k-150k words, which makes MoL ~6-8 "normal" novels long, which compares favorably with Harry Potter at 7 novels long.

If you are reading on a desktop computer you are probably getting a lot more words per page than if you were on an e-reader or if it were printed. Also, it reads pretty fast, for the most part.
