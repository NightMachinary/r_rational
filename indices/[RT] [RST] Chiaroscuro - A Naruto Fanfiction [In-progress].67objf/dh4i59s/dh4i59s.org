I've only checked the first chapter of the story - the opening is well done in the sense that it immediately shows the reader what's different from canon and what to expect, but after that it descends into the usual "I AM SO ANGRY I SPEAK IN ALL CAPS" tell instead of show pitfall. Could still be a good story but that sort of thing throws me off pretty quickly.
