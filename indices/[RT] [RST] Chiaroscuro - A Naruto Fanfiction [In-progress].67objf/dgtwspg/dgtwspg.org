I agree that this story is a rationalist work but, based on the fourteen chapters I've read, it's not very well written. It's clear that the author is trying but it doesn't come off very well. Still a somewhat enjoyable story but it doesn't really compare to most of the works we've seen on this sub. It also pales in comparison to a lot of other good Naruto fanfic.

That being said, it's still a decent story and my opinion is my own.
