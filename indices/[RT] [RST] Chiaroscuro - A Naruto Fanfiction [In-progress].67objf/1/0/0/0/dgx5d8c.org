Its definitely flawed, I'll give you that. Your comparison of show don't tell and Kakashi's "death" are spot on, it even gets a bit worse later on in the whole Jonin promotion thing. A lot of the story has some very good moments, but they're usually immediately spoiled by bad ones. If you don't mind a few minor spoilers, at around chapter 23 Shikkamaru decides to contact Anko and make a deal, essentially feeding her ideas that she'd reveal to the sect hunting down Orochimaru, but the main idea that he initially feeds her is... extremely obvious.

There's some moments like that later on as well, but... I liked it. I certainly see someone disliking it, but certain moments stuck out to me. I enjoyed the subplots going on, and the character's were engaging. Overall I gave it a pass, but I certainly don't blame you for not.

Maybe my memories of a separate but far better fic where Naruto goes on team 10 instead of Choji are coloring me. It isn't a rational fic, but its action scenes are written phenomenally and the character interactions were also very entertaining. It's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6557238/1/Better-Left-Unsaid][Better Left Unsaid]] if you're interested.
