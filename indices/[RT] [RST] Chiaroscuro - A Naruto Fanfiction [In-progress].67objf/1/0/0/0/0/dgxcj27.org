Ah....in my original comment, I said there was a lot of Naruto fanfic that stood far above this one. And BLU is definitely one of them. I've been a fan of this author for *years*. He's definitely slowed down recently but I still really enjoy his content. I've read most of his work, my favorite being his Naruto/Street Fighter fic (A crossover he somehow makes really work, even though it's mostly in the SF world!). I agree that it's really good :)
