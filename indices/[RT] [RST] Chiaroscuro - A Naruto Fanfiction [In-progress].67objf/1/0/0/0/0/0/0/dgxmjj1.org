That's a big question; after all I've been reading Naruto fanfic since 2007 or so. But I shall try and rummage through my brain to throw out some highlights:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3977593/1/Two-Halves][Two Halves]] - Honorable mention as the first fanfic I ever read period. It's mostly just a NaruHina slowburn romance story though. Cutesy, not ground breaking.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3430516/1/Lost-soul][Lost Soul]] was a good one that I read from almost its inception up to its completion. It's one of those "Naruto is trained into a living weapon" type fics. In fact, it may have been one of the first of that particular genre.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8116183/1/Ghost][Ghost]] was also pretty good; it's another one of those "Naruto is trained into a weapon" fics but the difference is in the way it's done; Ghost!Naruto is more of a combat pragmatist than anything else. He wears gray, rarely speaks and is more comfortable with shooting someone in the dark with a crossbow instead of having an out-and-out jutsu fight.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10996503/1/Of-the-River-and-the-Sea][Of the River and the Sea]] was one of the best Naruto fanfictions I've ever read; hands down. The fact that it does this while focusing almost entirely on an SI OC reborn in Kiri in a time that mostly predates canon makes that even more impressive. It feels sort of rational in that the main character is an intelligent SI from our world who's well versed in things like economics and survivalist tactics. She's also likable in general, and lovably insane (at least to me). *Highly recommend this one!*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11418526/1/Kill-Your-Heroes][Kill Your Heroes]] is another very good one. It's Sakura focused and written from an intelligent, realistically gritty standpoint. One of my favorite parts from it is when an old, retired kunoichi bitches about the 4th Hokage because he was dumb enough to get Konoha's jinchuuriki pregnant. /"The worst story," Gozen-san said at last, "is of a selfish man for whom many sons and daughters died, just so he could have a son of his own blood. He knew exactly the stress it would put on the seal, but he did it anyway, because he was so strong and proud and clever that he thought that it was his chance to take. But it wasn't, not in the end. So many dead, all because one man didn't have the sense to adopt and raise a child of the heart, rather than of the flesh. And he died for it, but did anyone think he'd gotten exactly what he'd deserved?"...."No," she said softly, voice sharper than one of Sakura's knives. "No. They whitewashed him and what he'd done and made him a hero," she sneered. "And that is why it's the worst story."/

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4041754/1/Time-and-Again][Time and Again]] is a pretty good time travel fic; it's long and complete BUT it does have an unfinished sequel that starts where Shippuden does basically.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4512691/1/Medicinal-Lullaby][Medicinal Lullaby]] is another amazing Naruto fanfic. This one is Naruto as a dad. At sixteen. Yuppppp. Sadly, it's unfinished so far but what IS there is really, really good. The Naruto in it becomes strong, like OP-broken-plz-nerf strong. But that doesn't make parenthood any easier. It feels like a very realistic portrayal of parenthood by a young guy with no experience but all of the determination and good intentions in the world. Highly recommend this one as well.

I'm going to assume you've read Time Braid.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2348553/1/The-Legend-of-Uzumaki-Naruto-A-Beginning][The Legend of Uzumaki Naruto]] was a story I really enjoyed as a kid; it's a Naruto/World of Warcraft crossover but you really don't need to know anything about WoW to enjoy it (I didn't know shit about WoW when I first read it). Again it's complete and has a sequel but the sequel appears to be discontinued. Regardless, the original story is about 600k words, has its own complete narrative, and was a very fun read.

There's definitely a lot more in my brain but those are all I can come up with right now. Enjoy! :)
