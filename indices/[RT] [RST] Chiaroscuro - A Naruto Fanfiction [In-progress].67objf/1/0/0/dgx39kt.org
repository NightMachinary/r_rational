I've given up at about chapter 21 or so, so I can't really speak for the "further in" you mentioned, I suppose.

*Also, there be spoilers up to chapter 21 ahead, so tread carefully.*

And it's definitely "serviceable". But I find that most of the stories that end up posted here are written to a much higher standard than serviceable, so I may also be biased.

Firstly, there's not a whole lot of description. While the fight scenes are somewhat entertaining, due to the intelligent spin Shikamaru puts on things, they feel very bland. Even the segment with Orochimaru just felt blase and boring.

Secondly, it also seems really inconsistent to me in general; for example, why is everyone so certain Orochimaru can come back from the dead? He's never established that ability at this point (it's established in canon much /much/ later but never in this part of the story or canon so far) He also gets crippled /very/ trivially. We've seen Orochimaru demonstrate monstrous healing abilities mid fight, and we've also seen that everyone's terrified he'll resurrect himself, we also know he must be a God at the Kawarimi yet electrocution makes his arms useless? Due to muscle spasms? It felt very much like the author just needed his arms to be not working as an excuse for what comes later.

And with Shikamaru gaining Izumo as an ally in chapter 20, that felt implausible in several ways; he basically promised him a /Jonin/ position in exchange for a B rank? Even with the implied caveat that this would only happen if Izumo was skilled enough, this seems implausible both because Izumo has no reason to believe Shikamaru could get this done (your son telling you about this random guy he thinks should be a Jonin isn't the strongest recommendation) and because he'd be giving a group of (highly skilled, but still) genin he knows /nothing/ about a mission reserved for experienced Chunin. Shikamaru knows nothing about Izumo either. They basically both operated on blind faith, which is dumb from both of their ends and seems unlikely in the more sane Naruto world the author's trying to present to us. It felt contrived and completely driven by the plot. As an author, it's your job to do your best to NOT make that so obvious.

Thirdly, the story doesn't feel like it delivers very well on what it promises, that of Shikamaru being some borderline OP prodigy level ninja. It's heavily implied that he's holding back and that he works with almost Gai-level persistence to hone his skills, yet he still feels lackluster. The way he's talked about, he should be sweeping the board (with obvious exception to people like Kakashi and Orochimaru) but there hasn't been anything like that. At least not yet. And it's all well and good to hold yourself back in context of the world he lives in but, from a story perspective, waiting twenty chapters for you to deliver on the implied promise of a Shikamaru much better than canon is a bit too much. There's too much /telling/ that Shikamaru's crazy good and not nearly enough /showing/ of it. Honestly, I can't really think of a single moment in the chapters I've read where canon Shikamaru wouldn't have done the job just as well as this Shikamaru, outside of being the top student in the academy.

Lastly, this one particular part of the story was absolutely cringy and automatically made me immediately dock points from the author in my mind. It happens at the end of chapter 15.

  There was really only one proper diagnosis for what he'd just seen.

  "He's dying."

*Chapter 15 ends*

*Chapter 16 begins*

  Hiruzen Sarutobi's heart nearly stopped right then and there.

  "What did you say?"

  "He's dying," Jiraiya confirmed with finality as he got to work immediately. The curse seal lines were mere inches away from Kakashi's heart. If he had arrived even thirty minutes later, it would have been too late.

  "But he's not dead yet. I think I can save him. Well, more like, buy him a few more decades."

  "Oh. All right, then."

Capitful Fuck and Off. That was a move that felt as close to clickbait as you could really get in a written work. At the end of chapter 15, we get about half a page to a page's worth of build up and reasoning to why Kakashi won't make it. There's at least three seperate issues and hints, followed by the chapter ending with Jiraiya saying "he's dying.". I thought to myself 'Wow, he's killing Kakashi? Bold move' because he'd set up Kakashi's death /to make sense/. It could've been a powerful moment; a moving moment for the team and a shake up to the classic Naruto formula that would've served to drive our main team seven even further. Instead we get typical, tropey bullshit that didn't even have the decency to be done in a cool or interesting way. That was the final nail in this story's coffin for me, such that I was completely unsurprised when I finished chapter twent one and said to myself "Yea, I'm done with you."

So overall, that's why I said what I said. The story certainly is fine. But it's just that; fine. I could've continued on on a few other tangents but I didn't want to descend into pointless bashing. It's fine if others feel differently from I do though that doesn't necessarily invalidate some of what I said. The story has legitimate issues.
