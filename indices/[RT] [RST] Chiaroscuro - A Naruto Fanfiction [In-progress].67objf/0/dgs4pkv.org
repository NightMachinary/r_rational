Seconded. I believe this story has been mentioned in passing here on this sub, but no one appears to have made an actual post about it--a fact which is somewhat surprising, given its quality. I was actually considering making a post on it myself, but never quite got around to it. Kudos to you, OP.

P.S. I'm not sure if I'm misremembering, but I believe the author of the story has also commented on this sub in the past. If so, he's at least a peripheral member of the community.
