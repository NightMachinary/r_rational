Okay. That's sort of what I was thinking. I'm assuming that genetic engineering is not available, or Arthur probably wouldn't have social anxiety in the first place. It seems like there might be some optimization left to perform here--Arthur seems to freak out when social interaction is required, and I can't imagine that's good for either their job performance or crew stability and integration.

I enjoy socializing (though I do find it tiring to meet and be friendly with new people), and I don't really have a good model of the social needs of socially anxious people. Does Arthur actually benefit much from socializing, despite their distaste for it? Or is this mostly for the rest of the crew's benefit, so they can get to know and trust their fellow crewmember?
