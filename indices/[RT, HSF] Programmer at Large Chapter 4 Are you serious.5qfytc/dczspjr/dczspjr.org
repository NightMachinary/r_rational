Why does the computer keep recommending socialization for Arthur, when it's clearly unpleasant for them? I imagine that some level of socialization is necessary for the proper functioning of a crew, and that for most members, the preferred level of socialization exceeds this minimum. Is the computer insisting on (and Arthur being frustrated by) the minimum level, or are its recommendations based on what an average crew member would enjoy?
