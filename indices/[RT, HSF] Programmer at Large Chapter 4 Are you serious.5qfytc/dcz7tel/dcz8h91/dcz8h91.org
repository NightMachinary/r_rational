  I like the syllable IDs ! jad-nic, vic-taf, nod-sid... Are you inspired by Urbit in this, or you both draw from another source, or is it independent?
#+end_quote

I'm only aware of Urbit in the vaguest sense, so it's not inspired by it but there might be a common source. The syllables are byte representations from a UUID, with crew-members chosen to have the two least significant bytes from their UUID unique amongst living crew on the same ship. The byte->syllable mapping [[http://hewo.xedoloh.com/2015/04/base-256/][comes from here]]

  Also, is nod-sid 1 not the same as Tulela? Did Tulela adopt the nod-sid ID when they were born?
#+end_quote

Tulela is a use name. It's globally unique amongst living crew, but when its user either dies or manually relinquishes it it comes up for grabs by other users.

So in this case although Arthur is referring to nod-sid 1 as "Tulela" this is technically incorrect. Tulela is the living crew member who currently claims that use name. nod-sid 1 simply happened to be identified as Tulela at the point at which the message was left.

This is a fairly common source of confusion with historical records.

Similarly the nod-sid ID becomes available when its holder dies (two bytes isn't enough for uniqueness across history!), and the dead holder gets a digit after their ID to uniquely identify them (this can technically be used for living crew, but generally you don't and if you don't use a numeral it's assumed you're referring to a live crew).

If you're not bored yet [[https://github.com/DRMacIver/programmer-at-large-notes/blob/master/names.md][there are more details on how all of this works in the world building notes]].
