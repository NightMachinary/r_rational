  Oh I see! That is quite cool, although will anyone memorise the 256 syllables?

It isn't actually necessary to do so - you just need to remember people's identifiers, and it's easier to remember vic-taf than to remember what numbers it corresponds to.

That being said, the crew are much much better at language than we would consider normal, so it's probably easy for them to memorise the syllables if they really cared to.
