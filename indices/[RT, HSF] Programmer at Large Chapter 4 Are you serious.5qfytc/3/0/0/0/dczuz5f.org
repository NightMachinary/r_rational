  I'm assuming that genetic engineering is not available, or Arthur probably wouldn't have social anxiety in the first place.
#+end_quote

Genetic engineering and screening are available but tricky when it comes to behaviour - too many useful things are too close to too many problem things. Cases like Arthur are rare but not absurdly so.

(Significant modification of the human mind may be possible in reality, but in this setting 21st century technology is posited to be much closer to the plateau of what's possible than one might hope)

  It seems like there might be some optimization left to perform here--Arthur seems to freak out when social interaction is required,
#+end_quote

Arthur doesn't usually freak out when socialisation is required, they freak out when they perceive socialisation to be going wrong (and have an extremely exaggerated sense of when that is). Normally they just find it slightly overwhelming. Unfortunately they anticipate both these things, so are rather scared of it and try to avoid it where possible.

  and I can't imagine that's good for either their job performance or crew stability and integration.
#+end_quote

There's a reason Arthur has an atypically solitary job.

  Does Arthur actually benefit much from socializing, despite their distaste for it?
#+end_quote

Arthur (and a lot of people with social anxiety in general) actually quite likes socialising as long as it's going well, and will feel sad like most people if they don't get enough of it. It's just that they also find it scary and difficult, and would prefer to stick to more familiar people and situations that they're better able to navigate.

Sometimes when they avoid it it's genuinely because they can't cope with it right now, sometimes they're just letting fear overcome them. In that sense having the ship giving them a constant nudge towards socialisation is actually quite helpful for them, even if they hate it, but it can also go wrong and the ship is not particularly able to distinguish the difference.

  Or is this mostly for the rest of the crew's benefit, so they can get to know and trust their fellow crewmember?
#+end_quote

It's not so much about knowing and trusting any individual crewmember (though that is part of it) as creating an extremely tightly knit society that is very resistant to factionalisation and other forms of breakdown. The ship's social software pays a lot of attention to the shape of the friendship network and tries to make sure that it's well mixed and everyone is a fairly low social distance from everyone else.
