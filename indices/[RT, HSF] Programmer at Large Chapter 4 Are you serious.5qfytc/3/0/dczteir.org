The ship's software is not a hedonic utilitarian and it's only really interested in Arthur's happiness to a certain base level (above the bare minimum needed for them to be productively functioning as a member of the crew, but not a /lot/ above that).

The goal of the socialisation program is primarily to keep the crew society well integrated and stable, not because the ship thinks people enjoy it. Normally the suggestions are less "you should socialise more" and more "it would be useful for you to socialise outside your current ingroup".

Fortunately most of the crew /do/ enjoy it. Arthur is just unlucky in that they have a social anxiety disorder and live in a hypersocial society, so they tend to be constantly bumping into the danger zone where the ship thinks they might be failing to integrate properly and gets quite pushy.
