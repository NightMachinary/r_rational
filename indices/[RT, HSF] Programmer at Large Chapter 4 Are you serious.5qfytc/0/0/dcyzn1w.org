  It's millennias into the future and humanity still hasn't solved death?

The basic premise of this setting (and the Vernor Vinge novels it was loosely based on) is that we're much closer to the point where what's possible plateaus than one might optimistically expect. No FTL. AI is limited or impossible. No magic nanotech. No neural transfers.

Depending on how you count things (basically, whether you count time spent asleep or not. The crew don't), the average crew lifespan is anywhere between about 200 and about 1000 years. They push that up gradually over time, but towards the end of that they're hitting some fairly major limitations on human neural architecture which are hard to resolve without causing major damage, and the body has been repaired so many times that it starts to become extremely fragile.

  What have they been doing?

Periodically self-destructing at a global level, or sleeping through most of it amidst the stars.
