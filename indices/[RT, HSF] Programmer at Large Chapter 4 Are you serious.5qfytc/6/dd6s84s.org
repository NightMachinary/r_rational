Until the last comment about the gym, I honestly didn't realize the protagonist was female. Huh.

Once more the differences between Ship coding and ours proves amusing. The fact bug-hunter programs exist makes sense as soon as it's brought up, but beforehand I was thinking people went around to do it manually. Got a chuckle out of the protag's first thought to find out how many programs hadn't been poked at by humans since launch, only to realize it was /considerably/ bigger than expected and immediately toss that idea for something else.
