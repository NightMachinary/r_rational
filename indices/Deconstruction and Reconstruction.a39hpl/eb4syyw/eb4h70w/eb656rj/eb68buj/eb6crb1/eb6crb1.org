Hrm. I think I would actually just call them two different axes? But it's close.

[Deconstruction <---> Reconstruction] would be our "disposition toward heart of the work" axis, while [Cause Alteration <---> Effect Alteration] would be a separate but related axis. (Note that neither of these are actually axes, because there are obvious hybrid approaches; the most common sort of reconstruction spends its first half as a deconstruction.)

So we'd have four elemental subtypes ...

*Cause Alteration Deconstruction:* Changes the base parameters of the work in order to criticize the original. Seems like it would generally be pretty weak deconstruction, and would likely get called out as character assassination, because it's not founded on the principles of the work. Probably strongest when it's showing us inside the head of someone we're not canonically in the head of, showing how a villain is the hero of his own story, or how the hero is impurely motivated.

*Effect Alteration Deconstruction:* /Much/ more common, and much easier, because the stage has been set for you, and all that remains is to take it in a different (typically darker) direction, showing how it would "really" be.

*Cause Alteration Reconstruction:* The original has people make dumb decisions for dumb reasons, forget about their powers, etc, and the easiest way to fix these things is to give justifications for them in one way or another, reconciling the magic system or standardizing the superpowers or whatever. On the character side, this is usually the fan wank explanations for why some obvious plot hole isn't /actually/ a plot hole.

*Effect Alteration Reconstruction:* Less common, in my experience. Basically, you see a place where the characters act out of character, or the established rules are violated for no clear reason, and you decide that you're going to keep to those rules, /while/ adhering as closely as possible to the spirit of the work.

I would definitely agree that the two styles are each closely aligned with an approach, which is why I would call it a quibble.
