Yes, I agree with this. Where the "cause" is the world building (aka: the state of the world at the beginning of the story) and the "effect" is the result of this world and how it evolves (aka: the plot), to every narrative there's always a third element: the presentation. Which in-world isn't something tangible, but it has to do with how the events are framed and presented to us. You could use the same exact dialogue, and with different narrative cues, make the same scene feel neutral, or threatening, or funny. The "headspace" of the characters especially is completely inaccessible to them (unless telepathy is involved), but it's bared in front of the readers if so the author wishes.
