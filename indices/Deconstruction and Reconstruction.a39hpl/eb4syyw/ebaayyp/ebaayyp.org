HPMOR does a bit of both, but imho it's neither really because one way or another both deconstruction and reconstruction focus /on the original work/.

Taking the most famous example I can think of: the mecha anime genre. /Evangelion/ is a blatant deconstruction of it, takes the tropes and twists them, showing the result they would lead when applied to psychologically realistic characters (and let's face it, not even the most stable people to begin with). /Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann/ is a reconstruction, in that it explicitly embraces the irrationality that drove the older, simpler stuff and makes it an actual rule of its setting, saying basically "fuck realism, we like giant robots BECAUSE THEY'RE AWESOME".

Both have their own themes too (depression and human relationships for Eva, growth, loss and human spirit for TTGL), but in one way both works talk mainly /about the mecha genre itself/.

So to be either a deconstruction or a reconstruction, HPMOR's main concern should be to talk about Harry Potter (the book series, not the character). But besides the occasional jab, I don't think that was ever EY's main aim. Rather, he wanted to /use/ Harry Potter as a useful vehicle to lay down some ideas about rationality and narratives at large, and a lot of other stuff really. Especially as we go forward, the focus of HMPOR shifts away from talking about HP and moves on to talking about rationality at large, in a more general sense.

Now this still passes through some criticism of HP, but there too I think there's a double nature for good reason. On one hand, the values expressed by HP as a series are mostly positive, and there's no reason to deconstruct them. On the other, though, the setting itself, and sometimes the characters' actions, seem to contradict those values, and do so mostly out of narrative convenience or author oversight, and there HPMOR sets to lampshade those problems and if possible fix them.

And then of course you have the whole Sirius Black thing which, let's be honest, was just Eliezer trolling the readers.
