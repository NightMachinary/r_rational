It's an interesting way of framing it ... but I'm not sure how correct it is.

My quibble is mostly with how "Effect" and "Cause" are defined. For my example? A romantic comedy.

In the romantic comedy, man chases after girl, does some sketchy stuff to win her over, she eventually finds out and gets mad, and then he wins her over again with his love, they kiss, end of movie.

In the deconstruction, all the warped power dynamics, unhealthy attachment, pressure and expectations, etc. are all laid out. If we're excoriating the male lead, then the female lead probably says something like, "No, you don't get to fuck me just because you put in a lot of effort, and I'm not obligated to forgive you just because you made some grand gesture". All that's pretty standard fare for deconstruction, and I would generally agree that you can reasonably model it as "keep effect the same, change cause".

/But/ we can do a deconstruction in a /different/ way, where neither cause nor effect actually changes, at least on the surface. Instead, we get a better psychological model of the man and woman, they ways in which they're damaged, and what causes them to respond to things in the way that they do. Where the original doesn't call out the behavior as unhealthy, the deconstruction definitely does, in ways that are explicit or implicit. The grand gestures of the male lead are revealed to be because those are easier than consistently being a good person. The acceptance of the female lead is from the gaslighting and internal feelings of worthlessness, with a smidgen of cultural conditioning layered on top of this. It's not depicted as a healthy relationship, but the plot beats are the same, and the outcomes are the same, they've only changed the /framing/. Really, what we've done is changed the worldbuilding, the "cause" rather than the effect. It's still not a reconstruction though, because its aim is to break down the original into its component parts and show all the ways that it's ugly and problematic.

Similarly, there are different methods of reconstruction. What's important is not so much whether we're meddling with cause and effect, it's whether we're preserving the heart of the work or attacking it. You can do reconstruction that attempts to fix all the problems in the worldbuilding to achieve the same result (cause alteration), or you can take the stated rules to their limits and get something wildly different (effect alteration) ... and still have both of those sing to the same tune of the original.
