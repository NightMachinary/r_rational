Well, you posted it at 10pm in California, 1am in New York, and 6am in London (so presumably before 8am or 9am for most of Europe). I reckon most people are probably available during downtime at work or during their break, and then when they get home after work. Most of Europe is in the middle of their workday, maybe within plus or minus an hour of their lunch break. The east coast of the U.S. is just waking up for the most part (6:34am by my clock) and it's the middle of the night for the west coast. I'm going to go out on a limb and reckon that most of the people who frequent [[/r/rational][r/rational]] live in Europe or the U.S.
