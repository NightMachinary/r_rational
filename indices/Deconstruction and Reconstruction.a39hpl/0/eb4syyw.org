  According to these definitions, almost every rational fanfic is first and foremost a reconstruction, including HPMOR and Worm.

I've always felt that HPMOR didn't know if it wanted to be a deconstruction or a reconstruction. There are several scenes where some completely illogical bit of worldbuilding is lampshaded and never brought up again (why doesn't anyone abuse the exchange rates between muggle and wizard money? Why doesn't anyone letter bomb the Wizengamot?), but there's /also/ scenes where the world has been rational-ified (Dumbledore acts weird and inefficiently because he's trying to fulfill a prophecy, Voldemort is cartoonishly evil because he's just doing a prep-run for his actual attempt at world domination). It leaves the whole thing feeling a bit confused
