Yeah, that's my read. A deconstruction preserves worldbuilding and loses the plot, the theme, and the tone. A reconstruction abandons worldbuilding in order to preserve the plot, theme, and tone.

I'd go so far as to propose that most /fanfiction/ is either: - reconstruction where the worldbuilding is warped in order to match whatever the fanfic author wishes the story had focused on while preserving whatever they liked about the original work. - deconstruction where the plot, theme, and tone are warped in order to lampoon whatever the fanfic author was exasperated by in the original work. - or both! Season to taste.

So Rational Fanfic either devotes itself to adjusting the worldbuilding for logical consistency, or using logically inconsistent worldbuilding to munchkin varying degrees of omniscience.
