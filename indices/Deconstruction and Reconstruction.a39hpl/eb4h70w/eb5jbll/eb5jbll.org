I don't think the reconstruction abandons worldbuilding, it re-organises the world so that the worldbuilding rationally results in something close (ie thematically comparable) to the original intention, taking full advantage of the lessons learned from the deconstruction.

I suggest that Pokemon OoS is a reconstruction, since it is about kids adventuring in dangerous wilds and training elemental horrors to battle one another as was the original game, but benefits from prior deconstructions that described the world as one featuring cockfighting for profit, Team Rocket terrorism, and post-apocalyptic survival.
