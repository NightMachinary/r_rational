Here's the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] post about the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6oje2x/nsfw_the_erogamer_a_quest_about_a_girl_who/][Erogamer]] so you can read what others here thought about it before.

It's basically about a girl who becomes a Gamer like in an LitRpg, except the game in question is an eroge aka runs on porn rules. It sounds like it should be a boring harem story chock full of wish-fulfillment, but it scratches the same philosophical metanarrative itch that /Worth the Candle/ does.

Here's the review which sums it up better than any others I have read.

  "This is way more depth than I was expecting with my porn quest, even taking that statement into account." --- [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/page-37#post-1353851][Sirrocco]]

It's worth making an account for if it's only to read this one story.
