It's unfortunate that you're getting downvoted, since your post seems pretty well cautioned, if a bit aggressive. Just asking what this is about, in future cases, would get you a more positive response, assuming you care about it.

As others say, the website is pretty well known around here (as the less censored version of spacebattles and sufficientvelocity) and the story itself is the best example of its genre that I ever read, and a pretty fun read in general.
