The site is fine. Questionable Questing is just that, a 'Questing' site dedicated to (mostly but not always) questionable quests/stories. It's basically SpaceBattles or SufficentVeloicity if they didn't sensor themselves in any way. It's (for the most part) used as a fanfiction site for sexy/porn stuff. This link is to one of them, the Erogamer, which is actually a Rational fic about a girl that gets a version of The Gamer power except it's like two infinities more powerful than the original and its centered around sex.

As you might imagine, there is quite a bit of sex in it. On the other hand, the plot and exploration of the metaphysical narrative is second to none. It's like Jostein Gaarder's Sophie's World in a way, except much more... sexy, rational, and critical of society and ways of thinking. It's actually really good. Both the sexy stuff as well as the plot, and the characters. It's one of the best stories I've ever read actually, regardless of origin or genre.

This specific link is for the latest chapter just released today.

I do recommend it if you're in any way a person that enjoys erotica or is interested in trying it out. It even has its own manga/hentai adaptation (for parts of the series) that the author paid for. It's hilarious, amazingly written, really thought provoking, and very hot.
