You have the power to instantly 'reflect' yourself. Anything that happens to the right side of your body (injuries, muscle fatigue) can be switched to the left and vice versa.

This includes your body position, including internal organs, as though you just swapped places with the person in the mirror.

Also applies to things you are wearing or holding* (*if you are physically capable of lifting them yourself)
