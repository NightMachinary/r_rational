How is left-handed sugar, as an element of diet, functionally better from stevia, erythritol, xylitol, or any other non-sugar sweetener, such that you can actually make a profit from bulk sales? Seems to me, low or 0-calorie sweeteners are already ubiquitous and low-cost.

If you sell L-sugar merely as a curiosity, you're going to run into lack of demand very quickly that will eliminate any profit you can make.
