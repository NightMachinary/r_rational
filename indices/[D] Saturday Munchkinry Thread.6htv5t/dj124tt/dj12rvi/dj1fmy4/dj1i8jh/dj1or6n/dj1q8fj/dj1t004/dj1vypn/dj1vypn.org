If the ability works down to the molecular level, then it /should/ work to make left-handed sugar out of right-handed sugar.

I'm less certain of your (reflected) body's ability to function /at all/, since every single molecule in your body would be reflected and that would give some of them different properties. That probably wouldn't be a problem until you started eating or drinking things (since water and air are non-chiral), but once you tried ingesting things you would run into problems. (L-glucose and D-glucose taste the same, but I'm not sure this is true for all tastes and smells; naively, I would think that both rely on bonding, which relies on configuration, which means that taste/smell/digestion would be impacted.)
