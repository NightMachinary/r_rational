Another work dealing with this phenomenon is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technical_Error&oldid=762053060][a short story by Arthur C Clarke]], in which an industrial worker has an accident. The characters don't know what happened and try to figure out what's wrong with him, and why he's losing weight despite eating regularly.

I remember there being a rather chilling line about nourishment, something like “despite all this food, it doesn't nourish,” I but can't recall the particulars.
