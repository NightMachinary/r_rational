Think of it this way, you body needs to know what it's eating so it knows what to do with it. In order to tell what all this food stuff is, the most common way is shape. Your body creates relatively large molecules that are like gloves or shoes, and the stuff you eat fits into different shoes depending on what it is. So there are shoes for different sugars, shoes for different vitamins, etc.

Right-handed sugar and left-handed sugar are like your right and left feet. Sure they look the same, but your right foot doesn't fit in your left shoe (at least, it shouldn't. Unifoot shoes are weird). The same thing happens here: your body only has shoes for right-handed sugar. The right-handed sugar you eat fits in the shoes your body makes, so your body can tell "oh hey this is sugar" and then use it. The left-handed sugar just bounces around without properly fitting into anything, so your body doesn't know what it is and doesn't do anything with it.
