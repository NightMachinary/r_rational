It tastes the same as normal, right-handed sugar, but the body doesn't absorb it. Diabetics can have it, it has all the same properties as far as baking, browning, etc. go, and it doesn't cause or exacerbate tooth decay. It's 0 calories, obviously.

It's also really expensive to produce, which is why it's not currently commercially viable. Of course, your ability to make money is limited by how many pounds you can do in a day.
