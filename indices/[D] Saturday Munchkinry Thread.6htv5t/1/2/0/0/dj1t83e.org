I see a few interpretations of this statement:

Case 1) Everything I'm holding in my right arm teleports to my cut-off left arm.

Case 2) My right arm, along with everything it is holding, is cut off and teleported to the location of my left arm, while my left arm is teleported to me and reconnected with my body.

In these cases, the stuff gets teleported.

Case 3) Everything about my body is mirrored at once, so my cut-off left arm teleports across my body to its mirror location, still cut off. Based on what you just said, I now assume this is the correct interpretation.

This case is trickier, but still easily exploitable. Just get someone else to put the stuff on my cut-off left arm, and call me to tell me when to activate my power.

Actually this case is the most exploitable, since the teleportation would be able to send you to places you haven't been before.

So for example, say 100 km in front of you is an enemy base. Go 100km back, hold a bomb in your left hand, and cut it off. Now go back to your original location and stand such that to your left is your left hand, and to your right is the enemy base. Activate your ability. BOOM.

You now have no right hand. But the enemy base is no more.
