Question, can I cut off parts of my body and still use this? Because it basically allows teleportation from place A to place B.

Cut off my left hand and leave it in place A. Go to place B, pick up stuff with my right hand (use plastic bags to make it easier to hold), and activate ability. Boom, stuff now disappears from my right hand in place B and reappears on my left hand in place A.

You could use fingers instead of hands if you like your hands. I suggest the left pinkie.

Or alternatively, you could grow out your hair! Grow twin tails! Then you can cut off your left twintail and pick up stuff with your right to teleport them to your left!
