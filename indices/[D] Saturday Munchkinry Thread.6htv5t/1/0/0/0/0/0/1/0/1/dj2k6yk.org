This is the plot of a Philip Pullman novel called 'the boy who reversed himself'. Great YA light sci-fi. The main characters basically discover a way to travel through the fourth spacial dimension, and accidentally 'reverse' themselves in that dimension at one point. They discover that chirality-flipped ketchup tastes like the best thing ever and has euphoric properties. I really recommend the book!
