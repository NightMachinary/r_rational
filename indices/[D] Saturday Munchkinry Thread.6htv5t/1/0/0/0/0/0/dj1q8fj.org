This is a real thing. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry)][Chirality]] is a chemical property of some molecules; using the same building blocks, and the same basic arrangement of bonds and atoms, you can build a molecule that's /almost/, but not quite, the same as the mirror version.

Pretty much all sugars derive from natural sources, and pretty much all of those sources produce D-sucrose, the sugar that we all know and love. However, if you do a lot of stuff in the lab, you can produce L-sucrose, which is the same as D-sucrose except with the bonds mirrored. To your taste buds, it's the same, but to the bacteria in your mouth and to your stomach, it's unprocessable. Everything that makes sugar makes D-sucrose, so we haven't evolved to deal with L-sucrose since it's not found in nature.

(I was on a drug called Celexa for awhile; the process that makes it makes a left-handed and right-handed version of the molecule, where only one of those actually does the proper SSRI thing it's supposed to and the other is basically useless/detrimental. Lexapro has the useless part removed, but it costs more, so they only prescribe it if you have symptoms. You need half as much Lexapro as you need Celexa, because it's removing the half that doesn't do anything.)
