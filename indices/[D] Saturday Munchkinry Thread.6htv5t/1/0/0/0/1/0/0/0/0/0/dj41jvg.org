Normally the infrastructure would work out better in the long run, yes, but in this case you have to manually invert all of your soils and fertilisers - everything that has chiral molecules that goes into the system. Which means that pretty near every atom of carbon in your left-handed sugar will come from a flipped molecule in any case. And there will be a fair amount of wastage, as well.

It seems less trouble to just flip the sugar.
