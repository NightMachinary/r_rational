More efficient in the short run, true. But building capital will let you set up infrastructure that allows for much more sugar production in the long run. Then again I guess it doesn't matter, because, until the next scientific breakthrough on creating left handed sugar, you'll control the entire supply and thus the price of it anyways.

I wonder how antitrust legislation would interplay with this...
