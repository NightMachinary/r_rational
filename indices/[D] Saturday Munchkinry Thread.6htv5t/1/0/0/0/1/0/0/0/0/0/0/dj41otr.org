I was under the impression that a completely closed greenhouse doesn't require any inputs like fertilizer, but I guess you're correct.

Hm, what about charging to flip people themselves? They can buy an amount of flipped food for themselves from you regularly to actually eat for nourishment, and then all other food they eat will be correct but not metabolisable.
