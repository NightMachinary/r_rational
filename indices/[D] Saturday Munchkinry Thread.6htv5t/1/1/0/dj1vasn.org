Any mass you switch has to be something you can carry. The scalpel could switch sides out of the doctors hand, or it could end up bonded to your skin as the space it was occupying no longer becomes empty.

I'm not sure what that would do to the structural integrity of the scalpel. It could become incredibly brittle (gallium absorbed into aluminum scenario) or it could stay solid and, even though one side of it is sharp, still need to be cut out with another scalpel to avoid ripping and tearing from the bonded flesh.

I only just learned about left/right handed isomers from these comments. I'm curious now if that simple switch would result in the person gasping for breath as their body no longer interacts with their environment the way it's supposed to. Might make a good murder plot if there's a delay until the negative effects add up.
