You could get some mild energy gains by lying on your side and holding a mass and swapping sides. This really could only gain small amounts of energy (a fair amount less than 1000 Joules at a time) and there wouldn't be an easy way to harness it.

What happens if someone were performing surgery on one half of your body, with the scalpel inside of you, when you switched sides? If it moves the scalpel, you could have some giant mass that has a bit inside of you and switch sides.

I know that some molecules have left/right isomers, but I'm not sure what effect switching them would have.
