Organized by humans? Then I understand and can instinctively see the Invisible Hand of the market! By perceiving the global economy naturally and perfectly, I could outperform any investment broker and probably any modern microtransaction supercomputer, seeing trends before others can perform their analyses, and would be able to get incredibly rich incredibly fast.

I'd also understand politics, society, culture, and romance to such an insane degree that it would be child's play to become universally beloved while deflecting all possible suspicion.
