There was a really clever moment in Gargoyles:

#+begin_quote
  "All right, big guy. I'm holding the spell. That means you have to do what I say. I order you to act for the rest of your life exactly as you would if you were not under a spell."
#+end_quote

Tweak the wording and you could do something similar. You'd technically be under a curse to obey someone. That sucks.

But since you're obeying yourself, it doesn't have much practical effect beyond blocking any lesser mind-control spells.
