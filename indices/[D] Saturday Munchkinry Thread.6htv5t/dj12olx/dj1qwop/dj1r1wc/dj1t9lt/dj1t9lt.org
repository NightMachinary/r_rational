I see, so it has to sound harmful to the Dungeon Master, not just to me.

I curse myself to never kill anything. Now I am a supreme power leveler/trainer, able to utterly destroy enemies until they have 1hp so my allies can killsteal, and also able to whip my allies into shape without fear of accidentally killing them.

I curse myself to never win any gambles. I get my allies to bet the opposite of whatever I bet on, and thus become filthy rich.

I curse myself to never finish a battle. Then, since a battle is finished if either I or the enemy dies, I can be an indestructible tank. So I can stay in dungeon boss fights until both the boss and I are at 1hp, then flee the fight and let my allies kill the 1hp boss.

I curse myself to temporarily gain the elemental weaknesses of whatever I'm thinking of at the moment (or whatever I last touch). E.g., if I think of a fire spirit, I'm now suddenly extremely weak to water. Now I can use myself to identify the weaknesses of any dungeon boss. Think of the boss (or touch the boss and run), then try a bunch of minor offensive spells of different elements on myself until I find one that does damage.

Same thing but now with skills/stats/the opposite of the enemy's strengths/etc. Now I'm a walking pokedex with extreme detail, able to fully analyze everything about every monster.

I curse myself with an extreme allergy to demons/evil/other kinds of enemy essences. Now I'm an enemy detector, if I start sneezing like crazy, there's enemies around. This will greatly hinder my combat ability, but my party will no longer be ambushable.

I curse myself with total inaccuracy: my attacks will never hit anything. Now when fighting invisible enemies, I can cast an AoE spell. Whichever spot my AoE spell doesn't hit, the invisible enemy is there. So my allies can now see the invisible enemy and kill it.

I curse myself with the hatred of the entire world, causing all enemies to attack me instead of my allies. My allies would also attack me, so I would only use this with my defense is much higher than my allies' attacks. So it's a curse for a super tank.

I curse myself with lag. My communication with the DM takes three "turns". So if I want to attack an enemy, my attack happens only three rounds of combat later. This makes you unable to react properly to enemy movements, but would allow you to pull off some interesting lag kills. Conversely, if an enemy wants to attack me, its attack only affects me three rounds of combat later. So this would also increase your survivability in some ways. Note: The DM's head will probably start to hurt in a while.

And finally, if the DM refuses all my suggestions:

I curse myself with complete obedience to some other player. Now that player can control my character, and I can go play a game that isn't run by this DM. > _ > < _ <.
