  How would this work? If you're holding up a weight using your spirit, you're still fighting gravity's acceleration and therefore consuming energy.

Work is force over distance. If you're not lifting the object, you're not technically doing any work.

This sounds weird, since holding up a big rock would make us humans tired. But, imagine putting the rock on a table. The table has to counter gravity's force. But it's not doing any work.

  Arbitrarily shaped spirits seem OP; there are too many story-breaking applications (e.g. lock-picking, non-spirit combat, survival in dangerous environments, flight via spirit glider). I can't think of a logical reason why it shouldn't be possible though.

I'd make spirits human-shaped by default. People think this is a law. But really, it's just that our brains are wired with a human-shaped template.

Getting a non-human shaped spirit requires you to overwrite your brain's map of your body. It's possible, but anyone who manages it would be deeply, deeply weird.

  This might be a matter of how common spirit usage is, and also being trained to perceive and defend against other spirits.

I might push at this a bit more. In the real world, I'd expect a VIP to have ~5 body guards, or fewer. Even if those body guards are fantastically trained, I'd expect them to lose a brawl to a crowd.

Body guards work in the real world partly because we use metal detectors. This means that VIPs can have armed guards. Also, there are severe real-world consequences for trying to attack a VIP. No one wants to rush a stage at a concert if it means they'll get their nose broken by security.

These consequences wouldn't obviously apply to spirits. I wouldn't expect to be able to shoot one with a gun. And even if I could detect a spirit, it might be hard to trace it back to a specific person.

You also have the problem that any body guard who's using his spirit to protect a VIP is a body guard who's vulnerable to spiritual attack himself.

If I were leading an intelligent group of attackers, I'd pick a situation where we outnumbered the guards. Then have our spirits attack the guards in waves. The guards would either lose, or be forced to withdraw their spirits to defend themselves. At that point, the group attacks the undefended VIP en-mass.

I can see a few options that would let VIPs defend against this.

The first is to ramp up the exponential decay of spirit-strength. Then force VIPs to stay 30' back from crowds at all times. That way, they'd have enough leverage to defend themselves. This has interesting story consequences; anyone who's sufficiently famous loses the ability to have a normal public life.

Alternately, add physical ways to defend against spirits. Maybe they can't cross a line of salt. That makes it possible for VIPs to shower in private. The interesting story-prompt here might be: It's your anniversary. You send your spirit home to whisper 'I love you' to them. The spirit discovers that your bedroom has been warded. But there's a good reason...

A third option might be to add consequences for misuse of spirits. Maybe they can be trapped. And this causes some kind of terrible damage to the person who's now lost their magic. For instance, you can only fall asleep when your spirit is inside your body.

If this is true, I can imagine a story prompt like: Teenager hears that [pop-star] is doing a photo-shoot at the beach. Teenager, being dumb and horny, sends their spirit to watch. Someone anticipated voyeurs. The teen's spirit is caught in a necromantic trap. They have a very short window to find and free their spirit.
