  The amount of energy the spirit can use is limited only by how much energy is in the body, so theoretically, the spirit could e.g. tear apart reinforced concrete, given enough energy.

That sounds like limited energy (joules), but not limited power(watts). Batteries of people (slaves, volunteers, wage earners) can have ludicrously high power outputs concentrated on one point. A new siege weapon is a line of people standing in front of a mid-sized rock. The first person's spirit shoves the rock forward hard enough to exhaust themselves for a period of time (between a minute and a week), followed by the second, who pushes the flying rock, and the third, who pushes the /quickly/ flying rock, and so on until all of the people have added their energy to the rock, making a cannon.

Eavesdropping/spying becomes much easier.

Mechanical repairs and surgery also become easier, as you can access the inside of something without opening it up.
