Seems like I'll have to figure out how rare to make this ability to avoid story-breaking stuff while keeping things interesting.

  Eavesdropping/spying becomes much easier.

Maybe. Depends on how common spirit-usage is, and on whether people are trained to detect other spirits.

  Mechanical repairs and surgery also become easier, as you can access the inside of something without opening it up.

Surgery not so much. If you can get your patient to move their spirit out of their body (or you know how to force it out), definitely, but otherwise, their spirit gets in the way.
