It seems like the best practice is to use spirit to augment yourself, and only use it remotely for special circumstances like scouting, and espionage.

It's similar to the magic system in eragon. Requiring the same amount of energy it would take to complete the task yourself and exponential energy requirements with distance.

Two big questions:

How fast can a spirit move?

Can it 'snap back' to the body or does it have to travel the distance?

There are three scenarios in one on one fights between spirit users;

- Both using Spirit separated from their body.

Two spirits fighting is pretty much a fight of endurance, whoever runs out of energy first loses. Less distance between you and your spirit means less energy use, and efficiency is the biggest advantage you could have.

The contest would basically be both spirits trying to locate the unprotected body of their opponent while also trying to maintain leverage of distance without giving away their own position. The best way would probably be to sneak up on your opponent with your real body, keeping them distracted with the fight. Or luring your opponent into a trap.

There's plenty of mind games and strategy to explore here. But this is all all attack, no defense strategy. If you choose this fighting style it only makes sense if your goal is to attack the body directly, expect high risk feints and gambits, not a direct spirit to spirit fight, because that would almost always equal a loss to whoever is furthest from their body. Both would have to be the 'sacrifice all your peices for the checkmate' kind of people to end up fighting like this.

That or one got caught snooping and got forced into this method of confrontation. Try making a tactical retreat while keeping your spirit in range without letting it give away your direction or position for them to send the army after you, or without losing the leverage of distance and dying anyway.

- second fight scenario

One person with no defenseless body to sneak attack, just a spirit with it's power source directly inside it with no loss over the distance squared.

Vs someone with a weak defenseless body and a spirit unnecessarily leaking energy somewhere away from their pathetic body. Blow for blow against our friend they will lose the most energy in Spirit, or their body will get smashed into paste.

Having your spirit outside your body against another spirit user is a bad idea. Which leads us to scenario 3

- Both using Spirit to Augment the body.

Use a crossbow or something first to drain as much energy from your opponent possible and gain the advantage before you jump in. Maybe use your spirit to quickly grab a spear from behind them, or use it to shoot the crossbow while you stay out of harms way if you must.

Using spirit outside your body should only be for specialised tasks like unlocking doors from the inside, triggering traps remotely, or using tools like crossbows that provide decent return for your expended energy.

If it doesn't cost the enemy more than it costs you, it's not worth it.

Heck, in a first scenario fight, my strategy would be to keep the fight as close to my body as possible, then retreat into my body and go offensive on the spirit to drain them dry, follow them back to their body if they try to run and end it there after they wasted most of their energy being stupid. (Maybe they're trying to do the same thing to me.)
