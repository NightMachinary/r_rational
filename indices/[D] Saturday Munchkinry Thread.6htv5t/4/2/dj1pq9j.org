Can your spirit go through walls like ghosts? Can it say, look inside a lock and push the pins to unlock it? This would be useful for all kinds of espionage.

It would also be incredibly useful for scientific research. At present, there are plenty of chemicals we would like to study but can't properly do so because we can't actually hold them. E.g. Liquid tungsten is so hot that it melts just about any container you put it in. You could use this spirit ability to just hold the liquid tungsten. Same for many other chemicals that are too toxic or radioactive to handle safely. Spirits would revolutionize the field of chemistry.
