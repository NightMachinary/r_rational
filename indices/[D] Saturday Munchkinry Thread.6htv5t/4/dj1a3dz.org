People have spirits. Spirits can affect the physical world. Usually, a person's spirit remains inside their body. However, it's possible to send one's spirit outside one's body to perform tasks in the physical world. Using the spirit to observe and affect with the physical world requires expending energy from the body. Energy consumption increases (usually exponentially, but the exact fashion varies from person to person) as the spirit goes farther from its host. Consequently, if the distance is too great, the host will die of exhaustion.

The spirit can affect the physical world in the way the body does---imparting kinetic energy to objects (i.e. picking things up, manipulating them, hitting, throwing, etc.). The amount of energy the spirit can use is limited only by how much energy is in the body, so theoretically, the spirit could e.g. tear apart reinforced concrete, given enough energy. The spirit can also be used inside the body to augment the host's physical strength or durability.

It's difficult for two spirits to exercise physical influence in the same space in the same way that it's hard to push one's hand through someone else's hand, meaning that it's possible to defend against spirit attacks on the physical body.
