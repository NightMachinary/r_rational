- In combat, keep your spirit in your body. Then you can punch spirits /and/ punch physical things. In fact, by keeping your spirit in your body (or maybe a few centimetres outside) you get all the benefits of spirit manipulation at extremely low energy costs, except you actually have to be there to rip up that reinforced concrete.

- Bodyguards should be able to do the above as well.

- It makes sense for damage to the spirit to reflect damage to the body; if your spirit punches mine in the nose, my body gets a bloody nose (perhaps only when my spirit returns to it?)

- Can a person control body and spirit simultaneously, to effectively get four hands working together on some task? (This will be very useful when, for example, soldering).

- People with non-human self-images may have non-human spirits. Transgender people may have spirits of a different gender to their body. So on and so forth. (Still a constant shape, just not the same shape as their physical body).

- If someone dies, what happens to their spirit? Can a dead spirit be used to create objects made of 'spirit-stuff' - like a sword that ignores (physical) armour and slices through the spirit of the person inside the armour?
