  It makes sense for damage to the spirit to reflect damage to the body; if your spirit punches mine in the nose, my body gets a bloody nose (perhaps only when my spirit returns to it?)

I like this. It adds consequences for getting into spirit vs. spirit fights.

  Can a person control body and spirit simultaneously, to effectively get four hands working together on some task?
#+end_quote

Yes, with enough practice.

  If someone dies, what happens to their spirit?
#+end_quote

The fluff is that there's a spirit world and a physical world, and non-sentient blobs of spirit leak over to the physical world and inhabit living things. When those things die, normally the spirit incarnates in another random living being, or goes back to the spirit world and loses its shape/history, like an ice sculpture melting in a pond. However, if the being is a human, then the spirit retains self-awareness when the body dies, and doesn't want to go back. So (unless it's a hippie or suicidal) it finds another human to incarnate in.

  Can a dead spirit be used to create objects made of 'spirit-stuff' - like a sword that ignores (physical) armour and slices through the spirit of the person inside the armour?
#+end_quote

Spirits don't "die" so much as get reabsorbed into the formless spirit world. I still haven't quite figured out how the spirit world is going to work---I'm toying with the idea of having it change based on the ideas of the people who are there. So probably you can make a sword (and a bunch of other stuff) out of spirit---but maintaining it in the physical world will be tricky (or impossible, if it proves story-breaking).
