  Do spirits retain memory? This could be a means of immortality.
#+end_quote

The spirit is not the mind. When someone dies and their spirit gets reincarnated, the new person gets access to the previous incarnation(s) in the same way that we have access to Albert Einstein---we have his notes, and we can make good guesses about his behaviour, but he really is dead. If Alice has a conversation with previous incarnation Bob, she's really talking to herself, using Bob's experiences as a sounding board. If Bob disagrees with her on something, it's because Alice is conflicted and the fragment of her mind simulating Bob is pointing it out, not because Bob has his own volition.

  How can Jane ensure that her child gets the best spirit?
#+end_quote

She can't, 'cause of some fluff I'm gonna make up right now to prevent reincarnation within families/lineages/etc. After someone dies, their spirit goes to the spirit world. If the person was strong-willed in life, they can resist melting into the void (for a while, at least) and find their way back to the physical world to be reincarnated. (This is also why so many past lives are important people---if you have what it takes to make it out of the spirit world, you probably kicked a lot of ass while alive.) Of course, there's no telling where they'll end up when they get there, and they only have so much energy to expend in travelling to find a preferable body.

By the way, I came up with an idea about why the spirit/physical dynamic works the way it does:

- Physical beings can only replenish their energy/heal by taking it from a physical source or from their spirit.
- Spirits can only replenish their energy/heal by taking it from a spirit source or from their physical incarnation.
- Energy can only be transferred between a spirit and its incarnation. No third-party energy transactions. (Alternately, nobody has yet figured out a means of transforming physical energy into spirit energy and vice-versa except the bond between a spirit and its incarnation).

This explains why harming a spirit can harm the physical body (it doesn't directly, but the body deteriorates if it transfers too much energy into the spirit) and sets up some interesting possibilities, e.g.:

1. Find a spirit-energy source with the output of a nuclear power plant (probably in the spirit world).
2. Transfer energy from your spirit to your body continuously.
3. Become Goku.
4. ???
5. Profit.

  Human population keeps going up, in general; but in some countries the population is declining. Does that mean that there's a lot of fighting in the spiritual realm, in those countries, when a new baby is conceived?
#+end_quote

Lots of spirits only incarnate once before getting reabsorbed into the spirit world; the number of spirits that reincarnate more than a few times is actually quite small (<1% of world population). There isn't really competition for bodies.

  If Joe sends his spirit out to go and spy on a neighbour, then can someone else put their spirit in Joe's body? What happens then?
#+end_quote

Too storybreaking, so no.

  So someone with strong mental discipline can create a paradise for himself? Why would he ever leave?
#+end_quote

That paradise might get lonely. Also, maintaining it would be very hard work---imagine maintaining a mansion in the middle of a desert with no help. Of course, with enough people this becomes feasible. So spirit cities and even entire realms are possible.

  ...it sounds like, while such objects can be made, they won't last long in any case. Hmmm... but they can be made quickly. So a spiritual weapon or shield can be conjured up, used once, and then dissipate instantly. This seems likely to lend itself to a certain amount of spirit-realm slapstick.

Within limits, namely energy limits. Damn, now I have to figure out how energy works in the spirit world...
