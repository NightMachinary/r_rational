  In the physical world it acts mostly like an invisible extra limb that's also a hard drive for memories (but no CPU).

Ooooh, now /that/ has interesting consequences. Plenty of interesting consequences.

Can a detective interview a three-year-old who he suspects is holding the spirit of a murder victim? (Or the spirit of a /murderer/, if he suspects that the wrong person has been accused of the crime?)

Are the memories complete, or are they merely partial? If partial, how are they chosen? One hour every day? When the person is feeling particularly intense emotion?

Do people store /all/ their memories in their spirit? So that, if the spirit's not at least partially in the body, the body is amnesiac?

#+begin_quote
  The spirit is left with an imprint of the mind (neural networks, whatever) which degrades as the spirit uses up its energy (another reason not to wait around in the physical world before reincarnating).
#+end_quote

So a ghost is a spirit that has found some sort of energy source?

#+begin_quote
  Dying severs the connection between the body and its spirit, which is what knocks the spirit into the spirit world. If you could restrain the spirit, maybe, but it would be tough, and the spirit might not survive long enough to force it into a new body.

Hmmm. Villain alternative - have the baby conceived near one of the spirit-world portals, and detonate a few bombs in crowded areas around the world ten minutes earlier.

(This setting is going to have potential for some /nasty/ villains).

  There's also no guarantee that the newborn would grow up into a person useful to the killer; it's possible (though usually a bad idea) to completely ignore advice from your past lives.
#+end_quote

The killer has control over the newborn practically from birth. Given his lack of conscience and his presumed resources, I doubt he'll have much trouble indoctrinating the newborn. (Of course, the young boy or girl will have a chance to eventually break free of the villain's control and find redemption...)

  If you were strong enough, you could build a shelter for yourself and a few (also quite strong) followers, and it would snowball from there. If you have some kind of energy source other than people, it gets easier. There's strength in numbers and organisation---one man can build a house, but a ten thousand could build Rome.
#+end_quote

Hmmm... seems sensible, but I think you'd still need that other energy source.

#+begin_quote
  [in the spirit world] the physics change based on what people believe...
#+end_quote

Wow. This... this has so much potential. Also, if you're willing to work really hard at it, this basically gives you a way to create infinite spirit power; you just need enough strong-willed people who can be persuaded to believe in a perpetual energy machine to die...
