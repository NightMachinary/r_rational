  It doesn't depend on whether you /think/ you'll die---it depends on whether you actually die.

Okay. So, how do yo define 'die'? Let's say your heart stops and you're medically considered dead for about twenty seconds before the paramedics start it again. Does that count?

What's the /exact/ cutoff here?

  You could explain this by saying that the mom's spirit is in the way. Plus, reincarnating spirits like to latch onto forms they're familiar with. And who wants to accidentally reincarnate in a foetus that turns out to have terrible/fatal birth defects?

Okay, so as soon as the baby is out of the way of the Mom's spirit - basically, as soon as the baby is removed from the mother? I think that means that, if the doctor handling the delivery is in on the plan, it can probably be set to very close to a specific time (assuming the doctor gets to guess his best idea for the exact time of birth and then deliberately help that time to happen) - though I'm not a medical person, you might want an actual doctor's opinion on this.

But it seems reasonable to me that, five minutes before the birth, the doctor can call out to an assistant who sends a five-minute text message, and causes all thirty victims to be killed exactly five minutes after the message.

...hmmmm. I just went and looked it up - worldwide, there are an estimated 4.3 people born per second. Which is 258 per minute. So, this villain has a less-than-ten-percent chance that his golden child will be born with a strong spirit.

Villain backup plan, then. Get a job in a maternity ward, or perhaps as a midwife. Wait for a strong-spirited baby to be born (have some way to detect this, at least at close range). Abscond with the baby.
