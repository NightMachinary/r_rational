  So, let's say Jack hits his head (let's assume that at the time of the injury he thought he would die), and gets a perfect case of Hollywood Amnesia - all the memories in his brain are scrambled but nothing else is affected. Can he use the backup memories in his spirit to remember things? Are these as good and plentiful as memories-in-the-head? Do they get overwritten by his memoryless brain?

  If you think you'll die, do you get a copy of your brain at this time written to your spirit? Are you then able to tap into this copy as if it were a past life, and re-remember things that you forgot since it was made?

Okay, thanks for making me consider this fluff more seriously.

It doesn't depend on whether you /think/ you'll die---it depends on whether you actually die. When your body dies, your brain stops being you, and your spirit starts. Then it starts degrading and you die for real either when your spirit degrades completely or reincarnates. So you can't overcome amnesia by using your spirit as backup memory. (This also means that severe brain injury/amnesia is still a real and threatening consequence for characters.)

  Oh, so the spirit transfer happens at birth, not conception?

You could explain this by saying that the mom's spirit is in the way. Plus, reincarnating spirits like to latch onto forms they're familiar with. And who wants to accidentally reincarnate in a foetus that turns out to have terrible/fatal birth defects?

  One could get around the random-spirit problem by having a few dozen strong-spirited people killed at the appropriate moment; having more strong-spirited people killed than there are expected to be babies born at that time, perhaps. (Of course, anyone else born at the same time, give or take a few minutes, is also likely to get a strong spirit - this could make an origin for a protagonist, perhaps).

Let's play this scenario out. The villain has captured thirty people they know to have reincarnated at least three times (no small feat!), and has a pregnant woman on hand about to give birth. The woman goes into labour and the captives are executed. Each spirit arrives alone in a random location in the spirit world. Seven decide to stay in the spirit world, alone or joining the local village/warlord/republic. One melts into the void. One ends up getting killed after robbing from a gang. Twenty-one make it back to the physical world. Five reincarnate on the same continent as the villain. The closest one reincarnates about 400 km away as a tinker's daughter. For twenty-five years, the villain searches, but in vain. Broken and destitute, he is finally murdered by one of his victims, who reincarnated an ocean away as a vengeful but not particularly smart noble. The tinker's daughter considers taking revenge, but instead decides to use her past lives' experience as a merchant, alchemist, and blacksmith to invent an improved steel-making process and found an industrial empire. She dies old and obscenely wealthy.
