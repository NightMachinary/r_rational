  What's the /exact/ cutoff here?

I'd say severing the connection between body and spirit. But when does that happen? This is an important problem. If you can sever the connection by e.g. drowning in cold water, and then get revived, what happens? So I'll say: the connection breaks when the body can no longer be revived. This is function of whether those present believe it to be possible (so drowning victims have a better chance than beheading victims).

  Villain backup plan, then. Get a job in a maternity ward, or perhaps as a midwife. Wait for a strong-spirited baby to be born (have some way to detect this, at least at close range). Abscond with the baby.

Plans of this nature are much more reliable. If someone who's reincarnated plenty of times dies, their spirit might show up anywhere between hours and weeks later---or not at all.

Also, having a spirit with many past lives, while useful, is not essential for success. Lots of real people get by without one.
