  What is the spirit, then?
#+end_quote

In the physical world it acts mostly like an invisible extra limb that's also a hard drive for memories (but no CPU). Since the mind originates with the physical body, it's not possible for the spirit to exercise volition unless the body is dead. The spirit is left with an imprint of the mind (neural networks, whatever) which degrades as the spirit uses up its energy (another reason not to wait around in the physical world before reincarnating).

In the spirit world the spirit is effectively a second body---the primary body, in fact, because the physical body can't affect spirit (except by using up spirit energy).

  Okay, so reincarnations are /random/. Can a sufficiently knowledgeable person make it more likely that a random spirit will be picked up by a certain conception, then?
#+end_quote

Human spirits tend to reincarnate where there are humans (i.e. they don't get dumped in the middle of the ocean), but other than that, it is indeed random (mostly because organising the spirit world so that specific exits lead to specific places in the physical world would require a /ridiculous/ amount of energy, both spirit and physical). So until that happens, it's impossible.

  Perhaps via some sort of ritual, or simply dragging in a strong-willed prisoner and killing them while the new baby is, um, being conceived... okay, this is /very much/ sounding like a villain-only trick here...
#+end_quote

Dying severs the connection between the body and its spirit, which is what knocks the spirit into the spirit world. If you could restrain the spirit, maybe, but it would be tough, and the spirit might not survive long enough to force it into a new body. There's also no guarantee that the newborn would grow up into a person useful to the killer; it's possible (though usually a bad idea) to completely ignore advice from your past lives.

  I'm not sure is is - not if Joe's spirit gets to fight off the invader on his return (and Joe's spirit has a sufficiently large home terrain advantage as to make victory almost assured) Then, instead of a permanent body takeover, you've got a temporary loss of control - which can be protected against by leaving Joe's body guarded while he's out (perhaps by a trusted friend, well-versed in spirit combat), so it's only risky if Joe decides to go jaunting on his own, or without taking proper precautions first.
#+end_quote

True. Maybe I'll leave it in then.

#+begin_quote
  Hmmmmm. But only excessively strong-willed spirits can retain their individuality without a body, and even then not for too long. So I don't see there being enough population for an entire realm - not for long, at least.
#+end_quote

If you were strong enough, you could build a shelter for yourself and a few (also quite strong) followers, and it would snowball from there. If you have some kind of energy source other than people, it gets easier. There's strength in numbers and organisation---one man can build a house, but a ten thousand could build Rome.

#+begin_quote
  But where does the spirit energy come from? (In the physical realm, the energy we use comes, almost entirely, from the Sun. Is there a spiritual Sun? Or is the physical realm the only source of energy for the spiritual realm?)
#+end_quote

I think there should definitely be energy sources in the spirit world. If the physics change based on what people believe... maybe, at first, the source of energy is sheer willpower. As cities and then empires are built and the population increases, the spirit world begins changing to resemble the physical world, with rivers, plants, maybe even animals (some unique to the spirit world)... but the physics are Aristotelian, working based on intuitive assumptions. Then, as scientists' spirits start trickling in and new ideas propagate, the physics change again, and it becomes possible to build spirit steam engines, and then turbines, and even spirit reactors. Of course, if the physics varies throughout history, it can vary from area to area, so a device (or nuclear reactor/eternally rotating axle/floating crystal) that works in one place might prove unreliable or even unusable somewhere else. Exploiting the reality-bending nature of belief would probably become an important art/science.
