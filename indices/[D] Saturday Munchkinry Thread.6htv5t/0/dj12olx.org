[[http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/spells/bestowCurse.html][This Pathfinder spell]]. My character in that campaign has acquired the ability to cast it, but the means of doing so makes it useless offensively. However, I can place curses on /myself/ without issues, which is where I need ideas for technically-harmful-but-circumstantially-beneficial curses, like "You cannot lie" -> "Your magically enforced honesty is a boon to negotiation."
