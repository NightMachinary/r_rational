See this doesn't make a lot of sense to me, because as a pessimist, it is my belief that *EVERYTHING* is technically harmful. And just plain harmful in general as well.

I could curse myself with riches or beauty or love. It's technically harmful because now others will envy me and may try to rob me of them.

I could curse myself with immortality. It's technically harmful because now I'm stuck in this horrible world.

I could curse myself with happiness or any other kind of positive emotion. It's technically harmful because the state of happiness impairs my ability to make judgments.

I could curse myself with the ability to always make accurate judgments or any other kind of intelligence boost. This is technically harmful because now I would always be exposed to horrible underlying truths.

I could curse myself with super speed. It's technically harmful because now I have to live through this horrible world at super speed.

I could curse myself with omnipotence or any other kind of power boost. This is technically harmful because a large majority of humanity believes that with great power comes great responsibility, and so will demand I slave away to save them from bad guys and what not.

I could curse myself with utterly nothing. This is technically harmful because one day someone might learn about what I've chosen to curse myself with and laugh at me because they think I'm an idiot who wasted his chance for a beneficial curse.
