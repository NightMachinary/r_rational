Define "everything made". Can I look at a crime scene, which is made by a criminal, and understand exactly the intentions behind it? And so become the greatest detective ever?

Can I look at the stock market, an artificial construct of humanity, and understand the intentions of all shareholders? And thus use it to become obscenely rich?

Can I look at a child, and understand the intentions of the biological parents when they made it? And so be able to find out all kinds of things like adoption and adultery?

Can I look at an election result, and understand the intentions of every single voter (including who they voted for)? And so be able to selectively target and suppress people who vote for people I don't like?

Can I exploit this by compressing lots of information into a single bit, and just read this bit to understand everyone's intentions? For example, I could build Internet bots that just go around collecting statistics from every website, including forum/twitter/reddit posts, youtube/facebook comments, etc., and every few minutes it would convert all of the data collected into a binary number and output the first bit on my screen. Whether this bit is a 0 or a 1 clearly depends on all of the data collected, so in a sense, this bit was made by EVERYONE whose data was collected. Thus by looking at this bit, could I understand the intentions of EVERYONE my bots gathered data on? And so perform mind reading on a global scale?
