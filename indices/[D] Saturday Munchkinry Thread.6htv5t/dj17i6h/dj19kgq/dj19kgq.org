You're an Engineer who can debug existing with no ramp-up or documentation. You'd make a ton of money in various vanilla consulting jobs.

You could have an even bigger impact by detecting intentional deception.

Pull out your laptop, look at the chip, and discover if the manufacturer [[https://www.wired.com/2016/06/demonically-clever-backdoor-hides-inside-computer-chip/][intended there to be a backdoor]].

Your ability to certify systems as non-compromised would be an absurd intelligence coup.

Taking that in a more abstract system: treaties, contracts and financial reports are things made or organized by humans.

You know if a company's annual report is designed to conceal financial difficulties, or if it's designed to draw attention to a legitimate success. So you can win at the stock market.

Even bigger, you can look at corporate contracts and treaties and know if the writer designed them to take advantage of some loophole, or to promote a mutually-beneficial partnership.
