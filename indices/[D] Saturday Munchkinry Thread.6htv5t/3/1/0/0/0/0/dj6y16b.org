[[/hmmm][]] Hmmmm. Alright, so it can pretty much hold an infinite amount of energy. Now, we're getting into truly ludicrous amounts of heat here, but energy /does/ have mass; what would happen if I poured enough heat (with a super duper laser) into the pebble that the mass of the energy in question is greater than or equal to the mass of a black hole with an event horizon larger than the pebble?

(Yes, I probably have to annihilate multiple solar systems worth of matter to get the required energy. I did say 'ludicrous', though...)
