  Can a detective interview a three-year-old who he suspects is holding the spirit of a murder victim? (Or the spirit of a murderer, if he suspects that the wrong person has been accused of the crime?)
#+end_quote

It would be difficult of course, but sure.

#+begin_quote
  Are the memories complete, or are they merely partial? If partial, how are they chosen? One hour every day? When the person is feeling particularly intense emotion?

  Do people store all their memories in their spirit? So that, if the spirit's not at least partially in the body, the body is amnesiac?
#+end_quote

The memories are copied over from the brain, so whatever the brain remembers (and how well), that's what the spirit will remember. It's not known when the copying takes place (over time? at the moment of death?).

#+begin_quote
  So a ghost is a spirit that has found some sort of energy source?
#+end_quote

If you could bring a spirit energy source into the physical world for the unbound spirit to feed on, sure. You'd have to make constant runs back and forth to bring more, though. It would be hard to justify the effort.

#+begin_quote
  Hmmm. Villain alternative - have the baby conceived near one of the spirit-world portals, and detonate a few bombs in crowded areas around the world ten minutes earlier.

  (This setting is going to have potential for some /nasty/ villains).
#+end_quote

You'd just get a random spirit. It might even be a completely new one. Also, there aren't really fixed portals (there could be, but you'd have to build them in both worlds). The only certainty with reincarnation is that a spirit will show up in the physical world within a few dozen meters of a spiritless newborn.

#+begin_quote
  The killer has control over the newborn practically from birth. Given his lack of conscience and his presumed resources, I doubt he'll have much trouble indoctrinating the newborn. (Of course, the young boy or girl will have a chance to eventually break free of the villain's control and find redemption...)
#+end_quote

True. The point is, though, that the spirit guarantees nothing. You could indoctrinate someone to believe that they're a direct continuation of the previous incarnation, but really, every new incarnation is a new person with their own agenda (even if they believe otherwise). (This could make for an interesting villain; every time they reincarnate, they see a trail of past lives all believing that they are the same person, and so they believe it too; the hero would try to convince them that they can be someone else. C.f. General George Patton's belief that he had been reincarnated repeatedly as a soldier.)

#+begin_quote
  Hmmm... seems sensible, but I think you'd still need that other energy source.
#+end_quote

It's likely that spirit food and animals will be a thing (if only because people /believe/ they should).

#+begin_quote
  Wow. This... this has so much potential. Also, if you're willing to work really hard at it, this basically gives you a way to create infinite spirit power; you just need enough strong-willed people who can be persuaded to believe in a perpetual energy machine to die...
#+end_quote

Yep. Of course, an invading army from a rival spirit empire might kill/banish all your perpetual energy plant's employees and cause the machines to stop working. Or you could simply get spies to convince the employees that the machine is a sham. Thoughtcrime has very real consequences in the spirit world. Cosmopolitan areas might not exist or might be restricted to primitive technology due to the cocktail of ideas; alternately, they might be places where /anything/ is possible. (I wonder what kind of reality you'd get if you locked the spirits of Aristotle and Einstein in a room together...)
