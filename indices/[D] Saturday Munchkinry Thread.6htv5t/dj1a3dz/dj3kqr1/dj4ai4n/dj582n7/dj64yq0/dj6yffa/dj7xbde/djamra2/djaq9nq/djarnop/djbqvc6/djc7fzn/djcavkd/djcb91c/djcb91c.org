So, let's say someone gets drowned in cold water. Everyone present thinks he has no chance, and his spirit severs itself. Ten seconds later, a passing paramedic turns up and resuscitates the guy.

Does he get a new spirit? His old spirit back, but with his old memories written into it? No spirit at all?

  Also, having a spirit with many past lives, while useful, is not essential for success. Lots of real people get by without one.

Well, sure. If you want to excel as a banker, a merchant, a military test pilot, a baker...

But if you want to excel as a spirit warrior, the old spirit's going to give you a pretty big advantage, I'm thinking.
