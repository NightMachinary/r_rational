  It would be difficult of course, but sure.
#+end_quote

Not to mention traumatising for the three-year-old.

#+begin_quote
  The memories are copied over from the brain, so whatever the brain remembers (and how well), that's what the spirit will remember. It's not known when the copying takes place (over time? at the moment of death?).
#+end_quote

Hmmm.

So, let's say Jack hits his head (let's assume that at the time of the injury he thought he would die), and gets a perfect case of Hollywood Amnesia - all the memories in his brain are scrambled but nothing else is affected. Can he use the backup memories in his spirit to remember things? Are these as good and plentiful as memories-in-the-head? Do they get overwritten by his memoryless brain?

If you think you'll die, do you get a copy of your brain at this time written to your spirit? Are you then able to tap into this copy as if it were a past life, and re-remember things that you forgot since it was made?

#+begin_quote
  You'd have to make constant runs back and forth to bring more, though. It would be hard to justify the effort.
#+end_quote

Which means that the only spirits who become ghosts are the ones who have /really good/ reason for it. Martyrs, for a start...

#+begin_quote
  You'd just get a random spirit. It might even be a completely new one.
#+end_quote

Oh, so the spirit transfer happens at /birth/, not /conception/?

One could get around the random-spirit problem by having a few dozen strong-spirited people killed at the appropriate moment; having more strong-spirited people killed than there are expected to be babies born at that time, perhaps. (Of course, anyone else born at the same time, give or take a few minutes, is also likely to get a strong spirit - this could make an origin for a protagonist, perhaps).

#+begin_quote
  The point is, though, that the spirit guarantees nothing.
#+end_quote

It guarantees that the newborn has a strong spirit. It could even be a spirit of someone previously opposed to the villain... the villain just has to raise the child, and teach him or her all about spirit-combat and showing no mercy to the villain's enemies and so forth.

The child doesn't need to be indoctrinated to believe he's the same person. He just needs to be indoctrinated to be the person the villain needs him to be.

#+begin_quote
  (I wonder what kind of reality you'd get if you locked the spirits of Aristotle and Einstein in a room together...)
#+end_quote

Einstein can provide a thorough mathematical framework for his ideas. Aristotle has been seeing his ideas work flawlessly for far longer.

I imagine that, between the two of them, they'd figure out the nature of the spirit world and how to use that nature to their advantage. (And then Einstein would persuade Aristotle to never mention any of it to anyone else, because he still feels guilty over Hiroshima. Maybe.)
