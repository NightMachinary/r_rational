  The spirit is not the mind.
#+end_quote

What is the spirit, then? Instinct? Muscle memory? Is there any actual /difference/ between having (say) Ghengis Khan's spirit as opposed to a random new one?

#+begin_quote
  Of course, there's no telling where they'll end up when they get there, and they only have so much energy to expend in travelling to find a preferable body.
#+end_quote

Okay, so reincarnations are /random/. Can a sufficiently knowledgeable person make it more likely that a random spirit will be picked up by a certain conception, then?

Perhaps via some sort of ritual, or simply dragging in a strong-willed prisoner and killing them while the new baby is, um, being conceived... okay, this is /very much/ sounding like a villain-only trick here...

#+begin_quote
  Lots of spirits only incarnate once before getting reabsorbed into the spirit world; the number of spirits that reincarnate more than a few times is actually quite small (<1% of world population). There isn't really competition for bodies.
#+end_quote

...okay, fair enough.

#+begin_quote
  Too storybreaking, so no.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure is is - not if Joe's spirit gets to fight off the invader on his return (and Joe's spirit has a sufficiently large home terrain advantage as to make victory almost assured) Then, instead of a permanent body takeover, you've got a temporary loss of control - which can be protected against by leaving Joe's body guarded while he's out (perhaps by a trusted friend, well-versed in spirit combat), so it's only risky if Joe decides to go jaunting on his own, or without taking proper precautions first.

But, eh, it's your story, If you think it's too storybreaking, then it's not going to happen.

  That paradise might get lonely. Also, maintaining it would be very hard work---imagine maintaining a mansion in the middle of a desert with no help. Of course, with enough people this becomes feasible. So spirit cities and even entire realms are possible.
#+end_quote

Hmmmmm. But only excessively strong-willed spirits can retain their individuality without a body, and even then not for too long. So I don't see there being enough population for an entire realm - not for long, at least.

#+begin_quote
  Within limits, namely energy limits. Damn, now I have to figure out how energy works in the spirit world...
#+end_quote

That seems fair. But where does the spirit energy come from? (In the physical realm, the energy we use comes, almost entirely, from the Sun. Is there a spiritual Sun? Or is the physical realm the only source of energy for the spiritual realm?)
