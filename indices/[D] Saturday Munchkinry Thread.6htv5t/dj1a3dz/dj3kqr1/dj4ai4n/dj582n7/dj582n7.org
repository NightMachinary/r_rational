  So (unless it's a hippie or suicidal) it finds another human to incarnate in.

Do spirits retain memory? This could be a means of immortality.

Let's say that Jane is planning on giving birth. But she knows about the above. How can Jane ensure that her child gets the /best/ spirit? (Assuming she's reasonably wealthy and willing to spend money on this). Can she set up an interview panel, treat the whole thing as a kind of job application, asking for resumes and so on from prospective spirits? And then have bodyguards around at the critical moment to keep all spirits except the one who was successfully hired away? (Or perhaps she would rather deliberately reincarnate a favourite uncle who recently died?)

Human population keeps going up, in general; but in some countries the population is declining. Does that mean that there's a lot of fighting in the spiritual realm, in those countries, when a new baby is conceived?

If Joe sends his spirit out to go and spy on a neighbour, then can someone else put their spirit in Joe's body? What happens then?

  I still haven't quite figured out how the spirit world is going to work---I'm toying with the idea of having it change based on the ideas of the people who are there.

So someone with strong mental discipline can create a paradise for himself? Why would he ever leave?

  So probably you can make a sword (and a bunch of other stuff) out of spirit---but maintaining it in the physical world will be tricky (or impossible, if it proves story-breaking).

...it sounds like, while such objects can be made, they won't last long in any case. Hmmm... but they can be made /quickly/. So a spiritual weapon or shield can be conjured up, used once, and then dissipate instantly. This seems likely to lend itself to a certain amount of spirit-realm slapstick.
