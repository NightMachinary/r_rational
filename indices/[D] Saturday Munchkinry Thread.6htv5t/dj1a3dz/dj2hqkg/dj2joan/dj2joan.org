  How fast can a spirit move?
#+end_quote

Arbitrarily fast, given enough energy. Spirits have to move through the physical world by interacting with it (i.e. walking, running, etc.), and therefore have to have at least a tiny amount of mass (a grain of sand is usual---though this may be a conceptual limitation) to be accelerated. However, low mass means it can be easily stopped by other spirits, so in a spirit fight, there's a tradeoff between speed (low mass) and power/energy consumption (high mass).

  Can it 'snap back' to the body or does it have to travel the distance?
#+end_quote

They have to travel the distance.
