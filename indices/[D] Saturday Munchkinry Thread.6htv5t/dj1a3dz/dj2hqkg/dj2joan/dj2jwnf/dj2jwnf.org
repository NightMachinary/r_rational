So a spirit can decide it's momentum essentially? High speed, easily stopped or pour in more energy to barrel through.

What's the deal when a spirit attacks another spirit? Does the attacking spirit decide how much energy goes into the attack and how much is taken, or can the defending spirit decide to not hold it's position to avoid the energy waste?
