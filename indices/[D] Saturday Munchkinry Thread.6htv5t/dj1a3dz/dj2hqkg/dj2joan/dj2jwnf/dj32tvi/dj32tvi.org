One spirit attacking another spirit probably wouldn't be able to do much unless there are special techniques for attacking spirits directly or at least displacing them (think about that scene in Doctor Strange when the Ancient One knocks him out of his body), though these might become OP depending on how widespread/effective they are.

Probably though spirit vs. spirit fights will be rare, since whoever's spirit is closer to their body will have a big advantage in energy terms. If your opponent's spirit can attack your empty body and keeping your spirit close gives you an advantage, why not just keep your spirit in your body and fight like that (which of course leads to amusing wuxia Jedi hijinks)?
