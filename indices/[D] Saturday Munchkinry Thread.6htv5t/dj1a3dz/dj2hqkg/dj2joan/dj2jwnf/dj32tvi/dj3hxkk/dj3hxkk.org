Interesting thought. Have you considered accidental usage?

I assume everyone has spirit and that only some people, through training or luck are capable of using it.

You could have non users with greater resistance to spirit enhanced attacks. Or a basic resistance in everyone to prevent fuckery.

You could incorperate little things into the lore, for example; when people get the feeling that something bad has happened to someone they care about, or parents somehow knowing where to find their lost children, maybe they've subconsciously been keeping their spirit near that person.

Or an obsessive stalker that feels like they need to be near the object of their obsession because the distance has an affect until they waste away or learn to let go.

You could have a loophole in the distance restriction if two people have their spirit with the other person, substituting their own. Kind of like a stable link between two people. There would be a tangible sense of loss when the other died.

There's a lot you could play around with.
