The release of energy doesn't have to be provided by the spirit directly as propulsion. Use it to provide potential energy that gets released all at once later.

Give them absurdly powerful bows that a normal person couldn't operate. Something that for normal humans to get the same amount of power, would need to be stabilized in the ground and cranked up with gears. Basically seige weapons. Portable seige weapons

The biggest advantage of spirit is the ability to release large amounts of power at once, the downside is range. Powerful ranged weapons seems perfect for them.
