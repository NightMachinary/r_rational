While the spirit railgun idea is entertaining, I don't think it would work for the same reason a human railgun wouldn't. The first few people are okay, but the people later in the line would have to push a rock that's already moving at high speeds. That's like trying to catch a cannon ball in mid-flight. Even in spirit form, I don't think humans would have the dexterity to do this.
