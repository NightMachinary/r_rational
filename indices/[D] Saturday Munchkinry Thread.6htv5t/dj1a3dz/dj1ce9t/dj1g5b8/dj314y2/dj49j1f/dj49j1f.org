  A third option might be to add consequences for misuse of spirits. Maybe they can be trapped. And this causes some kind of terrible damage to the person who's now lost their magic. For instance, you can only fall asleep when your spirit is inside your body.

I like that. Probably the fluff would be that the punishment is done using spirit, not physical means.

Would it help if people who have the training/raw talent to actually use their spirit outside their body (or even know that such an ability exists) are about as rare as non-EU Jedi?
