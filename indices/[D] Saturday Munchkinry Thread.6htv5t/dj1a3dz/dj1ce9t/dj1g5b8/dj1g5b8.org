  You could use this to build a hover-board. Since the board is keeping you steady at a constant height, it's not actually consuming energy.

How would this work? If you're holding up a weight using your spirit, you're still fighting gravity's acceleration and therefore consuming energy.

  If the spirits push on a capsule instead of a skateboard you could get a space elevator.

I think I'm going to rule out flight; it's too OP. To prevent people from using their spirit to carry them through the air, I'll say that spirits, when interacting with the physical world, have to deal with inertia (i.e. your spirit can't push something unless it's braced on the ground/an object with sufficient mass).

  The precision and physical shape of the spirits would matter. Could they maintain an air-impermeable barrier? If so, I can do some pretty amazing free dives. Can they act precisely? If so, I can cut the concrete with an arbitrarily sharp knife.
#+end_quote

Arbitrarily shaped spirits seem OP; there are too many story-breaking applications (e.g. lock-picking, non-spirit combat, survival in dangerous environments, flight via spirit glider). I can't think of a logical reason why it shouldn't be possible though.

  This world might end up with very interesting notions of privacy and safety. If I'm a VIP, it seems like I'd have to expect that people could overhear everything I'm saying all the time. That would be shocking to us. But it might be normal in spirit world? Safety would be really hard, especially if spirits are invisible. Imagine a soccer match where 20 fans give their spirits an order like, "Go punch that goalie!" The goalie might be able to defend himself against 1 person, but a crowd of hostile people would be extremely dangerous.

This might be a matter of how common spirit usage is, and also being trained to perceive and defend against other spirits.
