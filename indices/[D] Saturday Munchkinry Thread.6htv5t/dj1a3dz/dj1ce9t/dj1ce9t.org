You could use this to build a hover-board. Since the board is keeping you steady at a constant height, it's not actually consuming energy.

If the spirits push on a capsule instead of a skateboard you could get a space elevator.

The precision and physical shape of the spirits would matter. Could they maintain an air-impermeable barrier? If so, I can do some pretty amazing free dives. Can they act precisely? If so, I can cut the concrete with an arbitrarily sharp knife.

This world might end up with very interesting notions of privacy and safety. If I'm a VIP, it seems like I'd have to expect that people could overhear everything I'm saying all the time. That would be shocking to us. But it might be normal in spirit world?

Safety would be really hard, especially if spirits are invisible. Imagine a soccer match where 20 fans give their spirits an order like, "Go punch that goalie!" The goalie might be able to defend himself against 1 person, but a crowd of hostile people would be extremely dangerous.
