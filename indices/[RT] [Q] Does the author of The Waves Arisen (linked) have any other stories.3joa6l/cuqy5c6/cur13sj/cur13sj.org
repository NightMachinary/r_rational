You know, I'm rereading the last chapter and it [[http://i.imgur.com/wwc6fbg.png][really]] reminds me of his style. Might just be influenced by him, though, or confirmation bias.

Then again, I doubt he'd write [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2upavf/ffrst_the_waves_arisen_ch10/cob8kyb][this]] if he was secretly the author.

I also tried to find the guy back then and completely failed, I agree it's probably a throwaway identity, but why someone would bother writing an amazing story with one I don't know.
