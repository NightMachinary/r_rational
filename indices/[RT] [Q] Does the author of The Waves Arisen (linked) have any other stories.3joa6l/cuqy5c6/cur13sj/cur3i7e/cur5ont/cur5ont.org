Want to do a comparative [[https://psal.cs.drexel.edu/index.php/JStylo-Anonymouth#You-can-download-it-here][stylometric analysis]]? (But if it /was/ Yudkowsky, he'd probably be expecting that, and have used the other tool on the page to anonymize the writing. I wonder if the suggestions the Anonymouth tool makes are predictable enough to prove its usage---whether words are effectively re-attributed to the robot's particular style. That'd be evidence of /something/, at least.)

One could also likely generate a stylistic signature for every corpus on FF.net to compare to, if one had the inclination.
