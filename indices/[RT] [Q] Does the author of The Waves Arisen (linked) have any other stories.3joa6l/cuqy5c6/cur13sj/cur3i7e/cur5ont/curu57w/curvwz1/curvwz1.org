If you're ordinarily the type to make claim to what some would consider embarrassingly low-status writing (e.g. HP fanfic), but in some /particular/ case you decide to write under a pseudonym, that would suggest that you /really/ want to remain unlinked to that particular work.

Further, if you are aware that your fanbase is the type to be insatiably curious to the point where they would attempt to dox people, and you are also intelligent enough to realize that just using a pseudonym isn't enough to avoid that doxing attempt... then what else /could/ you do but to change your style?

Note that the above-mentioned program automatically makes these stylistic changes for you; it's not hard work.
