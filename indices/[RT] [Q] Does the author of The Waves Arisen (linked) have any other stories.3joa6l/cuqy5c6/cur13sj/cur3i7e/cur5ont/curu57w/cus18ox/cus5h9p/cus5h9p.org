In /Ender's Shadow/, Bean decides Locke and Demosthenes were two different people because they had different writing styles, which he didn't think anyone was smart enough to fake. Might've been a joke on Card's account, as his telling the same story from Bean's perspective as he did Ender's is kind of like what Peter and Valentine do with their alter-egos.
