So because of this thread I read the entire story. I remember seeing it back when it posted but I knew nothing of Naruto so I didn't give it a chance. Thank you "Wertifloke", it was absolutely fantastic and gave me many laughs and feelings.

I am confused because from my perspective this was pretty clearly Eliezer's writing but I don't see much consensus on this. Can anyone attempt to answer these questions I have?

1. I would expect most readers of both The Waves Arisen and HPMOR to think it was by the same author. Is this the case? or am I in the small minority?

2. If it was written by Eliezer what are some reasons that he would write under another name?

3. Am I blowing his cover if it is him? Is there a reason it should remain a secret?
