I had a similar thought a few months back.

The author created the username Wertifloke specifically to post and promote The Waves Arisen on a few webesites, then never posted with that username again. From my research, Wertifloke isn't associated with anything else, or any other user. It was an identity created for The Waves Arisen and discarded immediately afterwards.
