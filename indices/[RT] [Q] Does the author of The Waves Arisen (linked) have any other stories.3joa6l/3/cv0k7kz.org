I'm pretty sure it's Yudkowsky, especially this paragraph

#+begin_quote
  It really hadn't been that much unlike the case of the nine-tails---certainly not as much as he'd felt a minute ago. Sage mode /had/ been playing tricks on his mind. He resolved that in future he would try to have shadow clones in existence as a precaution at all times, and he'd require all important decisions to be made /outside/ the influence of sage mode, even if it seemed pointless to bother at the time---or, no, /especially/ if it seemed like he shouldn't bother. And if he ever caught himself trying to avoid even thinking about it so that he could stay in sage mode, that would initiate the emergency shutdown procedure, and his brain would unleash untold horrors upon itself.

It just reads like his writing. It reads exactly like when Harry makes contingency plans.
