I dropped it when they made it into the leaf village safely and the sensei married jiryaia. It just felt like they werent marked for death anymore and they won the game. I wish they created their own village instead of the cliche of being integrated i to the leaf. I also didn't like it how the MC was trying to get a harem with ino and her girl teammate and was actually rationalizing it. Did it stayed interesing after these events or are the characters playing world police?
