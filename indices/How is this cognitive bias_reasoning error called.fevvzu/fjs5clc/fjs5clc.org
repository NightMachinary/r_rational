Actually, false => anything at all, and this person's reasoning is correct - B still can be true if A is false. Your wording ("it is generally known...") also implies that, while B /usually/ comes from A, there can be other possibilities. If B can /only/ come from A, then the implication is the other way around: B => A (or A <=> B if B only comes from A /and/ is its inevitable consequence).
