Maybe pair each chapter? One chapter that advances a plot, one that's just a slice of life for those characters? Just get in their heads and have a conversation.

Chapter 50 feels like the plot is advancing (or, in this case, being set up), while chapter 51 feels like getting to know the characters (with some incidental developments snuck in there).

Edit: For the characterization chapters, go with characters that haven't had as much screen time, ideally interacting with characters they otherwise haven't interacted with.
