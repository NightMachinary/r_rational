Chapter 51 is [[https://heroessavetheworld.wordpress.com/2017/03/07/sharp-as-sword-blades-ch-12-daniel-hernandez/][here]].

Next week's update will include the first chapter of Sequence 5, which I've finally decided to call "Sunlight." It's going to be longer than the other Sequences but will carry us to the end of 2014.

I've been told that the pacing has been better in this Sequence, but I feel that I'm falling short on the character end of things: We haven't done as much with Austin as I would like, we haven't seen much of the Indian kids, and I'm not sure if all of the members of PALATINATE feel alive yet.
