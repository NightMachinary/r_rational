As far as I've ever guessed, the AI doesn't use blackmail or stuff like that. It goes for emotional attacks, exploitation of cognitive biases, and basically just all the other ways for tricking a person despite themselves. The idea seems to be, a human mind that is prone to mistakes in predictable ways is open to attack on its will in predictable ways.

The transcripts of every actual experiment were kept secret, seemingly just to be mysterious. One guy who blogged about it said that he played as the AI and lost, but kept the transcript secret because his dialogue really had been /outright cruel/ in its blatant attempts to attack and wear down the Gatekeeper's ego.
