And getting a human to do something they previously stated they didn't want to do and saw no way they could be possibly persuaded to do doesn't count as control? I don't read it as Hollywood style "mind control" but a more subtle, "I can get you to *willing* do whatever I want" - advertising style. I think its strong evidence for that.
