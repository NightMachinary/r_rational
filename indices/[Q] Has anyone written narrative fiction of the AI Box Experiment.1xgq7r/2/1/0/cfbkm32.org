The experiment is only meant to show people who believe that they could never be persuaded to release a boxed AI, that they can be persuaded. Not only that, but they can be persuaded by a merely human-level intelligence.

The argument is that any significantly above human level AI would be better at persuading (and everything else) so could overcome the difficulties. It's a proof of concept, rather than a prototype.
