I'd do it, but A) I don't know how anyone ever wins the AI box experiment as the AI and B) no sane person would set up the AI box experiment like that - you're going to need a quorum of individuals, break time to mull things over, etc. I suppose you could sketch out some kind of story even with both those things in mind, but it seems like it would be better to just get someone to hand you over a transcript of the actual AI-in-a-box conversation and read that instead, or to take that transcript and fictionalize it (perhaps with the twist of the story being that the person on the other end of the line was a human all along, and the test was designed to see whether you were fit for AI-in-a-box watching duty).
