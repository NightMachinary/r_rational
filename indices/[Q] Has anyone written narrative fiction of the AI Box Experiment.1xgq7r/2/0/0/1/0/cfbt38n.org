I finished reading through the logs. I don't think that I know all of the arguments used in the experiments, I just think that I know the general classes of arguments to a decent enough level that there wouldn't be any surprises. Though the experiments with released logs surely have a selection bias, I didn't see anything in there that surprised me.

Then again, maybe there's something that would surprise me, an unknown unknown that's been kept secret by the victors. I won't rule that out ... but I currently consider it unlikely.
