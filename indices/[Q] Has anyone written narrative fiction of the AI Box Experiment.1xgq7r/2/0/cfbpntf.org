I think before you're going to write a story about it you should definitely try the experiment at least once. Almost everyone who has seriously tried it has said that it was a really unique experience. As far as I know [[/u/tuxedage]] has witnessed most AI box experiments so you could ask him more about details, he's an active redditor (though he mostly posts on [[/r/dogecoin][r/dogecoin]], idk maybe he's gone crazy after so many experiments) but I think he has promised not to reveal too much about the experiments he has participated in.

Here are all the interesting links about AI box experiments I could find.
