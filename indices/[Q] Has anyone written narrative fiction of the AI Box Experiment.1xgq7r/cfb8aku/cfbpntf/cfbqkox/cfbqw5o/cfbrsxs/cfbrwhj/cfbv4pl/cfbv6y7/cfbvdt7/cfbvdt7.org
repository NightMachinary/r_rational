Recalibrate your sarcasm detector.

I do not regard EY as a Friendly superintelligence. I regard him as a mere human who /managed to notice the problem/, and has been putting together a team of people to seek an actual solution.

Now, given that most people either maintain some kind of faith-based ethics, go into sheer denial about the incompleteness of their moral notions, or shrug off a casual moral nihilism with no concept of /dangerous consequences of such/... Given that ethics is probably /the/ major thing where most people just not-look and not-think about their raw, gaping, nasty ignorance and its consequences.... Given that those few of us who /do/ look at the gaping, horrid void straight-on usually just spend our lives in mild neurosis with no notion of how to proceed from there...

His noticing that the problem exists and beginning to demand a rational solution to it /without/ going completely off-the-rails /nuts/ are actually major credits to his person.

That doesn't mean he's a living solution, of course.
