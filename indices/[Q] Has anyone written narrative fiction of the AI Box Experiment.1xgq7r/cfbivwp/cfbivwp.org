There was a group that was trying to turn it into a movie. They've produced a couple of short films/teasers. It's called [[http://www.k3loid.com/][Keloid.]]

EDIT They have changed the video posted on their site significantly. At around 2:20 in the video, though, you can see the setup for the AI Box.
