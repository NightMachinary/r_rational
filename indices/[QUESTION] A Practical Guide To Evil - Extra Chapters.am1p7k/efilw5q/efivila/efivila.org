The vast majority of them happen before the events of the book, expanding on the backstory for the various characters. For instance, the current extra chapters are showing the Grey Pilgrim's backstory; before that was the White Knight.

Since they're independent of the timeline of the story, you can pretty much read them at any time, but I agree that it's probably best to read them at the point in the main story where they were published, as the events explored in the past often focus on the characters currently prominent in the main story, and offer context to their current actions.
