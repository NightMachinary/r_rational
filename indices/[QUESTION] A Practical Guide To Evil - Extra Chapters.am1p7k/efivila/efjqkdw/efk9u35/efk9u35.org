There are competing philosophies: it's the L.E. Modesitt vs. Steven Brust argument. The latter writes books to be read in any order, while the former insists that publishing order is the only way his books should be read.

A well-written story should be able to be re-read, and improve on the second (and third and fourth) reading, as you pick up on foreshadowing and subtle character developments that you've missed. If that's the case, reading a prequel first shouldn't spoil anything.

That said, I don't see why you'd want to read, say, the Hanno chapters before actually meeting Hanno, or the same for Tariq, because you have no idea who that person is in context to the story yet.
