Have you ever read Travers' book? It's substantially different than the Disney version - the adaptation changed many things, but most of all the tone of the story. For example, the Banks are less well off, and rather than blowing other nannies out of the way, Travers' books have the following occur:

  "But if it were me---I mean I---well, I should get somebody to put in the Morning Paper the news that Jane and Michael and John and Barbara Banks (to say nothing of their Mother) require the best possible Nannie at the lowest possible wage and at once. Then I should wait and watch for the Nannies to queue up outside the front gate, and I should get very cross with them for holding up the traffic and making it necessary for me to give the policeman a shilling for putting him to so much trouble. Now I must be off. Whew, it's as cold as the North Pole. Which way is the wind blowing?"

And, as that hints, that seems like an unattractive advertisement, and Mary Poppins is the only applicant - no need to blow others away. She does still fly in, though.
