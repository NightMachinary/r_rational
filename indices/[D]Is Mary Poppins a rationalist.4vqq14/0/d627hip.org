No. Mary Poppins /arguably/ takes actions which are surprisingly effective.

However, she is not explicitly shown to demonstrate or attempt /epistemic rationality/ ('truth-seeking'), which is a key component of "rationalist" stories or characters - it's a high standard. This should ideally be linked to /instrumental rationality/ (efficient pursuit of goals).

At [[/r/rational]], we additionally require that the setting should be consistent, and characters should have realistic motivations - this makes writing and learning from a good story much easier.
