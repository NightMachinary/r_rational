Veyers Boronova is the bully who got expelled before the story even started, right? I saw a theory somewhere that he's Red Robe simply because he was mentioned in the first few chapters so that means he /has/ to pop up later on. We probably will see him later, but I don't know if he'll be Red Robe or not. Red Robe is /probably/ someone who's name we already know, and I don't think he's Damien like some people do.
