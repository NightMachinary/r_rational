This year was Zorian's first year of actually casting magic. He didn't know his own mana reserves before Kyron's first lesson. If DaimenRobe even noticed his little brother (I think he went straight for Zach and was mostly occupied by him), the obvious conclusion would be that Zorian was something of a prodigy and/or had an affinity for combat magic.
