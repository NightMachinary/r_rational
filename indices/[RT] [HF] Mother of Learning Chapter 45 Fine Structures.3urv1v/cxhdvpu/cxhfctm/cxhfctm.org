I decided to make an easy step-by-step list of how Zorian can completely break the time loop and win easily. This is what I would do, though I have a few advantages over Zorian as I'm exploit minded and less anti-social as well as being grey morally.

1- We've been shown he can get tons of money from crystallized mana from only one dungeon, now map out EVERY profitable dungeon and do that, you are now the richest man in the world basically.

2- Use that money to buy a team of the best researchers and trainers money can buy. He can optimize this team every month by picking new members etc and can throw huge amounts of money at the problem. Take potions, drugs whatever to stop sleeping during the month, so what if it hurts his body, he'll be fine next month.

He can be taught exactly what he wants in the most efficient manner. Focus the best researchers and every soul mage you can find on understanding the time loop and improving his own soul defense and attacks. Also develop his mind magic as much as possible.

3- Buy a core group of mercenaries that will make up his "honor guard" optimize the best people for this job over time. Use this group to get valuable combat experience and leadership experience. Fight dragons and baddies and whoever and get enough illegal spells and equipment that you become a powerhouse.

4- Understand how to stop the loop (it is implied that he just needs to beat the invaders). Once your sure when the time loop will end focus on training and exploiting as much as possible until there are 6 months to a year left before the loop fully degrades.

5- Buy a big mercenary army, conduct guerrilla warfare during the entire month the invaders are there, cripple them until they are desperate. When they attack mop the floor with them by countering their every move, optimize over restarts. You can even bring in the government as long as you don't mention time travel. I'm sure with some money and influence (aka money) they'd be more than happy to bring an army to annihilate the necromancers island and defend the academy.

6- ???

7- End the time loop buy a plot of land, revolutionize mind magic and other fields, have kids and become the most powerful mage that has ever lived at the tender (physical) age of 15. Take that Damien!
