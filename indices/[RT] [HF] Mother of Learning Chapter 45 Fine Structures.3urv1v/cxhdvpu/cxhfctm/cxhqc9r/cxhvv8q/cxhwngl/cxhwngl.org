(The spiders can't do anything to his soul --- only give him a brainwashing that'd last through loops.)

They'd have two reasons for this: ether straight out betrayal (which did happen, and can be defended against by suicide), or when finding out about the loop and wanting in. In latter case it's a matter of trust, and Zorian decided to trust his current spider partners since he was in a zeitnot because of the deteriorating mem-package and had no other solution.

With the soul mages there is no such obvious zeitnot, so hiring them to research looping would be an /unnecessary/ and serious risk.
