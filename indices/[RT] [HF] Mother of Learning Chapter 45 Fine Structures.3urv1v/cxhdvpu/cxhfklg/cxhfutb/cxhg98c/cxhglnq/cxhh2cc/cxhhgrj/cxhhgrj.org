  Since you didn't reply, I imagine you're conceding that most mages may not know golem making, bomb making, and invisibility? And that as such he may have trump cards others lack, a sign of his good training?
#+end_quote

Not all of them can do everything but one guy can do bomb making the other golem making etc, he's just one man after all. Though he is becoming well trained there are still people that will always be better battle mages than him.

#+begin_quote
  He only knows so many tribes, this wouldn't necessarily work.
#+end_quote

There's been around a dozen webs mentioned so far, he could probably do just fine with enough gifts and favors.

#+begin_quote
  He has bombs and golems, he can suicide bomb it. He can figure out any wards.
#+end_quote

He can't figure out any ward, he's said before that some are too powerful, complex or well made. You can't suicide bomb an entire army camp, you're underestimating his enemies. They have numbers and he needs them too.

#+begin_quote
  Or he can buy mercenaries, they can speak to the wrong people (as he still has more intel gathering to do) and then red cloak can ambush him and mind and soul rape him.
#+end_quote

He obviously changes his appearance, doesn't tell anyone what's really going on and blames his actions on another government or entity, like a false flag operation.

The entire idea behind guards is to not be ambushed, if he is they can probably buy him valuable time to get away or at least kill himself. (Why hasn't he made suicide rings that totally destroy his body like when he threw himself into the pit?)

He can also manage their emotions, erase his presence and memories from his mercenaries so nothing leads back to him, etc.
