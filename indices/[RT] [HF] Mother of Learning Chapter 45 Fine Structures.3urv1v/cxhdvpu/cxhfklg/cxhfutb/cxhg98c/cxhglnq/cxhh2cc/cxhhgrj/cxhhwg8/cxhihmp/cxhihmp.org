Well basically it's risk vs reward and with the time loop he doesn't really have risk. If he can make suicide rings that will kill him if he is unconscious or hurt mentally, he will be immune to mind magic control, especially if he can figure out how to avoid sleep for a month even if it hurts his body.

If he can also make his suicide rings able to destroy his body totally (some type of magical acid?) he is basically immune to soul raping as it's been shown that necromancers need a body, which is how he escaped red robe the first time. He can cover himself in so many failsafe suicide devices that he'll always die before mind or soul death. He is now invincible and only really needs to worry about the time loop degrading and red robe finding him.

Now he can take huge risks. Red robe wasn't able to find him the first time, it's logical he couldn't a second time, especially if he does it smart. He only meets his men by proxy, letter, simulacrum if he can make one etc. He could even train his divination with the spider tribes, he's good at it after all.

If his mercenaries turn on him so what, he'll die via suicide and start over, more informed and ready to lead.

If all that isn't enough he can blame it on zack and use him as a distraction. Zack can have his own army that is much more visible which red robe will target first.

Your suicide bombing plan isn't without risk either and it's not that easy. The gate is obviously warded heavily so he can't just teleport golems in, he has to teleport them outside the wards and walk them in. Don't you think explosive golems have been used before in the history of war, it's probably an established tactic with a known defense (blow them up before they come close).
