The feeling i get from the arachne is that they would react badly to him getting mind magic lessons from other webs. Also because its mind magic lessons he gets its hard to conceal that fact. He would have to be better at mind magic than his teachers which nullifies the gains he could have.

On the topic of Red Robe didn't he see his face and since then he left? Or do i remember that wrong?

Thats just my two cents on this.
