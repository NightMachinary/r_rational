  Yup, I'm not saying he does all this immediately, but he needs men and allies and not just a couple, he'll do all his big mercenary moves at the end of the month too and be as subtle as possible. Also remember he'd be doing this (and telling his men) that this is for a government or some other entity, red robe wouldn't immediately think time traveler.

And the best way to ensure this is safe is for him to gather information on which people are potential leaks, as he is doing. Once he captures someone high up and knows who is in which cell then he's much less at risk of someone tattling on him to red robe. He can't control what red robe thinks, but he can control what red robe knows about him. He can maybe even monitor communication between red robe and his allies and set up an ambush.

  Divination isn't an end all tracking art, I don't think it's that easy to be tracked, they have to know what they are looking for in the first place, which is where a distraction comes in.

We don't know what higher tier divination magic can do.

  Every plan has it's risk, but trying to fight an invasion on his own (or with a couple students and zack) isn't going to work. Zorian has correctly noted that, he's just not doing anything about it.

  Destroying the gate in their main base would no doubt utterly cripple the planned invasion, unless a new gate was easy to build, which he doubted.

He explicitly noted an action which he personally could do which could stop the invasion. He knows where the exhaust port of the death star is.

  Also there's a potion that turns people into an eagle but not one that prevents sleep for a while? Infinitely simpler I would think. Sure it probably has big side effects which will conveniently not effect him.

The author has noted there are magical drugs that can keep you awake, but those have side effects.

Souls is easier. Souls have the advantage that they share the same operating system. You can plug an animal soul into yours without needing any trickiness about form changing, and rely on evolution/ intelligent design to do the work for you. It's like the difference from transferring genes between animals and making whole new ones.
