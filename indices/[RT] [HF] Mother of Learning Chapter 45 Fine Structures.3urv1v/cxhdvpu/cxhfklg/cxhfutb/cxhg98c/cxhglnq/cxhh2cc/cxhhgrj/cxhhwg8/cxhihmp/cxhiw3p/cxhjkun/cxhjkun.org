Yup, I'm not saying he does all this immediately, but he needs men and allies and not just a couple, he'll do all his big mercenary moves at the end of the month too and be as subtle as possible.

Learn it then, he has money, he can do a lot more than he currently is. Divination isn't an end all tracking art, I don't think it's that easy to be tracked, they have to know what they are looking for in the first place, which is where a distraction comes in. Also remember he'd be doing this (and telling his men) that this is for a government or some other entity, red robe wouldn't immediately think time traveler. Maybe he can be an offshoot of the cult of the dragon below, they are surely crazy enough.

Every plan has it's risk, but trying to fight an invasion on his own (or with a couple students and zack) isn't going to work. Zorian has correctly noted that, he's just not doing anything about it.

Also there's a potion that turns people into an eagle but not one that prevents sleep for a while? Infinitely simpler I would think. Sure it probably has big side effects which will conveniently not effect him.
