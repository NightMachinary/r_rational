  If he can make suicide rings that will kill him if he is unconscious or hurt mentally, he will be immune to mind magic control, especially if he can figure out how to avoid sleep for a month even if it hurts his body.
#+end_quote

He's noted that doing that is risky, because other things could trigger those states, and he has no way to avoid sleep for a month. Randomly dying also carries some risk- if it happens enough he could draw attention and he hates dying.

  If he can also make his suicide rings able to destroy his body totally (some type of magical acid?) he is basically immune to soul raping
#+end_quote

Having a magical acid that eats your flesh near your body sounds like a bad idea. In the long run teleportation to a safe house would be good.

  Red robe wasn't able to find him the first time, it's logical he couldn't a second time, especially if he does it smart. He only meets his men by proxy, letter, simulacrum if he can make one etc. He could even train his divination with the spider tribes, he's good at it after all.
#+end_quote

Extended interaction carries a heavy risk of being tracked. The first time Red Robe had little to go on. This time he would have more to track. Proxies and letters can be tracked, he can't cast Simulacrum.

Better to carefully investigate each mercenary company, a skill which requires good mind magic.

  If his mercenaries turn on him so what, he'll die via suicide and start over, more informed and ready to lead.
#+end_quote

Or a spell bypasses his defenses or disables his magic items and he gets mind and soul raped.

#+begin_quote
  Your suicide bombing plan isn't without risk either and it's not that easy.
#+end_quote

I presume he intends to do it at the end of the month and if he fails he'll likely just die. Red Robe isn't likely to be around the gate anyway, Red Robe has his own gate.

Defenses always have countermeasures.
