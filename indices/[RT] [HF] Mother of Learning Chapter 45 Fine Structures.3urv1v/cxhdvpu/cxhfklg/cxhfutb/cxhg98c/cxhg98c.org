  The memory pack is a problem which can probably be solved in a couple months by a mixture of single minded training while ignoring everything else, money and time travel trickery.

  The problem is Zorian is doing exactly what Zack is doing, he's trying to get good enough to beat the invasion on his own. he has two allies only because they came to him. He's not thinking big enough. You can't out hard work an entire country, you need men and troops of your own.

He's trying to find the best way to defeat the invasion. He already has one way, destroy the gate. He is intelligently seeking out weak points in their force which he can manipulate- he may be able to single handedly beat the invasion on his own. That's not his focus now though, he's gathering intel.
