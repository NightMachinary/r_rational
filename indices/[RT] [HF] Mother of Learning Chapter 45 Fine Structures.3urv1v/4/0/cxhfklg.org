  If Zorian is going to be doing combat sparring then he needs to do it how he'd do it in the field.
#+end_quote

Combat reflexes are very useful for fights. By focusing single mindedly on those he is giving himself a valuable head up- mind magic is erratically reliable against prepared mages, items are very context dependent, combat reflexes almost always work. He can later learn how to incorporate mind magic and items into that style.

  Finally we are getting into the part of the story where Zorian does everything, he hasn't been exploiting this enough. He has infinite money, why not buy mercenaries and go kill bad guys and dragons and stuff to get combat experience?
#+end_quote

He explained in chapter. He's continually been facing issues that require him to build up some skill (recently, that mental packet which is degrading and which carries critical information and red cloak) and hasn't had time for a more ambitious approach. He has been trying to get the best instruction from the best masters in the world in mind magic. He has advanced mind readers, and enough mind magic and combat item magic to defeat most enemies he faces.

  Money is power, yet Zorian only thought of the idea years later.
#+end_quote

He only got money recently and only recently got back to Cyoria in a safe way. Years is an exaggeration.

  Anyone from [[/r/rational][r/rational]] could exploit the time loop better, but I doubt many of us would work as hard. Different methodologies but looking for exploits would probably win every time, after all you only need one good exploit to become very powerful.

He has potent exploits- powerful mind magic, invisibility, bombs, golems. He's made excellent use of those to punch well out of his weight class, but he does face a big issue- he faces many enemies, and one good exploit can be countered by their allies. He needs lots of good exploits. A lot of that comes from his hard work. I don't know how well [[/r/rational]] people would do with gathering enough tricks to beat everyone.
