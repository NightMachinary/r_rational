I mean from what we've seen of combat mages I would assume they would have some automatic sensor of hostile intent or something. I certainly would aim to have an invisible detector at the very least.

We don't have enough insight on the combat mage culture to really say but if they behave sensibly I can only assume that they would protect against something someone can learn in a year
