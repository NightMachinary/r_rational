Since you didn't reply, I imagine you're conceding that most mages may not know golem making, bomb making, and invisibility? And that as such he may have trump cards others lack, a sign of his good training?

  That's what I meant by time travel trickery and training. Get ten Aranea to teach him the same subject if that's what it takes to learn as much per day as possible to learn how to get info from the mind packet.

He only knows so many tribes, this wouldn't necessarily work.

  I don't think he can destroy an obviously heavily guarded gate by himself, weak points are fine but in the end power trumps all, a large powerful army would totally destroy them root and stem.

He has bombs and golems, he can suicide bomb it. He can figure out any wards.

  He can simply buy mercenaries, get into a real fight with higher ups and learn what he needs to know. If he runs into trouble he can kill himself and during the fight he will learn a lot about his enemies.

Or he can buy mercenaries, they can speak to the wrong people (as he still has more intel gathering to do) and then red cloak can ambush him and mind and soul rape him.
