  Not all of them can do everything but one guy can do bomb making the other golem making etc, he's just one man after all. Though he is becoming well trained there are still people that will always be better battle mages than him.
#+end_quote

Golem making and spell item creation seem like quite rare talents, most don't seem to have any real skill at it. Not sure about invisibility. Together they let him kill better battle mages.

#+begin_quote
  There's been around a dozen webs mentioned so far, he could probably do just fine with enough gifts and favors.
#+end_quote

Eventually, with enough months. Although the mind package will unravel before that likely.

#+begin_quote
  He can't figure out any ward, he's said before that some are too powerful, complex or well made.
#+end_quote

If so, then he's figured out that the ward is unbeatable and can hit another target or train more.

#+begin_quote
  You can't suicide bomb an entire army camp, you're underestimating his enemies. They have numbers and he needs them too.
#+end_quote

As he mentioned, if he destroyed the gate in then the enemy couldn't call in more reinforcements and would be mostly stopped. It's a critical point of failure.

#+begin_quote
  He obviously changes his appearance, doesn't tell anyone what's really going on and blames his actions on another government or entity, like a false flag operation.
#+end_quote

He can try to hide, certainly, and his hiding skills will go up against Red Robe's divination skills. Who do you think will win?

#+begin_quote
  The entire idea behind guards is to not be ambushed, if he is they can probably buy him valuable time to get away or at least kill himself. (Why hasn't he made suicide rings that totally destroy his body like when he threw himself into the pit?)
#+end_quote

Or they can be mind raped, and used to lull him into a false sense of safety and aid Red Robe. Drawing attention is really really bad, enemies can be smart too.

#+begin_quote
  He can also manage their emotions, erase his presence and memories from his mercenaries so nothing leads back to him, etc.
#+end_quote

That sounds incredibly risky and dangerous, using hostile mind magic on dangerous combat mages. What if they retaliate with mind magic?
