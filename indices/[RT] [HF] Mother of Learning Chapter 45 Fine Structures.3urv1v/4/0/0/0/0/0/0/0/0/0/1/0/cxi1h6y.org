There is a big risk, as noted above, that authors will see us as assholes for demanding that their characters take some weird course of action. Nobody103 is awesome and by my perspective Zorian is pretty rational. I'd be quite careful before calling his actions irrational. If there's a clear course of action he could take for victory of course, then it would be good to call it out.
