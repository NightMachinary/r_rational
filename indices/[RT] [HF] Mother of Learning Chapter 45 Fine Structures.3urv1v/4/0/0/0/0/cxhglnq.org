  Not really, successful mind magic stuff requires dedicated trainers who only help him a certain number of hours. Hence why he sought out the Aranea

That's what I meant by time travel trickery and training. Get ten Aranea to teach him the same subject if that's what it takes to learn as much per day as possible to learn how to get info from the mind packet.

  He's trying to find the best way to defeat the invasion. He already has one way, destroy the gate. He is intelligently seeking out weak points in their force which he can manipulate- he may be able to single handedly beat the invasion on his own. That's not his focus now though, he's gathering intel.

I don't think he can destroy an obviously heavily guarded gate by himself, weak points are fine but in the end power trumps all, a large powerful army would totally destroy them root and stem.

He's gathering intel and looking for weaknesses but in a small way, not thinking big enough again. He can simply buy mercenaries, get into a real fight with higher ups and learn what he needs to know. If he runs into trouble he can kill himself and during the fight he will learn a lot about his enemies.
