If Zorian is going to be doing combat sparring then he needs to do it how he'd do it in the field. That means mind attacks while doing physical attacks and using items, he's nerfing himself hard to fight on an even playing field with Taiven. If he used items and mind magic he'd likely mop the floor with her and need to fight two people at once. If he intentionally wasn't using mind magic I'd hope for at least a line about it, but nothing.

Finally we are getting into the part of the story where Zorian does everything, he hasn't been exploiting this enough. He has infinite money, why not buy mercenaries and go kill bad guys and dragons and stuff to get combat experience? Or get the best personal instruction from all the best masters in the world like Taiven said. I truly don't think Zorians excuse of being busy is enough, he could have had people teaching him from day one. Money is power, yet Zorian only thought of the idea years later.

I think it's more of a personality flaw than anything, which is fair. Zorian (despite all his complaints) is a simple hard worker, he gets a task and completes it to the end, no matter how boring or harsh. He doesn't look for exploits or loop holes really. He hasn't really taken advantage of the time loop yet. Sure he's gotten teacher and spider help by tricking them or giving away things that won't matter at the end of the reset, but nothing major.

Anyone from [[/r/rational][r/rational]] could exploit the time loop better, but I doubt many of us would work as hard. Different methodologies but looking for exploits would probably win every time, after all you only need one good exploit to become very powerful.

Also as a side note why do people never erect shields that protect them as they move? Shields seem pretty useless unless you are prepared for an attack as they are stationary.
