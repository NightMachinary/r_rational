Uh, why would he be using mind magic in a spar against a friend? The whole point of sparring is to learn something from it. What does he get by mind blasting down them down, when he is already learning how to use it against the invaders?

He doesn't have infinite money. It's only however much mana crystals he can collect at the start, which only get refreshed at the start of the loop. He can't go kill bad guys and dragons like a superhero, because that shit gets on the news. Red Robe will come say hello.

You claim anyone, yourself included, from [[/r/rational][r/rational]] can exploit the loop better but all you're suggesting is a fast and easy way to get destroyed by Red Robe.
