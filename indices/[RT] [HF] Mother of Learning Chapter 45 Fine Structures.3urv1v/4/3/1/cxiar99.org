  I thought of all the exploits mentioned, but for most of them I have three basic complaints: 1. They trivialize the risks inherent in their proposals, claiming that Nothing Can Go Wrong and all risks can be mitigated (ha ha). 2. They ignore the set-up time needed to make some of the scenarios come to pass. Some things cannot be done in a month. Other can, but would take years of repetition until you could align everything just right, which is a dubious time investment. 3. A fair number of them depend on assumptions that just aren't true. The setting doesn't work that way. As an aside, a lot of proposals focus on recruit a lot of people for his projects. This is obviously a potent tactics, if fraught with its own issues, but consider this: if Zorian was the type of person who was inclined to do this, he would be already dead by this point in the story. He would have made himself noticeable within the first couple of restart and gotten soulkilled by Red Robe before he was capable of doing anything about it. The same reason that is limiting his growth is the only reason he is alive right now.
