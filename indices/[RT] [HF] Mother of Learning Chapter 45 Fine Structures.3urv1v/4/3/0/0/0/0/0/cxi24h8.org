  Of course I can simply say that Zorian way is obviously the right way because he will win at the end.

No, that wouldn't be a rational story anymore.

  Since both mind and soul magic imply knowledge of the loop before you know about the magic.

No, both areas of magic expertise exist outside of the time loop.

Yes, Zorian did take a risk with his current aranea partners because of the zeitnot. However, from a probabilistic POV, the more people Zorian meet that are capable of discovering the loop and manipulating his mind/soul, the greater his danger of coming across a treacherous party. That's why it's not a very good idea to meet/hire 2-3 aranea webs simultaneously as [[/u/OutOfNiceUsernames]] suggested. However, it can be necessitated by the urgency of the packet decaying, so it's up to the author how to deal with the risk.
