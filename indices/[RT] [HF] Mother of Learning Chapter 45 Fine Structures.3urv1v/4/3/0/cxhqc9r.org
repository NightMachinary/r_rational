  Focus the best researchers and every soul mage you can find on understanding the time loop and improving his own soul defense and attacks.

If I were your Dungeon Master I'd make the first soul mage you hired that's clever enough steal your looping ticket and get you a game over (maybe you'd like to continue playing as that soul mage?).

Soul mages would be one of the few things that I'd expect a clever looper to stay as far away from as possible. No matter how much money you promise to a soul mage, once you clue him in to the whole looping business there's a big chance he'll take the best one shot he's got at turning on you and stealing your ability --- especially since you yourself aren't a qualified soul mage and don't understand how it works.

Zorian's chosen approach is almost entirely consistent with his personality. The only things that stand out are him not seeking better tutors (I think you'll enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567][Temporal Beacon,]] btw) and him not concentrating completely on the memory pack decryption. He could hire at least 2-3 different Aranea webs in a single loop, and so far he almost never even approached the one web that's described as the best mind-reading professionals. I am guessing that the Doylist explanation for this is that once the decryption happens, some “game scripts” will get [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScriptedEvent][triggered]] and the entire environment will get irreversibly changed, so the author is taking his time with the status quo while he can. The Watsonian explanation, however, makes Zorian look like an idiot in this regard.

You're severely overestimating how much money crystal-hunting can get him in a month's time. Maybe if he robbed some rich people or made some kind of deal with them, he'd get himself an army-buying amount of money, but otherwise there isn't much to do to get that rich in a mere month. Besides, even if he /did/ have the money to buy an army, the logistics of assembling so much people together would also take more time then he can spend on it.
