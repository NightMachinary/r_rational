Zorian definitely does not have infinite money, as he has to allot time to map the riches, and then harvest and convert resources into cash in every restart. Harvesting mana is not so great, but thankfully he can now just rob the aranean treasury for cash. The main argument against exploiting money is attention it would inadvertently get, and Zorian needs to remain unnoticed at all costs.

There are, however, some instances where Zorian can use money to solve very concrete tasks that are already on his list: Silverlake's task and that mansion in the north. I think he could at least make an attempt with a bunch of mercenaries. Since Tavien is sort of in the time loop now, maybe he will finally make some progress there.
