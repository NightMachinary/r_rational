If you haven't already, I'd give [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]] a try.

It takes a little while for the character dynamics to build up, but after a while you get a lot of small moments and bigger touching scenes between the cast. The only downside is that while it's heavily implied (and explicitly stated if I'm not mistaken) that the rest of the cast have equally deep relationships among each other, you mainly see things from Juniper's point of view so most of the interactions "Joon/Supporting character", rather than "Supporting Character/Supporting Character". But it's clear that they all have varied and nuanced relationships with each other.
