It is made quite explicit that over time holding a shard twists you to behave in accordance with its nature as opposed to your own. Ruin was originally a nice guy. And even while your mind is still your own, using the power in ways opposed to its style is hard or impossible. Note how the Lord Ruler, in wanting to get rid of Feruchemists, ended up turning them into immortal blobs when using the power of Preservation. In the case of Harmony, that nature seems to include Avoiding Rocking Boats, which makes sense at least to me. I like the bombastic cosmic-scale exploration of the fact that in isolation, even virtues are destructive.

Also, you should keep in mind that the backstory for this universe includes a group of people killing Adonalsium who held all the Shards, which implies something about the power level of individual ones. To be fair that is not mentioned in any of the existing books, so it's a poor argument for the SOD level of the work itself.

That being said, I do agree that I've never seen a group dynamic like Red-Blue-Leaf in Sanderson's work.
