Seconding [[/u/CraftyTrouble]]'s disagreement. Mistborn is the only Sanderson series I've read and I actually haven't read anything else in large part because his characters felt so... dry and flat.

The first of the Mistborn books was the best in this regard, specifically because of Kelsier, but the second two were actually hard to get through. The worldbuilding and magic system is great, but the characters not so much.
