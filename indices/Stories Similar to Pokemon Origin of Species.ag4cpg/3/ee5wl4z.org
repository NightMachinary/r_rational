I think what stands out about PTOOS is that each character has a distinct personality and real agency, making their interactions feel genuine and interesting. It feels like real, intelligent people interacting rather than a single-mind author telling a story. Another fic with this quality is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest-story-only.24793/][Marked for Death]], if you ask me.
