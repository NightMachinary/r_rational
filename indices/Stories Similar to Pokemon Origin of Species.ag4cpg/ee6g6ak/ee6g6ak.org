I'm glad you've enjoyed the characters so much! In addition to Twig, Worth the Candle, and Marked for Death, I'd also recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Animorphs: The Reckoning]]. It has less in the way of fun and warm friendship moments, but the author does a great job of writing rational and fleshed out, agenty characters.

For non-rational fiction, I'd recommend IT by Stephen King.
