Yeah, it's a bit SOD breaking for there to still be meaningful conflict with the power and benevolence of Harmony. I've heard that SPOILER the main villain of the series has supernatural means of evading Harmony's sight, but even that shouldn't be enough honestly.

Maybe he got lobotomised when he ascended to godhood.

I'm only part way through Alloy of Law.
