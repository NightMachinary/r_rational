It's weird how often sci fi has viruses coming from space. Isn't it basically impossible? Since viruses meant for aliens generally wouldn't be adapted to infect earth life, and also because space dwellings tend to have air scrubbers everywhere, and lots of bulkheads.

On the other hand, space is big. Larger population sizes mean more chances for horrible things to emerge and spread.
