Wouldn't he want his forged blood card to be O negative, rather than AB negative? Sure, AB- is the rarest blood type, but they can accept blood from A-, B-, O-, and AB-, a full 16% of the population. O- have the most restrictions when receiving donations, as they can only receive from other people with O-, 7% of the population.

Also, donation centers always test the blood type anyways, so he'd have to avoid donation as well in order to keep the deception from being discovered.
