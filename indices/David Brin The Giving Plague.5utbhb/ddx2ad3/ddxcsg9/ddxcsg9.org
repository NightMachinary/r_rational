It's actually a relatively [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Panspermia#][serious theory]], though of course there's not much evidence for it yet.

That's one reason why we might want to search for microorganisms in potentially life-bearing areas of the solar system (Mars, Titan, Europa, etc). If they turn out to be surprisingly similar to Earth-based life, that's a point in favor of this hypothesis.

Mind you, these are hypothesized to be just hardy microorganisms, not viruses evolved to prey on a particular type of life.
