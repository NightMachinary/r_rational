In some of Brin's other work there is an implication that life on Earth was seeded by microorganisms from space. For instance, a comet carrying all sorts of frozen life forms impacts, spreading new germs into the ecosystem. I find it pretty unlikely that life would develop in space and spread to planets, but it's not too outrageous an idea that it can be ignored completely.
