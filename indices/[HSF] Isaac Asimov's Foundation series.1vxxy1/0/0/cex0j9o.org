I actually think Asimov's short stories tend to be 'rationalist' literature far more than his longer books - his short stories are frequently basically puzzles to solve via use of character resources, and are fairly interesting. I really recommend reading basically any of his short fiction collections.

His ideas about AI were sort of hilariously outdated by modern science - see his three laws of robotics for example.
