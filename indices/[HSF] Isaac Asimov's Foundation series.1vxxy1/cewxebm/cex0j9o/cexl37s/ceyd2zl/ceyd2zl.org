Above and beyond all difficulties of implementation, I agree with Terry Pratchett's cynicism about the literal implementation of the three laws, as described in Going Postal:

/‘Hey! No! What?' Moist waved his hands wildly and knocked game pieces tumbling. ‘Wait! Wait! There's a rule! A golem mustn't harm a human being or allow a human being to come to harm!'/

/Lord Vetinari raised a finger. ‘Just wait one moment, please, Mr Pump. Very well, Mr Lipwig, can you remember the next bit?'/

/‘The next bit? What next bit?' said Moist. ‘There isn't a next bit!'/

/Lord Vetinari raised an eyebrow. ‘Mr Pump?' he said./

/‘“ . . . Unless Ordered To Do So By Duly Constituted Authority”,' said the golem./

/‘I've never heard that bit before!' said Moist./

/‘Haven't you?' said Lord Vetinari, in apparent surprise. ‘I can't imagine who would fail to include it...'/
