I'm a huge sucker for chronological reading, but, in this case, I'd agree with [[http://www.reddit.com/r/Asimov/wiki/seriesguide#wiki_algernon_asimov.27s_personal_recommended_order_.28hybrid.29][Algernon_Asimov's personal recommended order]]. Not that I've read all of the books in all three series, but still.
