Her plan wasn't just race-baiting, her plan was to air all of Commonplace's dirty laundry (that she knew about, anyway). The Shenti tie was part of that, and she definitely emphasized it, but her speech is better summarized as "don't trust Commonplace because they're monsters who don't actually care about you" than as "don't trust Commonplace because they're controlled by the Shenti".

I agree the reaction to her speech was predictable, but it's not like she yelled "kill all Shenti!" and then was shocked when there was violence against Shenti. She thought she was discrediting Commonplace by, among other things, tying it to foreign backers, and failed to account for just how racist and xenophobic her countrymen were.

  Her obsession with Tunnel Vision really is taking a dark turn.

The fixation on Tunnel Vision isn't what's driving her actions, it's just a symptom of a broader problem. The real issue is that she's incapable of accepting criticism of the ruling regime or the status quo. Her plan here wasn't even focused on Tunnel Vision, it was instead her best effort at helping the Principality fight Commonplace despite being a wanted fugitive in the Principality.

The Tunnel Vision thing is just her brain's way of ignoring any time someone affiliated with Commonplace makes a legitimate argument that she can't deny or dismiss. She just goes "oh, well, they work with Tunnel Vision, so whatever they say they're still okay with hurting lots of people so actually nothing they say matters." It's a psychological defense mechanism preserving her worldview, not her actual motivation.
