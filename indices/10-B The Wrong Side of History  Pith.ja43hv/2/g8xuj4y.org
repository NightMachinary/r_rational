It's okay, Ana. You did your best, and you couldn't know it would turn out th... wait, no, you could absolutely predict that this would be the outcome, and also you did it on an impulse for selfish reasons with no regards to how it would impact your friends and/or innocent people. This isn't okay at all. Fuck you, Ana.

That said, the rest of the team really share some responsibility. They should /really/ have known better than to give Ana a platform without proofreading her at first.
