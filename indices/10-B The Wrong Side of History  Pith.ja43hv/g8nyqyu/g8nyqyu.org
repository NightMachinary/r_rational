  “We're not mercenaries,” said Jun, panting as he assembled his machine. “We're unemployed. We should file for assistance.”

Jun is a precious gem and he deserves more love.

Regarding Ana's plan... oof. She really shouldn't be surprised that she made her already volatile nation erupt into riots, nor should she be surprised that her "loyalists" (read: reactionaries) are just as violent as the members of Commonplace. I'd say I don't know what she was expecting, except it's pretty clear she just didn't think that far ahead. She's been operating on gut feelings and emotional leaps for a while now, mostly because thinking too hard about what she's doing or why she's doing it tends to cause pretty severe emotional distress. Which is understandable, considering it means thinking about questions like "is the government I've idolized my whole life actually a brutally repressive regime?" and "do the terrorists I've been fighting, who I've witnessed commit multiple atrocities, actually have legitimate grievances with the status quo I've been upholding?" That being said, she should probably knuckle down and figure her shit out before making any more bold moves, unless she wants to accidentally start a civil war.
