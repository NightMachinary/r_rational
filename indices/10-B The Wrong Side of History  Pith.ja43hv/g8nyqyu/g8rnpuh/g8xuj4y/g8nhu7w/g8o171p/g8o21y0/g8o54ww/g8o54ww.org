I took this to be a reference to Commonplace rather than the Shenti. Looking back, it's unclear which specifically she's referring to, which is admittedly sort of the problem.

I'm not saying there's not a race-baiting element to things, just that I wouldn't say her plan was "just race-baiting." If you look at how she speaks and how she thinks about things as well as how she reacts to her speech's reception, it's pretty clear she wasn't trying to encourage people to "form lynch mobs." Her words were taken that way pretty easily, and that's frankly not surprising, but that wasn't her intention.

I think the disconnect between her expectation and the public at large's reaction is because when she thinks and says "Shenti," she's thinking "rich foreign warlords supplying money and arms," whereas the public at large is thinking "someone who looks like Jun." I think she was going for "tool of a foreign government" rather than "+Jewish+ Shenti conspiracy." She seems to be thinking in national rather than ethnic terms and is genuinely horrified when people take her words differently than how she intended. She thought the Shenti thing would hit hard because it's the country they were at war with not long ago, not because her countrymen are racist fucks.

Moreover, she focusses on more than just the Shenti thing. Yes, she thinks the Shenti thing will be the most effective part, but her speech reads as a big list of reasons why Commonplace is bad rather than a list of reasons to attack your Shenti neighbor. She's clearly trying to vilify Commonplace by using (among other things) its Shenti ties rather than the other way around. While she was playing off existing nationalist and xenophobic sentiment, she wasn't trying to incite racial violence.

Obviously she fucked up and she /did/ inspire lynch mobs and she clearly shouldn't have given that speech, I'm just saying that she didn't go on the radio trying to ruin Commonplace by getting innocent Shenti people beaten in the streets. Her plan was to discredit Commonplace by painting them as monstrous and insincere in their beliefs as well as tools of a foreign power. She just REALLY didn't think things through.
