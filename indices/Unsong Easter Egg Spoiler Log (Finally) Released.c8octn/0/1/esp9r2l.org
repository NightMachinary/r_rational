I don't know if you're aware of this, but there's a fascinating conspiracy theory based on that - [[https://old.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/]]

A bunch of people believe we crossed over to a parallel universe because their memories about stuff like Berenstain Bears don't match the reality.

  The Mandela Effect. The theory states that shared false memories are in fact glimpses into parallel worlds with different timelines and was named by writer and "paranormal consultant" Fiona Broome based on the fact that thousands of people apparently remember Nelson Mandela dying in prison in the '80s despite having been released from prison in 1990 and going on to become president of South Africa. Mandela didn't actually pass away until 2013.
