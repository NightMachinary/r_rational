Back when I watched [[https://kotaku.com/gainax-s-newest-anime-is-cute-girls-airsoft-guns-and-1441035074][Stella Women's Academy, High School Division Class C3]] I sort of assumed something similar about it. I just can't imagine a world where ostensible "students" actually have such huge amounts of free time to pour into their hobbies /during the school year/, let alone in a /Japanese/ school, with their intensive cramming-based education system and high-stakes matriculation exams.
