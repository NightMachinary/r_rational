I think I've found a way to rationalize the slice of life genre. In the transhumanist future setting of Eclipse Phase, civilization on Earth was wiped out by the Singularity and the survivors fled into space. To help rebuild civilization, they decided to raise thousands of children in a simulation at accelerated time. This being Eclipse Phase, it of course all went horribly wrong and the kids were all driven insane, but what if it had worked?

The kids would grow up in a environment meant to resemble reality as closely as possible, but lack the ability to do any real harm to each other. It'd be a relatively tranquil place where they're sheltered from anything more than inconvenience in order to condition them into being good citizens. Their lives would generally revolve around education since they're being trained to help rebuild society.

That sounds a whole lot like a slice of life anime, doesn't it? Students dealing with low-tension problems in a world where bad things just don't happen to them regardless of their decisions or aptitudes. Even if they try to physically hurt each other, there are no lasting consequences to it. Yet it all still looks like our reality because they will eventually leave for the outside world to make a life for themselves.
