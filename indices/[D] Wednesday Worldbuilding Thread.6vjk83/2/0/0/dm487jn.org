According to [[https://youtu.be/85G2naWJ46U][Digibro's video about high school in anime]], most people in Japan actually have more free time as students than most other times in their lives. Most high school anime I've seen will carefully edit scenes to take place days apart and not take up much time, so it's easy to assume I'm just watching the characters during the little free time they have and they spend the rest working.
