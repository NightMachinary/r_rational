For elves, there are two competing ideals; fäsh and shilaal. Fäsh is sometimes translated as "perfection", but a closer reading is "homeostasis", in other words, a thing remaining as it is. Shilall is sometimes translated as "improvement", but a better, more complex translation would be "integration of the positive".

Fäsh is the idealized end for an elf, a point beyond which no change will ever be made again, because all possible positive qualities have been integrated, thereby making shilaal unnecessary. Fäsh /by itself/ is not a good thing, because of course homeostasis is possible when a thing is suboptimal - enduring, but not perfect. The specific word for "fäsh with no room for shilaal" is "ulfäsh", which "elvish" comes from in the human tongue (and the human extrapolation, "elf", which the elves disdain to use).

The elven relationship with shilaal is complicated. On the one hand, shilaal is by definition good, but on the other, shilaal is also /aspirational/; the goal of shilaal is to move from fäsh to fäsh, which offers quite a bit of room for errors and in some cases will result in either extended negative effects before fäsh is achieved, or sometimes even death. Ideally, shilaal will be as fäsh as possible. Where a human will sloppily swing a sword over and over again until he finally gets it right more often than not, the ideal elf will study and meditate on the sword until he can perform his sword stroke perfectly the very first time he ever does it. Rapid iteration, in other words, is not for the elves.
