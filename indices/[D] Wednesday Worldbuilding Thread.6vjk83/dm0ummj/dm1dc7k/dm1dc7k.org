I like it, which means I want to change it a bit: consider the sword swing example. At the moment I see a tension between "will not swing" but "will study/meditate". After all, the new knowledge has to come from somewhere. So I propose that the elf keeps its current state so firmly in mind, like a computer backup, that essaying a swing would not necessarily change itself - unlike the human who rewires himself with every swing or thought. Then, any new information - from swinging, or reading about it, any practice that would make sense from the current state - would be used to create a mental conception of an idealised swing, and only when that conception becomes complete does the elf adjoin it to its current state. (It seems too easy to integrate small bits of improvement, which seems to be allowed by you at the moment.)

So the elf might well swing the sword "clumsily" a few times before he adjoins an ideal swing. You could have it as a matter of status the fewer times some form of practice is used before the ideal is reached.

An elf would have to be careful what sort of things they decide to achieve: if they pick something they can't create an ideal conception of in a reasonable time or using forms of practice they can easily think of, then they might never finish, and they'd have this huge chunk of memory taken up which would be a psychological itch and occasionally spit out some new form of practice that would seem very strange, like, for the sword swing example (though I expect elves to handle that just fine) maybe they pick too broad a conception of swing to start with, and they end up having to try to get idealised proprioception like a sense of space that goes for a hundred metres in each direction down to the accuracy of what their fingertips can sense. A rare success along these lines would give differentiation among elves, because you'd get these from initial mistakes and lucky breaks, and most elves wouldn't want to take such a risk.

You could get forms of madness from incomplete conceptions. Taboo madness might arise from multiple such. Or what happens when they successfully complete a conception, but it's a large one and would dominate their behaviour afterwards, and it becomes harder to think of them as humanoids because of it. Exaggerated example: all their motions have some of the motivation of a sword swing in them, because it's all mediated by a spatial sense which was created with that as a base. Plenty of opportunity for "quirks" that don't detract from perfect sword swings that way.
