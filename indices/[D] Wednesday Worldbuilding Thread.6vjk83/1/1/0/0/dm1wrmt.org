My pleasure! Thinking up a bunch of different ideas is a lot of fun when there's no existing universe to constrain you and no plot in mind to limit you.

I loved the idea of a bird with a jetpack too. Very visceral! From a realism point of view I'm not sure how many "CPU cycles" the capability for flight takes away from a bird's brain though.
