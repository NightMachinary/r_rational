From your examples I'm getting the feeling that you're wanting ideas on how you have a small brain case fit a "humanly intelligent" brain rather than on, say, what the machine itself would look like or anything about the social consequences. So I'm gonna focus on those aspects, though the whole thing is pretty interesting to think about.

You're basically limited to a few broad methods:

- Make the brain bigger

  - Bigger head for bigger brain
  - Squish/reshape organs, have brain matter distributed somehow (think the incorrect meme about stegosaurs having a brain in their hips)
  - Cyborg tech: brain chip interfaces with "the cloud" for brain power (plot opportunity: if the internet goes down, the creature gets downlifted)
  - Cyborg tech: brain chip interfaces with "harddrive" that is implanted in skin or worn as backpack (hard for suspension of disbelief with sufficiently advanced tech, since the hard drive should be pretty tiny).

- Make the brain more efficient

  - Cyborg implant
  - Genetic engineering (retrovirus?): have the neurons more efficient, closer together, etc

- Re-optimise the brain

  - Birds (say) are really optimised to control their wings for flight (or: dogs for smell/etc). Perhaps if the parts of their brain used for flying were co-opted for higher thought, you'd be able to fit human-level intelligence into that brain. Practical upshot: the animal makes some "trade off" for its intelligence.
  - As above but you use tech to "give back" the ability that the brain is no longer able to do e.g. give the bird a jetpack, or e.g. replace the part of the brain that controls the heart beat with a pacemaker (from an anatomical POV not sure how much "thinking power" the pons or whatever has)
  - As above but make the animal a head in a vat/robot so all the machinery associated with controlling the body can be used for thought (inverse of the "give them a cyborg intelligence chip" idea)
