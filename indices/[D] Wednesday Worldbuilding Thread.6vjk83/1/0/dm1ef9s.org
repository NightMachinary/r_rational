For me, the biggest question about uplifting was always why anyone would want to? Digital artificial intelligence can do things humans can't, can be programmed with safety features, and are subject to relatively easy modification as needed. Biological artificial intelligence is basically just a human, but more expensive to both create and maintain due to different biological and psychological requirements.

The one story I've read that justified it to my satisfaction is Freefall, where the purpose was to create people who could colonize a planet with biochemistry that was compatible with some animals but not humans. Eclipse Phase gets an honorable mention for being a setting where mind uploading is so common that uplifts just means more options for your body, but I could never reconcile that with the systemic racism they face.
