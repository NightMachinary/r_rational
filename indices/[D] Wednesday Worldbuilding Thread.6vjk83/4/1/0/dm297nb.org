  The "once every hundred years giant wildfire from the eclipse" would probably have different life (especially trees) more adapted to periodic fires, but it would still be feasible.

Fynbos (a plant kingdom that currently exists on Earth) is so well-adapted to periodic fires that it actually /requires/ periodic fires to survive (the seeds of several species won't germinate without enough heat).

It's not that hard to recognise; it's got very thin, very dry leaves. Much like kindling.
