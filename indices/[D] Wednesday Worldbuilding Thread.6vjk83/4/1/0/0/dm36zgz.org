Yeah, I actually live in such a biome! I actually have a friend who works for the "forest department" and she goes on helicopter rides and sets parts of the bush on fire, because fire is so common/important in the local ecosystem and it's better to have controlled burns during winter than giant bushfires in summer.

In fact, [[https://www.dpaw.wa.gov.au/management/fire/fire-and-the-environment/41-traditional-aboriginal-burning][bushfires have been used for tens of thousands of years by the local people]] for all sorts of reasons!
