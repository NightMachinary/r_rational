  Would the earth even be habitable if every eclipse was so deadly?
#+end_quote

I think the big question is what effect a focal lens like that would have on the oceans, since that's where most eclipses happen. The "once every hundred years giant wildfire from the eclipse" would probably have /different/ life (especially trees) more adapted to periodic fires, but it would still be feasible.

But if the water temperature fluctuated by several degrees every few years, this could have a big impact on microscopic sea life and might make things uninhabitable to life as we know it.

Realistically though, if the lens was always there, life probably would have evolved to be able to handle those big temperature variations (or the ocean is so big / eclipses so short that even reasonably frequent temperature variations like this would only have local effects anyway), so life would probably be OK.
