We'd need some math. According to [[http://tsanad.blogspot.com/2011/04/living-on-moon-how-bright-is-night.html][this site]], "The energy hitting a square meter of the Earth or moon each second is 1400 Joules". The moon is 2,159 miles wide, which would give the circular lens a flat surface area of 3.6 million square miles. Divide and then multiply, and that's [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(3.6+million+square+miles+%2F+1+square+meter)+*+1400+Joules][13 quadrillion Joules]] per second. That's on the level of an atomic bomb every second.

/However,/ the lens would be imperfectly focusing except under just the right conditions (even assuming the lens was tidally locked like the moon is), we can't actually assume 100% energy focusing, and the effects of the beam of light would by themselves cause particulate scattering that would negate at least some of the effects. The Earth would almost certainly get hotter, and there would be wide-spread devastation along the path (and outside it due to the heat and energy, which would probably cause destructive weather), but I don't think it would be /uninhabitable/, just difficult for civilization.
