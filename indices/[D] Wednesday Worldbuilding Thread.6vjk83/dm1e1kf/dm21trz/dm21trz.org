The most dramatic effect possible with lenses is doubling the brightness of the sun in some areas.

Right now, the sky is about 0.001% sun and 99.999% cold space. Lenses act to change some of the sky from something (like cold space) to something else (like the sun). During a moonbeam, the sky would be 0.001% sun, 0.001% sun-via-moonlens and 99.998% cold space.

The reason why you can start fires with a handheld magnifying glass but not the moonlens is that you can make a handheld magnifying glass take up half the sky instead of the 0.001% that the moon is.
