Another reason that might be interesting to explore is that certain animals may think differently, which could lead to unique ideas that would be difficult for a human to visualise. Cephalopods, especially octopuses, are quite smart, but have taken a different evolutionary path to humans. Maybe a sapient octopus would be better at visualising higher dimensions? It would be an interesting idea to explore in any case, and might see more interesting uplift candidates than apes or dogs.
