I'm brainstorming methods by one might uplift or otherwise increase the intelligence of an animal. I'm personally interested in methods that would fit a science fiction sort of setting but more fantastic methods are welcome, since I hope that this can be of help to others as well.

Current ideas:

- The standard "do some gene tinkering, make the brain bigger" method. This might be sufficient for e.g. chimpanzees or even large dogs, but smaller animals will probably not qualify.
- Implant a very small computer, which essentially simulates additional brain matter. These uplifts are cyborgs, and they almost certainly lose their higher reasoning abilities if the computer is damaged.
