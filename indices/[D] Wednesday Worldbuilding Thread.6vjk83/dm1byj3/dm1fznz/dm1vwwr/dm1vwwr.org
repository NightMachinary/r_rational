Excellent. Thanks! I especially like the idea about squishing/reshaping organs.

The idea of linking the chip to some sort of cloud is also rife with story potential.

  As above but you use tech to "give back" the ability that the brain is no longer able to do e.g. give the bird a jetpack

That's one way to make a setting stand out. "Oh, that's the story where the intelligent crow protagonist has to use a jetpack to get around."

Thanks again.
