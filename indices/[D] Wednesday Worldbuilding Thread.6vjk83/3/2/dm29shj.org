I think practicality and mix-and-match mentality might play a big role in it. Your roman vampire for instance, she may simply adore handbags and not be fond of pockets, simply because she didn't grow up with the concept of pockets. She wouldn't care about that accessory or utility in her clothes as much as someone from a different era (or same era and other cultural background).

On the other hand you may have a strong tendency to delineate generations of vampires, since age is a prestige thing and you signal your age by the way you clothe yourself. Think of age-correlated ‘uniforms' or styles in clothing here, something to show fellow vampires “I'm from this era!”, while at the same time not appearing too outlandish compared to normal humans. This might tie in as an identifier, actually, if that's a thing. If vampires don't immediately recognise their ‘species' clothes may be a valid tool to indicate what they are. Kind of like early christians (when they were still a sect, not a religion) and the fish.

Lastly and unrelated, if you don't have any plans for events taking place during the bottleneck event, you can simply leave it unexplained as well. Just have it as an event with recognisable naming, and keep in the back of your mind what that particular vampire might think of it, and have it not mentioned much. Compare, for instance, to 9/11. It's a date, and you don't need to explain to virtually anyone what happened on that day, since it's a day you were (likely) alive and a consequence you were affected by, in whatever way. When you speak with other people, you don't go into the particulars of that day, since you don't need to -- everyone /knows/ what happened.

The same applies to your vampires, be they sired pre or post event. They will know what happened, they will be affected by it, either directly or indirectly, and it will likely be a touchy subject for the older, which means it'd be reasonably avoided by the younger lest they anger their elders. And since it's been centuries, the event and its particulars and circumstances won't likely come up. It's not recent history for humans, and even for vampires it likely won't be. Important, yes, but how often do you think of WWII in everyday life, for instance. You life was shaped by it, but not in any way you would time thinking on. Unless that's your kind of hobby and interest, of course, but that's not the point.

Anyway, that my 2 cents.
