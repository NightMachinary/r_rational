I really love this post. Thank you for it! It is full of such useful information and perspective. I appreciate you taking the time to make it!

  First of, Hécatomba is an entirely valid name. It will work if you use it. Be advised, though, that I as a native German speaker and avid reader don't remember that word being used, ever.
#+end_quote

FWIW, I am a B1 French speaker and I'm currently reading [[https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/boulay-and-steyer-demain-les-animaux-du-futur/][this book]], which, conveniently for my French learning, is a genre that interests me and is available /only in French/. I found the word "hécatombe" in there, which is why I added it to my French vocab list. Now, admittedly I don't know if me finding it in a very niche book means it's a common word in French or not, but a [[http://www.wordreference.com/fren/hecatombe][FR-EN dictionary]] translates it to "massacre" or "slaughter". But I did find it "in the wild" rather than in a "word of the day" list, whatever /that's/ worth. (not that it necessarily matters: the rest of your post kind of makes me reconsider it altogether)

#+begin_quote
  However, it is a good callback for the ancient vampires, since they /will/ know that word, know about its /current/ use and also its /historical/ significance.
#+end_quote

Vampires and language is a weird concept, really. They learn a language at a time and place, and with their better than human memories they probably remember it for quite a while, and can relearn it within a few weeks. The more languages they learn, the more easily they pick new ones up, too. And, well, from a vampire conception of time spending 2 months learning a new language is not a major investment. But they might not pick up on nuances of words as they change, unless they make a habit of reading a lot of human-created media (which they probably have little interest in).

#+begin_quote
  For instance, take wars. WW1 was usually called The War, until WW2 happened. [...] I presume the US treat these two wars linguistically differently, since they had many more wars since then, and we were entering the age of mass media around that time anyway.
#+end_quote

I'm Australian so I'm not sure how the US names the wars; I know that WW1 was called "the great war" before WW2 happened though.

#+begin_quote
  [a bunch of extremely good perspective on what people called things that effected them personally, culminating] Youngsters may call it Hécatomba, but the older vampires will simply call it Then.
#+end_quote

YES. This is very true.

#+begin_quote
  Which is also a good way to drop the name, and then leave it infuriatingly unexplained for the next two novels, because it's not even tangentially relevant to the current story threads.

  #+begin_quote
    Oldie: No, I met him some time ago. We were cleaning up the consequences of That Time and wore these stupid plague masks. Well, now we say stupid, but at The Time it was the only recurse we had.

    Youngster: At which time, you mean? The Plague?

    Oldie: No, /Then/.

    Youngster: Oh! You mean the hécatombe, why don't you say so?

    Oldie: Do you want me to continue or not?

    Youngster: Yes yes, go on.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

I /really, really love this/. My story's supernatural romance and I have all these implied wars and plagues that I am going to be leaving infuriatingly unexplained, so an exchange like this sounds like a wonderful idea.

#+begin_quote
  All this writing made me curious, do the vampires have a lingua franca?
#+end_quote

I didn't picture them having one: I pictured them communicating in whatever language they happened to share, possibly with some levels of prestige if you both happen to speak e.g. ancient frankish circa 300 CE. My story opens with a vampire going to Italy for an Opera, but events like that are planned far in advance (as well as e.g. vampire meetings to discuss business). So I'd imagine the promotional material would say "Lady Vettori is writing an opera. It will be shown in Rome in July 1944. Language Italian circa 1870 with parts in Arabic circa 1750." or "You have been called to see Queen Anastasia's presentation of her newest progeny. To take place in August 2015. Ceremony to be performed in contemporary Russian and Old Roman Latin."; a vampire can spend a few months learning/brushing up on the language as required. And if you never learned Old Roman Latin, either because you could never be bothered or because you are too young, well, you'd better have a friend who is able to do you the favour of teaching you, or hope the vampire who created you is willing to tutor you.

#+begin_quote
  disuse fosters forgetting, even of languages.
#+end_quote

That's true but IME it comes back when you try to use it again: I remember I didn't speak any French for some 5 years, went to Lyon on holiday and after 3 days I started having words come into my brain. Like, I'd get the feeling that the word for A was B, and then I'd look it up in my travel dictionary and I'd be right. More words came to me as the days went on (forgot the word for "stamp" and then the next day "timbre" was just in my brain, fully formed). I imagine vampires would be even better than me at this, because my French wasn't great to begin with.

#+begin_quote
  For the middle ages it would have been Latin, or Pidgin Latin, or whatever traders spoke, and for the ancient times it was bastardised Phoenician and such, but the thought remains: did a lingua franca emerge for vampires?
#+end_quote

The thought of vampires having their own "secret language" is quite compelling. I wonder if they would just speak ancient Korean or something and call it a day, or if they'd construct a language? I suppose much like esperanto many vampires would try and few would succeed.

#+begin_quote
  Lastly, you can have vampires speak off-kilter in dated and anachronistic language under a specific circumstance: they speak a language they didn't for quite some time.
#+end_quote

Yeah... my vampire speaks that way, but I feel on some level you have to give characters vocal tics to make them easy to tell apart when written, and I don't think he's too bad. (Just FYI, I have a bad habit of plopping prose from my mostly-finished story in worldbuilding threads in order to demonstrate things, so in keeping with that bad habit I've put some sample dialogue to show you what I mean. If you object to this habit, let me know and I'll stop doing it to you!)

#+begin_quote
  It will have dated terminology, dated grammar, and will likely reflect the social status and stratum they frequented when they learned the language.
#+end_quote

Yeah, doing that requires a hell of a lot more research than I think anyone can really expect to do for a story. I'd like to be able to do it but... not gonna happen I don't think. Something I /did/ try was, if a character was speaking French, I'd write the dialog in English (of course) but structure it as a "literal translation" of what the French dialogue might be. So things like avoiding gerunds, using "more old" rather than "older" since French doesn't have the latter construction, etc. A beta reader said it was a stupid convention to make since I should try to have my English represent the way they sound to a French speaker rather than try to make them sound like a French speaker speaking English, if you get me.

STORY EXCERPT:

--------------

“Thank you for bringing my clothes.” William said, shrugging on his shirt. It was a dark maroon that reminded Red of the thick blood that had been in the warm cups at the ritual.

“Happy to help.” Red shrugged.

“Now we have a gargoyle, things are going to be easier than they once were.” He remarked, carefully doing up the buttons.

“So... you're going to...” He paused, searching for the words. “Keep him?”

William smiled. “Yes. Although my defeat has been rather humiliating, I believe he shall be an asset.”

Red nodded. “Yeah. I'm feeling a lot better about having him around, too.”

“Ah, he has been of assistance whilst I was away?” He walked to the bedroom.

Red shook his head, following. “No, it's not that. I've been talking to him a lot. It's... a little creepy. But he's happy... He's not unhappy about... serving. Which is good, I suppose?”

“Oh, is that so?” William asked with mild amusement. He went to the cupboard and selected a pair of dark brown suspenders and started buttoning them onto his pants.

“It's still weird. But it's for the best. I wasn't sure how we were going to release him without making things worse, but he seems happy, so...”

“Why would we do that?” William frowned as he examined himself in the mirror, adjusting his curly blonde hair yet again. “Such a creature will be extremely useful when I return home.”
