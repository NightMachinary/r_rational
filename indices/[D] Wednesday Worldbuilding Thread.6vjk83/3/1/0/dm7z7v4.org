When you say you expect the new vampires to look timeless, what exactly do you mean? To me a timeless outfit, well, doesn't really exist, but would be a suit for men and maybe a long-sleeved ballgown for women in a conservative sort of style: it's something that isn't emblematic of any particular era, so wouldn't look out of place at any point.

Anyway, that misunderstanding out the way, onto the main thrust of your comment!

  This means that I'd expect old vampires to have a "cultural assistant" picking out their wardrobe, explaining current events, and updating them on slang.

Agreed; these could even be human. There are definitely wardrobe services (you know, trunkclub and all that but for rich people), and there are high-level English teachers who teach people how to turn phrases like natives. Vampires can quite easily make humans do their bidding so this is easy.

Then again, turning a human into a vampire is very difficult, and there's no clear benefit from doing so; so perhaps some of them periodically turn a young, "with it" human into a vampire and learn the appropriate human nuances from them. But that would probably be too large an investment for something as unimportant in the scheme of things as fitting in human culture.

  You'd probably get funny conversations where the ancient vampire graciously shares their "wisdom" about pop-culture with a vampire who's merely 80.

Oh, yes. The one thing I need are more plot bunnies:

"Thank you for arriving on time." William said, eyeing the new vampire in his kingdom with suspicion.

"Of course, your majesty. I know I need to come on time because the whole 'being polite' stuff."

"If I am going to give you a duchy, I hope you would speak with more care around humans."

"How do you mean, your majesty?"

"You appear to be in your late teens. You have no excuse to use slang so poorly. I get dialogue lessons from a local teacher. You should do so, too, as the humans here have their own slang terms. I will provide you with their phone number..."
