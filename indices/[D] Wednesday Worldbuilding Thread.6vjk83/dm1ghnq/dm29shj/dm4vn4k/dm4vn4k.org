  If vampires don't immediately recognise their ‘species' clothes may be a valid tool to indicate what they are.

That is a very good point. Vampires can probably recognise each other based on smell and such, but that probably requires a level of proximity. (Vampires don't have to breathe, don't have to have a heartbeat, don't have to have a warm body, etc, but can choose to do any of the above). So simply dressing "vampire style" would be a pretty good.

Oooh, that direct comparison is groundbreaking for me. People don't casually say, "remember 911 when terrorists stole planes and destroyed the towers?" when they're reminiscing, or even when they're talking about (at least tangentially) related things like terrorism or war in the middle east. Using that as a point of comparison is excellent. Any time vampires talk about the /Catastrophe/, I should replace Catastrophe with 911 and see how it scans. Thank you! I had a lot of concern about how to write the story without the Catastrophe being nailed down, but you've really helped me!

(I am considering referring to the Catastrophe as the Hécatombe because I just learned that word and think it's excellent, but realistically I should get some sort of Croatian or "Prussian" word - which apparently they have as "hekatomba")
