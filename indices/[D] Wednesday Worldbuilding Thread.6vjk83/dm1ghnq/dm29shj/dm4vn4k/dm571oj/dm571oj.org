I have thoughts. Here are some:

First of, Hécatomba is an entirely valid name. It will work if you use it. Be advised, though, that I as a native German speaker and avid reader don't remember that word being used, ever.

However, it is a good callback for the ancient vampires, since they /will/ know that word, know about its /current/ use and also its /historical/ significance.

That said, names are /weird/. They pop up and are generated somewhat randomly, and if you want to have any indication as to how that occurs naturally, look to the past, because these days there's historians and media that will slap on their label and that will propagate. For instance, take wars. WW1 was usually called The War, until WW2 happened. Hereabouts it's still simply called The War, and differentiated to the other world war only when necessary. If it comes in casual observation though, it's only The War. I presume the US treat these two wars linguistically differently, since they had many more wars since then, and we were entering the age of mass media around that time anyway.

So look further back, and elsewhere than war (contemporaries will likely referred to any last war that personally affected them as The War, and only clarify when necessary). You're effectively talking about natural disasters, and the only with such an impact in modern history that come to mind are plagues and volcanic eruptions, maybe. The most noteworthy of the former is called the Black Death, because 1) you died from it and 2) black is a malignant colour (the necrotic tissue turning black is a more modern explanation). Contemporaries of the time called it differently, though: the *great mortality*, or the *great plague*. I assume the reason for this was that pestilence was not that uncommon, but the scales for that epidemic were unprecedented in such a way that even ‘decimation' is to weak a word to use.

My point is, contemporaries refer to stark events differently than later generations (or their historians). The former will feel less need to specify what they talking about, since it was the most radical/intruding/incisive event in their personal history, but the latter will treat it as mere history. Important, yes, but ‘come on, that was, like, three hundred years ago. That's basically ancient times.' Youngsters may call it Hécatomba, but the older vampires will simply call it Then.

Which is also a good way to drop the name, and then leave it infuriatingly unexplained for the next two novels, because it's not even tangentially relevant to the current story threads.

  Oldie: No, I met him some time ago. We were cleaning up the consequences of That Time and wore these stupid plague masks. Well, now we say stupid, but at The Time it was the only recurse we had.

  Youngster: At which time, you mean? The Plague?

  Oldie: No, /Then/.

  Youngster: Oh! You mean the hécatomba, why don't you say so?

  Oldie: Do you want me to continue or not?

  Youngster: Yes yes, go on.

All this writing made me curious, do the vampires have a lingua franca? I mean, they're all old enough to learn a couple languages (assuming they don't run into storage problems in their brains with age), but languages evolve with time, and disuse fosters forgetting, even of languages. For the middle ages it would have been Latin, or Pidgin Latin, or whatever traders spoke, and for the ancient times it was bastardised Phoenician and such, but the thought remains: did a lingua franca emerge for vampires?

Lastly, you can have vampires speak off-kilter in dated and anachronistic language (a staple of immortality fiction, I'm told) under a specific circumstance: they speak a language they didn't for quite some time. It will have dated terminology, dated grammar, and will likely reflect the social status and stratum they frequented when they learned the language. You lived 20 years as a baker Cologne in 1500 before moving to England for the rest of your time? Your German will reflect that; you will not only have a dialect, but a sociolect and a chronolect, +to coin a term+ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronolect][which is an actual term in linguistics]].
