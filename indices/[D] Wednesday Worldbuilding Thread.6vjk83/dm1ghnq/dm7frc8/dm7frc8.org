I'd expect the new vampires to look timeless, and the oldest vampires to look like painfully trendy hipsters.

Figure I'm a vampire. I get turned. Then, I get distracted by vampire culture. Years 0-20, I fit in as a native. Years 20-60, I look like a weirdly dated native. Maybe I was a kid who latched onto my parents' fashion.

At 60-80 years, everyone who grew up wearing my outfit is dead. I'd look unnaturally dated, so I'd need to take a while to learn to look normal again. Fortunately, I still have some baseline understanding of culture to work from.

Contrast with a vampire who's 300+ years old. They'd have no idea what's going on culture-wise. And wouldn't want to spend a year talking to young people to figure it out. Those vampires should throw money at the problem.

This means that I'd expect old vampires to have a "cultural assistant" picking out their wardrobe, explaining current events, and updating them on slang. In some ways, it would be a form of conspicuous consumption. It also means that old vampires are taking advice from people who's livelihood depends on chasing new trends.

So, the Master Vampire would have a hipster undercut and all-birds shoes. They'd be fashion-forward in ways that require tons of effort (on behalf of their assistants), while 'timeless' clothing would be a new vampire thing.

You'd probably get funny conversations where the ancient vampire graciously shares their "wisdom" about pop-culture with a vampire who's merely 80.
