Trying to make a short post today, but as always it's about vampires! Specifically, vampire clothing!

A lot of the time fiction has vampires wearing either really old-timey clothes (I guess because they're used to them), or just whatever people are wearing in the "present day". Old-timey clothes are often justified with "well it's what they grew up with!" and present day clothes with "they want to blend in!". Both of those justifications don't really work when you think about it.

The idea of a vampire from ancient Rome just casually wearing a toga around is kind of lame, because did that vampire decide there was no fashion that appealed to them more in 2000 years of time and who knows how many different continents than a fancy draped sheet? Were they not as amazed by purple dye as everyone else?

But then the idea of a vampire in 2017 sporting purple hair and an undercut is also kind of lame. If this vampire is not trying to "fit in" with human society, why would she care about following a fashion trend that's only ~5-10 years old for anything other than a bit of fun? And if she is, she could "fit in" with clothes that are slightly dated: no need for her to be fashion forward. But really, why wouldn't she have tailors make her exactly what she wants to wear, and if it's a bizarre combination of a poodle skirt, corset, and stilettos, if she's only wearing those around other vampires and humans she's about to eat, why does it matter?

Actually, on the purple dye thing: I could see a vampire enjoying wearing purple for a few hundred years after it was cheap to do so just because of the novelty of it. Are there any other "advances in fashion" that are surprisingly recent that vampires might be really into? Like, I suppose there are vampires out there who have tons of velcro in their clothing because they think it's so amazing and cool and new?
