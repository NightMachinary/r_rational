I didn't want it to get too bogged down in my very expansive mythology, but since you asked, My Vampires' population went through a bottleneck ~1700 CE, reducing from 20k to 800 individuals. It recovers to ~20k in 1900 and then I believe that growth rate puts them on ~100k in 2000. This also makes the median age /very, very young/ (85% of vampires are less than 100 years a vampire).

My Vampires certainly do and it comes up a lot, but I tended to write it as the colour and the way e.g. the sleeves are rolled as being what has the effect rather than whether your suit is more appropriate to the 70s or the 90s. Essentially, a pale yellow shirt means you're appreciative that an important friend is honouring you with a visit, and it doesn't matter if it's a singlet or a button up. This doesn't make that much sense though it does give vampires a lot of flexibility in what they choose to wear if they want to blend in - but they normally don't need to.

So I wonder if my saying "vampires clothing colours, the way they fold sleeves up, and the way they lace their shoes matter, but it doesn't matter at all whether they're wearing a 3 piece suit or a bathing suit" is dumb. /Probably/ they all intersect: a suit means something different than a bathing suit, and a yellow t-shirt means something different to a yellow button up shirt, but whatever outfit you choose is "Turing-complete" so to speak.

Here's a self-indulgent excerpt from my story to explain a bit how the clothing works, I might edit it to make it more explicit though:

  William couldn't help but take note of the precise angle that the night porter was wearing his hat at; the place he had rolled his sleeves up to, and the number of times he had folded the sleeve to do it. To a vampire, such aspects of one's attire were carefully composed, and each button, each fold, and each accessory brought a meaning to the outfit. If the porter had been a vampire, he would be signalling for a private meeting with a superior. It was unambiguous. It was absurd; he had never heard of a human stumbling upon a coherent message like that.
