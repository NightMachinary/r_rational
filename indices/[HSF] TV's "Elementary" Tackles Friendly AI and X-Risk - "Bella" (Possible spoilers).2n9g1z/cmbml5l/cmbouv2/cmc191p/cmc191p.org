Honestly, I think it would actually be sort of hilarious if they actually had a police procedural where they stuck to the actual facts and disappointed audiences with /not solving/ fully 1/3rd of the murders they are presented with, and having a big portion of the ones they do solve be of the 'person standing over the body with a bloody knife saying, "He shouldn't have said what he did!", with multiple witnesses and camera evidence' sort. Maybe even have a lot of witnesses in compromising circumstances refuse to talk to police and demand a lawyer. It would make horrific TV, possibly, but honestly might be more interesting than the formulaic stuff they seem to be producing currently...
