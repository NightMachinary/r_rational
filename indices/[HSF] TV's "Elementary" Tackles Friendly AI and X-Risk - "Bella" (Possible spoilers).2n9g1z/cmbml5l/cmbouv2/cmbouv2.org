I've been binge-watching it over the last few days - I'm about halfway through the first season now.

It suffers a lot from the same old Sherlock Holmes problem of clues being cobbled together in ways that the viewer couldn't possibly have predicted, but other than that it's pretty good, especially for a show that's putting out 20+ episodes a year. I wouldn't say that it's in the running for my favorite show ever, but I like it.

Edit: It's also got that annoying thing that /every/ procedural besides (sometimes) /Law & Order/ has where the criminal will confess and the case will be declared solved on sometimes very slim evidence. I saw an episode last night where all of the evidence was completely circumstantial and there was no way that they'd be able to get a conviction, but the show treated it like a slam dunk. But I get that they do this for the sake of narrative speed - real criminal convictions take a long time, and there are appeals, and battles over evidence.
