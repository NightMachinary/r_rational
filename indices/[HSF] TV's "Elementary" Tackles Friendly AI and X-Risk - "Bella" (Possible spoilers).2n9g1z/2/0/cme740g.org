What exactly did you not like about it? I just watched it and my feelings were a little different. I thought that:

- they stated the argument straightforwardly and without excessively ridicule...
- although they didn't supply the FOOM contingency, which makes the idea vastly less believable.
- There was, at least for a bit, the possibility [[#s][that]]
- They never explicitly talked about Sherlock's findings on Bella, but it's pretty clear from implication that he found her impossible to disprove. He made a point of saying that they had to call her "it", but then promptly slipped and called her "she." He remained engaged with her throughout the entire show; even at the very end, he was telling the company that he needed a couple more hours. The very last moment of the show was him asking her a question, getting an answer that is rather chilling by [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror][FridgeHorror]] and giving us a split-second reaction to it just as we fade to black.
