It seems odd that the fragment of the Dead King in Zeze is relying on Cat keeping the Tyrant contained so that he can make his escape, or at least to open enough space to send a message out. Relying on your enemy, especially one as savvy as Cat, for the literal final step of your master plan, seems extremely risky.
