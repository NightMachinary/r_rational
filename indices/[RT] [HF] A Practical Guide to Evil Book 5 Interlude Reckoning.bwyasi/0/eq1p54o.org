Oof. Did Neshemah really think that trying to possess one of, if not the strongest sorcerer on Calernia and then killing his love in front of him would end well?

I guess I've been attributing Black/Cat's ability to see and manipulate stories to every player of a certain level of sophistication, but the Nessie really seems to overestimate the degree of control he can exert by getting directly involved.
