It is also possible that killing Archer was his best move there even knowing how Masego would react to seeing her dead, and he'd planned to conceal that fact; it seems like Bard did something to clear Masego's sight, there at the end, and that may be something that the Dead King didn't realize she could do.

A living Indrani would probably have been even more dangerous to the Dead King's control over Masego than a dead one, honestly. Once she made it inside the circle, there was nothing stopping her from snapping him awake in some dramatically appropriate way (confession of love, kiss, whatever), and I suspect the weight behind that would have made it harder for Nessie to conceal from Masego. A quiet, clean kill and an illusion let him put off the moment of realization for a few crucial moments to finish his investigation into the Bard, after all.
