This is the same mistake that has been shown just a few chapters ago though, when he failed to account for Kairos' personality - that the Dead King assumes everyone of a certain level will act rationally. This is only worsened by his apotheosis, which we know from both Sovereign of Winter Cat being extremely stuck in her violent ways and Sve Noc having Cat as their advisor to avoid this exact situation railroads you into thinking a certain way.

In case of the Dead King, who sacrificed his entire kingdom for power, this tunnel-vision as it were is that people with certain level of power behave rational and practical at most times, always looking for the most beneficial option.

Here the mistake was that due to the Pilgrim being close at hand Indrani will most certainly be resurrected by him. Every one of the heroes knows this, the Dead King knows this, and, since Masego can see what's going on now, Masego himself will almost definitely also realise that the Pilgrim is going to resurrect Indrani seeing as they appear to be on the same side.

So from a rational point of view all the Dead King did was dissuade Indrani from interfering since, well, death has no consequence this one time. It's quite literally a warning shot. And he assumed Masego would see this as well, and not risk himself trying to fight off the Dead King in his soul.

Unfortunately he underestimated (once again partly caused by his apotheosis) that human relationships can cause people, even highly intelligent and powerful ones, to behave quite irrationally. I assume next chapter Masego is going to attempt something very risky that will put his life and soul at risk to fight the Dead King off, something he would never do in a right frame of mind, which is why the Dead King thought it ludicrous for him to do.
