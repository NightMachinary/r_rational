I'm still holding out for the Gnomes to become plot relevant as well as lore-relevant. Maybe the Gods really just want a real life Truman show and the bard is the presenter who smooths things over and the gnomes are just there to stop it getting too out of hand. Hell, maybe its a simulation created by bored sci-fi humans.
