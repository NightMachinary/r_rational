When you undergo apotheosis you lose what makes you human in order to gain what makes you divine, this includes the ability to truly learn. I think Nessie is just a bit behind on how tight and loyal to each other the Woe are. He hasn't been around for the Calamity's reforms so he probably expects them to be as loyal to one another as villains normally are. That, and while he is extraordinarily cautious and intelligent, he is only risking part of his soul and one plan. This is a loss, and a permanent one, but he's not beaten by a long shot.
