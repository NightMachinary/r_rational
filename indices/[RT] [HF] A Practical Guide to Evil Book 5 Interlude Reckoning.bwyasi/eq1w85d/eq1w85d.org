I'm a bit disappponted in Nessie here. Much praise has been heaped upon him for surviving thousands of years by never giving the Plot an openning. He was raised up as the (un)living epitome of the Sun Tzu passage, paraphrased, "To secure yourself from the possibility of defeat lies within your power. The opportunity to defeat your opponent lies with him."

I really hope that Nessie has some scheme at work here that we aren't seeing, or this turns the only thing that made him actually scary into an informed ability. I don't expect him to play the entire thing flawlessly. He has to be defeatable in the end. A mistake this big, though, is straining my suspension of disbelief.

In other words, I notice that I am confused...
