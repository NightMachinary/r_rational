I'm actually, in a lot of ways, more curious about how he came to know about WB and turned into her antagonist. My old professor in history kept telling me to follow the money back to it's source if I wanted to know why something happened. And by that he meant 'whatever had the most value' in total, and to a singular person.

So some of the questions I'm asking myself is how he came to know her, how she intervened with his machinations, and what he did to avoid her machinations. Amongst other questions

Maybe the answers to those questions are obvious to some, but to me they aren't
