Hey, it's Friday already! Also, I'm in Korea now! (Keimyung University, Daegu; will probably link a blog entry here soon)

Anyone knows a good, cheap Korean phone service provider? I already have a smartphone, and I need 3G/4G/whatever, actual phone calls optional. Emphasis on cheap (at worst I can always use the school wi-fi).
