Saw Miss Sloane in Netflix the other day. Wow. Highly recommended. Best iteration of the "magnificent bastard" trope I've seen in a movie in a long time. Best political drama also. Very rational, like if skitter and tattletale had a child who became a lobbyist. I think it's right up this subs alley.
