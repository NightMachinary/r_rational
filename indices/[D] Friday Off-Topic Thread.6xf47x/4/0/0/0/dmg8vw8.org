It's just got the very good premise of an independent candidate being designated survivor and there's a terrorist attack and now he's president all of a sudden. I've never seen 24 but my partner says it has a lot of 24 vibes (it's starring Keither Sutherland).

I also enjoyed Travelers, but it's not Rational again; I probably only like it because it's got a lot of Stargate DNA and it shows.
