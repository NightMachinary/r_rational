I agree, but I have trouble accusing the show of not delivering on what it's always promised. Rick has always been a belligerent asshole that hurts everyone around him and gets what he wants anyway because he's so narratively powerful that nothing can seriously threaten him. His family has always been unusually accepting of this without trying to rationalize it because they are all kind of crazy and pretty stupid.

This set up was engaging because it acted as a vehicle for dark comedy and imaginative adventures. It's to sci-fi what Archer was to James Bond. I eventually stopped watching Archer, but I was always more of a fan of the sardonic wit than the raunchy humor so when the latter took more prominence I wasn't enjoying myself anymore. For me, Rick and Morty hasn't stopped being entertaining in the ways it was before.
