I see your point, but I think describing the show as "realistic" is utterly the wrong point to make. Even if Rick's behavior does reflect a real-world occurrence, that doesn't make the show more enjoyable to watch. It would also be realistic for Rick to die of liver problems due to his alcoholism or just be too inebriated to defend himself, but that's not what the audience or creators want to happen so it doesn't.
