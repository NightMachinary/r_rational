  Honestly, I feel like the show is written by people with different, probably incompatible moral outlooks with different conclusions about who Rick is and what he's worth. At the end of "Pick Rick", the therapist calls him out on using his intellect to justify hurting his family. At the end of "Vindicators", they let the villain get away, Rick goes "whatever, I never suffer from lasting negative consequences for my choices anyway", and Morty discards his dominator shirt like he's learned an important lesson when Rick murdered his childhood heroes.

I don't see how these are incompatible. Both episodes show Rick as a horrible human being. The Vindicators were also terrible people and that episode ruined Morty's faith in them. IIRC the Vindicators largely killed themselves by deciding to argue instead of scoring points when failing to score points activated the death trap. Morty already knew Rick was an asshole throughout the episode and lost more trust in him when he got the Noot-Noot video.

Rick gets his way often because the Rick & Morty universe has no karmic justice. It is cynical and emotionally realistic. Rick didn't have a sudden character changing revelation from the therapist's speech because that kind of thing rarely happens in real life. In real life if you made someone with narcissism go to a therapist and listen to a lecture on their faults that person would likely react the same way that Rick did. (without the super-science of course)
