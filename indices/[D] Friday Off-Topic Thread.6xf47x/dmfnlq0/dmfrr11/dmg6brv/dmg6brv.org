I just watched the season 3 premiere and while it was certainly entertaining, I didn't care for the unconditional loyalty the other characters felt for Rick. Literally everyone except Jerry said they would go along with whatever Rick did for whatever reason regardless of what it harm it causes to them or what he gives them in return for their loyalty. I don't get that, but I liked everything else.
