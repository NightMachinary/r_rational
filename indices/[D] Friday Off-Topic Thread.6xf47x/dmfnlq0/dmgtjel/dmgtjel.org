  The only issue I've had with it, though it's become much less of a problem in season 2, is that when it tries to be taken seriously I can't ignore what objectively horrible people all the characters are.

  I get the impression that the series overarching theme is nihilism.

And this is why I just can't watch a lot of TV these days.

  My only regret is that I picked up Rick and Morty just after I started JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, so I fully expect for my brain to melt from the amount of illogical absurdity I'm putting into it at once.

Ssshhhh sshhhh let it happen. This is training in the one true logic of the universe: absurdity and hot-bloodedness. You got through /Gurren Lagann/, you can get through this.

  I'm a couple episodes into Battle Tendency, Joseph has just left for Mexico, and the series continues to get more hilariously over the top with every episode.

Wait until you see him cross-dress to get into the Nazi base where they're keeping the super-vampire ubermenschen from the Stone Ages.

  I can't wait to see more insane fighting moves like the multi-grenade trick.

Crazy tricks in fights basically becomes the theme of Jojo from here on out, if it wasn't already from the beginning.
