For minor accountability purposes, I think I might start writing a werewolf story (length to be determined) and put my vampire story on the backburner for a bit (my coauthor has been unavailable so I figure why not do something that doesn't require her input? And I REALLY want to do something with My Werewolves, because I don't think there's a take quite like them).

I'm trying to work out a plot, so we'll see how we go. Got two main characters (the story may only end up being about one), but I need to work out a conflict that happens. It'll probably be a social conflict. Anyone have any resources for that sort of thing? I'm hoping to write this as rational from the ground up, so especially any (preferably short) rational stories that include social conflict/issues/etc as a central issue.
