Nice. Have you decided what kind of license will be applied to the engine? I didn't see anything about that, but I'm on a phone so I might just be overlooking it.

(If not, then I recommend something at least as stringent as Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike, so people know where the engine came from and have to "pay it forward." It's what I use for a lot of my work.)
