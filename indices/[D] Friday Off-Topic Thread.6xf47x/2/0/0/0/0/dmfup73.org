Engines (and code in general) are a bit interesting when it comes to licensing. On the one hand, yes, credit for my work is nice. On the other hand, you don't put up a billboard in front of your house saying BUILT USING DEWALT POWER TOOLS, and it's a very similar thing.

At the end of the day, a share-alike license (such as the GPL v3) tends to have a stigma of being "infectious"...if you use the GPL code in your project, now the rest of your project is forced to be GPL, which usually precludes being able to successfully commercialize the program, and I don't want that (neither for myself nor others).

I will probably end up using the MIT license as I have done for the majority of the code I have worked on for side projects. It's basically as loose a restriction as one can get without actually releasing it into the public domain: use it, remix it, sell it, whatever, just don't call it yours when it ain't.

EDIT: oh, and thanks for the reminder. I'll put up licensing and a Readme later tonight.
