Hrrm, I hadn't considered the patent angle (I'd mostly been ruminating over copyleft vs permissive). After wikiwalking for a bit, I can see the potential importance of needing to avoid situations where some random pull request results in a patent issue, especially considering Renegade's subject matter. I still don't think it's /likely/ to be an issue, but when the cost of prevention is changing what bytes I stick in a license file, it'd be irresponsible not to. I'll go with Apache.

(Shame that the thing is like ten times longer and harder to read than MIT, tho. I do appreciate brevity over legalese.)

I didn't know about the changing license thing, but that makes sense upon reflection. Thanks for all the input! Learned lots of good info due to your posting.
