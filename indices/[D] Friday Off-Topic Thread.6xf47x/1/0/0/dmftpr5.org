I do like that Morty has had some subtle character development with standing up to Rick and actually following through on the morals he preaches. The turning point for me was the climax from the episode with the Council of Ricks where he organized all the Mortys and decided to save Rick because he believed it was the right thing to do even if he had nothing to gain from it.

To me, that showed that he wouldn't give into the hedonistic nihilism that Rick has. After abandoning their home universe and taking over the lives of alternates who died purely by coincidence, I was worried he would give in to Rick's worldview. Instead, he has proven that he'll stand up for values that he believes in at a personal cost and own up to the harm he causes.
