I recently started watching Rick and Morty for the first time and, for the most part, I like it. I laugh at pretty much all the jokes, the stories parody interesting sci-fi ideas, and the animation is always imaginative. The only issue I've had with it, though it's become much less of a problem in season 2, is that when it tries to be taken seriously I can't ignore what objectively horrible people all the characters are.

I get the impression that the series overarching theme is nihilism. Rick has seen into infinity and found terrible things happening to everyone for no reason, including alternate versions of himself, and decided nothing really matters so there was no point in caring about anything. It's my interpretation that he goes on all these insane adventures to distract himself from that knowledge.

That makes for some hilarious dark comedy, but whenever it does something serious I just feel depressed and that's not what I want from this show. The first episode where they just watch interdimensional TV to escape from existential dread may be my least favorite episode so far because it undercuts the escapism I'm looking for. I legitimately lost sleep over the scene where Morty was almost raped.

To be clear, I like literally everything else about the show except the drama. It's just when it comes back to elements like Morty's dysfunctional family that it loses me because they're all morons and assholes. His parents are incapable of resolving the problems their family has, so whenever the show focuses on that for something other than comedy I feel dissatisfied. I've made it as far as the car battery episode.

My only regret is that I picked up Rick and Morty just after I started JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, so I fully expect for my brain to melt from the amount of illogical absurdity I'm putting into it at once. I'm a couple episodes into Battle Tendency, Joseph has just left for Mexico, and the series continues to get more hilariously over the top with every episode. I can't wait to see more insane fighting moves like the multi-grenade trick.
