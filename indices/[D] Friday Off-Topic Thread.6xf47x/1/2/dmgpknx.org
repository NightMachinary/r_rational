I don't agree with the others that the characters are "progressing" over the different seasons, especially not "progressing for the better".

They're changing, they're exploring new situations, sometimes they react differently, but they've mostly stayed the same on average since day 1. The only consistent change I've seen is Morty becoming gradually more jaded, more violent, and more willing to hurt and manipulate people for his own ends. That's... I mean, that's valid character development, but it's pretty ugly and sad.

Honestly, I feel like the show is written by people with different, probably incompatible moral outlooks with different conclusions about who Rick is and what he's worth. At the end of "Pick Rick", the therapist calls him out on using his intellect to justify hurting his family. At the end of "Vindicators", they let the villain get away, Rick goes "whatever, I never suffer from lasting negative consequences for my choices anyway", and Morty discards his dominator shirt like he's learned an important lesson when Rick /murdered his childhood heroes/.

I don't know. One the one hand, the show is clearly written by people who know what abusive behavior looks like, and it /is/ self-aware about the hypocrisy sometimes, but it... never really addresses it? The therapist episode is the closest it went to that. Honestly, it'd have been fine if the episode ended with the family in the car, after the therapist speech; but then we have a post-credit scene where Rick is awesome again, and says "That is the reason I don't go to therapy", and it feels like the whole episode was for nothing.

Rick gets his way too often is what I'm saying.
