I qualified by saying emotionally realistic. You obviously can't call it realistic as a whole when guy turns himself into a pickle ninja to get out of therapy. Rick probably replaces his liver semi-regularly, has a robotic replacement or fixes the damage with nanobots. (though Ricks presumably die a lot in other timelines just not the one we are following because Ricks seems to have a poor self-preservation instinct in general)

Part of the thematic elements of Rick & Morty is that it doesn't pull punches. Making bad things happen to bad people to satisfy viewers sense of justice goes entirely against the thematic underpinnings of the show. The universe has no sense of justice, religions are arbitrary and misguided, you need to take control of your own destiny.
