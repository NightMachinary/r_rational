The crossdressing was...oddly underwhelming. Maybe it's because I knew the scene was coming, but I cringed rather than laughed.

[[https://youtu.be/SJTbNiFcbzg][SuperEyepatchWolf laid out the differences between Jonathan and Joseph's fighting styles in this video]].

Jonathan was capable of thinking tactically, but ultimately overwhelmed his opponents through brute force and gentlemanly bravado. Joseph, on the other hand, is able to predict his opponents' moves and misdirect their attention so he can pull sleight of hand tricks. This shift in focus towards mental abilities is what led to the introduction of Stands.
