In season 3, Rick has been directly and explicitly called out on his behavior at least once, and indirectly addressed by the plot two or three times in ways that weren't just laughed off as black comedy. Rick so far has been unwilling to change, but I think this season is building up to some actual character development. The drama has gotten darker and more intense, but in turn I think there is hope for Rick and his family. So if the drama (and resulting disruption to the escapism) is too much for you, yeah season 3 isn't going to be your thing, but i think there is a light at the end of the tunnel.
