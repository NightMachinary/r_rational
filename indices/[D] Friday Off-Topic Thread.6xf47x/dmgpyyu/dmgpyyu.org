Ofcourse as always i am late to the thread because i usually dont see it nor seek it but i wanted to ask do any of you watch anime ?

Lately i have caught up to "Re:creators" and i am beyond frustrated with the show that could have been really great. Writers like urobuchi gen and that author of black lagoon also the music score was done by hiroyuki sawano. It had potential to be a truly game changing serie but the amount of stupidity i see there sometimes is...baffling

thoughts ?
