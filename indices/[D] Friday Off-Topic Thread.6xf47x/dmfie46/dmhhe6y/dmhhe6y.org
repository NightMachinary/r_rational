I'm really glad you brought this up. I think that what happened is they are unable to maintain the depth of GRRM without the full book for guidance. Who can read his mind? Also, we don't have the manuscript ourselves, so before we could see what was skipped and not feel as though we missed something. What defined Game of Thrones for me was its unapologetic honesty, I never once felt the author cared about me, or the charecters. No favorites, almost as though they were independent entities, and we were allowed to judge ourselves. Now, i feel that the charecters suddenly lost that independence, and are trapped in a predetermined plot? I can blather on forever on and on, as I love the premise...i truly hope it is just a fluke, and that the next season is more of before.

On an aside, whats your definition of nerd?
