Yes, this is all troubling. It reeks of dues ex machina. I think that they should have made an rpg for the directors and writers, and just let it flow, with grrm as the guide. Why does the story have to have a plan? Break the chains of the narrative. More then the logistics, i felt the activitoes of the charecters this last season was almost vulgar in the way it didn't feel authentic. The interaction between baelish, arya and sansa? I felt it was goofy. Other things for me that felt wrong was the imps acting around danaerys, and cersei losing a lot of her poise.\\
To me all of the performers lost something, to an extent, and I think before they had a sense of purpose and were able to merge with their charecters. Now, i think they instead are being directed as what to feel.
