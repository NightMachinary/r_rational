No spoilers, but I found the most recent season of /Game of Thrones/ to be a real let-down, mostly because the show's persistent problems with accurately depicting travel times have come to a head. One of the directors has admitted that [[http://news.avclub.com/game-of-thrones-director-admits-the-show-s-timeline-is-1798346260][they're focusing on the emotional experience]] (spoilers in link) and fudging the timeline to make things work, hoping that no one will notice.

I've gotten into a lot of arguments with people, mostly friends-of-friends on Facebook. There's not much that hits my nerd rage button harder than "it's got dragons, why would anyone think it was going to be realistic". The other argument I've heard a lot is "nerds just want a show where nothing happens for the sake of realism", which is obviously not the case. It's that I don't want things to happen in defiance of logic and the established rules because the writer couldn't make the plot work within the universe that they established.

(I am almost certainly preaching to the choir here.)
