Furthermore, the emotional focus makes me bonkers. Before, the emotions were apparent, but they were a driving force in the plot. It was never "this happened because the charecters are emotional" it was more that the charecters are human, therefore their emotions influence the decision. Here we see the emotion is the decisision and the end state, which for me is clumsy.
