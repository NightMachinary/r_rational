Well, the real problem is that the writers don't actually /care,/ nor does GRRM himself (he's quoted as saying that you should put down the ruler and stopwatch and just enjoy the story). That takes a story that's generally pretty grounded and pulls the rug out from under it, because now it's not that the army starves because their supply lines are cut and they need too much food on a forced march, it's that Plot Demands It Be So. And once that's the case, the writers are no longer thinking about what it means to travel for months on end with someone, or the pressures of half rations, or the movements of fleets, they're instead focused on what best manipulates the emotions of the audience.

It's not just the penultimate episode of the season that's at fault, it's most of the others as well. Troop and fleet movements don't make sense, they just /happen/ because the writers needed some drama. All the logistics gets filled in after the fact to make the plot work (which was basically what Star Trek did with their technobabble).

The show (and to a lesser extent, the books) was never good about any of this, but now that the plotlines have converged it's harder to hide behind "these things aren't happening at the same time", mostly because they /are/ happening at the same time.
