I don't remember it being an issue for me in the books, mainly because it wasn't used for any singular parties benefit or loss, and also most of the characters are privledged so it would ignore much of the plebian problems, which I guess I expected. I think what got me more then the logistics is the ice guy that threw that lance...that broke my heart because it was so forced. What this season really did for me that caused the biggest dissapointment, is that I am no longer emmersed at a micro level, enjoying each charecter, each interaction. Now I feel like Bran, I see everything, I know all, but I've lost my humanity and capacity to care in the moment.
