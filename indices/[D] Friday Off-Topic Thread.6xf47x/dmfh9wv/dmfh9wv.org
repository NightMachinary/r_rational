[[http://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/6wscnf/vice_pepe_the_frogs_creator_gets_altright/dmavm3n/?context=9][An interesting idea]] for a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Redwall/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=10][/Redwall/ fanfiction]] story

(Funnily enough, the linked story focuses on /consensual erotic/ hypnosis, and has rather little to do with /coercion or friendship/, IIRC, despite its title.)
