Yes, the hope is that once I've washed my hands of Renegade I can take the bulk of XGEF with me, and I'm building it accordingly.

Text only games should be quite doable, and in fact the first several iterations of combat will be command line before I futz about with visuals. The idea is to keep the "server" and "client" as separate from one another as possible, so how the client renders the window ought to be mostly immaterial to the server. There will be a handful of soft exceptions (such as defining GUI elements), but for the most part the server (and XGEF in general) will be mostly hands-off in that regard.
