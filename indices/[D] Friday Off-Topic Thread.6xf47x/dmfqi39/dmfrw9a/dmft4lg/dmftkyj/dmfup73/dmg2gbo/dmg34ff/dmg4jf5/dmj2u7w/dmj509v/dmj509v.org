I disagree with but strongly support this decision - it's your project and you can use whatever license you want to :)

Final notes:

- If you switch from MIT to (L)GPL, you still have to retain the text of the MIT license unless all copyright holders agree (ie all contributors, if any)
- You can trivially switch from (L)GPL to MIT or any other license - including none at all - with the agreement of all copyright holders.
- I would use the Apache License over MIT - they're basically identical except for patent clauses. (because the MIT license was written before software could be patented in the USA, a terrible decision with appalling consequences)
