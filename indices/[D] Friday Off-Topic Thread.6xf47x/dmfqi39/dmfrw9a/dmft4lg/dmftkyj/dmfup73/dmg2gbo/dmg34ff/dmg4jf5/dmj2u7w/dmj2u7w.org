After chewing on this for a couple days, I think I'm going to stick with MIT. I mean, I highly doubt that this is going to end up used in any huge capacity by anyone but me, and if the number and type of arguments I've had concerning its design are any indication, it's not going to be super popular with other programmers (doesn't help that I'm not S-class in coding either). But in the event that someone comes along and loves it just enough to make a private fork, then more power to them. They're probably going to change a bunch of shit I don't like, so who cares if they don't rerelease it?

But putting aside the likely outcome, worst case as pertains to licensing is that EA or someone comes along and likes what I've built, so they take it, build on it, and use it in Battlefield40k or whatever and never release the modifications they made. I don't really get fanfare for writing a crucial portion of a AAA game, and they never have to give back nor put in the man hours to build it from scratch. This is the same practical result that would happen with just about any other open source licensing, too; what, am I going to sue them for violating the GPL? Would make a great story but not one I'd like to experience.

Plus, with MIT I can always change my mind later on, but once I've used a GPL variant I'm pretty well stuck with it.
