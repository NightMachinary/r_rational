I was kind of expecting the movie to go into potential AI problems more (in a simplified, family-friendly way, obviously). To be specific, I was expecting the moment where he scans the entire city to lead into a hilarious scene where he tries to fix the medical problems of literally everyone in the entire city, and Hiro can't stop him and get him back to the main task because healing people overrides it.
