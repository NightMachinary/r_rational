I like this idea, although it's worth noting that Baymax is a PERSONAL healthcare companion. His primary directive is to ensure the health and well-being of his assigned patient. On the assumption that "bedside manner" is something that he's been programmed to observe, fluttering around the city performing ninja-like feats of sudden medicine before moving on is certainly not conducive to giving his assigned patient respect and attention.
