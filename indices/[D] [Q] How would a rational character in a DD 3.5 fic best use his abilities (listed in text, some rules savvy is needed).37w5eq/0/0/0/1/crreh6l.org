  And yeah, I guess the rules preclude that use of the Image spells because ... reasons.

Mostly because it makes it such that illusion magic is effectively more useful than some of the higher-level "real" spells.

Which is a problem if you /want/ those real spells in your world-setting. I always just thought it would be cool to have a setting where illusions are the /only/ "magic" in the world---but where they have no nonsensical restrictions.
