I just now realize that's ambiguous, but I think the "size of the effect" just refers to the largest object you can "create", not the range (which is 400 ft. + 40 ft./level, and centered on the caster.)

Drat, you're right about falling damage. You could drop magic items on someone, maybe? And yeah, I guess the rules preclude that use of the /Image/ spells because ... reasons. (You could wear an illusory uniform, though.)
