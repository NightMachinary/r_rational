Got this from HPN20, but: Silent Image and Minor Image can be reused, as long as nothing distracts you from maintaining it. Just have it "show" the "image" of something really small on your person, until you need it again. There's literally no reason to dismiss it.

(Unfortunately, this doesn't work with Ghost Sound.)

Prestigitation lasts an hour, and it's pretty versatile. So every time you cast it, you're a minor miracleworker for an hour. It can "slowly lift" a pound of nonliving material, which I /think/ can deal damage when it falls even though the spell itself can't deal damage. It could also be used to fake pretty much anything "crude, artificial and delicate", or which could be passed off as such. Also, it can colour living things, for what that's worth (which is a fair bit), although it wears off.

There are a fair few tricks you can pull with Prestigitation, actually; might be worth seeing if you can find a pre-made list of them.

Dancing Lights explicitly mimics a torch or lantern, so it's pretty much designed for leading enemies astray or faking troop movements/distractions at night.

Anyway, the big one: you can use the /Image/ spells to fake ... pretty much anything about you. Just stand inside the image. However, I'm not sure how this interacts with the /Bluff/ skill if you're in a D&D-rules 'verse.
