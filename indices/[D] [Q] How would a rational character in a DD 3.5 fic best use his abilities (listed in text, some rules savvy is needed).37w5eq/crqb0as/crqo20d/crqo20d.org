Unfortunately, Silent Image is limited to the size of the effect ((4 + level) 10ft cubes), so you can't carry it with you very far.

re: falling damage, a one pound object deals 1d6 per 70 feet fallen, but Prestidigitation has a range of only 10 feet, so you'd have to start over a cliff or something.

Also, the last one doesn't work because "Figments cannot make something seem to be something else." (PHB p173)
