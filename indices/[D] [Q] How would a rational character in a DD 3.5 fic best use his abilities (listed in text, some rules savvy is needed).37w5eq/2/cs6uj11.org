Do a "Find/Replace" maneuver in your head for "cool CG effects in a magic show, movie or video game" and substitute it for your game.

Quick example: If you have your character sneaking up on a guard perched in a castle turret, it'd be really easy to create a silent image of precisely the same scene (i.e. a floating image curtain) halfway between you and the target, assuming you've been up in the turret before and know what it looks like from their angle. You could insert the scene of a charging army, or a normal spring day or whatever you like.

Also, you could play a movie in a window. Play with people's expectations. Make someone see the glimpse of someone they once knew in a mirror. That sort of thing.
