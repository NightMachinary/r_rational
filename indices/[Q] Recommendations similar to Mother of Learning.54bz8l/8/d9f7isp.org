Hi! I know I'm late but there's a story that I want to recommend. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5166693/1/Scorpion-s-Disciple][Scorpion's Disciple]] It's written by the author of Mother of Learning. It's a fanfic of Naruto though but it's really well written. The last chapter might annoy/anger/frustrate you but I think it's still worth reading.
