I recommend RWBY if you like action anime with a character-focused story. I think of it as similar to Soul Eater, except I actually like the characters, setting, and humor. It's not perfect or rational, especially at the beginning, but it's more mature and intelligent than it seems. It's nothing profound, but I enjoy it.

It's still a goofy story about teenage girls in colorful outfits wielding crazy weapons going to a school for monster hunters, but if you don't mind the inherent silliness of that idea you should check it out. Just make sure to binge it, since it's written and paced like a normal anime despite the short episodes.
