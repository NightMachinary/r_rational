Hey, thanks. I actually read a decent amount of LNs and WN, so I've heard of I'm a Spider So What and have considered reading it before, I just haven't been able to convince myself that a spider can be a relatable main character (or do anything interesting from a human perspective without a copout like a transformation ability). Would you mind trying to convince me to read it?

Also, is canon RWBY any good? Worth putting on my "plan to watch" list on MAL?
