I feel the burning desire to recommend [[http://www.all-night-laundry.com/][All Night Laundry]] despite the fact that the only thing it has in common are time-travel shenanigans.

[[https://armaell-library.net/novel/i-m-a-spider-so-what][I'm a Spider So What]] is a nice story where the protagonist reincarnates as a spider in a RPG world. It's pretty good due to how it subverts the common tropes for protagonist reincarnating into a Gamer Mary Sue. [[http://blastron01.tumblr.com/post/150808855361/im-a-spider-so-what-107][Here's]] the link for online translations of later chapters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11019074/2/Gamer-Arc][Gamer Arc]] is a good RWBY fanfiction with Juane as a Gamer, but is not ridiculously overpowered as in The Games We Play.

In fact, here's the fanfiction [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Title-The-Gamer/119494/][collection]] of all RWBY fanfictions involving the Gamer power in some fashion.
