I've tried finding the infinite loops before but I can't never find the stories themselves, and when I do it seems like some kind of weird group roleplaying instead of a productive story with a planned ending.

Am I doing anything wrong? I /have/ found some snippets that are interesting but I can't find anything that ties it all together into a sane storyline.
