Most of the different 'universes' are pretty self-contained, really. As in, I can give pretty good assurance that if you just pick a source work you know well and start reading the first compilation, you'll catch on pretty quickly. Sometimes you'll find someone wrote a snippet focusing on someone you don't know, and you really lose nothing from skipping that apart from the snippet itself.

Heck, you don't even need to be familiar with the sourcework. I'm pretty sure I once decided to take a look at one of the universes where I had had no interactions with its canon, and came away with a respectable understanding of the source material.

As a side note, Innortal's a funny case. He inspired the genre, but his works aren't really in the greater style of the genre. They have worth in their own right, but don't expect them to be much like the compilations.
