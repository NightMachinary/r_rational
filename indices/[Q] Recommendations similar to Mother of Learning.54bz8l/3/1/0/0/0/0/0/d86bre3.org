I haven't read most of those, but I know Pokemon is a pretty representative one. It's the one I read the most, and from TV Tropes you'll find [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10217129/1/The-Infinite-Loops-Pokemon-Loops][this]] compilation of it.

Really, my advice is to just take a look and start reading. It's not as complex a situation as you think.
