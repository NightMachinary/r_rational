can you give me a recommended reading order or something like that? i went to the tv tropes page which seemed to point to innortal's fanfiction.net page going back to like 2004 and im unsure where to start. Are they all self contained stories or do i need to read them in order? I'm generally unsure how to proceed, especially because i only recognize like half of the sourceworks and have only personally viewed/read like 3 or 4 of the sourceworks.
