Yeah, I have heard quite a lot of bad things about it here, to the point where I really don't have a very good impression of the series. That said though, its not like I read rational fiction exclusively, so I may give it a chance if I exhaust my backlog. How far into the series would you recommend reading before dropping it if I'm still not enjoying it by that point?
