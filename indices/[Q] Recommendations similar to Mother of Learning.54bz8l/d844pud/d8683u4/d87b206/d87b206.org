Yes. It's been a while (maybe a few years?) since I read the series, but I still recall a feeling of frustration over how badly some characters get screwed over.

That said it is very good and VERY lengthy. The world building is excellent, the characters are interesting, and the powers (and their use and limitations) are extremely creative. I definitely recommend it, but don't expect it to be sunshine and rainbows.
