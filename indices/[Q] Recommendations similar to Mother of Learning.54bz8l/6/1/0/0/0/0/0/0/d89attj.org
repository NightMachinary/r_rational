Yeah, though honestly the only Arthur treatment(s) I've read also involved time traviling Sailor Mars. >.< I consider my a fan of the fantasy genre but had a strong aversion to reading things that felt too..strongly recommended I guess.

But it's about tone? Feel? Pacing maybe? Yeah I think pacing might be the biggest difference.
