Yeah, Inuyasha is a very different style. Much more focused on character relationships, emotion, etc. rather than power progression. It's still got some shonen characteristics, but it's less typical of the genre, imo.

When you refer to the older version of romance, do you mean things like the Arthurian legends and such?
