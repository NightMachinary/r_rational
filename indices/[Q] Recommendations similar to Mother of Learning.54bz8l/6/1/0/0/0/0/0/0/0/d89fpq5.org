I can understand wanting to stay away from things that are too popular, but it's easy to miss good stuff that way.

Pacing is definitely different in those older stories, and I'd say that the story structure is often very different in general. It's been a while since I've read any medieval literature, but most of the ones I recall tended to focus on the current protagonist being an exceptional example of humanity. They often didn't follow the same literary arc structure that modern novels tend to.
