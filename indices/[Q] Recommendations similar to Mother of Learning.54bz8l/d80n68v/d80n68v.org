The [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheInfiniteLoops][Infinite]] [[http://infinite-loops.wikia.com/wiki/Infinite_Loops_Wiki][Loops]] might have what you're looking for, with some looking. Basic premise is /something/ happened to the machine that maintains the multiverse, and to stabilize things the various universes of the multiverse (as in, our world's fiction) enter time loops, each centered around an 'anchor' that is aware of every loop in that universe. Other characters from such universes eventually being looping some of the time and characters can wind up in other universes for a loop, but the core premise is that the loops won't end in a conceivable time frame, so all of the characters just have to find ways to pass the time.

A lot of it looks at characters after they've really hit their stride and the only possible challenge to their power are other loopers, so it's fairly character-interaction based, especially since most loopers trend to being relatively benign to each other, but there are also stories written about characters just entering the time loop for the first time, which you might like.

I also once read a Ranma 1/2 story called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/764256/1/Right-Moments][Right Moments]] which sort of fits the bill. Ranma enters a one-day time loop and learns more and more techniques and gets more and more powerful and knowledgeable, with appropriately more difficult challenges he decides to take on. Ranma generally goes it alone for most of the story, though, and the core time loop elements start to break down (long-term safety, multiple attempts) when he spends more and more time interacting with the spirit world. Even still, I found it a good time loop story for such an unsaturated genre.
