I think I remember seeing those disagreements play out, and was worried that the concept of Worm Loops would dry up if all that it had to its name was a large battle about how the setting was supposed to be. It's good to see, at least, that the ball got rolling anyways.

Personally, I think if we could have agreed on two major camps we could have justified a weird situation where the Worm Loops were effectively two different main universes on Yggdrasil, where maybe it was and is a perfectly ordinary branch that got 'copied' to the junk space, in which Taylor wound up getting admin power. You would have two Taylors and other Worm Loopers, but that could be played out as an amusing quirk instead of a canon-breaking mess. But hey, if this works, it works.
