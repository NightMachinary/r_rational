I actually am a good deal more judgemental of the style of the work (and of fanfiction in general) than this post lets on. I wanted to give a helpful recommendation based on the story's qualities though, rather than on just my reaction to them. Not knowing OP's opinion on fanfiction, I thought that letting that judgment come through would be counter-productive.

Plus I got to vent all about it a few weeks ago, so the judgment isn't still stewing inside.
