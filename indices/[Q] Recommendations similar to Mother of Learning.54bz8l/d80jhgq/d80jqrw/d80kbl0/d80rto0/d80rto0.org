Each time someone warns about sex in that book I wonder whether I was really paying attention to the story, because almost no sex scenes come to mind when I'm thinking about Time Braid. Time travel, gradually getting separated from peers, mind control, gradually getting more thorough understanding of how magic works, etc --- these themes /do/ come to mind, but there's almost no sex in the memories.
