l recommend [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][The Gods Are Bastards]]. While it doesn't focus much on a protagonist getting more power (for one because there are many of those, but also because they're quite powerful already), it does involve the characters becoming more knowledgeable (one of the main settings is a University after all) and I think it is done quite realistically. The characters not only learn magic, but also history, politics, society and about themselves.

It's my favorite web serial among the ones I'm currently following.
