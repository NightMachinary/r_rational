This was pretty good, thanks for the suggestion. It does in fact start a bit slow and then picks up as it goes. Also, the main plot thread that begins within the first few pages of the story is very rarely addressed or progressed but the rest of the story is good too.

Also also, I don't think the title fits the story well--most of the gods seem to be trying their best and not actively being bastards or aren't doing anything meaningful. I think a better title would be "Arachne's webs" because that's a huge theme in the story.
