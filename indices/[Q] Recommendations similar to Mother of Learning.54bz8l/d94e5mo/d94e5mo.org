The "Schooled in Magic" series by Christopher Nutall. It's not rationalist but it is definitely one of my favorite works of rational fiction. The setting is a realistic take on what a medieval fantasy world would actually be like, the characters are realistic, relatable and often smart. No one ever holds the idiot ball and even the main antagonists of the series are not just doing things for the evulz like they seem to be at first.

Unfortunately there are a bunch of people on this sub who have given exaggerated, invalid or simply untrue criticisms of the series. It doesn't make sense to me at all that a work like Time Braid gets as much praise as it does and yet the Schooled in Magic series gets nothing but derision. The Schooled in Magic series is at least as good as Time Braid if not a lot better. I have read and enjoyed most of Time Braid as well as the entire Schooled in Magic series so far, so I do actually know what I'm talking about here. Both are well written and enjoyable, and it doesn't make sense for people to say that Time Braid is decently rational fic and not Schooled in Magic.
