  Edit: I think I underestimated how many responses would be fanfics. Unfortunately, I'm just not familiar with enough of the common fanfic canons to read many of them.

As a comment: I don't think unfamiliarity with canon is a problem in a well-written fanfic. If it's done well enough you likely won't even recognize that it's fanfic -- for example, it could be argued that Mother of Learning owes more than a passing nod to D&D. The city of Cyoria bears strong resemblance to [[http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Waterdeep][Waterdeep]], with the dungeon under it mapping well to the [[http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Undermountain][Undermountain]]. It's been quite a while since I finished MoL, but as far as I recall the magic systems (clerics / wizards / psionicists) map well onto the D&D systems. Many of the monsters referenced were clear analogues from D&D. Obviously some of this is simply cross-pollination between fantasy tropes, D&D, and mythology. Still, the similarities are strong. Chances are good that you are not intimately familiar with the Forgotten Realms canon, yet you clearly enjoyed MoL despite that.

Some recommendations I would make, all of which are fanfic and none of which (in my opinion) require familiarity with canon:

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/][Dungeon Keeper Ami]] A brainy magical girl (Ami) ends up in a fantasy world and accidentally bonds with an evil artifact. All the good people assume she's evil and fight her, and she has to defend herself without breaking her own moral code. There's a moderately uncomfortable amount of "clothes fell off" considering that the protagonist is 14 at the start of the story, but it's not too bad. The power levels increase gradually but significantly and it's highly rational.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine][Dreaming of Sunshine]] A young woman from the modern world wakes up in a land of kung fu battle wizards and needs to survive. Her personal magic levels aren't much compared to those around her, but she leverages them into major power in very believable ways that often involve the proper application of explosions. The relationships and characterizations are especially good.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark][Lighting up the Dark]] Written by my quest co-author [[/u/Velorien]], this is the story of a young ninja who is /not/ an idiot and uses his power in very munchkinly ways to beat significantly stronger opponents. It's smart, funny when it chooses to be, and the characterizations are excellent.\\
- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest-story-only.24793/][Marked for Death]] /cough, mild self-promotion, cough/ This is a quest that [[/u/Velorien]] and I write. (If 'quest' is unfamiliar to you, as it was to me, it means that the readers vote on what the protagonist should do next, but the authors define the rules of the world and choose the actual path of the plot.) I've linked the story-only thread, but feel free to [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][join the discussion]] as well.

Side comment: [[/u/FuguOfAnotherWorld]] (aka Jackercracks) was a co-GM on the Marked for Death quest until he got eaten by +a grue+ the video game Stellaris. (Come back, man! We miss you.) He writes [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11402847/1/Roll-the-Dice-on-Fate][Roll the Dice on Fate]] which I like very much but I suspect leans too heavily on canon to fit what you're looking for. Still, I didn't want him to feel like I was ignoring him.
