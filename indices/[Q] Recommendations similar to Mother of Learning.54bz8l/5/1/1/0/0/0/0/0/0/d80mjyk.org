Fine. I'll concede that I was wrong. Still, these segments are very easily skipped over. I read /Time Braid/ for the action and the worldbuilding, and largely skim the passages to which you're referring, which is the reason for which I apparently forgot about so many.

/Time Braid/ does not lose its value when its lewdness is ignored by the reader.
