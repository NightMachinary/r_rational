It does a good job doing a slow, realistic-seeming increase in power. It's also very nice that it's complete. In that sense, it has what you're looking for. However, I didn't enjoy the writing style or tone as much as I like /Mother of Learning/'s. MoL feels like professional quality. Not on the level of the best writers out there, but about even with more skilled new authors. I've certainly read worse in books that I purchased.

On the other hand, several aspects of TB (including the sex and the [[#s][surprise worldbuilding and character details introduced partway through]] felt very amateurish. Mostly in delivery, but also partly in conception. The interpersonal relationships read like they were written by a teenager, albeit one with good grammar and some experience with internal struggle. If copyright could be ignored and the story were eligible for professional publishing, I expect it would need a solid editing and some cuts first.

On the whole, I liked it a lot less than I expected to, given the high regard I saw it given on this sub. I kept expecting it to get better, and while it did in some ways, it didn't in others. I don't often abandon books or stories, but I also have pretty high standards, so I might have if I'd known how it would go. That said, it does have its good points, and others clearly weren't bothered as much as I was by the style issues. I expect that it comes down to the matter of fanfiction. This isn't a story that just happens to be about Naruto characters, the way /The Waves Arisen/ felt. It's fanfiction through and through. If that doesn't bother you, you'll probably enjoy it a lot. If it does, you'll probably have the same reservations that I had.

[Edit: For what it's worth, I didn't have much familiarity with the canon when I read it, and I was able to understand what was going on pretty well. YMMV.]
