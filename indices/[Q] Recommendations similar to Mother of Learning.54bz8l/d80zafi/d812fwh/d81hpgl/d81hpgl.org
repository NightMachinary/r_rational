The main character in I'm a Spider was originally a human with a pretty unique writing style. It's important you find a good translation, because she speaks in a distinctive way with a lot of idioms and stuff that don't translate well unless your translator is pretty good. Here's an example of her style:

  Oh ho! All three meters went up by two, as did Offense and Defense, and Magic Power and Resistance went up by one. But uh, hey, Speed, what are you doing? I remember you being 348 before, and then you gained... twenty one points...? Isn't that a little weird? The other stats were a little more reserved about it... aren't you trying a little too hard? ...Offense, Defense, why did you go up the same amount? You're leaving Magic Power and Resistance in the dust, you know... Uuuuunbelievable...

And:

  After my successful defeat of the first squadron, the wasps started attacking continuously. I wiped out the second squad they sent at me without any trouble, but after that, things started getting a little hairy. They started sending multiple squads at once. No waaaaay! I mean, this is the right thing for the wasps to be doing, but, please look at it from my perspective! I don't want this many wasps to come! I'm still totally safe in my nest, but there's this constant feeling of pressure, you know! What am I supposed to do about all of these wasps constantly buzzing around me, day and night?

The translator who I think does the best job is blastron01. The passages above are taken from his translation. His translated version only has up through chapter 106, but is the highest quality and captures the tone and quality of the original writing in a way I think others (including Turb0's) do not. You can read it here: [[http://blastron01.tumblr.com/kumoko-contents][(link)]].

Here's an example of blastron1's translation notes:

  Translator's notes for this chapter:

    1. These lines are referencing the opening lines of I Am a Cat, a famous Japanese novel. “I am a cat. As yet, I have no name.”
    2. There's joke here that's difficult to translate directly: the protagonist says “I can't live a normal life”, then remarks that “life” (人生) contains the kanji for “person” (人), and that it would be more accurate to swap that out for “spider” (蜘蛛) to make “spider-life” (蜘蛛生).

This should give you an idea as to the quality of the translation. Very good quality.
