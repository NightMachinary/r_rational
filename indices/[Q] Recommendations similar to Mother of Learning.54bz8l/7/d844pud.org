For me, the training and growth of a character is by far the most satisfying part of fantasy. Mother of learning is likely to go down as my favorite book ever so it seems like our interests align. Here are books that I've liked based on the above qualifications.

1) firehurler. Indie fantasy book by a redditor that is incredibly well written and has a lot gong on. though the main character starts out with a ton of raw power, he gradually learns how to control it and how to use it.

2) lightbringer series. Book 4 of 5 is coming out really soon but it is well written and has a solid sense of progression of the main character

3) the waves arisen, Naruto fiction. Does run into the issue of making other characters obsolete, though not entirely. Very good gradual power up, though you probably want to have seen some Naruto.

4) Pokemon, origin of species. Unfinished currently updating rational fiction. Very well done, probably my second favorite currently updating web serial.

5) wheel of time. Certainly not rational fiction but if you haven't read it, well the main character goes from human power to good level without overshadowing the rest of the cast. There are like 2 to 5 secondary main characters who also power up in similar fashion. It may not be the most gradual power up, there are several jumps in power but in the end when he reaches his final level you feel like he has transcended to a completely new level both in power but also in his ability to deal with people and influence the story. It's incredibly satisfying after such much suffering and work though the work tends to be of thematic significance than actual training.

6) I haven't read this, I'm trying to finish off a few series before committing to this, but Worm is the obvious next thing I need to read.
