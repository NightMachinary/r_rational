the second one would probably be my recommendation.

book one is basically 'farm boys of destiny goes on a quest to mount doom with female gandalf'

book two they all go their separate ways and do different things which is basically what the rest of the series is about, a bunch of POV characters all over the world doing crazy shit and trying to prepare the world for the last battle.
