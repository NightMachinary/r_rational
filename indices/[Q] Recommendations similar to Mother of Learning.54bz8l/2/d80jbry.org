I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][natural 20]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/][2 year emperor]] are similar, though natural 20 is on hiatus.

Oh and also worm's pretty good if you haven't read it (not really fantasy but there are superpowers and the gradual increase in the power of the MC). And the [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3998737/chapters/8979811?view_adult=true][fanfiction]] that stemmed from that as well. Oh and also [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play.306381/][the gamer vs RWBY]] was great; it's long as hell but unfinished.

There's also [[http://thezombieknight.blogspot.com/2013/04/page-1.html][Zombie knight]] that's sort of like this, though the powering up is a bit bumpy.

[[http://brainchip.thecomicseries.com/][Transdimensional brain chip]] is worth a mention, though it's not a fantasy setting.

Re: Your edit, [[/u/Cuz_Im_TFK]]: except for natural 20 which requires harry potter knowledge and has some dnd tropes but knowledge of them isn't needed, everything I linked is stuff I enjoyed while knowing nothing or nearly nothing about the original stories/universes (2ye, rwby vs gamer) or are original fiction (worm, zombie knight, transdimensional brain chip).
