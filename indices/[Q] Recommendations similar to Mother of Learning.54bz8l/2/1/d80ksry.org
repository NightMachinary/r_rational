[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play-disk-five.341621/][I have good news for you]].

I do think that the story is great even by rather strict rationalistic standards and that the worldbuilding it has is stellar, but if OP is looking for a vaguely realistic power curve then that TGWP can't provide. A lot of the story revolves around the fact that the main character's superpower is utterly broken.
