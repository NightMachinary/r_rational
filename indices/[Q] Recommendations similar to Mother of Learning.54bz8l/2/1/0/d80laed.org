I do not see at all how "the MC finally got inside the plot device" is by any stretch of the imagination finishing the story. If anything, the author cut off at the very top of the climax.

It's great and very lengthy and what's there is satisfying but the story doesn't definitively explain any of the plot hooks even at the very end.
