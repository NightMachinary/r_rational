My problem with Naruto (and I think you are mostly correct about Hero Academia) is that using the Kyuubi never is actually a problem? Like the two times that Naruto goes hard with the Kyuubi both don't really seem to cause actual problems, just the vague telling of problems.

He uses it once against Jiraiya, that we don't see, and Jiraiya is like, "Oh now I have a scar, but its fine" (not a direct quote). So that really isn't a problem (to me).

Second time is against Orochimaru on the bridge with Kabuto (they are trying to see who the spy is or something right after Shippuden starts). And again, like, people escaped and it fucked up the plans a bit, but mostly it seemed like having the Kyuubi was really useful to for stopping Orochimaru.

It never, to me, felt like an actual problem. Like something that I saw cause him pain and problems. We are told a lot about how it made his childhood tougher and stuff, but it just doesn't seem like it even comes close to outweighing all of the positives.
