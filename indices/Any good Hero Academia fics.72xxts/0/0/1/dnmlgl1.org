I know nothing about Bleach, but the way it works in Naruto and HeroAca is that the protagonist has a trump card they can use in emergencies, but it too risky to rely on. This allows every conflict to have an arc where the hero is on the ropes until they tap into their "inner strength", which is a fundamentally sound formula for getting people emotionally invested in the action.

It's an archetypical structure for telling a story about an underdog, but one that delivers on what an underdog story needs to. Even HJPEV had his "dark side" that he could call upon, and it worked there just as well as it does in shonen. HeroAca isn't a masterpiece, but it's fun escapism with just enough depth to keep me coming back and talking about it.
