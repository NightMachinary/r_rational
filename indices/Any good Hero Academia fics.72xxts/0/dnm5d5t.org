Erased Potential is pretty good. Young Deku tracks down Eraserhead and begs him to train him, reasoning that Aizawa basically fights Quirkless. He basically attempts to mimic that style by leveraging his analysis and prediction abilities to understand his enemies well enough to cancel out their special advantage just like Aizawa does. Pretty interesting, almost feels more true to Deku's character, instead of being given the most OP superpower on a silver platter, he works to become a hero without it.
