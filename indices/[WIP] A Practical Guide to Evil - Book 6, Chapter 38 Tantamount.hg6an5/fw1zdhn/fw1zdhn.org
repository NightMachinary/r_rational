As expected the Mirror Knight's trial posed a lot more trouble than the Hunted Magician's, leaving everyone feeling a bit unsatisfied. I fear for the Red Axe's trial next chapter.

On another note, it's nice to see that Cat and Yannu are getting along, and are managing to pressure Cordelia into having at least /some/ measure of oversight on the whole "superweapon that might blow up the entire continent". I'm also liking Yannu a lot more now than when he was first introduced, he's grown on me a lot these past two chapters with both his dedication to his principles and his pragmatism when it comes to politics.
