I'm glad you like the setting! I really appreciate these kind of comments.

I don't want to say too much, but when I was first outlining the story, I was thinking about how a lot of modern fantasy settings are fundamentally written as tragedies about the loss of past knowledge, with the implication that if it had been preserved, everything would have been okay - Library of Alexandria parables. I was partly drawn to create the setting by how I find those conceptually frustrating. I wanted a post-apocalypse where knowledge is kept, and instead the emphasis is on its inability, even at its apex, to save humans completely from both themselves and the reality of the universe.

The primary thing I tried to do with the worldbuilding was to create a certain tense strangeness by meshing together a combination of both ancient and futuristic imagery, language and metaphysics, to the point that things become difficult to distinguish as belonging to one or the other. A lot of the story is about generational conflict or the pursuit of recapturing something lost or fading away, and I wanted that dissonance between old and new to be palpable to the reader. To make them feel a sort of grief? I'm not sure if that will make sense.

  How does seed checking work in practice, though? Surely restaurant staff don't check every person's seed as they enter by hand? That would be a recipe for disaster long term. Would be safer to just wear masks everywhere. Do they use ID cards? Can logic engines check the seed at the entrance automatically? But then why would you need paperwork here.

There was originally a little section that explained this way back in chapter 4, but I had to remove it because it was too awkward and jarring with the level of context readers had that that point.

Basically, though: Older places without much importance of wealth use a system where someone enters the number at the door before it unlocks, while newer ones have a logic bridge that checks instead. The order using paperwork for it is another of its really antiquated traditions.
