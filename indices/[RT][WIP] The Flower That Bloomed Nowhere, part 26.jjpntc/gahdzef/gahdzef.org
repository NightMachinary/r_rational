The setting is fascinating. For a while I though that Iron and Ironworkers are just metaphors for technology and the characters just live in a virtual reality, no actual magic involved. And there are so many parallels to that scenario in this explanation. Substrate, computers not been able to emulate themselves, string theory, mass warping space. But they seem too sophisticated a society to not understand their situation, and I like the whole weird magic setting more, I think.

How does seed checking work in practice, though? Surely restaurant staff don't check every person's seed as they enter by hand? That would be a recipe for disaster long term. Would be safer to just wear masks everywhere. Do they use ID cards? Can logic engines check the seed at the entrance automatically? But then why would you need paperwork here.
