  I'm curious what you meant by this ... I didn't feel like the genre, setting, or direction of the story changed noticeably in this chapter?

I was mostly goofing around, but I guess I was referring to the barrage of pseudo-sci fi concepts at the start of the chapter. Speaking more seriously, though, it's obviously still very much a fantasy story in a lot of its devices and its respect for actual science, just with a bit of cross-genre stuff thrown in.
