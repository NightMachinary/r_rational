  In this chapter, I abandon all remaining pretenses of writing fantasy.

I'm curious what you meant by this ... I didn't feel like the genre, setting, or direction of the story changed noticeably in this chapter? (If anything, it was the interlude a few chapters ago that suggests some weird meta genre-twist weirdness.)

Anyway, stuff is moving along.

Since Ophelia had the stronger reaction (probably meaning she recognized Balthazar's form more than he recognized hers), and given some of Kam's dialogue, it suggests Ophelia was the one with greater distinction treatment from her original form.

This chapter also isn't the first one where issues of gender have come up, there was all the discomfort with having the entrances segregated by gender for example. I'm wondering if it might be connected somehow: we know that the aetherbridge does a prosognostic overlap check, so if Ophelia and Balthazar had been on the same trip, the overlap would have been noticed sooner. This was 'conveniently' avoided, although I don't think it's been specified when Balthazar arrived, so the gendered entrance thing might be narratively unrelated. I'm just looking for anything that might be a clue, and this is all I've grabbed onto so far.
