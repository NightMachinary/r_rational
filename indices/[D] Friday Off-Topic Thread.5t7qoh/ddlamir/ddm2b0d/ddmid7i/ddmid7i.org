Revolt against the modern world? Look, you can't use high tech to revolt against modernity. It /is/ modernity. Besides, what would I want to harm modernity for? You destroy the established order because it's stagnant, exploitative, and oppressive, and it's time we moved on to a radically more humane, modern order. Silly person.
