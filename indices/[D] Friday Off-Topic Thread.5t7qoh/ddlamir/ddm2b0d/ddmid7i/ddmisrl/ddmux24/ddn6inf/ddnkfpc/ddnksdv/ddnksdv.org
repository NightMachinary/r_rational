Given the circumstances I'd obviously rather not be specific. I'm currently living and working in a European country. I'm not a national-socialist, but again not due to any criticism of that ideology originating from the left or from modernity. My political beliefs, if professed publicly and with intent to convince third parties, amount to "incitement to hatred", carrying a maximal sentence of five years in prison.
