  I disagree, I'd argue that the harmful social and cultural changes of the last 400 years can easily be decoupled from the beneficial technological changes.

Thing is, I /like/ the social and cultural changes, minus the rise of capitalism which is an unfortunate transition stage.

  It is stagnant in the sense that there is zero ideological diversity (the only kind of diversity that matters) at the top
#+end_quote

No hegemonic order /ever/ has ideological diversity at the top. That's why we call it the top. The whole [[http://davidbrin.blogspot.com/2011/09/class-war-and-lessons-of-history.html][economic and political project of the Enlightenment]] was to spread power and influence /away from the top/, on the basis that /only/ the lower orders have the will to innovate, invent, or adapt /anything/. The top of the social order was perfectly content with cutting peasants heads off, taking their seed corn, and then riding off to some other village to do it again.

The top slice of people in any given system are incentivized primarily to care about maintaining the system. Only by spreading power out do you /force/ them to act as stewards of a system they /cannot/ truly own.

You are entitled to complain about at-will employment, and the lack of stable contracts. You are not entitled to laws protecting [[https://xkcd.com/1357/][assholes from getting fired for being assholes]] when everyone else can be fired for no reason at all. If you want better labor rights, fight for /better labor rights/, not for being an asshole on private property.
