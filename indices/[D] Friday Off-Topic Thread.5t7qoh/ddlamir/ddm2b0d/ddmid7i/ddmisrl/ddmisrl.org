I disagree, I'd argue that the harmful social and cultural changes of the last 400 years can easily be decoupled from the beneficial technological changes.

The postmodern western system is all of those, just not in the ways it is often accused of being from the left. It is stagnant in the sense that there is zero ideological diversity (the only kind of diversity that matters) at the top, exploitative by the virtue of its secular guilt-and-repentance state cult thoroughly lacking in the repentance department, and oppressive in the sense that questioning the progressive-humanist orthodoxy is career suicide in many top fields, ours included.

But that's just, like, your opinion, man. I'd prefer a more sane, traditional order, for example.
