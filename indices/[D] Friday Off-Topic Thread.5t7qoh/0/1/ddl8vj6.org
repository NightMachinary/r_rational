That video is literally awesome. It makes me think of how weird the general perception of technological progress is. Every movie or book set nowadays that was made 30-40 years ago would look nothing like today, with flying cars and androids and other outlandish things. And yet I doubt most scientists would have predicted so much progress on machine learning even 5 years ago as we have today(besides the singularity cultists anyway). I'm constantly disappointed in the big picture progress, and blown away by the incremental advances of stuff like this.

Humans are really, really bad at making predictions, I guess.
