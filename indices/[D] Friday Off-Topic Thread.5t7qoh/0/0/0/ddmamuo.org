These are clearly not AGIs. They can't do anything but create pictures, and they can't communicate with us or do anything we'd consider intelligent. They aren't even really reading words, just putting them into Google and scraping the results from there.

I'd actually say that this is evidence AGI is a lot further off than we thought. After all you thought that being able to do this would be evidence of intelligence, but we have established that unintelligent things can do it. What other things we once thought would require intelligence will turn out to only require a specialized neural network? It's impossible to predict.
