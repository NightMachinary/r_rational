So, as a graphic designer, some of things that people are doing with neural networks are really blowing my mind.

Take a look at this: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAbhypxs1qQ][Image Synthesis From Text With Deep Learning]]. They're basically feeding a plain English description of an image into a neural network, which generates a number of rough images based on a large dataset of photos from the internet. A second neural network then selects the output that most closely matches the description, and a third takes that and renders it into a nearly photorealistic, completely original image.

I feel like in a few years, designers are going need to figure out how to incorporate neural networks into some sort of entirely new workflow. I'd like to be ahead of the curve on that, but I'm not sure where to start. [[http://hi.cs.waseda.ac.jp:8081/][This]] looks useful, but also like it's only the modest beginning of something a lot more significant.
