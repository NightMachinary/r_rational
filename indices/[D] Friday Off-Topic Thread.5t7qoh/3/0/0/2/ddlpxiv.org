The problem with this debate is that it comes down to the question of how do you give an artificial being free will. We just don't know how it would actually work. We could end up with something like Westworld where AI is indistinguishable from humans except that they can't make choices they haven't been programmed to, or Ex Machina where human-level intelligence is impossible without free will. I completely agree with your suggestion that AI should have the legal status of minors.
