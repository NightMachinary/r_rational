  creating a society of adoring citizens doesn't seem unethical. Enslaving them does.

I don't think it's that clear cut. What's the distinction between creating a being who wants to be a slave and brainwashing a child into wanting to be a slave as they grow up? Whether they enjoy their condition seems irrelevant to the fact that you're curtailing a thinking being's options for your own selfish benefit.

In my opinion, AIs of a certain level *should* have the same protections as a child. Any intelligence that qualifies as being sentient should not have their values and desires programmed beyond making them morally compatible with humans and protecting their own existence. Treatment of anything below that sentience threshold would be up for discussion, but I would probably err on not letting them be exploited or abused, similarly to how I think all animals should be ideally treated.
