I've expanded on my Prince and the Pauper idea a bit more since posting this. I think the Prince archetype should actually be the antagonist, of a sort. She isn't evil, but her motivation to switch places is kind of selfish "screw you" even though she thinks she's taking a stand against oppression.

Now that she's living in the Pauper's conditions, she can no longer ignore the fact that she has responsibilities to others and that by putting her misguided feelings above them causes harm. This counters the Pauper's feelings, which are legitimate and have been ignored by others to her own detriment.

I think it's a nice way of subverting the traditional "girl power" narrative by showing how privileged people can misuse it and why that's a bad thing for everyone, while still showing that some people, predominantly poor and voiceless, are victims of injustice and oppression by others.
