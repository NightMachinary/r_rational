Time for random what ifs and brainstorming that probably won't amount to anything but I still want to talk about. I randomly heard a line from one of the songs in Mulan, /"when will my reflection show who I am inside"/, and then I wondered what if Disney made a movie with a transgirl princess? A pipe dream, perhaps, but how would it actually work in a Disney film?

What I've got so far is that the overall theme of the movie shouldn't be just about accepting LGBT people, the broader message should be that /what makes a true princess isn't the way they were born or raised./ It would be about how anyone can exemplify the values that Disney stands for, not just someone who was born in privilege or raised in a certain culture.

As for how to go about telling that story in a distinctly Disney way, I have no clue. Maybe it could work as a reimagining of The Prince and the Pauper, where the pauper is a transgirl being pressured to become the "man of the house" to take care of her family and switches places with a tomboy princess. That could potentially give a good balance between talking about gender identity and gender roles without getting them confused.

Of course, that's my idea is just for the focus of the story. The context surrounding it is equally important in order for the movie to be entertaining and the themes to emerge naturally rather than coming across as preachy and forced, which the best Disney films are known for. I'm no storyteller and this conversation might not amount of anything, but I'm a nerd dammit and I think this is interesting.
