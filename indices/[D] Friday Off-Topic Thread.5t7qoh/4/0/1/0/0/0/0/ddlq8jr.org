I absolutely love Zootopia, it actually handles adult topics with more intelligence and maturity than most films for adults I've seen. I really like Frozen too, though I never got the impression that there was anything about destiny in it. If anything, it's about rejecting the path you think you have to follow in life and making a new one.
