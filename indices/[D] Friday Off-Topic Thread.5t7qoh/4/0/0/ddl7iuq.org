I agree that has always been the intended message, but here it would be more explicit. Just like how Frozen wasn't the first feminist Disney film, but it was the first to explicitly claim to be feminist and make it a big part of the story. If people, myself included, can praise a movie for saying "you can't marry a man you just met" why not another for saying "being born and raised in a castle doesn't make a princess"?

Still, that would be the broader message behind the focus of the story. Frozen was about love between sisters and used that to convey a deeper message that more people could relate to. This hypothetical movie would use a transgirl's struggle with her identity the same way so that the story doesn't just appeal to transpeople.
