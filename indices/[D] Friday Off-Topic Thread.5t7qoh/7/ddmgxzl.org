On somebodies advice in the monthly recommendation thread I picked up Touchstone. I'm a bit conflicted. It's self published which both means it isn't that expensive, but also it isn't in any libraries around here so I had to actually pay $8-10 it costs. It also means it didn't get fully edited. I'm not any kind of grammar Nazi so I din't notice any obvious spelling or grammar errors, but there were sentences that I had to go over multiple times to properly parse. On a more macro scale the plotting could have used a lot of work. I was left with a strong impression that the author at least partially came up with the plot as she went along. I won't give any examples here because I don't want to include spoilers, but what seemed to be major characters were introduced early in the book only to be abandoned soon after only even mentioned one more time. Similarly the romance in the book seemed both forced and unnecessary,

About 3/4 through the second book I decided that I'd rate it a 2/5. I think I'd upgrade it to 3/5, but it suffers from too many problems for me to really recommend it. It reminds me of much of the online fiction I read, but not free.
