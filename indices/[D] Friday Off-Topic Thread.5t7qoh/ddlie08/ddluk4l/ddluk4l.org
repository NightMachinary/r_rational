Other responses here are good, so I'll just add:

If you feel like you've reached a cap on how much job-hunting you can do in the coming days, either from mental exhaustion or just waiting on more opportunities to become available and communications to be returned, remember to commit yourself to something constructive/productive with another portion of your daily time.

Whether it's continuing to develop your professional skills (by staying up-to-date on research or practicing your craft or networking or whatever, depending on your professional skills/goals) or even just exercising or reading or learning to cook or whatever, this is important not just to help you maintain hireability, but also to keep your motivation up.

A few days "off" to recharge and play video games or go fishing or whatever can be helpful, but if it starts becoming weeks of that, it can really play a number on one's self-esteem and make it harder to get motivated to get back to job hunting.

Good luck!
