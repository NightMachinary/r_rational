  Sure, your views just coincidentally fall under incitement laws targeting Nazis in formerly Nazi-occupied countries.

It's not coincidental - while national-socialism started as popular mass politics, it was very much an elitist ideology opposed to modernity. I didn't say I was opposed to national-socialism, I said I don't consider myself a national-socialist. I would probably still prefer it to what we have today - representative democracy dominated by secular guilt-and-repentance humanist theology.

Also, you sure seem drawn to using slurs for a self-professed rationalist. "Nazi" was never used by self-identifying German national socialists, and carries similar connotations to "commie".
