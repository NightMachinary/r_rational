Need more information to give you advice specifically relevant to your particular situation. That said, based on your description of this situation as distressing, I infer that you probably do not have significant savings or financial support. Whether or not that's the case, be aware that you may be eligible to receive unemployment benefits and earn yourself about six months to find a new job.

Expect finding a new job to be time consuming. 30-60 job applications prior to finding a new job seems to be common. Just think about how many applications a company will receive for a given job posting and the fact that they'll hire only one person and you can get a sense of the statistical odds of any given job application resulting in getting hired. Being licensed, certified, or highly experienced are all good ways to narrow down the competition and speed up a job search.

With decent savings and/or unemployment benefits, you should have little difficulty as long as you keep putting in new job applications every day. Without decent savings or unemployment benefits, your best option might be to have a yard sale and then [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couch_surfing][couch-surf]] until you find a new job and get back on your feet.
