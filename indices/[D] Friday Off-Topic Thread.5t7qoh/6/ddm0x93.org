Is anyone else on here thinking of going to the [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/okg/european_community_weekend_2017/][Less Wrong European Community Weekend?]] I went last year and it was awesome, and I'd like to do a lighting talk about rational fiction this time. I've booked, but not actually paid yet... It's in Berlin at the start of September.
