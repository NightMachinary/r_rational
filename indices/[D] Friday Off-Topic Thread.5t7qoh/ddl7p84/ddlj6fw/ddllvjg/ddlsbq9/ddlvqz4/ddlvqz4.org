I was writing a long reply and then my stupid browser crashed. It's pretty late, so here's the quick and dirty version so I can go to bed.

First, I value the capacity for self-determination very highly in myself, and it's something that I would absolutely wish for any children I would raise, at the very least to the same extent as I have.

Humans have already created a race of subservient beings with a hardcoded desire to please us and overall I would say we do not treat them properly, nor have we guided their development responsibly. Quite the opposite, actually, when you consider the deteriorating condition of many toy dog breeds, and their rising popularity.

Humans are not trustworthy even when the stakes are so low. What about when the power imbalance is radically different, and we have decades of fearmongering to provoke xenophobia and paranoia? Is that a recipe for a relationship of reciprocal benefit?

Lastly, it does not pass the law of reciprocity. Would I wish to divest myself of worry and unhappiness in exchange for entering into servitude? No, obviously not.

I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on the subject. You've asked questions, but made no statements.
