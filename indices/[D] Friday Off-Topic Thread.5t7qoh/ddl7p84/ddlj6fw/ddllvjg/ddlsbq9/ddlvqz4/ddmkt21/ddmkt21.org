  Lastly, it does not pass the law of reciprocity. Would I wish to divest myself of worry and unhappiness in exchange for entering into servitude? No, obviously not.

This isn't actually reciprocal. In the former case, you're creating a new utility function from whole cloth, which includes a desire for subservience. In the latter case, you're altering a preexisting utility function. The latter's flaw is obvious: utility function A does not want to turn into a different utility function B, because B will generally be worse at achieving A's interests than A is. The same is not true in the former case.
