A few days ago I finished reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33962948-perilous-waif][Perilous Waif]]. I wouldn't say its a deep book or anything, it's got a lot of "fan service"(for lack of a better term) like catgirls and foxgirls and it stretched my suspension of disbelief a lot, but overall I enjoyed it. A big part of the book deals with AIs with wonky utility functions, which is what's been on my mind the last few days.

In the future portrayed by the book, there are I believe 5 levels of AI cognition, with level 3 AIs being nearly indistinguishable from human level cognition, Level 4 AIs being like level 3s only capable of abstract thought, creativity and spontaneity, and level 5 AIs being super intelligences who completely eclipse human level cognition, and are thought to be unstable and are taboo throughout the galaxy. The one civilization depicted as researching and integrating level 5 AIs into their society and military are the victim of a galaxy-wide crusade which ends in their genocide.

In the book, level 3 AIs compose the vast majority of all AIs, being used for prostitutes, techs, bodyguards, factory workers, and every type of menial servant. They all are designed to be content, if not ecstatic, at fulfilling their roles and being subservient to humans, no matter how menial and dangerous their jobs or unpleasant their masters. Basically, like this [[http://imgur.com/PePy6a8][GIF]], only he wasn't given enough self reflection to feel sad about it. Maybe he was even made to feel ecstasy every time he does fulfills his role.

So while its obviously unethical to create a human-level intelligence to pass you butter or some other menial job, some boring things need to be done, it's unavoidable, and sometimes those will need some adaptability. So if you're going to make an AI for those tasks, why not design it to relish its intended role? And if you can make an AI that loves whatever its made to do, then where is the ethical line drawn if no one is suffering? At what point does it become unethical to create a society of adoring slaves, with you as the slavemaster?
