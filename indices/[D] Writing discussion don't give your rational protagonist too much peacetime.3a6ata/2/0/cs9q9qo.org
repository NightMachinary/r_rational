The reason that this often happens in serials is that the author often doesn't have any idea where they're going, or knows where they're going but aren't in any rush to actually get there. The serial format doesn't really lend itself to structure as well as a completed book, nor to brevity. When you're writing a serial, you're usually focusing on making /this chapter/ enjoyable, with less focus on how it's going to tie into later events.
