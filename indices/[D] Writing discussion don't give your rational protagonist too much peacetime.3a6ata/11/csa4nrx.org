This seems like a reaction to having to wait for serial chapters more than anything else. That's why I always end on a cliffhanger that implies more action soon. And then I deliver (ahem, eventually...)

As long as a chapter or two later the new and fully operational battlestation appears to challenge the protagonist, everything should be fine. Building tension is a style thing, so that means some people will always disagree with pacing and focus.
