Yes Pact is propably not meant as rational fiction or even rationalist one. Still in the part I actually read Blake was winning (or at least not losing) battles against very powerful opponents with more power and experience than him. Partly through creative uses of his powers.

But yeah rational is not the first word that comes to my mind for Blake. With more downtime to plan maybe he could have made better decisions.

Pact is the only text I quit because there is not enough peacetime. Maybe there are better rational examples for this.
