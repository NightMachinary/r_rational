Fair enough. Having skimmed those Trope links, I don't think I'm risking either one; whatever my protagonist's abilities (and resources and etc) are at any given moment, those abilities are reasonably consistent, well-defined, and predictable (until something happens to change them). She just happens to sometimes be able to drive off a flying gunship, and sometimes gets nearly killed by a crossbow.
