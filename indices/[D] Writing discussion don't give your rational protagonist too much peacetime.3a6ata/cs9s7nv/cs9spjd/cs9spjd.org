This is all perfectly valid. I most definitely agree - respites in the story are usually important can improve the overall quality.

I'm not so much commenting on how much a character should level up - you're right, the munchkin genre allows for quite a lot of that - I'm more pointing out that 20K works of nothing /but/ leveling up can get quite boring. It's possible others find it fun, though, so again, grains of salt.
