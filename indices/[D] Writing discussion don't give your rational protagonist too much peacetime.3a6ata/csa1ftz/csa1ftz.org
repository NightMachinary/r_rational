I don't see why powerups are an issue, as long as most characters are rational(which is assumed for rational fiction) the MC is not the only one that should get powerups. I actually find cases where you just get one tight situation after the other much less interesting, because thats like unreasonable, and doesn't really give a chance for any complex plots to be made.

I didn't read most of the other stories you mentioned, but at least in the case of Waves Arisen I think the issue was mostly that after the middle it just became a demonstration of how that current implementation was totally broken, and it progressed to simply show how OP naruto was(not to mention all the stuff with the eyes). but that is not an issue because naruto had time to implement his plans, it was an issue because the premise was broken in a way that made the story brake the minute naruto had some time to make bigger plans.
