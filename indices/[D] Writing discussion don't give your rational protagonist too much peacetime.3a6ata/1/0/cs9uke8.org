If you do have them try things and fail, it's best for this to have an impact in some way; either we find out something important about the world, it's an opportunity for character growth, etc. If there are five thousand words devoted to a character's clever solution to a problem, and the chapter ends with someone pointing out an obvious flaw that sinks the entire thing, that's the sort of thing that can ruin a reader's enjoyment.
