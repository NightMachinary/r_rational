Yes, and becoming overpowered oughtn't always be the primary goal of a rational protagonist. Not every problem is a challenge to be overcome, sometimes there are hard moral or ethical choices to be made. Not every antagonist (in fiction, or in life) is a powerful enemy or an impending disaster, sometimes it's a reticent lover or a dire misunderstanding.

A rational protagonist should be free to struggle on the inside as well as the outside. Not everything is threats and powerups.
