Your amateur opinion is also the opinion almost all professional writers have. (Most professional writers write commercial fiction)

Scenes in a story can be loosely defined as being action or reaction scenes. Commercial stories tend to be more action-oriented. Literary stories tend to lean towards reaction-oriented scenes.

Literary fiction isn't just length. It's getting into the lead's head and seeing what's there.

I'm going to say something that has the potential to get me some downvotes here, heh.

Let's swap some words, and use movie terms.

Literary Fiction = Chick Flick

Commercial Fiction = Action/Adventure Thriller

Both types of movie have their followers. Both of them use the same tools, but they use said tools in different proportions.
