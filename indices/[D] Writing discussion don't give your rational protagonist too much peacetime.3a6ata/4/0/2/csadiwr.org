It depends on what you're looking for in fiction. I personally read spec fic for the worldbuilding, and any plot that happens to occur is generally incidental to that. I'll read spec fic with a crummy plot but an interesting world, but I won't read spec fic with a crummy world and an awesome everything-else.
