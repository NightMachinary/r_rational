Eh, Symbiote isn't set in the Worm universe. Wildbow just showed me how serial fiction worked, and I liked it.

You are absolutely correct about pacing. And, after the reading I have been doing on plot and structure, I know what you are seeing that a lot of rational writers are doing.

According to the book I am reading, there are two main types of fiction. Literary fiction, and commercial fiction.

Literary fiction tends to be more long-winded. More world building. More introspection. More information.

Commercial fiction tends to be heavily action based. Lean, active. If your character gets a chapter to rest, they are usually doing a lot more than just resting! They are plotting, rebuilding something, healing, or whatever to prepare for the following chapter's action-reaction.

Both are normally based on the 'three act story' concept.

The folks here tend to gravitate towards literary fiction because we like to think. Our characters, as extensions of us, also share that predilection. Where the lead goes, the story follows.

We can write commercial fiction here. The process isn't that hard to understand. We just don't do it naturally :)
