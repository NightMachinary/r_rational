This approach is really off-putting for me. Many times, authors create some character that has potential to win decisively given a week to prepare. What usually follows is relentless string of attacks, unlucky coincidences and other reasons that don't give character a minute of rest.

There are several problems with this approach.

First. As [[/u/DrunkenQuetzalcoatl]] pointed out, characters cannot act smart and rational if they are denied all the opportunities to plan and prepare.

Second. Unrelenting tension-filled action gets boring really fast.

Also, I like to read about characters that devise and execute good, smart plans. Or even flawed plans. As long as flaws weren't apparent at the conception of plan.

*TL; DR:* I enjoy characters leveraging situation to gain power and really hate when characters are prevented from powering up by unrelenting chain of assaults or other mishaps.
