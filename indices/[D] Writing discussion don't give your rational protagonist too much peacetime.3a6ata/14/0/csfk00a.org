I'm flattered you'd ask my opinion! :)

My objection isn't specific to magic or nanotech or a planning session or a 15-minute training montage. It's just the observation that any plot outline that boils down to "And then the character got stronger/gained advantages. And then she got stronger again. Now, I'll explain just how she got stronger the third time" is a pretty boring story.

Though there are multiple ways to handle this, I think one of the most general ones is that this should be tied to drama - whatever that means for your story. Drama can be mortal danger, or the risk that the protagonist's date will be a disaster, or a down moment when it looks like all the protagonist's work is for naught, or a moment of panic when it looks like the important chemistry experiment will explode, or a thief has made off with your Amulet of Munchkinry before it was completed.

Of course, I don't know the particulars of your story, but it sounds like the Munchkining is balanced with other things. I have no problem with Munchkining. I also have no problem with chocolate sauce. They both just need to be spread out amongst their delivery medium.
