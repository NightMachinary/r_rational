I can see where you're going with this opinion, and I think it's perfectly valid. However, from my most likely /even less/ qualified viewpoint, I don't think you're necessarily distinguishing properly between different types of stories.

For example, take T.Y.E. and Mother of Learning. These stories aren't necessarily /rational/ stories. They're /munchkinry/ stories. (Well, at least T.Y.E. is. MoL is about time travel, though, which is pretty much the same thing.) These aren't supposed to be about the plot and the power levels, they're /meant/ to show how a person can manipulate the setting to their advantage.

For example, say Zorian spends 200 restarts training. So what? He's got the experience of a ~30 year old now, which is certainly not enough to go against a thousand year old Lich. But if you've had 200 chances against that Lich without him adapting to your improving strategies, you'll probably figure out a trick to consistently beat him soon enough.

Though, of course, I can agree with you on the subject of peacetime. If the protagonists are seizing a chance to improve, the antagonists should be improving themselves to compensate. But the problem with that is, if you don't ease up on the pressure /at all,/ the eventual outcome is Warhammer 40k.
