Incidentally, I can think of an exception: Alexander Wales' "Branches on the Trees of Time". After the story's initial conflict and hook, the majority of its 20,000 words are devoted to planning and preparing, and generally doing what I just advised against. I believe it works, though, for a few reasons:

-I found many of the character's clever use of the time travel system to be genuinely new to me. This allowed several plot twists to happen during the peacetime.

-The story is short. Even with the plot twists, the ~10,000 words of planning and preparing started to tax my patience near the end (but didn't quite cross the line).

So, like all rules, exceptions exist. Here, the author kept it interesting (to me) and had a very immediate climax it was building towards. If he interrupted the planning session with drama, it would have stretched the story beyond the length it was structured for.

The constant level-up structure also works in A Bluer Shade of White, for different reasons. I won't spoil the story, but suffice to say the circumstances are different, and the author doesn't quite let off the drama pedal until the end.

Disclaimer the second: I did not read enough of Mother of Learning to truly critique it. I just got the same vibe.
