I liked Mother of Learning specifically, because of it's slow pace, low level of tension and the long periods without anything happening really. Somehow I loved to read about this guy repeatedly doing nothing but searching for teachers and studying with them. It is a very welcome change to all the tight, conflict-driven plots out there.
