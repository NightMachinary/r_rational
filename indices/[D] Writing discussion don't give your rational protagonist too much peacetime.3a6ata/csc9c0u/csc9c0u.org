I'm just catching myself up with my own story, S.I., to get ready to resume writing it... and I'm not sure whether or not I've been guilty of the sin you describe, or whether it would be a sin in my story's case. My protagonist has had brief peaceful breaks, and has been Munchkining as hard as she can, gaining allies, technologies, abilities and resources; and has also been facing various opponents, and losing some of what she's gained, or time, or parts of her own body.

If no actual magic is being used, do you feel your criticism would still apply to such a story?
