  I feel like any piece of literary fiction could have well-defined plot and character arcs and can build to a climax (or multiple climaxes) in a timely fashion, and in many cases, the decision not to do this is one of laziness.

I think this is definitely a community welcoming of harsh criticism, but I'd dispute the accuracy of this assertion. Farmer Bob has written a lot of fiction rather quickly, which is no small feat.

Try writing a few thousand words of serial fiction sometime-- it can be very mentally tiresome, and I have immense respect for the authors here who exhibit the amount of creative throughput they do.

No, laziness isn't the right term, I don't think. I think perhaps a more accurate observation would be that creators of serial fiction have a tendency to write less /tightly,/ to meander a little more, and to indulge themselves in vignettes conventional fiction authors might not.

Why? Because there are really two writing modes: a generative mode, in which one produces a great many creative ideas quickly, and a critical mode, in which one reins in the ideas and edits the work to improve /tightness/ and chop out extensive navelgazing.

And the thing is, if you want to write /serial/ fiction, you /have/ to spend more time in mode 1 than mode 2, because otherwise you'll never write anything at all.
