  And the thing is, if you want to write /serial/ fiction, you /have/ to spend more time in mode 1 than mode 2, because otherwise you'll never write anything at all.

I think, more to the point, serial fiction is usually done on a set schedule, and the critical mode takes much more time and introspection. If you have [[/u/wildbow]]'s frankly insane schedule of twenty or thirty thousand words a week, you just don't have time to go back and make substantial changes to a chapter that you've finished writing. You can do a lot of the small editing stuff, like changing who gets a line, fixing some word choices, and stuff like that, but if you've generated ten thousand words (1/8th of a normal novel) and you realize that you need to rework something in a major way, you sort of have to roll with it, if you're serious about not missing a deadline. Worse, you can't really change things that happened in previous chapters, so you get kind of stuck with what you have and critical mode doesn't help you.
