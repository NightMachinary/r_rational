Huh, I'd never heard it broken up that way. Yeah, I'll admit I definitely prefer "commercial fiction". To give an honest, harsh, and not universally accepted opinion, I feel like any piece of literary fiction could have well-defined plot and character arcs and can build to a climax (or multiple climaxes) in a timely fashion, and in many cases, the decision not to do this is one of laziness.

Again, that's both harsh and I'm pretty sure a lot of folks would disagree. I also feel the same way about including humor in commercial fiction.

In my amateur opinion, then most elements of world-building, character-building, character-interaction, and story events should have at least one other secondary objective beyond their own sake. The world element should add to the plot, the character interaction should reveal more about the characters, the character element should help convey the author's underlying moral message. (Incidentally, this is one reason I enjoy fanfiction: you can go further in the world building, because this /new/ piece of worldbuilding is relevant to this /new/ story's climax)

But yes, thank you, I'll try to keep that in mind. Some people like their stories longer than I think necessary. :)
