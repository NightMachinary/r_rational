Yes, the same thing was with [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/blood-and-chaos-the-story-of-a-btvs-si-turned-vampire.354777/threadmarks][/Blood and Chaos/]] --- the author had to both restrict his own character's originality and (at least partially) refocus the story from physical confrontations and powers required for them to inter-character relations.

I think not introducing an enemy of equal power could still work in at least two cases though.

- 1, if the protagonist [[https://medium.com/life-learning/your-life-is-tetris-stop-playing-it-like-chess-4baac6b2750d#.ro4ibyo6f][didn't think in terms of enemies\bosses to beat]] but rather in terms of “fixing” the whole universe to their likening. Difficulties:

  - if the story started as an action \ adventure, it would abruptly change its genre (strategy \ history \ infrastructure management) losing many readers in the process;
  - even if did start with warnings about the incoming genre shift, it still wouldn't be interesting for as wide an audience as a general action \ adventure story is;
  - it would be hard to write a high-quality story in this direction: one would have to be well educated in history, political and social sciences, economics, etc.

- 2, using an analogy with video games, the author could be describing his character's actions in an open sandbox world where the main plotline has already been completed. Often you want to know what happened with the hero after the main plot line is finished and they are at the peak of their power --- but for writers, the sensible thing to do is to finish the story right at this point. So you usually end up with either no continuation at all or with a sequel that starts right off with introduction of another [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad][big bad.]] In case of videogames, however, players will often return to an already “finished” RPG ([[http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page][TES,]] [[http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page][GTA,]] etc) to just spend some time there as a form of /casual/ entertainment. What eventually dims the interest in this case is depletion of original content in the game (e.g. side quests) and getting bored by the game engine's capabilities. Both these problems are solvable when an imaginative writer is writing a /story/, so I think an OPed protag could keep going from one original “side quest”\plot arc to another --- if the story was intended as a pulp fiction from the start.

On another note, why are you naming that law after one particular person? I don't think EY was the first person in history to point out that stories should be balanced to preserve intrigue and tension. So why is it being introduced as /his/ law? Isn't it like saying [Someone]'s Law of Round Wheels?
