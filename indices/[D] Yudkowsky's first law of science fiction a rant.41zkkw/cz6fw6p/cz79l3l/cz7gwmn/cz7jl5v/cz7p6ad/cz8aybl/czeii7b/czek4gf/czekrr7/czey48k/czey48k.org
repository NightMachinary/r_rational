Remember when we find out that [[#s][]]? There were several comments of people who quit reading there because it was too much. I found it /interesting/. Horror and tragedy in fiction, especially in the written medium, just doesn't negatively affect me all that much and I have to get *really* attached to a character in order for me to mourn their deaths or death-equivalent events.

But maybe you'll turn out to be right. I'll come back and tell you when I'm done reading that story.

Cheers!
