Read all of the available chapters. Liked it a lot. You can pretty much feel all the alternate timelines Coil uses to manipulate her. But I don't get why everyone is acting as if he is describing in detail how kittens are being slowly pushed through a meat grinder or something.

I mean sure, lots of standard issue psychological torture but till now there hasn't even been any hope suddenly janked away from under her. No forcing her between the lives of a random innocent or that of her father. No Tattletale dying to a tragic freak "accident" or being forced by Coil to betray her. No finally getting free from Coil just to find her father already dead.

Sure, all those things may well still be coming but those comments about the story being unreadable really confuses me seeing how the original Worm not only had much bleaker moments but also had much more of a ramp up while this story starts kinda fucked up and then pretty much keeps the expected level without ever becoming worse.
