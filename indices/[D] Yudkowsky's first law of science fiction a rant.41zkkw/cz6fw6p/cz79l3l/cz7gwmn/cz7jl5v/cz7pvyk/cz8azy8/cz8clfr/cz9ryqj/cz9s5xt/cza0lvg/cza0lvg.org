You're talking about movies like No Country for Old Men right? Well, maybe I'm biased because I was brought up on Bollywood movies, but for me a bad ending is unacceptable unless I know it's coming, simply because I watch movies primarily as entertainment AKA an escape from reality, and I absolutely don't want anything in the movie that reminds me of ho shit the real world really is. And bad guys winning or everyone dying is pretty indicative of that, so it really turns me off.

I know that there are people out there who like tragedies because it gives them a sense of relief that its not happening to them. However, I've always been far too empathetic to watch tragedies without suffering right along with the characters, so I have never really understood that viewpoint.
