Increasing the difficulty for the hero is almost never a problem, at least so long as the hero can still win without it coming off as unearned. You can just keep upping the difficulty as much as you want, and so long as there's a good way to pull out a win in spite of that, you're golden. (I'll also note that one of the corollaries to Yudkowsky's First Law is that it's fine to make Frodo a Jedi without giving Sauron a Death Star if Sauron becomes the protagonist.)
