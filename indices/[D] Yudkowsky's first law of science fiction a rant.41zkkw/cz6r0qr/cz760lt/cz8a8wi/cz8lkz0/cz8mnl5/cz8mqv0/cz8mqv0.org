  If you don't stop reading when you've stop enjoying yourself, why are you reading?

Because you expect to enjoy yourself again later into the book, enough so that the boring parts are worth slogging through. Even my favourite books are not thrill rides 100% of the time, they just don't have the downward trend of unplanned fiction. Often the biggest payoff is near the end, even.
