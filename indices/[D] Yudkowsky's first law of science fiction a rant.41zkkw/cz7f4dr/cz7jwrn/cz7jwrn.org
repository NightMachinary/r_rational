[[http://rationalreads.com/?#/works/30][I read a bunch of /With This Ring/ and it was quite fun, and then it stopped being fun, then I read a good deal more]]. It's right around that time I finally integrated the "you /can/ just stop reading, you dummy!" rule. (I do wish that had happened /before/ I encountered /Adventures in Effulgence/.)

But IIRC I dropped it because of a combination of poor pacing and unmet expectations (when a rationalist enters a superhero world, I kind of expect more than slice-of-life intersped with bog-standard superheroing to ensue; or at least I want better written slice-of-life). I agree it doesn't fit the pattern in the OP, which is why it's not on the list.
