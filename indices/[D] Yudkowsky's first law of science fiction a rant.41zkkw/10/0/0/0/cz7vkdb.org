I've kept reading WTR and the part that bugged me has always been Renegade. He rolls in, curbstomps everything, rolls out, is rude and untrustworthy to everyone, ignores the Justice League's ROE, and never faces any consequences or experiences any character growth. I've said as much in the thread multiple times.

Zoat just put all that out the window. The latest arc is Renegade-focused, and I think it's my favorite of the entire story so far.
