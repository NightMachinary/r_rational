I will be very surprised if the Mannis story doesn't end up with a challenge. Plenty of foreshadowing going on at the moment. You did notice the whole- "Argilac the Arrogant reborn" thing going on, right? I suspect the author does have a long term plan. On the other hand I've read plenty of awful Mary Sue fanfiction and it may just be wishful thinking. Something about this one makes me think he may be planning something different.
