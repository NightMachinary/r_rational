I'd say i definitely agree with the general point, and would add "The Waves Arisen" to the list if you ever think of trying it.

I also agree in regards to time braid, and I think its interesting to point that one of the interesting things that work for time braid in my opinion is that that it skirts some of the issue simply by having one of central most powerful characters offscreen half the time.

I of course think the way it built sakura up was really well done, but in my opinion if the story was instead on naruto it would have felt too OP. but by not having naruto as the MC it gets to sort of "eat the pie and have it" if you will.
