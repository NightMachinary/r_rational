It was heavily implied that the extra water was from over-used suiton jutsu. It was also implied that society was once much larger than what was presented to us in the fic, and kind of destroyed itself as a result of the water having nowhere else to go. There are a few off screen holes in that theory, in my personal opinion, but I let it slide. Although I found it hard to emotionally connect with "wanting to get rid of some of the water" as an overarching goal of his.

EDIT: Based on some other, less blatant hints and speculation, I concluded that the pre-existing society's over-use of suiton jutsu most likely wasn't so much of the "ninjas spit water" variety, as of the "large chakra-to-water spawning machines go nuts" variety.
