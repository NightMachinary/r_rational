There is no way that any believable number of ninja produced that much water, and why in the world would they create chakra-to-water machines? Where would they get enough chakra to power such a thing for the amount of water that would be necessary?

The thing that puzzles me is that it's a major part of the setting -- Wertiflowke went to the trouble of finding a map of the Tibetan Plateau and then modifying it to show the drownage. Despite that, it never had any actual impact on the story.
