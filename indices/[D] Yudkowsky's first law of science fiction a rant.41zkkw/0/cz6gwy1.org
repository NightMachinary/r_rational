I'll admit I personally prefer the stories where a rationalist character powers through, sneakily defeats, or completely bypasses various canon problems, but then runs smack into other problems (canon or derived) which cause them genuine issues. Particularly if they've started feeling a bit smug about how smart/informed/capable they are.

And it kind of makes sense. Any protagonist who keeps pushing their boundaries will run into a lot more situations, events, opponents, and so on than one who lives life in the background. And the more things that a protagonist encounters, the greater the chance that one or more of them will be something they can't handle - and the effect will be worse because the speed at which they were moving will generally mean that they haven't had time to build up networks, secondary defenses, and fallback positions.
