  I'll admit I personally prefer the stories where a rationalist character powers through, sneakily defeats, or completely bypasses various canon problems, but then runs smack into other problems (canon or derived) which cause them genuine issues. Particularly if they've started feeling a bit smug about how smart/informed/capable they are.

One of the later "Wiz Biz" novels is like this (if you look at it as a SI in the canonical 'medieval magical universe' because that's kind of what it is). [[#s][SPOILER]]
