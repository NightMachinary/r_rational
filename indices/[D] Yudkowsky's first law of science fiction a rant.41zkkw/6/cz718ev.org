Agreed. Suggested improved 1st law:

The problem with all of these fanfics is that they take a standard story where everything revolves around the hero, then give the hero rationality but /still let the entire world revolve around them/. Sauron does not need a deathstar to kill frodo. Frodo just needs to be able to die to a stray goblin arrow.

Heck, even Hpmor has this problem. Harry comes into Hogwarts and not only does he start out with a ridiculous amount of scientific knowledge right off the bat, but ALSO everyone loves him and he is super rich without having to do anything for it, and everything he does is awesome for some reason. He'd come across as much less of a Mary sue if the rest of the world didn't see him as the main character.

edit: one of the very few examples of a fanfic that does this right is The waves Arisen. No matter how powerful the main character becomes, he still feels vulnerable because the rest of the world treats him like fodder.
