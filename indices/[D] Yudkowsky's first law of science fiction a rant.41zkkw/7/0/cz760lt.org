*"Jedi Frodo vs Death Star Sauron"*

- The ubiquitous genre-defining fics of this sub (HPMOR, Luminosity, The Metropolitan Man)

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2776352/chapters/6226538][Weaver Nine]]

([[http://addventure.bast-enterprises.de/frecent.php?tag=Dungeon+Keeper+Ami][Dungeon Keeper Ami]] (Pusakuronu chapters only) is also impressively good at avoiding this pitfall, given its premise and length. It's a damn shame it instead fell into the pitfall of not being very good writing.)

*Original works that still do the "rationalist tries to fix everything but it's really hard" thing*

- [[http://archives.erfworld.com/][Erfworld]] (book 1 only, and excluding the text epilogues)

Also, all the stories in the OP (and I could dig out some names for the broad categories at the bottom of the list if you want) make for good reading, *provided you stop reading as soon as you stop having fun*. They blow their premise's payoff in the first chapters.
