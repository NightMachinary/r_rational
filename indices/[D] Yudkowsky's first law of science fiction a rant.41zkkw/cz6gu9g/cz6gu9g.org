You know what fanfic community has a good record of sufficiently powerful antagonists? Dragonball Z. Turns out there's almost no power up to canon you can't fix by moving forward an arc or two in that setting.

Though to be fair, I have yet to read a fic where the dragonballs were abused instead of nerfed. It would almost be embarrassing if there wasn't an author somewhere that was able to write themselves into a corner with the help of nigh omnipotant wishing machines.
