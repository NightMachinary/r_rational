  Wiz Biz is not a rational programmer for the same reason Sherlock is not a rational detective, I think.

Why do you say that? (Honest question, not snarky.) The details of the magic system are never really clearly laid out, true. Still, Wiz's actions are driven by his values and are reasonable based on who he is and what he knows at any given point. Better, his magic isn't "and then I needed a thing so I took five minutes to do it" -- he has to spend considerable time prepping his spells ahead of time, and he loses most of his most significant battles. ("Loses" as in "needs to be saved by an ally", I mean.)

In the first book the factions are good and evil, but after that it's more realistically grey.
