Time Braid does a sort of OK job of explaining stuff so that a newer reader is not totally lost, and goes pretty fair off the rails of canon so reader familiarity is not always assumed. I'd say to try it. There's a lot of nouns that will be unfamiliar at first, mostly because of gratuitous japanese names for stuff, but you can Google anything important and let the rest sort itself out by contextual cues. Honestly, I think you're more likely to be turned off by some of the content than by the source material - Time Braid contains a /lot/ of nightmare fuel that some people find objectionable. I really like the story, but I /completely/ understand people who don't.
