I will agree with you, because I'm comfortable with framing "exploration and learning" as "overcoming the monstrous fact that we don't know this thing, that we want to know".

  This scenario is not optimal, and is not the post-scarcity many of us are looking for.

Post-scarcity gives us the opportunity to fight more interesting monsters, and gather more interesting information. Trying to "end the problem of having problems at all" is very much first-order thinking, and it would potentially be a problem in itself, if it actually /mattered./

One of my favourite quotes on the subject, from "Harry Potter and the Natural 20":

#+begin_quote
  Steadying himself with deep, calming breaths, Milo forced his eyes to stare directly at the polished silver surface.

  The universe unveiled itself in front of him, and, while, conceptually at least, Milo knew from Wizards experimenting with Divinations and Greater Teleport that the distance between stars was inconceivably far and that the distance between galaxies made even that colossal distance seem completely negligible, Milo could see, clearly, pinpoints of light unfolding before him in numbers so large that they didn't have names. Many of those stars had planets, and many of those planets had moons, and a rare few of those planets and moons had life. Milo saw stout, bearded dwarves bustling about in their mines and forges, not knowing that with every greedy swing of their pick they unwittingly brought themselves one step closer to their own inexorable demise as they approached the horrors which lay beneath their underground cities. Milo saw proud elves, comfortable in the fact that they'd been toying with the very fabric of the universe and living in shining cities and soaring towers while the lesser races had yet to discover fire; blind, in their arrogance, to their ever-waning power, numbers, and relevance to the world outside of their sequestered paradises. Milo saw humans beyond number, living their lives, tilling soil, and always expanding outwards, propelled by their adventurous spirit and search for excitement, not knowing what was in store for them when they found there nowhere else to discover. Milo saw ankhegs, centaurs, chimera, dragons, gnomes, halflings, half-elves, aquatic elves, wood elves, dark elves, high elves, gray elves, wild elves, wood elves, orcs, goblins, hobgoblins, bugbears, half-orcs, magmin, barghests, blink dogs, dinosaurs, dire animals, ghosts, ghouls, ogres, oozes, mephits, medusae, merfolk, sahuagin, sprites, lamias, wyverns, will-o-wisps, and wraiths. Milo saw the entirety of the Prime Material as if he were examining every object, creature, and wisp of smoke with intense scrutiny. Milo saw the Great Wheel of the Outer Planes, the sixteen infinitely large planes of Celestia, Bytopia, Elysium, the Beastlands, Arborea, Ysgard, Limbo, Pandemonium, the Abyss, Carceri, Hades, Gehenna, Baator, Acheron, Mechanus, and Arcadia arranged clockwise around the barren Outlands, which, from its heart, rose the impossibly tall Spire, ringed at its peak by Sigil, The City of Doors. Milo saw the Lower Planes ripped apart by the never ending Blood War and the uncaring laughter of their thirsting gods. Milo saw the Inner Planes of Air, Fire, Earth, Water, and Positive and Negative energy from which the Multiverse itself was made. Milo saw the Astral, Ethereal, Shadow, and elusive Mirror Transitive planes, and the madness of the Far Realm. Milo saw the Multiverse in its entirety, and it was all his.

  Milo saw himself, with an infinitely high level in every Class and Prestige Class, with every feat worth taking and a good many that aren't, with infinite ranks in infinite skills, with infinite ability scores and infinite ability modifiers, with infinite hit points, with infinite spells per day and every spell known, lounging on what, at first glance, appeared to be an intricately carved throne of every precious metal, expensive special material, and gemstone Milo had ever heard of (and several others, as well) but upon closer inspection were, in fact, Epic Magic Items and Artifacts. Milo saw a backrest composed of dozens of Staffs of the Magi sitting on piles of Rings of Universal Energy Immunity and Bracers of Relentless Might. One armrest was simply the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords while the other appeared to be the great battleaxe of Heironeous Himself, sitting on a pile of the six weapons of his archenemy, Hextor. Milo, the most powerful character conceivable, lounged on his terrible throne, staring at His gauntleted hand (in some detached part of his brain, Milo realized it was nothing less than the Iron Gauntlet of War), an expression of detached ennui on his blank face. In his other hand, he idly spun the Gold Dragon Orb around his fingers, one of the most powerful artifacts in creation reduced to a mere stress ball. Who has any need of an Orb of Dragonkind, even the most powerful one, when Milo could simply rewrite reality to create a breed of better dragons, forced to bow to his every will?

  Milo had no enemies, for they had all long since been defeated. He had no adventures to undertake, for there were none of an appropriate Encounter Level. He had no friends, for he needed none. He had no dungeons to raid, for he had the Multiverse in his inventory. He had no familiar, for they could be traded for more powerful alternate class features. He had no partymembers, because in the impossible event that he would need allies, what could be more powerful than Simulacra of himself?

  The Milo in the mirror had everything he'd ever wanted, everything he'd ever seen, everything he'd ever heard of, everything he'd ever only conceived of.

  Milo ---the real Milo --- wasn't sure when he'd started screaming. He felt hands (the detached part of his brain that kept noticing minute details even in impossible situations noted that it must have been Ron and Harry, not that the rest of him cared) struggling to pull him away from the mirror, but even as they dragged him away from it he couldn't summon the willpower to tear his eyes from the horrible visage. Eventually, one of them wrapped the Cloak of Invisibility around the artifact, and the visions stopped --- but the memories remained.

  "What the bloody hell was that?" Ron asked, his face pale and bloodless.

  "I... I saw everything," Milo said weakly. He tasted blood in his mouth, he must have bit his tongue at some point. "And ... and it was mine. I had everything ... everything except a reason to..." he trailed off, his brain still not fully functioning.

  "Reason to what, mate?" Ron asked nervously in an odd, falsely cheerful voice.

  "Anything," Milo said. "No reason to anything."

*No reason to anything.* This is the gift that these people like that [censored to avoid unnecessary moderator attention] [[/u/transfuturist]] who called my philosophy "disgusting" and downvoted it with arrogant distaste, are trying to give us.
