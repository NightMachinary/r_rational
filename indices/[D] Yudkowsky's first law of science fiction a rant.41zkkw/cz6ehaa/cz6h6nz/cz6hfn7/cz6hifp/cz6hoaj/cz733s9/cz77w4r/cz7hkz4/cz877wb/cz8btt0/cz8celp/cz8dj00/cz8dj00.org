The thing is, that state of omnipotence is the endstate of any being with an infinite lifespan. Barring anything that would kill them or make them kill themselves, any intelligent being would rise in power until they can sit upon a throne of Gods. Give a mind infinity, and it either kill itself or become a God.

Would that create ennui? Perhaps.

But the being that sits upon such a throne would be far wiser, far more intelligent and experienced than me, for me to foolishly declare them as bereft of existence. An ant may as well decry the same to me, asking what purpose my life serves if I don't need to fight for food and shelter, what purpose or goal I could have if all my needs were met. I would simply look at it, smile, and go back to watching cat videos, an activity that the ant would be hard pressed to understand (and would probably drive it insane trying to).

There was this interesting short story I read once on this subreddit (search for Lotus Thrones), where it talked about the endstate of a Singularity, namely a gestalted being that has run the simulations for every variation of the universe and thus has nothing left to discover. The author said that therefore a worthwhile end goal would be for it to enter meditation, to contemplate itself and it's body/home/universe in all it's wonder.

Personally, I found that rather boring and self-incapacitating. I would try to break free from the universe, either through a black hole or some other anomaly, whereby I could experience another universe in all it's forms and features.

Eventually, I may leave that multiverse cluster and head to a different one, where the laws of physics differed; or I may create my own. One that contained infinity in it's purest form and thus would never run out of things for me to do.
