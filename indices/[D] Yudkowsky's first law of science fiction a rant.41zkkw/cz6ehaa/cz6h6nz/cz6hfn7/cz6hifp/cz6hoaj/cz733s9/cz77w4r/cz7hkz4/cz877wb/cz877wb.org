It's a concept that I propose to name the Gygaxian Paradox: you do not gain XP unless you deserve it. The universe's algorithm for determining whether or not you deserve XP, is based on the /difficulty/ of what you did. A life without suffering and conflict has a cap on its difficulty. Maybe you could challenge yourself intellectually, eg by playing games and /pretending/ to experience events which are difficulties from the point of view of your characters, however, unless the /stakes really matter to you/, you are (tautologically) not overcoming sufficiently difficult problems.

You are both author /and character/ within your own life. From the point of view of Theon Greyjoy, his suffering is terrible. From the point of view of George RR Martin, Theon's suffering is a necessary part of the story. This doesn't mean that George /hates/ Theon, or even that he doesn't /love/ Theon; it means that George has larger, and different, concerns than Theon's "right" (which only he and other people in the story think he has, George RR Martin certainly doesn't) to live free from suffering.

This is the insight that moved me from atheist to syncretic pantheist. The world is a story. "God", the author, the DM, the Ultimate Oversoul, may cause us to suffer /and/ still love us, /and/ also have the "right" to do so, because we are each a part of God, and we are doing it to ourself. We suffer because only /in suffering/ may we have the opportunity to overcome suffering; not just our own suffering (self-actualization) but the suffering of others (Good-aligned behaviour).

The child in the cancer ward, the pig in the factory farm, the Jew in Auschwitz, the people in the queue behind that stupid woman arguing with the post office clerk, the failed gambler, the sex-deprived friendzoned ratheist neckbeard, all may curse God and all may do so justly. And yet God loves them all. Their suffering creates the opportunity to not suffer. If not for themselves, for others.

(As a side effect, this manner of thinking helps depression a /lot/. We thank thee, oh great DM, for these monsters which we have randomly encountered, for only by defeating them may we gain XP and treasure. Amen, and roll for initiative.)
