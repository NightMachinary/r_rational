I'm happy to redefine "conflict" as "challenge".

  It is not true, however, that learning happens only on the margin. I can improve slowly while doing low-challenge exercises. More importantly, it's a truism that teaching someone else will help your own understanding; that's because it forces you to go back and re-examine things that are simple and un-challenging for you, and to see them in new ways based on greater understanding.

I agree. Low-challenge exercises still count as learning experiences. Teaching someone else /definitely/ counts as a learning experience.
