I see a number of problems with this philosophy:

  It's a concept that I propose to name the Gygaxian Paradox: you do not gain XP unless you deserve it.
#+end_quote

XP are an abstract game mechanic. They do not apply in the real world. My ability to comprehend, evolve, and grow is not limited by an absence of abstract 'points'.

Furthermore, 'deserve it' usually implies some sort of moral framework, as though I must have committed a good deed in order to be rewarded with enhanced understanding and/or development. If you want to contend that you're using 'deserve it' in the sense of 'he worked really hard' then I suppose it fits, but that's simply playing semantics.

#+begin_quote
  The universe's algorithm for determining whether or not you deserve XP, is based on the difficulty of what you did.
#+end_quote

This is an extraordinary claim, and you need to provide extraordinary evidence for it. Everything that science knows says that the universe possesses neither intelligence nor agency; it does not make decisions, and it does not have an algorithm for when and how much I should be allowed to learn.

#+begin_quote
  A life without suffering and conflict has a cap on its difficulty.
#+end_quote

Discovering / creating new fields of mathematics is very difficult, yet there is no conflict involved...unless, of course, we start playing semantics again in order to redefine 'conflict' such that it includes what would normally be considered 'challenge'.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe you could challenge yourself intellectually, eg by playing games and pretending to experience events which are difficulties from the point of view of your characters, however, unless the stakes really matter to you, you are (tautologically) not overcoming sufficiently difficult problems.
#+end_quote

It is true that learning happens fastest on the margin -- I learn a song faster on my harp when I push myself to play as fast as possible, because then my fingers/brain need to work hard to catch up. It is not true, however, that learning happens /only/ on the margin. I can improve slowly while doing low-challenge exercises. More importantly, it's a truism that teaching someone else will help your own understanding; that's because it forces you to go back and re-examine things that are simple and un-challenging for you, and to see them in new ways based on greater understanding.
