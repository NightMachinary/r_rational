That's a very disgusting way to look at it. It is not because of suffering that we are able to remove suffering, it is /SO VERY MUCH/ in spite of it. This mode of thinking is psychotic and begs unjustified moral objectivity (subjective to some human-immoral ubermensch) as well as a law of emotional dynamics that /does not exist./ /Is/ is not /ought/, and it /isn't/ in the first place. You have drunk deep of the mystical just-world kool-aid.
