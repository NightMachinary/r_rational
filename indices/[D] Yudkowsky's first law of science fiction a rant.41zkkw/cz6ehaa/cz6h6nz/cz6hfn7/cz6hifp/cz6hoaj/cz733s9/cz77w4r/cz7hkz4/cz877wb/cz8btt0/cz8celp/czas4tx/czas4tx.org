That enormous quote could have been boiled down to "absence of challenge is awful because it's boring." In future, please try to condense.

The problem with the quote is that it makes the assumption that absence of challenge is /possible/; it presupposes that there /is/ an end to what can be learned. I would like to see some evidence for the truth of that statement, because I very much doubt it to be the case.

Over the last few hundred years, humanity has reduced or eliminated many enormous challenges that have existed throughout history. Compared to someone from the Middle Ages or the Stone Age we have plenty of food, plenty of medicine, and we need to do less work. That doesn't mean that life has become boring; we have invented new fields of study, new means of entertainment, and new professions. In the 1700s it may have been possible to have a reasonable understanding of a major subset of the world's knowledge -- to speak the most important languages and have a solid if not perfect understanding of all that science then knew. That isn't even remotely possible today, as there simply aren't enough hours in the day. There's no reason to think that's going to change any time soon, either.

It might, of course. Perhaps ten years from now we'll all have a DNI and enhanced neural architectures that permit transferring memories, experiences, and comprehension directly from one brain to another. Then I could download the mathematical knowledge of Stephen Hawking, the guitar skills of Carlos Santana, and the X of Y for every X.

Perhaps.

It's unlikely to happen anytime soon. By the time it does happen I expect we'll either be in the middle of the Singularity or out the other side, at which point there is no point in discussing what life will be like.

Short version: you contend that we are going to become omniscient gods and suffer from boredom and ennui? Prove it. Or, at the very least, show some evidence. Right now you are arguing from assertion; I do not agree with your assertion, and I suspect that a significant number of other people would not either.
