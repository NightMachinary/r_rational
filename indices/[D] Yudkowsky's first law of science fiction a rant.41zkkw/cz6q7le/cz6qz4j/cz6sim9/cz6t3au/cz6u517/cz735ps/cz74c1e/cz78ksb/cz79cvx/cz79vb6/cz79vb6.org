Agreed. No way standard canon suiton jutsu was responsible. As to why they would create chakra-to-water machines?

No. Fucking. Clue.

I just reached that conclusion because:

1. No way some guys spitting water filled up the world.

2. Chakra to water seems to be the method in which this happened. There's no other water spawning showcased in Waves Arisen.
