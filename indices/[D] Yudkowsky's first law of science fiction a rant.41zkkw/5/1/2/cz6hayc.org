+I'm currently on mobile, so I can't link to+ [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2o482k/how_much_naruto_knowledge_is_needed_to_read_time/][the thread in which this question was discussed]]--but, IIRC, the consensus in that thread was "Yes, if you check [[http://www.naruto.wikia.com][the wiki]] whenever you feel as if you're getting lost".
