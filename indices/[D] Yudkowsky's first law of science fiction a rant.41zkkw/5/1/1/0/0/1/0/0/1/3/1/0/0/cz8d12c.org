  You simply have nothing that will actually convince me,
#+end_quote

Heh.

#+begin_quote
  You are operating under the assumption that reality acts like a narrative, when there is barely even a relation, let alone reverse causality.
#+end_quote

No, it's a chosen axiom. You may choose differently, but it's still a /choice/, not an objectively determinable fact.

#+begin_quote
  What justification do you have for referring to an 'Ultimate Oversoul,' or of any properties it may or may not have?
#+end_quote

Not much. It's just the terminal point of a series. This is at best a hypothesis, I have yet to find a prediction from the idea that can be tested.

#+begin_quote
  What justification do you have for saying that this Oversoul's terminal values should be more valuable to us than our own?
#+end_quote

None other than (1) values are inherently chosen axioms, having no /real/ existence; (2) if the existence of an Oversoul is chosen as an axiom, then one of its roles within the system is to serve as the terminal arbiter of values.

#+begin_quote
  What justification do you have for saying that overcoming suffering is The Good, and that suffering's existence is in any way responsible for our future triumph over it, other than its 'necessary' existence as an obstacle to be overcome?
#+end_quote

It's blatantly obvious. If ants were biting you, wouldn't you move? How does that dynamic look from the point of view of ants? "Obstacles" and "methods to overcome obstacles" are pretty much the same thing. Points of interest, within a stochastic process.

#+begin_quote
  Why would overcoming suffering be better than not suffering in the first place?
#+end_quote

What is "not suffering in the first place"? Consider the terrible disease, ipsischacthuritis. We cannot describe its symptoms, it cannot be detected in any way, it cannot be vaccinated against and it cannot be treated, because /it doesn't exist/. Are you glad that you do not suffer ipsischacthuritis? Right now, would you rather there were a cure for ipsischacthuritis or a cure for leukaemia?

#+begin_quote
  Why do you imply that suffering is necessary in order to to be challenged? [and then you answer your own question] I believe challenge is what you're truly espousing, and that you're applying this to real-life suffering in order to justify its existence in the face of a nihilistic depression. You directly advertise this worldview as a way to avoid depression!
#+end_quote

/Exactly!/ Believing this, /axiomatically/, creates a /story/ which explains the existence of suffering in a manner that encourages me to persist in seeking to overcome it. It is a lie from which truth grows.

#+begin_quote
  Myself, I am not threatened by the epistemically hygienic alternative causing that failure mode.
#+end_quote

Possibly you just haven't met it yet. ;)

#+begin_quote
  Don't answer those questions, I know I won't be satisfied with your answers or lack thereof.
#+end_quote

Eh, give up the silly posturing. You started this, with your "disgusting" crack, and your implication that I am Not Smart. I am satisfied that you are Smart. I would accept an apology from you, if you're mature enough to give it.
