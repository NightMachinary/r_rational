Although I agree with you that [[/u/aeschenkarnos]] is wrong, the way you're presenting your argument is not effective. You are phrasing it in the form of ad hominem attack, and that only weakens your position -- both your argument per se and, by association, anyone who agrees with you.

I've seen you make good, well-reasoned arguments before; if you want to defeat mystical thinking, don't do it with emotional arguments and attack language. You are better than this.
