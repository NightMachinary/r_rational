  I'm happy to redefine "conflict" as "challenge".

That would pretty much put a nail in your argument, though. If you change your argument to be that I can only "gain XP" by experiencing challenge, then you still need to provide evidence that there is an end to the available challenges. And that's leaving aside the question of evidence for:

- any meaningful way in which 'XP' applies to reality;
- the existence of this 'Oversoul';
- the idea that the Oversoul makes decisions related to XP awards; and,
- the idea that reality and narrative have any sort of real link.
