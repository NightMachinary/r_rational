It is not at all ex nihilo. You simply have nothing that will actually convince me, and this fact is not due to any stubbornness I may have. You are operating under the assumption that reality acts like a narrative, when there is barely even a relation, let alone reverse causality.

- What justification do you have for referring to an 'Ultimate Oversoul,' or of any properties it may or may not have?
- What justification do you have for saying that this Oversoul's terminal values should be more valuable to us than our own?
- What justification do you have for saying that overcoming suffering is The Good, and that suffering's existence is in any way /responsible/ for our future triumph over it, other than its /'necessary' existence as an obstacle to be overcome?/
- Why would overcoming suffering be better than not suffering in the first place?
- Why do you imply that suffering is necessary in order to to be challenged?

I believe challenge is what you're truly espousing, and that you're applying this to real-life suffering in order to justify its existence in the face of a nihilistic depression. You /directly advertise/ this worldview as a way to avoid depression!

  It's not a falsifiable, testable, idea and assessing it as such is a category error. The purpose of having ideas in an "artsy-motivational sense"--stories--is to motivate us to advance the art.

Our major difference is that you're willing to hold unjustified metaphysical beliefs to avoid a cognitive failure mode. Myself, I am not threatened by the epistemically hygienic alternative causing that failure mode. I am at peace with nihilism, and have moved on to existentialism without any epistemic is-ought fuss. I will admit that, while not being epistemically rational, you are at least to your own knowledge being instrumentally rational. We will continue to live our lives entirely unaffected by the other.

Don't answer those questions, I know I won't be satisfied with your answers or lack thereof.
