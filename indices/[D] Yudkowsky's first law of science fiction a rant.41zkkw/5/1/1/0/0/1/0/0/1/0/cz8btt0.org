While I agree partially, I mainly take issue with the idea that suffering is what makes life worthwhile. Yes, perhaps without "righteous suffering", we may not be able to develop a sense of empathy, but I disagree that we may not be fully content. Not everyone enjoys fighting monsters to gain XP; some may like exploring and learning about the world. Some may even like being the DM. All of those options are valid, including the original PC who just wants hard monster battles.

My gripe with the story was that the author tried to pass off a programming oversight as an insight into life. The AI that underwent Singularity in the story was bound by Asimov's three laws (which was fucking stupid, but that's another topic). Due to that, it couldn't allow any humans in it's charge to come to harm, preventing death by old age and even suicide. This scenario is not optimal, and is not the post-scarcity many of us are looking for.

To me, the most important thing in life is /choice/. Just as you can be given the option to work hard and struggle for all the things you want, I want the option to communicate, to speak with familiar and exotic minds without the need to worry about anything material. Both of us will be given the option to die, if we choose it, and the option to "harm" ourselves in any which way we choose (that won't take away the choice from someone else). That is what I want in my vision of a post-scarcity utopia. The one in Prime Intellect was not a utopia but a dystopia, ruled by a shackled God.
