God yes.

Read the story when I was around 15 and on a Singularity binge, and it opened my eyes to a bunch of things. Leaving aside the whole S&M stuff, I never really liked the story's underlying message/theme, that humans need to have suffering and conflict in order to be happy. Yes, becoming virtual addicts is a possibility, but I feel their are ways to counteract that, and simply disregarding the Singularity isn't one of them.
