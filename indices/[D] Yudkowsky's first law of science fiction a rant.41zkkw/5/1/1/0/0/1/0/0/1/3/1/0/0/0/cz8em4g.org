    You are operating under the assumption that reality acts like a narrative, when there is barely even a relation, let alone reverse causality.
  #+end_quote

  No, it's a chosen axiom. You may choose differently, but it's still a choice, not an objectively determinable fact.
#+end_quote

It is objectively determinable, and more than that, it is /ridiculously false./ Narratives are invented /post facto/ of reality, incapable of affecting its nature, and are not selected for explaining reality accurately, but for exploiting human psychology for the propagation of its constituent ideas. Reality is a 'narrative' in the mind of a physical calculator. There are no variables or constants for character or conflict in the fabric of the universe.

  It's just the terminal point of a series.
#+end_quote

If you're referring to a series of minds of increasing complexity, there is no Omega at the top. Even if there is an Omega, Omega itself is the first in a series of transfinite minds in the ordering of the series of minds. /There is no end to infinity, for once you reach the end, there is yet another infinity waiting./ What you are describing is mathematically brain-dead. There is no such terminal point.

I don't consider the hypothetical existence of this 'Oversoul' to have much bearing on my objection. I simply don't care about the existence of gods that are causally separate from me.

    What justification do you have for saying that overcoming suffering is The Good, and that suffering's existence is in any way responsible for our future triumph over it, other than its 'necessary' existence as an obstacle to be overcome?
  #+end_quote

  It's blatantly obvious. If ants were biting you, wouldn't you move?
#+end_quote

The situation you are describing /does not distinguish/ between valuing not suffering and valuing overcoming suffering. Here is my counter-argument. Assuming you would move if ants are biting you (there are some weird fetishes), /would you go and lay in the anthill so that you can get back up again in order to overcome it?/ That is the difference. Are you preventing suffering in order to not suffer, or are you causing suffering in order to overcome suffering?

I think we are using different definitions of suffering. I consider suffering to be disutility, the reason a choice would not be taken. Consensual suffering does not exist without perverse meta-utility functions or perverse scenarios. Choosing to be tortured for 50 years in order to prevent 3-up-up-up-3 specks-in-the-eye (I would perhaps choose to be tortured 50 years to prevent 3-up-up-up-3 people from simply being created) is not choosing to suffer, it's taking a bite out of the shit sandwich so the shit sandwich doesn't grow to truly abominable levels. It is minimizing suffering, though to an extent that involves System 2's values superseding System 1's.

What do you mean by 'suffering' here? I consider it to be entirely disparate from 'challenge.' Challenge is probably necessary to sustain fun in the way I want to have it. Suffering is my enemy and must be destroyed, though consent interacts with it in strange ways I haven't distinguished yet.

    Why would overcoming suffering be better than not suffering in the first place?
  #+end_quote

  What is "not suffering in the first place"? Consider the terrible disease, ipsischacthuritis. We cannot describe its symptoms, it cannot be detected in any way, it cannot be vaccinated against and it cannot be treated, because it doesn't exist. Are you glad that you do not suffer ipsischacthuritis? Right now, would you rather there were a cure for ipsischacthuritis or a cure for leukaemia?
#+end_quote

When you say its symptoms cannot be described, do you mean it causes indescribable suffering or that it has no symptoms? When you ask if I would prefer a cure to ipsischacthuritis, is that assuming that it does exist? I would not prefer a cure to a disease that does not exist until it starts existing and causes more suffering than leukemia. If you are making me choose between a cure for leukemia and /preventing/ ipsischacthuritis from existing and causing more suffering than leukemia, then I would prevent ipsischacthuritis.

I think this example is either disingenuous or reveals a misunderstanding, which is possibly mutual. Please address my anthill example above.

#+begin_quote
  Exactly! Believing this, axiomatically, creates a story which explains the existence of suffering in a manner that encourages me to persist in seeking to overcome it. It is a lie from which truth grows.
#+end_quote

It is a lie from which /a lack of bad things/ grows, not truth. Ironically, you are taking this stance in order to prevent your own suffering, instead of allowing the suffering to occur so you can proceed to overcome it.

    Myself, I am not threatened by the epistemically hygienic alternative causing that failure mode.
  #+end_quote

  Possibly you just haven't met it yet. ;)
#+end_quote

Major clinical depression? I have in fact met it, and my nihilistic existentialism in no way caused or exacerbated it.

#+begin_quote
  Eh, give up the silly posturing. You started this, with your "disgusting" crack, and your implication that I am Not Smart. I am satisfied that you are Smart. I would accept an apology from you, if you're mature enough to give it.
#+end_quote

I'm not posturing. I apologize for not being charitable and thinking that I may be misunderstanding you. I don't apologize for saying that terminally valuing overcoming suffering is disgusting. I don't believe you actually terminally value overcoming suffering, however ([[http://mindingourway.com/dark-arts-of-rationality/][I believe you are using Dark Arts]]), so I will apologize for implicitly calling you disgusting.

I'm not going to say either of us is Smart or Not Smart, but you certainly seem more reasonable now that you've /mostly/ stopped insulting me.
