  We're authors in an artsy-motivational sense, but not in the same way as an actual author. We're probably not God either.

It's not a falsifiable, testable, idea and assessing it as such is a category error. The purpose of having ideas in an "artsy-motivational sense"--stories--is to /motivate us/ to advance the art. You may like to think of yourself as this cold and perfect clockwork engine of science, but you're an ape whose wet and warm meat-brain runs on stories. Sorry. It's a good thing though, because the existence of the clockwork engine is ultimately starkly pointless, its achievements mean nothing, and it may as well die now as later.

  How is this any better than not suffering in the first place?
#+end_quote

If I overcame /my/ suffering, whatever it was, I /won/. I survived, I got over it. Depending on exactly what it was, I may have kept scars, and I may even have /diminished/ capacity to address future problems of a similar kind (eg, recovery from cancer leaving me with a weaker immune system) - but I am now permitted to frame my self-view as a survivor of that thing, as stronger than it.

Alternatively if I /learned/ from overcoming a problem (eg, I graduated from college, I successfully fixed the problem with my car, I built a loving relationship with another human), I may have gained skills that are useful in addressing similar problems.

Alternatively, if it killed me, or caused me some great harm, this might motivate somebody else to attempt to address that problem.

  Being challenged is more meaningful (at an individual level, not an objective one) than having a break from suffering.
#+end_quote

This is pretty much a re-statement of my point. Life is the search for meaning. If we extrapolate out our individual subjective searches for meaning to /everyone else/, then it's close enough to objective (for my purposes, yours may differ).
