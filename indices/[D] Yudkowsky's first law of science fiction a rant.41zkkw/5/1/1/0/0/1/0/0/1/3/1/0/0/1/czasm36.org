  if the existence of an Oversoul is chosen as an axiom, then one of its roles within the system is to serve as the terminal arbiter of values.

The problem with this argument is that it's self-defeating. You don't understand how the world truly works -- which is unsurprising, since no one does -- but, instead of challenging yourself to find the answer, you are simply asserting that there is an Oversoul who is responsible for deciding what's important.

You are giving up agency on the very foundational questions of reality: What /is/? How does the universe work at the deepest level? What matters? Why choose one action over another?

Why would you do that if you feel that challenge is what matters?
