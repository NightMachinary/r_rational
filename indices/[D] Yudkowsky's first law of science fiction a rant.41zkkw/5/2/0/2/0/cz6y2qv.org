#+begin_example
  [text](#s "spoiler text")
#+end_example

This works fine on mobile. It puts a black bar over the text and, when you click / highlight, you can read it. It's the new version,

#+begin_example
   [text](/s "spoiler text") 
#+end_example

that doesn't work; it puts the text into a tooltip that doesn't work on iPhone.
