  Can you give me your browser info?
#+end_quote

OSX 10.11, Firefox 43.0.4.

AdBlockPlus installed but disabled, ditto User Style Manager. RES installed and active. No other addons that seem relevant.

  Also, do you have Reddit Enhancement Suite installed?
#+end_quote

Yes.

EDIT: It still looks the same (i.e. the tooltip version) when I disable RES. Also looks the same in Chrome Version 47.0.2526.111 (64-bit)
