I agree with almost all your points, save for the inclusion of Inviolate.

While several fics in DC have done the twist that Inviolate did, when you find out the real antagonists involved they are certainly still a significant threat to the main character, despite his optimization. I don't agree that it hits stage 4, excepting maybe the epilogue, which I'm glad ended the story there - any continuation from that point could have been bad.

Similarly, it's hard to justify stage 4 on Oh God am I the Mannis Now - the SI is in a setting with provable supernatural elements which hard trump any non-supernatural foes with no or little counter to them and no access to supernatural strength himself. He's also a lot more realistic in the sense of not remembering all of the minutiae of modern technology to be able to perfectly recreate it at will.

Trying to write my own SI story however, I can understand the problems. I tried to solve it by choosing a main setting which is basically impossible to directly overpower because the existing foes and threats in the setting are Worm level of dangerous and less concerned about stealth or collateral.

I also eliminate all my SI's knowledge of the setting until a significant point in the story - they have to optimize from their modern perspective but without meta-knowledge.

Also important is creating a specific storyboard early on to figure out where the story is going, and how it's going to get there. I'm still working on that, but I've got the major events planned out in such a way that those familiar with the setting shouldn't consider anything as Deus Ex Machina.

I'm considering adding in a canon plot device to help with avoiding that issue by providing a reason for what are effectively cutscenes of some of the opposition.
