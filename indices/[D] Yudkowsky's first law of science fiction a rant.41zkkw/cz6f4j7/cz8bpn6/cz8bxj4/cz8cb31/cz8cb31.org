Oh you don't need to keep the reader in the dark in order to hide it from your SI. What With This Ring did was essentially not directly inserting himself into the story but an alternate version of himself that just happened to never read or hear anything about the particular story he got inserted into. Imagine for example if you were to write a GoT self insert but one where the SI character isn't you but someone from an identical alternate universe where ASOIAF never came to TV and you never stumbled across any notable mention of the books.

Or you could just go the specific amnesia route like in that Warcraft/MtG crossover I once read where the SI had a magical amnesia make him forget every last detail about anything Warcraft or MtG related (along with a few other things that slowly came back to him).
