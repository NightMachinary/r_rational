What isn't often considered in these stories that a rational individual won't always succeed even if they behave perfectly rationally throughout the entire story. Actually, in some setting, they will still be more likely to fail. You can't think you're way out of everything. Born during the black plague? Maybe you have a higher chance of survival, but you're not going to recreate all scientific knowledge since then. You still have a good chance of dying. Maybe you can attempt to escape to an unpopulated area, but can you get there in time?

Are you an illiterate farmer in a poverty stricken region l? You may eventually succeed, but there is no garuntee. Disease, famine, loyalty to family, and natural disasters could all easily stop you.

Even in a modern setting you can't always prevent a car crash. A rational character isn't a perfect one. They also should still make mistakes unless they are somehow omniscient.

Once you introduce magic it becomes more difficult, but assuming the power has obvious limitations that need to be worked around (not just unlocked by figuring out one key fact), you should still be able to have an interesting story.

Also, a rational character may learn faster, but they don't learn instantaneously. Someone experienced could still have the upper hand.

Anything else you've noticed along these lines? Ways to create difficulty for a rational character in a magical setting without giving them an equally intilligent antagonist (which is definitely a viable option, but I'm curious to see what else there is)?
