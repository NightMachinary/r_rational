I don't think the Dresden/ASOIAF one was meant to be a rational fic, or even one with much challenge. It always felt like a slice of life fic with some munchkining and industrial revolution porn (there has to be a better term for "character from the future introduces new technologies and advances the setting to the next era", but I can't remember it) to me.

And we don't know yet if the Mannis one is going to turn bad, you're kind of assuming.

And the problem with Worm fics is that [[#s][]] With that example to follow it's no wonder people have trouble writing good Worm villains. Also there's a delicate equilibrium of villainy in Brockton Bay and adding original characters or buffing established villains kind of messes that up.

But I agree with you. Stories need to spend more time in the planning stage, which unfortunately Spacebattles doesn't really agree with. They're all "hey let's turn this 1k word drabble into a 50k word unfinished story with no planning in between". It kinda sucks.
