I see a lot of people dislike it when protagonists become over powered, but I honestly kinda enjoy that kind of fiction from time to time.

And what you call whish fulfillment porn is what I call a satisfactory end to a book or series where characters faced a lot of difficulties.

I honestly hate it when long works end abruptly: "Oh, yeah, after 10 000 pages we finally defeated the big bad, the remaining good guys now have some power and time to use it to better the world while their enemies are dead and the worst problems taken care of. Imagine what could happen. The end."

In the same vein I /do/ enjoy "Giving Radio to the Romans" fiction. I like world building and problem solving without action, combat and classic enemies, just the improving the world.
