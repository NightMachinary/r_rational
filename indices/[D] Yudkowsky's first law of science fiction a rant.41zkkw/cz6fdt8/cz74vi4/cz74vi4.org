  I don't think the Dresden/ASOIAF one was meant to be a rational fic, or even one with much challenge. It always felt like a slice of life fic with some munchkining and industrial revolution porn

I agree. The pattern still happened though.

The payoff of industrial revolution porn happens at the very beginning (when the time traveller is all "look at this cool idea!" and everyone else goes "oh my god this is the best thing ever") and again years or decades down the line (when all the cool ideas finally become widespread reality). I really enjoy this genre. But like many others, ASOIAFTWAMF makes the mistake of sticking to an almost day-to-day pace rather than jumping ahead. So it starts awesome and then gradually degrades.

And the author probably realizes this on some level, so to keep us entertained they tried to add in threats. But because the protagonist is a millionaire demigod gadgeteer (with [[#s][]]) in a low-fantasy setting, and because there's no buildup (since the author started out writing a peaceful slice-of-life story with no antagonist), it falls flat.

The pattern has already happened. Maybe it'll get better in the future, sure. But from where I stand, on chapter 1.16, it has fully entered the "[[#s][]]" phase.

Compare e.g. /The Two Year Emperor/. Fairly similar setup, fairly similar snowballing start, but the threats escalate /even faster/, so the protagonist remains on the brink of disaster for the entire story. And when he [[#s][]]

  Stories need to spend more time in the planning stage, which unfortunately Spacebattles doesn't really agree with.

Yeah, this is probably the root of the problem. You can't skip the boring bits to get straight to the awesome bits, and then end, if you don't even know where the awesome bits are going to be - and at what point they'll stop coming.
