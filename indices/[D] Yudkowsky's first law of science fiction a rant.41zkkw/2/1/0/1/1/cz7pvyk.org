It wouldn't necessarily mean they'd lose. And should it matter? Why can't a story end badly, to keep us on our toes and help us not take it for granted that the story has a nice end?

I don't mean harder by crippling the MC, but making the enemy a bit more sane, or just removing the plot armor and making the hero actually earn the win or something.
