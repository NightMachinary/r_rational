If the original work was well-written, the protagonist probably spent a lot of time on the brink of defeat. Upping the difficulty would just mean making them lose. Or maybe relying on the butterfly effect to save them, but I don't think that would be very satisfying.

Of course, there's lots of fanfics of bad works too. I can't think of an answer to your question though. I don't know any Jedi Frodo in a Wheelchair story either. Jedi Frodo With a Limp, at worst. I'm sure a few exist, but on the whole, fanfics writers just don't like making their characters' lives harder.
