I won the Rational Horror prompt here when the writing contests began ( I think it was the second or third prompt?) with a story called [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PmC1LfBHH2poxcgKJZRjDprwWLrlOgD3zHG9o_OIRvk/edit][The Real You]], though my little sticky note flair thing disappeared when I modified my flair.

I don't consider it my best work personally, I wrote it in about an hour and a half after reading the prompt, and have only done cursory editing.

For the new story I'm working on, I'm trying to get a good percentage of it done before I start posting - my writing style is not conducive to small daily tidbits, I go back and reedit, add sections, or flesh out a beginning skeleton several times in the process. Things get moved around, reorganized, or changed in wording.

Having read an obscene amount of fiction, I've gotten to the point where I can instinctively tell what turns of phrase are good and evoke relevant imagery and which ones are jarring and remove you from the scene. An improperly worded sentence or description can be worse for immersion in a story than a nonsense plot point or even a blatant misspelling. Because I'm hyper aware of this, I nitpick my own writing to the hilt, and my speed suffers a lot.
