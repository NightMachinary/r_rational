It's necessary for me for plot based reasons, plus my SI would act /significantly/ differently if he knew exactly which world he was in.

I'm still not sure how long I can keep the reader from knowing. I have at least 5 or 6 chapters of prologue before the reveal planned, and I'm sure that even specifically choosing words and phrases to obfuscate, it's going to come out pretty fast.
