It's kind of implied (pretty much everywhere) that he has confidence in his ability to manage or at least circumvent his problems. He doesn't lack self-esteem, since one of his inner goals is to prove himself and become independent. It's more that he's frequently being set with problems that he cannot outright solve, and so he always feels the need for improvement.

Also, he's not the type to just stroke his ego by putting a beat-down on his friend just to feel better.

The great thing about MoL is that the reader has a general feel of where Zorian's skills are at currently. It's already assumed that no student at the academy is a match for him because of his hidden mind magic edge.

Regarding your final point about the author putting limitations on Zorian and your desire for min-maxing in the time loop, you seem to be falling prey to the planning fallacy! It's definitely true that the author wants to control the growth rate of Zorian to avoid a potential Gary Stu, but a realistic learning curve usually doesn't involve min-maxing. It's just like a game: you can't min-max without sufficient *info + time*.
