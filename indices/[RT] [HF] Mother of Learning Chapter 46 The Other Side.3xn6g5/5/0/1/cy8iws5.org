I agree that a reset button would be more useful than a suicide button. However, a switch on a soul that kills that soul seems like something easily doable, while a switch on a soul that affects the entire loop may be less feasible, especially since we don't know how complex the magic used to create the loop was. Also, why give Zack the power to affect the loop in such a way? When Zack dies, does it reset the entire loop or does it just reset both of them, while Red Robe and everyone else continue until the summer festival?
