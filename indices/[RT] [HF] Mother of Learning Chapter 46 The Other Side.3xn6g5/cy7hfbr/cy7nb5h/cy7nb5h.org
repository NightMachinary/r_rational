We can't be sure yet, but that would be a slightly strange decision.

In the worst case scenario of there being no loop active while you have a marker, the switch would kill you instead of doing nothing.

In the best case scenario of there being a loop active, the effect of the two options is the same.

No gain, but additional risk.

Mind you, I wouldn't be surprised if mages did not think this way - this is more reminiscent of software design than anything else.
