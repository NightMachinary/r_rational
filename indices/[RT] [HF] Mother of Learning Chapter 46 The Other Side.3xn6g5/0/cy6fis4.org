Huh. I wonder how that loop-reset actually works. If it straight up resets the whole loop, then Zach has got to have noticed it when Zorian used it here. More than that, Red Robe may or may not notice that something new happened - Zach didn't die, yet the loop reset pre-maturely (assuming he's keeping some sort of tabs on Zach).

And of course, there's the question of the other switches. Now /those/ are interesting. What settings could a time-loop even have? Length? A button to bring someone else inside? Perhaps some useful minor features, such as teleportation to the origin of the loop?

None of the above seem likely, so I really do wonder.
