What makes you suspect that it was a /loop reset/ switch, and not a more simple /suicide/ switch?\\
A loop reset feature would have to be developed wholecloth specifically for the sake of the time loop spell, where as a suicide switch may have already been pre-existing soul magic.\\
Since for a looper it has essentially the same function (unless you are accidentally in the loop like Zorian) it would seem more practical to reuse an existing spell.
