  It was established that red robe does not have a marker, as only himself and Zach showed up in the location spell he used.

He could have a different marker that wouldn't be located by the spell but would give him the same funcitons. Like usernames on a forum, with Zorian piggybacking on Zach's. It's not necessarily "The Marker", it could be "a marker".
