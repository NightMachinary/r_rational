There's clear evidence that the mechanism that Red Robe uses to time travel is not the marker. It was established that red robe does not have a marker, as only himself and Zach showed up in the location spell he used. He likely does not know of the marker's existence, as Zorian only protected himself from being located that way months after their initial confrontation and it would have been trivial for him to locate Zorian before that.
