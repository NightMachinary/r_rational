  It was a belt.

  A black leather belt. With a stainless steel plate for a buckle.

  I took it out. It wasn't a bad looking belt --- in fact, it was quite handsome. I wondered what I could wear it with --- almost anything actually; it was just a simple black belt. It had a peculiar feel to it though; the leather flexed like an eel, as if it were alive and had an electric backbone running through it. The buckle too; it seemed heavier than it looked, and --- well, have you ever tried to move the axis of a gyroscope? The torque resists your pressure. The belt buckle felt like that.

  I looped it around my waist to see what it would look like. Not bad, but I had belts I liked better. I started to put it back in the box when it popped open in my hand. The buckle did.

  I looked at the buckle more closely. What had looked like a single plate of stainless steel was actually two pieces hinged together at the bottom, so that when you were wearing the belt you could open it up and read the display on the inside of the front. It was a luminous panel covered with numbers.

  But the only thing that looked like a trademark said TIMEBELT. Everything else was display. Two of the rows of numbers kept flickering, changing to keep track of the tenths of seconds, the seconds, and the minutes. Also indicated were the hours, the day, the month, the year---

  There were too many numbers on that dial. There were four rows of numbers, and a row of lights and some lettering. The whole thing looked like this:

  And there was something else I hadn't noticed. The other part of the buckle --- the side facing the clock --- was divided into buttons. There were four rows of them, all square and flush with each other. The top row was cut into two; the second row, six; the third row, three; and the bottom row, six again.

  My curiosity was piqued. Now, what were all these for?

  I touched one of the top two. The letter B on the lower right side of the panel began to glow. I touched it again and the letter F above it winked on instead. All right -- but what did they mean?

  I put the belt around my waist and fastened it. Actually, it fastened itself; the back of the clasp leaped against the leather part and held. I mean, held. I tugged at it, but it didn't slip. Yet I could pop it off as easily as separating two magnets. Quite a gimmick that.

  The buckle was still open; I could read the numbers on it easily. Almost automatically my hand moved to the buttons. Yes, that was right -- the buttons were a keyboard against my waist, the panel was the readout; the whole thing was a little computer.

  But what in hell was I computing?

  Idly I touched some of the buttons. The panel blinked. One of the dates changed. I pressed another button and the center row of lights flickered. When I pressed the first button again, a different part of the date changed. I didn't understand it, and there was nothing in the box except some tissue paper.

  Maybe there was something on the belt itself I took it off.

  On the back of the clasp, it said:

  TIMEBELT

  TEMPORAL TRANSPORT DEVICE

  Temporal Transport Device--? Hah! They had to be kidding.

  A time machine? In a belt? Ridiculous. And then I found the instructions.

  --------------

  The instructions were on the back of the clasp -- when I touched it lightly, the words TIMEBELT, TEMPORAL TRANSPORT DEVICE winked out and the first “page” of directions appeared in their place. Every time I tapped it after that, a new page appeared. They were written in a land of linguistic shorthand, but they were complete. The table of contents itself ran on for several pages:
