I'm a little surprised he didn't bring Edwin's golem along. Just promise to give it back the day after the festival.

Not using it for the hook gnomes' distraction role makes sense, that certainly wouldn't look like a random monster attack. But he could have brought it with him, just as another tool that might come in handy, especially after showing it is decently robust.

Is the golem not stealthy enough to bring or something?
