Upon re-reading recent chapters, I've been wondering: how fast could Zorian cast force lance, if he practiced for a while? From chapter 45, here's a description of the spell:

  'Force lance', as the spell was called, was her new favorite when fighting him. He knew better than to try to shield against it this time -- the beam was practically designed for cracking simple force barriers, focusing an immense amount of penetrating force on a tiny patch of the shielding surface. Some of the stronger, more advanced shields could withstand the beam, but nothing in Zorian's arsenal could truly stand up to it. He had learned that lesson very painfully in the first few spars he'd had with Taiven during the past few days, and he still had bruises all over his chest and arms to prove it. Even at their highest setting, the safety wards couldn't blunt the power of the spear-like beam completely.

  No, the only realistic defense he had against that spell was moving out of its way. The good news was that beam spells like those couldn't home in on targets, so dodging them was an option. The bad news was that a beam traveled blindingly fast and was really hard to evade at the distances he and Taiven fought at.

It pierces basic shields, it travels extremely fast, and it sounds like it can really mess somebody up if it hits. This sounds like it could be really impressive if Zorian can cast it before a foe knows what's coming.
