I think RR probably has a vested interest in what happens in Cyoria, and as I mentioned above, we can expect he's paying some attention to deviations in Cyoria for any hint of a time looper. After all, he spent quite a lot of time on Cyoria's invasion for some reason and now he ditched it because he's presumably afraid of hidden loopers.
