The worst case scenario here is that Sudomir is in contact with RR and prepared to give RR a summary of the month and any notable deviations at the end of the loop. It's just a vague possibility, but Sudomir so far doesn't seem invested enough with the Ibasans and his necromancer status suggests a potential tie-in with RR.

Recall spell: wards might prevent that too? Concealing face/voice: do we know that Zorian wasn't disguised? He is growing bigger balls as his skills progress though...
