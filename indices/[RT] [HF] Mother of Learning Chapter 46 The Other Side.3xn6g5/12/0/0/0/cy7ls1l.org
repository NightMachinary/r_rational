You got me thinking and after some further consideration I'm putting StRR in the 'falsified' basket and Sudomir liaison of RR in 'unlikely' basket.

If Sudomir is to report to Red Robe at the end of the month, Zorian should've been soul-killed. Zorian made a pretty big splash from Sudomir's POV: saving Lukav and Alanic and then becoming apprentice in plain view. This has drawn attention from Sudomir to outright assassinate Zorian in one restart. This should've been reported to Red Robe who could infer that Zorian is time traveler or is connected to one. Moreso if Sudomir is in the loop directly. But nothing of the sort happened, therefore either Sudomir is giving RR a /very/ cursory overview, or RR put Sudomir in the 'invasion' folder and therefore has avoided contacts with him in the past several restarts, or, quite likely, they are not connected at all.

In any case, in this particular restart Zorian dodged the bullet by resetting the loop prematurely. There was no time to report to RR even if Sudomir and RR stay in touch.

As for concealment measures, they were outright mentioned in confrontation with RR, and were /not/ mentioned this time. Anti-recall wards seem possible in the setting, but again, a failed attempt to recall should be mentioned. Luckily these errors could be rectified with small edits.
