Knez is a bit more easier to pronounce , one letter one sound and same meaning, but I think knyaz is more poetic.

ny is bit harder for those with English only since no equivalent sound, it is very fast combo of November and Yogurt, need to break tongue in between those sounds, it sounds like nasal N.
