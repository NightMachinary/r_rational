The recall spell establishes a magical link between a caster and a prepared object. The link must be supplied with mana to keep existing and - though I seem to have not explicitly spelled this out in the story - has range limitations. Any recall link Zorian may have had in Cyoria would have been severed when the gate closed shut on him.
