Wow Zorian is now even closer to invulnerability, if he can activate his switch before someone kills him, he can restart the loop (apparently, not confirmed yet, but if it didn't and he just died there would be no point). He can now do anything dangerous he wants that doesn't alert red robe. I wonder how zack will react to getting restarted randomly.

In this chapter we finally get to see some inkling of what Zorian can do untethered. His skills are not suited for a duel with taiven. If Zorian fights he fights with a pet golem, dominated animals, a plethora of powerful items and mind magic attacks. Like I said in the previous thread Zorian is nerfing himself hard to fight taiven on an even playing field, which could be the purpose. I really would like at least a line about that though.

I've revised my opinion on using mercenaries like I advocated in the previous thread, that is best saved for the final fight. Though I still think it's a REALLY good idea to get a lot of teachers, illegal books etc with money from dungeon diving. How many useful spells can you accumulate with a large budget that replenishes once a month? A lot. Maybe he can actually cast a moving shield instead of a stationary one then. (I still think stationary shields are kind of useless)

If Zorian was a bit more sociable it'd be a good strategy for him to go around finding "one month recruitables" as I call them. People who over the course of a month he can recruit to fight against the invaders. Just focus on one person a month that seems likely to help and try and figure them out at the end of the month tell them about the invasion and get them to fight with you. If they don't fight when it's obvious invaders are really coming then you try again next month with someone else. If they fight they can join your team. As long as you make sure they are honest people (which he can do with empathy) and you don't give them time to spread the word and possibly alert red robe, there is almost no risk. When the final fight comes he can recruit all of them at once.

Really he should probably try and learn stuff from a necromancer now (with backup to buy him the couple seconds he needs to restart the loop if they try to attack him). Only getting soul sight from some random potion or human sacrifice sounds fishy. There has to be another way. Plus think of all the soul magic he can learn.

With all that in mind the author has stated (according to another reddit user) that Zorian *can* break the loop easily, but that wouldn't make a good story so he put a lot of limitations on Zorian. It just hurts my min-maxing soul for him to not exploit the loop to its greatest extent.
