Well though Taiven was upset about his combat skills, and now she thinks they are on an even playing field when they are not. So basically Zorian is not telling her everything after he said he would tell her everything.

If you think about it he comes off pretty dickish (he's lying) or that he's lacking in self esteem when he says he can't beat taiven consistently after years of constant training, because he can. Not in the same way perhaps, but if he combines his golem stuff, items, mind magic etc he'd mop the floor with any normal battlemage much less a novice one. He is not built for a straight up one-on-one fight, especially a non-lethal one.

That's why I wanted a line about him saying that if he fought the way he normally would taiven would be having a much harder time. Zorian seems to have a magical complex of some sort where he thinks pretty much everyone is better than him, though he's finally getting to see just how far he's come.
