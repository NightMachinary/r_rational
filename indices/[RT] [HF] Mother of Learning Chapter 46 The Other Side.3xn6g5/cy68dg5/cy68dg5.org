Sudomir might be Red Robe, right? I mean, Necromancer: check, obviously powerful: check, has a reason to be involved with the invaders without being fully aligned: check (seems to be the Gate keeper), brags about being hard to kill: check (both Zach and Zorian have done the same).

The only thing that makes it a little unlikely is the fact that he doesn't freak out over someone coming in through the gate in an unprecedented manner. This could be explained by the fact that Red Robe isn't looping in exactly the same manner as Zorian and Zach (otherwise the soul pattern would show up in the scans), and might experience it differently somehow.
