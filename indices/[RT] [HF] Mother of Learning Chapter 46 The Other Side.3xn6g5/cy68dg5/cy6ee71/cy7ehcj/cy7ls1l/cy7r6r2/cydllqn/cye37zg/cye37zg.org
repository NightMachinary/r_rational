I have no idea how to explain the pronunciation, but the words have been lifted almost wholesale from Slavic languages and mean 'Prince's Gates'/'Gates of the Prince'. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knyaz][Knyaz]] is Prince, and Dveri are doors. The pronunciation is self-evident to me (me being Slavic and all), so I'm having trouble constructing a pronunciation guide. Try messing around with translation sites and see if they can help you.
