I think Sudomir the Red Robe is very unlikely.

Necromancer: check. Obviously powerful: not enough power. Wears Red Robes: no check!

It doesn't make sense for StRR to abandon invasion like he did in the past several restarts but then be still there for the final (failing) part. This token effort is meaningless. No, the actual Red Robe is doing something bigger somewhere out there. And the question why Red Robe invested time in invasion optimization is still a good one. So far I don't see any clues except that maybe it is a big distraction and nothing more.

But the possibility of StRR raises a question why the hell did Zorian forget about recall spell, why he did not conceal his face, why he did not conceal his voice... And why he had built his escape upon an untested feature of the most enigmatic asset: his soul marker? Reckless, utterly reckless. Zach's soul bits are really rubbing off on him.
