It /could/ be that RR simply doesn't happen to know the locating spell - it's not necessarily common knowledge.

If he does know of the marker, he could also be hiding his own. But then he would also have to know of the possibility of the location spell (and therefore he would almost certainly have it, and have no issues locating Zorian) - so that's /very/ unlikely.

Mind you, I fully agree with your assessment. I was just thinking on some other possibilities.
