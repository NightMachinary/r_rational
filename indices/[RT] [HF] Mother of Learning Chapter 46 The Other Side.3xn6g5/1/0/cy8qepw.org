  Why would RR need Cyoria burned to the ground?
#+end_quote

Something I thought of was that RR wants to be able to tap into the huge amount of ambient mana emanating from the Hole, magnified by the alignment event, without any interference from the city mages and city services like the teleportation network. Maybe destroying the city forces everyone else to either die or flee, giving more mana for RR to utilize.\\
The problem with this is since the reset and invasion happen concurrently, there doesn't seem like there would be enough time to "power-up" anything significant.\\
And I also suspect that ambient mana is so inefficiently utilized, like solar power, that all of Cyoria is probably barely impacting the raw amount of power, if RR were capable of harnessing all of it somehow.
