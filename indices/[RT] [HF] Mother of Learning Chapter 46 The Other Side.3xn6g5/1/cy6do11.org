So my little prediction that the gateway leads to Iaksu Mansion came true. Neat[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3urv1v/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_45_fine/cxr3ibu][.]]

Seeing Sudomir as the necromancer-in-charge there could probably explain the soul mage massacre. Maybe he wants to grab more power via open revolt in the aftermath of Cyoria invasion and doesn't want any soul mage to be a threat to his army of undead.

And I can't stop seeing sort of mini quests lying around like little jigsaw pieces that could probably click together perfectly. Raynie is wolf shifter, wolf shifters hate +dire+ winter wolves, there is a WW alpha to kill, let the girl help and let her take the credit. Boom, a little ruckus in the shifter tribe politics.

Oh, Zach and Red Robe are VERY SURPRISED right now.

/add:/ so after going for a walk and a bit of thinking I retract my statement I made elsewhere that for Red Robe investment in Ibasan invasion is a distraction. This does not warrant his reaction in ch. 26. Who goes in guns blazing when your decoy plot is foiled? Maybe RR is not properly paranoid and is overly impulsive instead, but that's not worth considering. "The enemy is smart" and all that. Why would RR need Cyoria razed to the ground, I don't understand. Especially if Daimen is connected to/is RR. There are cheaper ways to get your brothers killed, Daimen!

Putting on my Doylist hat here I'd say we will have some insight on that in the next chapter (two max). Zorian has to open that memory packet as we are approaching (probably) the end of second arc. The 1st one took us 26 chapters, we're at 46, I think it's time to raise the stakes. Whatever got aranean matriarch so agitated and reckless has some clue to what RR is doing in Cyoria. It's worth noting though, that maybe intel she got was a deliberate ruse. Dozen+ restarts later (there was a handy restart-tracking spreadsheet somewhere) and the loop still looks pretty stable.

How does Zorian open it, IDK. He could capture some low-ranking invader, haul him to Luminous Advocates. They could plant a memory packet inside prisoner's mind, and he would try to read it again and again until he succeeds. Yes I'm a horrible person. So I doubt this will be the route taken, that's too grim.
