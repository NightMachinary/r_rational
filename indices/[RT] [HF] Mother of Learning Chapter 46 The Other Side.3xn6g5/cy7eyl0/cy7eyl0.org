The last time Zack and Zorian met, Zack displayed ridiculously huge mana reserves, which Zorian was suspicious about, but passed off as crazy magical heritage. But now we see that Zorian's power is increasing too:

  He could cast about 35 of them in quick succession, which was more than four times the amount he could cast before the time loop -- that shouldn't be possible, especially since he was sure his mana reserves still hadn't topped out yet, so the most logical conclusion was that his magic missiles required significantly less mana now than they had in the past.

I am fairly confident that this means that the time loop allows loopers to increase their mana indefinitely. This could be a product of a perpetually young body, magical hormones or something allowing their mana reserves to grow without aging to trigger the reserves to stop growing.
