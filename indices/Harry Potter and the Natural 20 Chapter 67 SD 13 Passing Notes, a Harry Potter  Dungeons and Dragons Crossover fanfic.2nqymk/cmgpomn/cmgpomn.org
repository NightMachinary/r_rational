Amazing chapter as always. Still, I wonder how Dementors will react to Milo given I'm unsure if they should be treated like torture or mind magic, which Milo seems to be able to shrug of easily or more as living a "goodness" vacuums to be introduced to a good-aligned character with potentially disastrous, temporary alignment flipping results.

Any thoughts?
