I have just binged Scar's Samsara, and mostly liked it.

I have some issues with Diabolus Ex Machina in recent chapters, but overall it is an entertaining read.

Still, it is hard for me to take Disney-based universe of talking animals seriously. It is a fun deconstruction, but I have hard time imagining it working at all.
