Sigh, one of the annoying things about "new reddit" layout is that it effectively erases the old sidebar (which, in our case, was pretty well written and effectively summarized what we're about).

Most subreddits for some reason have dealt with this by hastily writing a new sidebar, rather than copy-pasting the old one. I guess someone for some reason hastily added a "weekly" rule during this re-write.

We're really /not/ an active enough subreddit for that sort of rule to make sense. If someone was spamming the same work over and over maybe, but there is a chapter update here, so it's arguably a different work. I vote you just go ahead and post and ask for forgiveness if the mods don't like it.
