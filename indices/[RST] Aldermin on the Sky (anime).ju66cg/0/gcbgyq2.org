I liked the story, but there were two things that really grated at me.

First, the use of kids in the military. This is a Japanese story, so it would be odd if the main characters /weren't/ kids, but even so... I get that there's a bunch of cultural differences at play here, but it still comes across as wrong. There's the obvious (and most important) problem of having child soldiers, but there's also this weird disjoint when you see a teen ordering around adults.

Second relates to your cons - the way women (or in this case girls) are portrayed. This is a pet peeve of mine, but it seems Japanese authors don't realize women in fantasy settings can wear pants. Like, they're going to war, they pack all their gear and get everything ready...and the female lead is wearing a miniskirt and stockings.

(I don't remember the MC sexually harassing anyone, but I might have just blanked that out. I wouldn't be surprised given how common it is in Japanese art/media.)

Like I said, the story itself is good, so if you can look past these things you'd enjoy it. It has quite a few tropes that are common in Japanese stories, but for the most part I'd agree it is rational.
