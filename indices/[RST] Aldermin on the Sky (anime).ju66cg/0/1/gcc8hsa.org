I've only read the light novel translation, but agree with you both. A large numbers of elements are very stereotypically "anime" in character archetypes, plot beats, and the setting in such a way that detracts from the experience. While I did overall enjoy reading it, some additional areas of concern are in the character interaction, which can seem rather surreal the way it goes while the characters are in a warzone. The variety and soundness of the MC's strategy can very from realistically impressive to feeling like deus ex machina. The MC can be both likeable but also quite irritating on times. The views on sexuality go all over the place from quasi-progressive views to full on typical sexism. Politics seem to lack nuance and I also have objections to the way it portrays science.

I'm left feeling profoundly mixed. There are a lot of parts I enjoy, but serious issues as well.

I think a fanfic writer could do quite a bit with the setting, characters, and overarching plot, if they made some changes.

This brings to mind another fairly similar series, both available on Skythewood translations, Altina the Sword Princess which has a similar list of issues and strengths, but also interesting depictions of tactics and some fairly solid fight scenes.

When it comes to anime war stories, albeit less tactics focused, an anime I like quite a bit is called Flag. Pause and Select did a good [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW75SnALjEc][video]] on it. I'm not sure where you can find it anymore, though.

One final series I like, is the first volume of a series called 86. It's quite powerfully written as a stand alone piece, but I feel that the sequels are not nearly as strong. While it is also "anime" feeling (teenagers in mechs, sent to die, etc.) much of it feels more maturely done than anything other than Flag. I really enjoyed reading it.
