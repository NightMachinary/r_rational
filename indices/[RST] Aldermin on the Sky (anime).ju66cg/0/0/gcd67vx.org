  the way women (or in this case girls) are portrayed. This is a pet peeve of mine, but it seems Japanese authors don't realize women in fantasy settings can wear pants. Like, they're going to war, they pack all their gear and get everything ready...and the female lead is wearing a miniskirt and stockings.

I mean, I haven't watched this show but it sounds like the typical stock LN adaptation. Thing is, a lot of these start pretty much with the express purpose of being wish fulfillment power fantasies for a certain demographic, and very little beyond that in terms of ambition. There's a few exceptions (such as Tanya the Evil being more of a satire - though it can still be read as a power fantasy if you're kind of ignoring its subtext), but in general, the miniskirt part is simply for the purposes of fanservice. Because regardless of the world of the story, its /purpose/ is to please/arouse male readers, and so they'll end up having miniskirts. Which obviously runs right counter any concept of "rationality" in the story itself.
