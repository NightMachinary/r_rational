I concur. I find myself constantly off-balance when I watch anime. The characters /look/ like they are underage but at least in this story the main characters (except the princess) are said to be 18. It makes me uncomfortable but I can look past that if the rest of the story is good as is the case here.

But it also rules out watching it with my family, because I don't want to normalize portraying girls in this manner. Which is a pity because the tactical stuff is cool
