I also think Altina got dropped without being completed in favor of the author's other series, which I find to be pretty much the worse kind of isekai slave trash.

Please let me know what you think of 86. [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/86/][Here's]] a page about it. The pages can be accessed via the wayback machine. It doesn't really count as rational IMHO, but it's a good read. Also, from what I've read, apparently things pick up again around volume 4, but YMMV.

Finally, another interesting rational-adjacent light novel, but not tactics focused, is May Your Soul rest in Magdala, by the author of Spice and Wolf, but this time about early alchemy that seems to be transitioning to chemistry. It can be found [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/may-your-soul-rest-in-magdala/][here]]. This too has its flaws, but feels very unique. In addition to the fact that some of the alchemy experiments are things that I have really done in my college chemistry class another thing that I like about it is that the mc is flawed and the story acknowledges this as they slowly grow over time. I think it is well done.
