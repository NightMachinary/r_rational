I've only watched a few episodes of the anime and I pretty much agree entirely. I have to say I didn't find the MC likable at all. He acts arrogant, but the show tries to convince you that it's just an act and he's actually wise. It doesn't really work and I just found him more irritating. I also didn't like the female lead either. I can't really explain why this annoyed me so much, but there's a scene where she solos a platoon of soldiers and I hated it. I think it's mostly because how the MC comforts the female lead after that scene. It just felt so nauseatingly fake.

I enjoyed Altina the Sword Princess considerably more, although I got bored of it after a few volumes. It has similar flaws but the story is lighter in tone, the characters are more likeable, and the humor is less cringy. The worldbuilding is less ambitious, but more believable and logically consistent.

I'm trying to find stories where the main character is an underdog tactical genius, but I've haven't had a lot of luck. Probably the best ones I've read are the How to Train Your Dragon books (very different from the movies btw), but that's aimed at elementary schoolers. 86 sounds interesting though, I'll check it out.
