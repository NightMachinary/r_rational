"This is a pet peeve of mine, but it seems Japanese authors don't realize women in fantasy settings can wear pants."

For an antidote to this, try watching Seirei no Moribito. It's a rather well told fantasy, with a strong female protagonist, in her 30s, who wears pants, and some of the side characters even use the scientific method.
