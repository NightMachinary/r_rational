Seconding. The protagonist is like a more frivolous version of Yang Wen-li (LoGH). The show diminishes its potential gravitas by embracing some too-anime-esque ideas, but it manages to find some depth about halfway into it. A minor masterpiece with a focus on the ability to survive, and on what it means to be a leader who deserves respect rather than has it given to him by rank or by violence. I'd say its characterized by a low-key idealism about the latter.

This is the second time I've seen a casually stated disapproval of how women are depicted in a work on this sub and felt both the desire to respond and hesitance to get involved in the argument, in part just to avoid stirring up trouble. I'll just surmise that I can't be alone in this feeling, and say that the heroine was an excellent character. Though, again, it does have some of the usual anime cringe, so I wouldn't necessarily watch it in front of family.
