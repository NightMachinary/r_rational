There isn't any really rational anime, but there are certain ones that I enjoyed.

â€‹

Code Geass, Death Note,

Mirai Nikki, Psycho pass,

Attack on Titan, kabaneri

maybe Steins gate

maybe Danganronpa all versions

maybe Guilty Crown,

almost all animes have their silly elements but they could be kinda partially rationalized if you try hard enough
