Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex might be worth a look. It's more about exploring transhumanism than being strictly rationalist I would say, but the central mystery of The Laughing Man is pretty good. It has some pretty interesting episodes too; there's one which is set almost entirely inside a chat room, which happens to be one of my favourite episodes.
