Look; TV shows and movies have been made of many of works of fiction. Among them some very good works, like Death Note. That said, something is invariably lost every time. Who here has watched the Harry Potter movies and thought they were as good as the novels? (Putting aside that HPMOR is better than both, of course.)

This is why I /strongly/ disrecommend watching something in a secondary media, at least until you have consumed the first media. For example: If you haven't had enough Harry Potter after reading the novels, I have no objection to you watching the movies, so long as you are aware that they don't capture the full feeling and flair of the original.

Similarly, read Death Note. Don't watch it, at least not as the primary form you consume it in. It's just not worth. You lose so much.
