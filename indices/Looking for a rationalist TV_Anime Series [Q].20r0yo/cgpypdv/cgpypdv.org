*Shinsekai Yori* (From the New World):

- /Trailer:/ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybgzmTT_SuM][Extended fan-made trailer]]

- /What it's about/: In a far-flung post-apocalyptic future survives an isolated society of small Japanese villages. The community is rigidly controlled and stratified, with a great focus placed upon developing and restraining the natural psychic powers that all humans begin to demonstrate upon hitting puberty. The story follows a group of children as they begin to question the indoctrination imposed upon them and are steadily presented with the reasons and justifications behind it.

- /Why should you watch it?:/ While not explicitly rationalist, there are a lot of crossover points with topics that often come up in such circles, particularly the "conspiracy of silence" around dangerous knowledge, being willing to trade off otherwise essential values such as personal liberty and the lives of innocents in the face of a true existential threat. Shinsekai Yori has, hands down, the best world-building I've ever seen in an anime. It takes its central premise -- ubiquitous psychic powers -- and follows through on the societal consequences that the existence of such a thing would have. As the show goes on, it's made clear that there really are no “heroes” or “villains”, that everyone has their own entirely self-consistent justifications for their actions, which nonetheless conflict with everyone else's. It's a wonderfully morally grey narrative. As an added bonus, Shinsekai Yori is a rare work in that it treats its audience as intelligent: it doesn't directly narrate connections as the characters make them, it shows you flashes and assumes you'll keep up.

- /Caveats/: The start of the show is *slow*, with much more effort being put into setting up a solid foundation for the latter half and in establishing the unique setting than in showing things actually happening. This pays off, but the "mystery" of the early episodes is not enough to sustain interest by itself at times. "Plot holes", particularly with regards to character actions or motivations, only make sense with information gained later on. The sudden time-skip into adolescence around the half-way point makes for a *very* jarring transition episode with every character (including background ones) apparently having paired off romantically. Again, justified later, but still a bit of a sudden change-up from what had been happening up to that point.

- /Theme(s):/ Liberty vs Security. Identity, conformity and indoctrination. Legitimacy of violence. Discrimination.

*Fate/Zero:*

- /Trailer:/ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAIGOt4Eg7A][Fan-made AMV]]

- /What it's about/: The Fourth Holy Grail War: A battle-royale between seven pairs of mages and heroic legends summoned from the past, fighting to the death. The winner is granted an artefact capable of fulfilling their greatest wish, no matter how large.

- /Why watch it/: This is a classic Urobuchi work, balancing psychological and philosophical discussion against heart-pounding action, with little filler or fan-service to get in the way. The animation quality is simply one of the highest out there - the common joke is that ufotable could have bought a small country with what everyone presumes they've invested in this series. But the heart of the show is in the character interactions. This is not a "coming of age" story; every character arrives on the scene with a well-established identity and a coherent set of ethics and morals. The plot is an excuse to throw them up against one another and see what shakes out. The story is gripping and it does a decent job of contrasting different philosophies, with particular attention paid (in typical Urobuchi fashion) to the problems of Utilitarianism and confronting Nihilism. Any anime that explicitly includes a reference to the Trolley Problem merits a look-see, right?

- /Caveats/: This is an adaptation of a story set in a large existing body of work (the so-called "Nasuverse"). As such, the first episode is basically a gigantic infodump where it tries to set up enough context from the source material that the rest of the show can get right down to action without interrupting to explain the mechanics. You *have* to watch the first episode to understand what's going on, but it doesn't sell the series particularly well. Also, the ending, while spectacular, does leave a lot of things unfulfilled, a lot of questions that are only going to be answered in the follow-up Fate/Stay Night re-adaptation coming this Autumn. Everything between the first and last episodes, however, is solid gold.

- /Primary theme(s)/: Conflict of ideologies, with particular focus in the second half given to the conflict between Nihilism and Existentialism/Utilitarianism. The nature of leadership, the place of chivalry.

- /Similar works:/ Anything else by Gen Urobuchi - Madoka Magica or Psycho-Pass. Outside of anime, the Visual Novel of Fate/Stay Night is an obvious follow-up, albeit a major time sink too.

*Madoka Magica:*

This show is one of the hardest to discuss without spoiling in advance, simply because from the description it sounds utterly unlike anything you're asking for. Until it changes. That said:

- /What it's about:/ Madoka Magica begins with the standard "Magical Girl anime" set-up - the moral and upstanding Madoka is approached by two strangers. The first is an adorable-looking alien named Kyubey, who offers to fulfill any wish a teenage girl might have, provided that she's willing to sign on the dotted line and risk her life fighting against strange and dangerous beings known as "witches". The second is a mysterious girl her own age named Homura, who strenuously warns Madoka against taking up the offer.

- /Why watch it:/ Most "Faustian bargain" stories centre around malicious genies looking to exploit loopholes and wreck the entire idea for wishing in the first place. Madoka side-steps that issue immediately - wishes work based on /intent/, and they /always/ come true. Instead, the wisher's comeuppance comes from their inability to deal with the price demanded of them. Madoka Magica is one of the most highly-rated anime series of all time, and for good reason. It's often called a deconstruction of the magical girl genre, though there's some argument as to how accurate that description is. Whether it is or not, after the show gets going, the brakes come off the train as the plot careens towards an action-packed conclusion, with a massive amount of character development stuffed in along the way. The package is completed with a gorgeous soundtrack and a unique approach to animating action sequences that makes this an incredibly memorable series.

- /Caveats:/ This show is *the* reason for the standard "watch three-five episodes before giving up" rule for watching anime. Also, once you strip away the thematic elements that define the show, it /is/ at its heart a Magical Girl series. If you're utterly unwilling to countenance watching it based on that, then, well, fair enough.

- /Themes:/ Faustian bargains. Despair. Some see Buddhist or Christian overtones.

- /Similar works:/ Anything by Gen Urobuchi (*Psycho Pass*, *Fate/Zero*). *Stein's Gate.* If Madoka /does/ get you interested in seeing other decent Magical Girl shows, give *Revolutionary Girl Utena* a go.
