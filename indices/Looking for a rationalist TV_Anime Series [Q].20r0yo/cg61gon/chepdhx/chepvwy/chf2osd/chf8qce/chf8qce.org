Well, I did mention in my recommendation that there was symbolism. I liked it in Mawaru Penguindrum because it is interesting to interpret and gives you an insight into the characters' worldviews, such as Kanba and Himari's different views on fate. It's been a while since I watched the show so I don't remember everything, but there is a bit more to the child broiler than that. It's where unwanted children go.
