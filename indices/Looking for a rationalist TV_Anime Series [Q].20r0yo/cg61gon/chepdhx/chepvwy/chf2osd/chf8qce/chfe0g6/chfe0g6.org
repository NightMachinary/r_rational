So, would you consider it fair to say that Mawaru Penguindrum was a show about angst wrapped up in obscure symbolism? Shoma and Momoka were exceptions as pillars of positive energy, but I don't think they were impactful enough to support the argument that the show had positive themes.

I think the show was chaotic, boring, and shallow. I guess you have to be really entertained by symbolism to give it higher than my 3/10

I don't know that you can change my mind anymore :/ I'll probably pass on Zetsuen no Tempest as well.
