:\ I didn't mean to offend. I watched steins;gate and psychopass and enjoyed them both immensely.

I just really wanted to know why YOU enjoyed mawaru penguindrum and decided to share it with us, I never meant to insult your taste or convince you that you are wrong. I knew going in there was a good chance that I wasn't going to like it, I'm not angry with you at all. I just wanted to try to broaden my tastes, and it didn't work out this time, and I am currently feeling offput by it, that is all.

I hope I didn't ruin your day too much ;c
