Ok. Thank you for wasting my time. I went out of my way to recommend anime to people, but in return people bitch at me in a needlessly confrontational way about the ones I chose to recommend. If you don't like my recommendations, how about investing some of your own time in giving each series you hear about a chance? If you're not willing to do that, you don't have the right to complain about my recommendations. I even tried to discuss the issue with you and the other guy, but neither of you will even accept the simple premise that judging any work of art is entirely subjective. I've never talked to anyone so close-minded and unreasonable on [[/r/rational]]. Go ahead and don't watch Zetsuen no Tempest. You don't deserve to watch a good show.
