Wrong, there is no plot in that story at all.

Also, omitted putting "final" in the five episodes part; my mistake.

But the point still stands, that story created so many plot holes and inconsistencies, it became apparent they just made-up whatever they could the week before making the producing each of the anime episodes. It's more typical than people realize.

The plot twists themselves have no consistency. There was no plot, just a bunch of stupid crap poorly made together with this deluded idea of "mystery" before trying to become some stupid Code Geass wannabe near the end.
