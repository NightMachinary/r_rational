Well, I did say that it wasn't rational. However, it's not stupid. The plot is perhaps needlessly complex, but it serves the characters and the themes well. I get the feeling that you had a hard to time understanding it because you expected the rules of the Mawaru Penguindrum world to be consistent, when in fact they are based on and shaped by emotion. However, they are understandable on an intuitive level even if they aren't logical. Also, the show had more than five episodes and you're not supposed to understand everything within just the first five episodes.
