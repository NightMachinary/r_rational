As far as anime is concerned, Steins;Gate has time travel without plot holes.

In Zetsuen no Tempest, most of the characters act intelligently using the information that they have, and some of the plans they come up with are pretty clever. Zetsuen's first half is better than the second, but the second half still ends well.

Psycho Pass is an anime series that's basically about enlightenment ideals vs. romantic ideals in a dystopia. It's sci-fi and also has some transhuman themes.

Mawaru Penguindrum isn't really rational in that the rules of the world are vaguely explained and makes it difficult to figure out what will happen next, but it has a complex plot with interesting symbolism that is challenging to understand the details of. It's by the creator of Revolutionary Girl Utena.
