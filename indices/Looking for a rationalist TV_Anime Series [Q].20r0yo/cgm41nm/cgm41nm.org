I'd recommend Steins;Gate for a really engaging and human story involving time travel that seems to be /mostly/ internally consistent, with characters smartly trying to figure out why, exactly, time travel is happening and how to fix their mistakes. I love this show because it's a great mix of intellectual stimulation and /mostly/-believable human drama. Note: This is maybe the only the anime that I know of where I /wholeheartedly/ recommend the dub. I think it's absolutely impeccable and most of my friends agreed. There are some legitimately funny (and surprisingly English-centric) pop culture jokes, too. It's two seasons long. Made me cry twice.

I'd also recommend Puella Magi Madoka Magica (a.k.a. Madoka) as well. It's less "rational" and more "people who enjoy content on this subreddit will also enjoy it", in my opinion, but it's a fantastic deconstruction of the magical girl genre. It actually made a lot of people quite mad with this. It had about two episodes of being a straightforward "power of friendship triumphs over things that hold "evil" as a terminal value" show (and was pretty much advertised as such), but took a surprisingly dark turn and didn't turn back. It subverted pretty much everyone's expectations about the general flow of the show. Unfortunately it suffers from the common problem of "everything that's fucking awesome about this thing is a massive spoiler", but there are a /lot/ of bombshells. In terms of overall theme, it deals with some difficulties with utilitarianism, alien value systems, major character death, and powerlessness. If you're willing to give it a chance at all, give it at least three episodes. It's one season.
