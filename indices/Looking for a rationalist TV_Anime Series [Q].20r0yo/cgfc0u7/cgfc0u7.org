Planetes is possibly the hardest scifi ever on screen (maybe harder than 2001, since 2001 has Sufficiently Advanced Aliens and Planetes doesn't). Think /Gravity/, without the physics mistakes; the only implausible element I can think of is the computer technology not having advanced significantly by the 2070s. Not only is the physics realistic, so are the characters (besides a few comic relief characters who don't get that much screentime) and even the geopolitics; the characters don't carry the idiot ball, but neither do they solve everything themselves. It has one of the most satisfying, well-thought-out Earn Your Happy Endings in all of anime.

(The English dub isn't great, watch it subtitled.)
