Seconding Planetes. Honestly, it's so hard that it feels more like a light-dramedy styled documentary about the first extraplanetary colonies than a sci-fi show, if you're the kind of person who consumes so much science fiction that their mind is already in space.

Also, subtract from /Gravity/ the lousy "people can't live in space" aesop.
