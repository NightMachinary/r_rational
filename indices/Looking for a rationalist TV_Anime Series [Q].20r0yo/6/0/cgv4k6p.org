Mawaru Penguindrum is a bunch of stupid and poorly construed nonsense that's mindlessly created one after another. The final five episodes have such horrible plot holes that it's laughable how anyone could consider them 'rational'. There was never any real foreshadowing or any real plot. It's a bunch of random plot twists on plot twists that creates for the dumbest and most counterproductive storyline.

Don't believe me? Fine, waste your time and watch it. You'll be smashing your head against a wall wondering why you bothered.
