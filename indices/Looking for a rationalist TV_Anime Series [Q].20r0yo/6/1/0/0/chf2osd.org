symbolism irks me, why not just tell it how it is.. but to answer your question, I believe the child broiler symbolizes the 'brutal' socialization process into a mindless society, but there is nothing interesting about it: just a few sad children get put in there and then saved by some variation of 'I love you'.

really, I want to understand this, I hope I am not trying your patience too much. thanks.
