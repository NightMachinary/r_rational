If you pass on Zetsuen no Tempest just because I recommended it, it would be your loss. ZnT is much more straightforward and has much less symbolism. Also, I don't get why you consider 'angst' to be a problem in and of itself. The characters of Mawaru Penguindrum had legitimate reason to be unhappy. If you limit yourself to only works of art in which the characters are happy most of the time, you'd be missing out on a lot.
