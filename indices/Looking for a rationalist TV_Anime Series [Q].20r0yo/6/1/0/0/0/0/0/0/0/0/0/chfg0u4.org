Okay, I guess I was a bit too quick to get offended. But read over your posts, especially the first one. They could have been more diplomatically worded. I don't understand your emoticons either and even if I did they lack any subtlety in making a statement not come across too strong. Sorry if you feel you wasted your time on Mawaru Penguindrum, but it came across to me as if you were using me to vent your frustrations on. I doubt you were legitimately interested in what I liked about it, especially since I already stated some of the things I liked about it in my recommendation. Just in case, I liked the themes, some of the characters, the way the plot was presented like a puzzle, and the symbolism. You called it angsty, but the characters acted with nobility in the face of adversity. You didn't ruin my day, I was just a bit annoyed. There's no need to respond to this comment. I'm not interested in continuing this conversation.
