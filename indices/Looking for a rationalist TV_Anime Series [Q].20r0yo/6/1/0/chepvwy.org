It definitely isn't a pile of angst. There are themes of family, love, and hope throughout the whole show. Despite all the terrible things that happen and the cruelty of the world around them, these give the characters motivation and their actions aren't in vain. I don't understand your complaint about the characters because most of them seemed realistic to me with the possible exception of a few of the crazy ones. Realistic or not, they were complex and interesting. I guess I shouldn't have recommended it here because most rational stories have complex plots presented in a straightforward way whereas Mawaru Penguindrum has a simple plot presented in a complex way with a lot of the content left up to interpretation. I can see how its style might not be your preference but it's a good show. If you think there wasn't anything to the show, maybe you didn't get it? For example, do you understand the symbolism of the child broiler?
