I went and watched penguindrum, and I have to say it is among the worst anime I have ever seen. It was pure chaos, epically slow, and incredibly annoying at times. I feel that the totality of the show was just a few highly unrealistic characters hating their fate.

please, share with me your reasoning for recommending this: what more to it was there than a steamy pile of angst?
