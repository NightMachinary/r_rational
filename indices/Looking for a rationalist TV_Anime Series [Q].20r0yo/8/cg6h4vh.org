It's easy to find anime that takes on transhumanist themes, as in anime it's not even a distinct concept: the hero and/or the villain will have/seek superhuman powers, just because the show wouldn't be entertaining without them.

On the other hand, finding shows that aren't just silly, built out of pure Story Logic/Troperifficness, or major tossers of the Idiot Ball... is harder.

It's not a very cerebral medium.
