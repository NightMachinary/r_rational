Shingeki no Kyojin if we're pushing it.

Gunbuster to a degree. It's a short OVA series so won't take long. I wouldn't call it rationalist but it has some interesting ideas tangent to.

[[http://myanimelist.net/manga/42005/Torikago_no_Tsugai][Torikago no Tsugai.]] It's similar to Liar Game which someone else mentioned. A group of students go looking for a lost girl in a themepark and get caught in a survival game, they need to work within the rules to get through or they die.
