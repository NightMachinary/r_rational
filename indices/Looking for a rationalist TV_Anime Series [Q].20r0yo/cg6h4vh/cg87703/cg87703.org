I wouldn't say that anime isn't cerebral. There are plenty of thought-provoking shows, they just don't always incorporate much realism. Mawaru Penguindrum, for example, has plenty of events that don't really make sense (is the Child Broiler even real, for example?) but that still serve to convey the themes and character development. This is a good fit for the medium because unrealism is easier in animation, but it does have the effect of not many series being produced that could be considered rational.
