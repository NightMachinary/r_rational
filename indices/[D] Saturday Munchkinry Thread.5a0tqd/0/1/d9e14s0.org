"Part" is not a concept which divides reality at the seams and is like magic that can't create food or gold, magic that only works on "objects", etc. "Part, stopping at a reasonable point" is as bad, except that you've separated out the problem from the word "part" into the word "reasonable" instead.

A big part of munchkining this will be trying to figure out exactly what counts as a reasonable disassembly into parts. How easily you can munchkin it depends on where the power is on the lumper versus splitter scale.

Also, can you create a thing with information content, such as a book or computer drive? (And if you can't, does that mean that if you try to create an object with lots of fine but irrelevant detail, such as the microscopic bumps in a sheet of paper, you also can't?)
