The agency aside, this power is completely and utterly broken if there aren't any size restrictions. Just obtain a relatively valuable material like a gold bar (one part). Make a couple of copies, then melt them together to make a "large gold bar". Make a copy of copies of those, make a "larger gold bar" etc. You have exponential growth until size restrictions start making it harder to melt them down.

You could also do something similar with more complicated objects that can't be melted together. If an object has n parts, then if you just tie or weakly glue m of them together into a "n-object", just give it a stupid name and copy your new invention. Then you can make a copy in log(mn) = log(m) + log(n) time. Then disassemble the n-object into its useful components. As m gets larger the ratio of objects to time goes to infinity.

So basically you can mass produce anything with ridiculous efficiency as long as you do it in bulk. Definitely enough to break the world economy.

Hiring bodyguards should be relatively simple with your ridiculous newfound wealth. The only question is when the government finds out, can you make a good deal with them to let you be rich and wealthy while producing whatever they want, or if they'll just force you to do it trapped in a lab somewhere.
