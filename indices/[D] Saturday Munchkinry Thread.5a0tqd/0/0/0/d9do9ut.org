Originally I was working with a mass-based concept, but that biased things towards complex devices.

Then I considered a time function that was harsher than logarithmic, which meant that you would effectively never be able to create any complex device at all (or creating something simple would be virtually instant).

And using a hybrid was far too complicated for this sort of thread.

With the current system, creating a CPU alone would take more than 30 hours (assuming 1.4 billion transistors). A full computer I'm guessing would take maybe 35.

I could scale it up and say that it's 4 hours per log 2 of parts, which means you start running up against human limits of endurance. ~6 days to build a computer would mean you'd have to solve the food/water/excretion problems. 10 days (1*10^{18} parts) and you would have to sleep, which would be the hard limit I think.
