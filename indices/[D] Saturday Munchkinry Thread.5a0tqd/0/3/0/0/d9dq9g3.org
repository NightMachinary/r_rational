Now that I think about it you wouldn't even need to do that, /the body is pretty much one piece/. There aren't really parts of the body that could come out then just stick back in. Everything in your body is physically connected to each other.\\
The organs are all connected to the body as a whole, you can't just take them out and slot new one's in without cutting and stitching and stuff. Hell the bones are even connected to the circulatory system now that I think about it because that's where blood cells are produced.
