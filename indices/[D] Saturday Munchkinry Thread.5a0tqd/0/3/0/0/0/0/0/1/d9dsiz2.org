Having to visualize them from every angle is a weird restriction (since it preferences information about the surface of an object over it's innards), but it doesn't really explain why a MRI wouldn't work just fine. /Surely/ the power doesn't care that you know /what color/ something is, you can certainly get far more information about an object's structure from those sorts of imaging than you can with just a camera.

  You'd need to be able to visualise them from every angle. This would be a problem for the brain, unless you had very good detail of the folds

Depending on what you're saying here you also may have the problem that /humans can't imagine an object from all directions at once/. You have to switch between imaginary vantage points when imagining an object.
