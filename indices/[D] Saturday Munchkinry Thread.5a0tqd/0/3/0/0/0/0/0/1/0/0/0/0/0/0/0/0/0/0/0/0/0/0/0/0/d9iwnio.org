Orientation /by definition/ *is* only about one axis; the whole idea of which way an object's pointing, only makes sense in reference to a specific object being /pointed to/, and is unaffected by rotation along the axis pointing to the object.\\
If you look at the definition I posted prior this makes sense, because orientation was used to describe your bearing in relation to magnetic north only being concerned with the direction one axis is pointing in, is the whole point.
