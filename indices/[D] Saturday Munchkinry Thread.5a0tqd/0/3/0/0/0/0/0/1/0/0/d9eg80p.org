The passage does seem a bit odd, being able to view objects from every conceivable vantage ought to increase the amount of information received by /several orders of magnitude/ which immediately raises red flags.\\
I suspect they may merely have the ability to rapidly shift mental perspective and assimilate the information quickly. Similar to how (with the exception of split brain patients) people can't actually hold two totally separate thought processes at once, so multitasking is really about the ability to rapidly shift attention.

One could tell the difference a few ways. Firstly they ought to be able to recognize whether any two 3d shapes in any position were the same; faster than they could even consciously think. To them in the absence of some background to reference, the orientation of a object would mean absolutely nothing. Whereas to most people even in a featureless background objects would still have orientation since it is though you are looking at them. In fact one might even expect that if one's visual field was made to be totally blank and still (via eye tracking) then they actually /couldn't/ tell an object's orientation quickly.\\
This test sees the most promising for indicating whether there's anything here.

Secondly one ought to be able to notice changes to the appearance of an object on any of it's sides, even if the change happened just barely fast enough to be perceptible. Unfortunately this test would require ways of interfacing with environments that we can't do with our natural senses.

I also have some doubts because being able to perceive things this way means one ought to be able to easily handle seeing directly through a 360 camera bionic eye. However it's even more spectacular than that, because what you would actually be seeing would be as though seeing through thousands of such cameras all around your environment at once.

Another way of putting it, is that given these people already have memory as good as actually experiencing the event (though I somewhat doubt it's perfect since if so you shouldn't be able to tell the difference between memories and direct experiences) then it would mean they were able to experience vastly more information in their imaginings than they could in reality.\\
The idea that people could imagine something in orders of magnitude more detail than they could actually see with their senses (assuming peak human senses) seems extremely dubious to me.
