  I contend rather that only a small portion of active memory is actually rendered for virtual experience, and that all the extra unrendered data is necessary for real-time visual processing, because remembering is not a free action.

You see /I'm not so sure remembering isn't a free action/. At times people can have something trigger a long term memory pretty much instantly; the problem here is that long term memory is hard to sort through /but if have information to guide you I'm not sure getting things out of it is necessarily much slower/.\\
I don't think this buffer you propose where all the information about an object's appearance is being /actively processed/, but only part of it is being shown, has to exist.
