  You're assuming that their imagination is specifically allowing them to view a camera view from all viewpoints simultaneously. I'm not sure that works. They might simply be holding a complete 3D model in their head without necessarily having phto images from different angles.
#+end_quote

Yes but the kind of 3d model you would be talking about would lack certain visual information like the way light acted on the object.

  In Galton's paper, when he reached the point of asking about field of imaginary view, he referenced specifically a single object. I have no idea whether people can do the omnipresent-viewpoint thing with many objects or not.

I'm talking about this:

  HIGHEST.--My mental field of vision is larger than the normal one. In the former I appear to see everything from some commanding point of view, which at once embraces /every/ object and /all/ sides of /every/ object.
#+end_quote

The emphasis is my own; he isn't just talking about viewing all sides of a single object he's talking about more of the omnipresent viewpoint thing.

  ...I can imagine a lone object with an orientation.
#+end_quote

Ok I imagine you are imagining it having orientation in relation to some background, because an objects orientation is only a meaningful concept if you have /some/ reference.
