The examples I gave were taking apart scissors and decomposing electronics into transistors. If separability was the only issue, everything welded, glued, or riveted together would count as one part, which would defeat the purpose of the hypothetical.

Ultimately I can't give a consistent definition because it's physically nonsensical. It relies on human understanding.

I could rule that you can only use the power on things that were mechanically assembled, in which case "part" reflects how it was assembled.

The disassembling is to get a visual. MRI wouldn't count but a camera would. You'd need to be able to visualise them from every angle. This would be a problem for the brain, unless you had very good detail of the folds.
