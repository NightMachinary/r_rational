I think it is more likely that they are "visualizing" /less/ information than they normally get from their eyes. They see the shape and the light and the color of imagined objects, but they don't do the /extra/ steps of calculating which parts of it should be out of view or blocked or facing away.

There is precedent for this. When rendering computer graphics, all of those extra steps involve ridiculous four dimensional matrix convolutions and trigonometric comparisons, just to figure out what information descibing the scene that the machine already /has/ but shouldn't /show/. In reality, physics does all the work for us, but there's no fundamental reason why our brains should have to do all that when generating a scene.

My predictions: Any unfamiliar physical object will have blindspots or guesses around all unseen parts, so these visualizers can only quickly compare objects after they've already determined that they should use the same mental model for both; which must be done the hard way. They don't analyze every possible silhouette (in fact, they don't analyze /any/ silhouette in purely imagined scenes) and therefore they have no advantage in noticing shape changes or in finding the correct orientation of a complex shape. They have no trouble determining orientation relative to themselves, but they may say that abstract imagined things have no orientation.

I also predict that people who claim to visualize things vividly from every angle will nonetheless not find it easier than anyone else to draw a fish-eye picture.

At least, that's how it works when /I/ imagine things without orientation. But my imagination is not terribly similar to sight.
