  I see what you're saying, but I suppose we probably shouldn't be calling it orientation, because an object could rotate along an axis but it would have the same orientation if it was pointing in the same direction.

...by my understanding of the word "orientation", that /would/ be a change in orientation.

It is clear, therefore, that we are ascribing different definitions to the word.
