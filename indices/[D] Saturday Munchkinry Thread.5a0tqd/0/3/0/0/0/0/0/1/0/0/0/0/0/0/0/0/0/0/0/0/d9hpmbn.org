  Look - if an object is rotating about a point, then the shape of that object is not changing but the orientation is, right? Regardless of the presence or absence of anything else.

I see what you're saying, but I suppose we probably shouldn't be calling it orientation, because an object could rotate along an axis but it would have the same orientation if it was pointing in the same direction. For instance a floating compass needle could rotate while still facing magnetic north (which is /actually/ the magnetic *south pole*)\\
Idk what we should be calling it, positioning might have to suffice.

Anyway I get what you're saying, your earlier statement just confused me.
