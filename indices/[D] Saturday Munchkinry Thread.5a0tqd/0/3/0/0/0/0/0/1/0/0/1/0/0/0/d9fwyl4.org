  I disagree. I think that this is the case because that matches my own experience, and I simply can't imagine any other way to do it that isn't convoluted, inefficient, and improbable. I contend that when you imagine your breakfast table, your brain pulls up the entire concept-map for "your breakfast table", including color and material properties (perhaps with specular highlights baked-in based on the last time you saw it, or from a weighted average of every time you've ever looked at it - could you tell if it were unrealistic?). Do you think it's more likely that people's brains store "the front of your breakfast table" in a completely separate place from "the right side of your breakfast table", rather than starting from "breakfast table" and then finding the front part of it?

The majority of people will describe imagining something like a simulation of observing it normally, except with somewhat lower quality. When they imagine a table from above they would need shift their mental eye to tell how tall it is.\\
Sure all the details about something are stored in memory but only what they are actually /virtually sensing/ is being actively /rendered/. So if you change your mental view the brain has to go check the information in memory.\\
What i'm talking about here is effectively the distinction between cold memory and RAM, the brain has the information about what something would look like from a different angle implicitly, but that doesn't mean it's expending processing on anything not being actively (virtually) perceived.

  Seeing objects from every meaningful angle doesn't help people instantly compare two dimensional shapes. Even when we see everything there is to see, we still need to mentally rotate them until they are identical, or not.

See that makes no sense to me, because while they are on paper, your brain looking at them /still renders them in 3D/ so there shouldn't be any reason you ought to rotate them in this scenario.
