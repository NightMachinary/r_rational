No problem:

- There are human equivalents you need to uplift
- Let's say your immediate area contains a bit of forest to the north, an inhabited cave system/valley southeast and otherwise non-descriptive terrain. Overall the planet is reasonably earth-like, and probably has a molten mantle, but good maps are rare.
- You can cool your external surface, but it starts out irritating, and become outright painful after a few hours. You can remove mass without issue, but can't control it without physical contact, and it loses any properties you've given it. If you somehow manage to perfectly cut yourself in half, a random portion retains your identity, otherwise the more massive part counts as you. You can choose to remain in the smaller part though.
