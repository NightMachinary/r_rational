Heh, I have more clarifying questions than ideas.

-When you say the world is plagued by powerful creatures, do you mean that there is a human-equivalent race plagued by these creatures, or are the creatures themselves the "people" we're trying to uplift? If the former, how intelligent are the powerful creatures?

-What is the local landscape/geology like?

-Are you able to cool and/or detach parts of your mass?
