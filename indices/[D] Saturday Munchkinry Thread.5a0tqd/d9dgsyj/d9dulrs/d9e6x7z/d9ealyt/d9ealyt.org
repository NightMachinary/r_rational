I'll assume I'm the mantle. Can I drill volcanos of a few centimetres width to send magma where I want it? (While it stays connected to the mantle in order to stay under my control.) If a hundred litres of magma is enough to form a body of organs including a brain to micromanage them, I could instantly make 9100000000000000000000 bodies, except that would destabilize the planet. That's twentytwo digits. Can I separate metals out of some portion of me to make tools that won't melt everything they touch? If not, I can just manually send some bodies into the mountains to play human-like miner. Once I have tools, the surface population is freed from agriculture, since at the worst I can play human-like farmer.

Can I make limbs as large as I want or will they collapse under their own weight since they have the stability of bones? I am imagining a Sauron-tower rising out of the volcano I jump in after a few minutes.

Let's assume that I can't just step on the problem by setting a myriad of brains on thinking about FAI. Edit: ...at such numbers, this'll probably instead optimize for ideas that are good at convincing me they are good. See transdimensional brain chip. Though if I'm lucky, I would have realized that soon after spawning those brains (I did realize it here, after all) and stopped the brain project.

For some inspiration, imagine Taylor covering the Earth in relay bugs.
