You are made of molten rock, you constantly generate enough heat to keep your form molten, but can theoretically be put out, which will kill you. You are also able to designate portions of you mass as human organs ('bones' will stay congealed despite being liquid, 'skin' will with keep the rest of your mass contained, 'eyes' are sensitive to light...) , with 'brains' only contributing to you multitasking. You can add other molten rock to your from.

However, you are dumped on a world in the middle ages which is constancy drenched in rain, plaged by creatures powerful enough to shrug off your heat, and conveniently speaks english. How do you uplift the people of this world?
