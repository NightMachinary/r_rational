You are able to meditate to create ex nihilo any device you have ever taken apart and meditated upon.

The time to create these devices is, in hours, the logarithm (base 2) of how many "parts" the device has. So if your device has 1024 parts when fully disassembled, it would take 10 hours. This means that creating one very complex device is much faster than creating its components individually.

During a creation you may not do anything but meditate. That means no eating, sleeping, or using the bathroom. Your trance state prevents any urges you may have from forcing a response, but will not negate the physical effects (e.g. you may starve to death, but you will not suffer hunger pangs). You may still wake yourself manually if you wish, but your awareness of the world will be greatly reduced. Partial meditations have no effect.

Disassembly is only necessary for parts you have not already disassembled and meditated upon, and can be assumed to stop at a "reasonable" point (e.g. you'd only have to separate the blades and handle of a pair of scissors, not decompose the parts into atoms). This familiarity does not affect the creation time, only the examination time.

The examining meditation requires you to form a good mental picture of the object, so you would have to have seen it from all angles. This meditation always takes exactly one hour, not including the time to form the mental picture. You can do these meditations one part at a time.

Lastly, there is a well-resourced intelligence agency out there that is aware of your existence but not your identity or location. They want to kidnap you so they can take advantage of your power themselves.
