The point of "part" is to represent complexity in a sense. Because the time to create is logarithmic it isn't critical what constitutes a part; if you're off by a factor of 10, it's only a difference of around 3 hours and 19 minutes.

Disassembly is more complex. It isn't strictly necessary for the power, provided you can get a visual of each part. If the interior of a part is meaningful, you'd need a visual of that too.

You could create something with information content. If it noticeably affects the appearance of the part you'd need to visualise it as normal, but hard drive platters (for example) would all be reproduced as is.
