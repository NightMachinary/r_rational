Well the first step is to meditate on yourself (may not take long depending on whether each bone counts as a part) then create clones of yourself who will also presumably have your power.\\
You will want to find a powerful organization that can protect you from the organization; which is likely the hardest part since you don't know who you can trust not to sell you out to the government/organization.

If you manage to secure your safety then you will be able to make absurd profits creating massive blocks of various extremely rare materials. More importantly your army of clones can copy many researchers to vastly accelerate the rate of technological and scientific progress.
