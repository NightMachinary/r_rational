You seem to have switched your definition for what counts as an object. By this new logic every muscle fiber would be it's own object and in fact the idea of /any/ non-homogenous object would be nonsense, which is clearly not what you had in mind.\\
Basically there's no definition of part you can use that allows non-homogeneous objects, but still counts the body as more than one part.

But nonsensical definitions aside; there's the question of what counts as disassembling. You would also think that the point of disassembling is to gain information about the parts, if that's the case you could do just fine with a MRI.
