I don't understand what system you are using to decide the amount of parts,If it's based in human understanding does that mean the power is: A)using what I'm visualizing as a part when imagining the device B)using what most people thinks as a part in that concrete case C) using a fixed definition of part that is based on human intuitions If it's C) using the computer example what If I make a computer is the cpu a part or does every component of it count as a part? .is a computer made of a few components( ram , cpu ....) ?or does it count as being made of x number of transistors?. If you are making a transistor then does that count as a one part object or in this case it counts the components of a transistor ?( I suppose yes because you need to disassemble it) . Can I make a object that is made of a computer and other things or multiple computers( like a supercomputer based on parallel processors )and count the computer as a part ?. Can I make something that only has one part by whatever definition you are using ?

I don't know if I'm being clear , please tell me if you don't understand any of my questions because I'm bad at explaining myself and usually fall to de illusion of transparency(especially because English isn't my first language)
