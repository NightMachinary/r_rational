  That only holds true when talking about /a single object/

In Galton's paper, when he reached the point of asking about field of imaginary view, he referenced specifically a single object. I have no idea whether people can do the omnipresent-viewpoint thing with many objects or not.

  Even for a single object it's more than twice the info if these people are imagining the objects in near perfect detail like they describe. Because the way light bounced off an object would look different from multiple directions. An object viewed from an angle will also look compressed to you because of perspective and angle, so to get all visual info you need more than just 2 viewpoints.

You're assuming that their imagination is specifically allowing them to view a camera view from all viewpoints simultaneously. I'm not sure that works. They might simply be holding a complete 3D model in their head without necessarily having phto images from different angles.

#+begin_quote
  As I pointed out, /the only reason objects have orientation when we imagine them is because of reference to another object/ if you aren't imagining looking at the object (in which case your imaginary viewpoint is there as a reference object), or having that object have other objects around it. Then orientation /wouldn't mean anything/.

...I can imagine a lone object with an orientation.
