  Yes but the kind of 3d model you would be talking about would lack certain visual information like the way light acted on the object.
#+end_quote

Yes, this is true.

#+begin_quote
  I'm talking about this:

  #+begin_quote
    HIGHEST.--My mental field of vision is larger than the normal one. In the former I appear to see everything from some commanding point of view, which at once embraces /every/ object and /all/ sides of /every/ object.
  #+end_quote

  The emphasis is my own; he isn't just talking about viewing all sides of a single object he's talking about more of the omnipresent viewpoint thing.
#+end_quote

Which was in response to the question:

#+begin_quote
  "Extent of field of view.--Call up the image of some panoramic view (the walls of your room might suffice); can you force yourself to see mentally a wider range of it than could be taken in by any single glance of the eyes? Can you mentally see more than three faces of a die, or more than one hemisphere of a globe at the same instant of time?"
#+end_quote

...maybe your interpretation of that response is what was meant. Or maybe he imagined the cube, then the room, then the hemisphere, and saw all sides of every object - but only one at a time. I don't know.

#+begin_quote
  Ok I imagine you are imagining it having orientation in relation to some background, because an objects orientation is only a meaningful concept if you have /some/ reference.
#+end_quote

No background.

I'm having a bit of trouble figuring out how an object can /not have/ an orientation, though. I mean, I can understand an object that doesn't have a /defined/ orientation; but not having an orientation is a bit like not having a width.
