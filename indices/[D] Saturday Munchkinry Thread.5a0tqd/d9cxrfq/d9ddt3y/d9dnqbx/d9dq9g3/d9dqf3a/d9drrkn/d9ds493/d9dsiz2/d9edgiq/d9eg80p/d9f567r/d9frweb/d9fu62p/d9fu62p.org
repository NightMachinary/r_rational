  Your proposition /would only be true if you assumed that someone's mind was rendering all the information then obscuring some of it./ There's no reason to think that this is the case;

I disagree. I think that this is the case because that matches my own experience, and I simply can't imagine any other way to do it that isn't convoluted, inefficient, and improbable. I contend that when you imagine your breakfast table, your brain pulls up the entire concept-map for "your breakfast table", including color and material properties (perhaps with specular highlights baked-in based on the last time you saw it, or from a weighted average of every time you've ever looked at it - could you tell if it were unrealistic?). Do you think it's more likely that people's brains store "the front of your breakfast table" in a completely separate place from "the right side of your breakfast table", rather than starting from "breakfast table" and then finding the front part of it?

Personally, I can't imagine my table without knowing how tall it is, even if I'm not in a mental position to "see" more than just the top. Regardless of what I "see", the entire table is in my mind in some capacity. But I don't know how well my experience matches the visualizers', since I don't visualize.

In fact, given the brain's great love for cheating and lying, I wouldn't be /too/ surprised if it just said "You are vividly seeing [whatever]" without going to the trouble of actually generating anything to see. I wouldn't expect that to be true, but it's very cheap to do and has the same practical outcome.

  However /they still ought to be able to tell if two shapes/ *could* /be the same,/ whereas most people will need to take a second to mentally rotate an object around to notice that it's not actually the same as another, these people don't have to do that so they should be able to do it nearly instantly.

Seeing objects from every meaningful angle doesn't help people instantly compare /two dimensional/ shapes. Even when we see everything there is to see, we still need to mentally rotate them until they are identical, or not.
