  The passage does seem a bit odd, being able to view objects from every conceivable vantage ought to increase the amount of information received by /several orders of magnitude/ which immediately raises red flags.

No, it doesn't.

Consider, for example, a cube. I can imagine it from a single viewpoint; that it, I can 'see' up to three faces of the cube. Someone who can imagine it from all angles would be able to 'see' six faces of the cube; twice as much information. Yes, it's more information - but it's not /orders of magnitude/ more.

Again, I don't see how this follows. Their imagination may very well still /have/ orientation.
