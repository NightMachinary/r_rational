Ok so in response to your last point I'd say that you are probably inadvertently imagining an object against a white or black void background. Because orientation is a property that /is only meaningful in relation to other things/, it's not an intrinsic property the same way width is.

I have realized it seems likely that people aren't capable of imagining an object with no background because if you mental image isn't entirely filled with the object it's still /something/.

Even if you are imagining the inside of an object (thus no reference exists) you must be referencing some vague intangible viewpoint (even if that's kind of spread out and multifaceted).
