  I think it is more likely that they are "visualizing" less information than they normally get from their eyes. They see the shape and the light and the color of imagined objects, but they don't do the extra steps of calculating which parts of it should be out of view or blocked or facing away.

Your proposition /would only be true if you assumed that someone's mind was rendering all the information then obscuring some of it/. There's no reason to think that this is the case; instead the parts of the object the person isn't seeing in their mind's eye likely /just aren't being rendered/.\\
Sure you have to do some calculations to take into account perspective, but the brain doesn't have some fluid processing pool it's drawing on. The parts of the visual cortex used for perspective can't be repurposed for calculating more information about the appearance of the object from different angles on the fly.

  My predictions: Any unfamiliar physical object will have blindspots or guesses around all unseen parts, so these visualizers can only quickly compare objects after they've already determined that they should use the same mental model for both; which must be done the hard way. They don't analyze every possible silhouette (in fact, they don't analyze any silhouette in purely imagined scenes) and therefore they have no advantage in noticing shape changes or in finding the correct orientation of a complex shape. They have no trouble determining orientation relative to themselves, but they may say that abstract imagined things have no orientation.

Yes their ability to tell if two 3d shapes are the same ought to be limited by the potential that they can't see parts of the object.\\
However /they still ought to be able to tell if two shapes *could* be the same/, whereas most people will need to take a second to mentally rotate an object around to notice that it's not actually the same as another, these people don't have to do that so they should be able to do it nearly instantly.
