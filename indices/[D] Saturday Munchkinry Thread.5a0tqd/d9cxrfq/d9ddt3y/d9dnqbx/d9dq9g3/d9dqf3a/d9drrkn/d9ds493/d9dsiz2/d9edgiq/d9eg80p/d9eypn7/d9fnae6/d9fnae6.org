  Consider, for example, a cube. I can imagine it from a single viewpoint; that it, I can 'see' up to three faces of the cube. Someone who can imagine it from all angles would be able to 'see' six faces of the cube; twice as much information. Yes, it's more information - but it's not orders of magnitude more.

That only holds true when talking about /a single object/, if you are able to imagine a scene where you are seeing a great deal of objects all from every direction at once then this multiplies very quickly. If you were imagining a whole room full of objects from 2 different angles then /that's/ twice the info, but if you are seeing every single object from every angle then yeah that's far more than twice the info.\\
Even for a single object it's more than twice the info if these people are imagining the objects in near perfect detail like they describe. Because the way light bounced off an object would look different from multiple directions. An object viewed from an angle will also look compressed to you because of perspective and angle, so to get all visual info you need more than just 2 viewpoints.

  Again, I don't see how this follows. Their imagination may very well still have orientation.

As I pointed out, /the only reason objects have orientation when we imagine them is because of reference to another object/ if you aren't imagining looking at the object (in which case your imaginary viewpoint is there as a reference object), or having that object have other objects around it. Then orientation /wouldn't mean anything/.
