Munchkin: You exist in a world full of almost entirely mental superpowers. Precogs, mad genius inventors, memory-manipulators, mind-controllers, mad science researchers, detectives, and magnificent manipulative Bond villains abound. Your power simultaneously allows you to identify whether any individuals within your line of sight are super-powered, and passively prevents anyone from realizing you have this superpower. It does not tell you what their powers are, how to beat them, etc. Just that they have powers.

Your power actively prevents anyone from realizing you have powers. If they by some fluke realize this fact anyways, their memories will later be retroactively altered at the earliest possible convenience. This aspect of your power doesn't give you a "secret-identity." That is to say, if you go out in disguise and claim that you have superpowers, your power will still activate, and everyone will think you're lying, despite any and all evidence supporting your claim. In addition, they'll still be able to make associations between any and all identities you cook up, just not any associations between any of your identities and superpowers.

Reverse-munchkin: (Set within the same universe)

You have no superpowers. You're absolutely certain. Despite that, however, you keep having these weird night terrors in which Student, the world's most dreaded power-copier, tries to hunt you down for some reason. Student's collected a plethora of powers over the years. Due to your dreams, you tried looking up some of his powers online. While the vast majority of his powers are unknown(for obvious reasons), some of his more prominent, well-known and oft-used powers include:

Ability to abstain from sleep indefinitely, with no negative effects.

Perfect memory. Seamlessly integrates any and all information learned perfectly. Does not improve muscle memory.

Hyper-awareness, optimized mental faculties and multitasking. Is constantly running on full-throttle, mentally. Can split his attention 10 different ways with no loss in competence. Uses these in concert to constantly be fully aware of his surroundings at all times as best he can.

Rewind: He can designate a 1 hour period of time as a loop, choose a number less than 100, and then relive it that many times. Once he finishes reliving the time loop the designated number of times, he "exits" the loop, and time continues as normal until the next loop. He cannot use this ability again until that number of hours has passed. (ie. If he chose to relive the loop 48 times, then he would not be able to create another loop until 48 hours had passed.) A side effect of this ability is that Student effectively lives twice as much as everyone else due to these loops.

That last power is especially worrisome. It's almost like he's trying to kill you in your sleep, and is using his time loop power to help him get a read on you. But that's crazy talk, right? After all, if that was the case, you wouldn't remember what happened in those loops, let alone have dreams about it. After all, you don't have powers. But what if he really /is/ trying to kill you?

Oh, well. You should probably come up with some preparations, protocols, and plans to protect yourself against him, if only for peace of mind and sweet dreams. Knocking on wood can't hurt to try, after all.
