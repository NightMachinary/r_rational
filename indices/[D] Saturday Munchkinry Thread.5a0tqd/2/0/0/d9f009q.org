  Like, if you go around claiming to have invented a device that detects powers, will they believe it because it's not a superpower?
#+end_quote

Being a mad genius inventor with clarktech would constitue a superpower, so that won't fly. You could, however, pass it off as a gizmo that your superpowered friend made.

  Or would the power make people not notice the trend of how good your guesses are?

Oh, they'll notice the trends, alright, it's just that they'll rationalize it any way they can. Do you wear glasses? "Probably a gizmo his mad genius friend made that feeds him the info." Can you come up with a plausible explanation for how you solved the case? "Probably just a superhero wannabe that did his homework." If you can't? "Must've been a lucky guess."

As for the second one, I left it deliberately vague and open to interpretation, especially with an unreliable narrator. You can interpret it as a reverse of previous power in the sense that it actively prevents you from realizing you have a power. You can interpret it as the dreams being prophetic, in which case Student never actually succeeds in killing you in his time loops due to your advance warning, and therefore backs off the final go around of the loop. Or, you can interpret it as your power allowing you to remember the time loops, in which case the dreams are just memories of getting woken up in another timeline. If this is the case, then Student attacking you in broad daylight like an idiot would cause you to suddenly get hit with deja vu and false memories of the other timelines. Open for interpretation.
