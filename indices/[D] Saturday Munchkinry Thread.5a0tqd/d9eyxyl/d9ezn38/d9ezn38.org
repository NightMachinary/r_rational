For the first one, can you convince people that you are able to determine if people have powers if you give an explanation other than the real one? Like, if you go around claiming to have invented a device that detects powers, will they believe it because it's not a superpower? Or will your power alter that too? Similarly, if you try to become a detective or something that investigates superpower crimes, could you gain a reputation as "that guy that has hunches about people that somehow always end up being right." And go up the ranks that way? Or would the power make people not notice the trend of how good your guesses are?

For the second one, am I right in understanding that because you're experiencing these over several nights, that means he's looping to practice killing you, but then when the loop ends he doesn't follow through with it and just waits for the next night to loop again? What happens if he loops during the day? Do you seem to black out and interpret it as a dream? The distinction is important because it determines whether or not you know if you're in a loop. If so, then my suggestion would be to make secret preparations outside of loops, acquiring a gun, finding safe escape routes and hiding places, etc. But during loops don't reveal any of it, don't reveal that you know he's looping, and behave predictably and weakly during every loop that has the same start point. If he thinks he can kill you incredibly easily then he won't prepare as much and then when he tries to do it for real you can surprise him by having a gun or bomb or something that he didn't know about because you never used it during the loops.
