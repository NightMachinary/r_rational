Random ideas:

For different 'users', you could have states that are difficult to access because they require a certain amount of training to access reliably. These wouldn't be more powerful, necessarily, just more obscure because of the time/expertise required.

Examples:

1. *Clear-headed relaxation/calmness*- hard to describe, but if you've ever meditated, its that really calm but alert feeling you have right after meditation. Maybe this could give you a certain degree of blanket immunity to damage while removing your ability to deal damage. Like you're 1/4 as capable fo doing 'damage' but are only affected by 1/4 of the damage you'd normally receive.

2. The prototypical *'mystical' experience* William James (and many others) wrote about, variously described as transcendent, euphorically happy, a dissolving of self, etc.

   Maybe it gives you a short-lived powerful 'Master' ability where you have massively boosted empathy and reading of people around you. So you could predict their attacks or words but you'd feel so much empathy for them that you'd have to be quite detached or strong-willed to actually harm people while in this state.

3. *Extreme focus/obsession*-- I've had this when sober, but to explain simply: the hyperfocus you get while on amphetamines or other stimulants. The resulting power would give you better senses and intuition regarding your object of focus. A resulting disadvantage would be a corresponding lack of attention to everything but that object. So if I 'pull' focus and think about someone I want to kill in fight, I'd have a sense of their weak points, their location, etc. but also become numb to what's going on around me.

Maybe instead of overuse causing permanent numbing (too bleak to me, personally) it causes a corresponding weakness that last for a disproportionate amount of time? Someone who pulls love for too long or too hard will be weaker for a couple of days. etc.
