Employers would like their workers to be happy, and would like them to spend that joy and love being faster, stronger, more resilient and more effective. Those interested in short-term workers will be happy to burn them out, those looking for the long term will have methods developed to find a sustainable pace.

Soldiers and law enforcement will go out of their way to fight their opposition in a calm, predictable way. They must be stoic and relentless, to discourage Hope, but also gentle and fair to discourage Anger, Fear and Sadness. Again, Joy and Love are the greatest weapons in this regard.

A savvy criminal mastermind, then, will want to focus on Hope or Fear. The former would probably be inspired by confidence in the leader's ability to out-think the law. The latter would be inspired by the leader selling the very real dangers of the law's effectiveness. Fear is easiest, but necessarily short term: It breaks confidence even as it builds power. Hope requires more work (and skill) but will pay longer term benefits.

That gang leader will also, by the by, want to be just as polite, stoic, calm, and reasonable as his opponents... for the same reasons.

Also, getting discouraged in order to work through an intellectual dilemma is probably going to be a thing. /Work/ that sadness. Physical weakness isn't a big hassle in most of our everyday lives.

MEAT: The bit about Love requiring focus is a very solid limitation, rich with storytelling and motivational potential. Try to incorporate that into the other emotions. Purity of emotion based on specificity rather than a nebulous "strength". What outcome, exactly, do you Fear? What is the most poignant single source of your Sadness? Which specific aspect of their person inspires your Love?

Lots of great story hooks there, as well as establishing intriguing limitations. The most powerful pathomancers would all have a specific focus that, once known, could be attacked (physically or rhetorically). Weaker, less focused emotion would get less impressive results but be significantly more difficult to unwind.
