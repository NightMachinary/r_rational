To split the axes a little more bluntly:

- *Love:* Pacifist endurance
- *Hate:* Violent endurance
- *Fear:* Reactive precognition
- *Hope:* Proactive precognition
- *Joy:* Super-speed (distance)
- *Sorrow:* Super-speed (time)

I think this is good, though I'm not so sure about the Love/Hate split, since you're including violence as a feedback and it's already an emotion-based system and those seem like they'd be baked in. So I think I would go back to look at "endurance" and see if you can find a better way to split those; perhaps hate is endurance via regeneration while love is endurance via shielding?

I'm also not sure about putting limits on who can use what, since that seems like it's also baked into an emotional system. The only people who can use an emotion are people who strongly feel that emotion, emotions fade with time, you're already at the right limits.

For some meat, I think you need to consider drugs. Take a dose of something that induces extreme paranoia, get reactive precognition. Take a dose of something that induces psychotic rage, get extreme endurance. Take ecstasy, get super-speed. But I'm not sure that you want to go in this direction, nor am I sure that it's sufficiently awesome.

The most powerful people are those who are least emotionally stable, which is interesting, as those people are probably also the easiest to manipulate (cowards, hotheads, etc.). The burnout factor blunts this somewhat though.

As for meat ... what you want in a story is a driver of conflict, and ideally you also want something cool and splashy. I think given your framework, one of my solutions would be emotional clades, groups that all focus on a single emotion that they can reinforce within each other. It's easier to be joyful when people around you are joyful. It's easier to feel hate when you're within a culture of hate. This doesn't preclude anyone from forming their own group of mixed emotions, but it does provide some instant tensions. The gang of hatemongers all wearing red get pissed off when the yellow-dressed joyweavers come walking by, because it's a direct affront to the emotion they're trying to cultivate.
