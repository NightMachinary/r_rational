[With changes to the system. Also, imagine a properly alchemical language and style. Also also, clearly this theory is all wrong in some way, because all theories are!]

The Theorem of The Equilibric Universe: As within, without

We know from the art of engines the principle of /thermodynamic conservation/ - that is, that all power arises from a thing being separated from it's natural state. Water raised, temperatures outside of norm, fuels unburned, so on and so forth. Work, the /purpose/ of energy, is then done by diverting the course of the universe's re-alignment to equilibrium. The falling of water powering the water wheel being our most observable example.

As such, when looking at the magical arts, we can observe the same: the human heart, reaching a state of /disequilibria/, has /created/ energy, and the human soul, alone in the world in it's singular ability to enact /magic/, may extract work from this disquilibria in the course of equalizing.

As to the notable effect of /selective depression/, by which the magi becomes /numb/ or otherwise /subdued in an emotion/, we can liken it to the effort required to once again raise the fallen water to a height. A thing that naturally occurs, as the cycle of precipitation, but nonetheless one which takes /time/.

Now, to our main point of discussion, the emotions of Eurasia*, which we divide into the six humors:

Fear: Fear arises from what could be that is not desired. The Universe works to Equalize your soul by showing you that which can occur that you might make it /not/ occur. Fear equalizes to /fatalism/ - the one cannot change one's future, and with it, calm.

Hope: Hope arises from what could be that /is/ desired, and equalizes to /ennui/. As one knows the path to victory, one knows both how reachable and unnatianable it is, and with it, calm.

Sadness: Sadnessess arises from things that are that are not desired. The Universe works to Equalize your soul by giving you time in which to accept the state of the world. Sadness equalizes to melancholy. As one is able to contemplate their woes, they are able to consider how things could be worse, and that they are not.

*Researcher's Note: Just as having words that describe colors gives you the abililty to see those colors, so too does having words to describe emotions give the ability to feel them. However, it is more pronounced - the stories that one learns as a child, which then inform them as to the emotions one may feel, have the strongest effect. As such, the peoples of the Indies conduct subtley different Magicks as befits their different emotions.

This is an "eh" stab at what jumped out at me. Another compelling set up is to have a cycle - love leads to anger, anger leads to fear, fear leads to hope, hope to joy, joy to sadness, sadness to love.... Potentially, both could work in the same world, depending on how your character's cultures promote what makes you feel this or that. Either way, however, having some principle that explains why each emotion leads to the magic that it does would be very helpful - except then you pick one (or more, or in parts) to break that rule to some degree because theories are always wrong and in the early days it was easy to spot exceptions.
