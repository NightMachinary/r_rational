It feels to me like this system would likely result in, effectively, monastic orders of powerful magic users of a particular type, carefully husbanding their usage of the magic so as to not run themselves dry and working together to make their geniuses as purely colored as possible. I'm thinking a sort of Jedi/Sith split, with a similar organizational structure, but with eight sides rather than just two.

I suspect alliances between magic using orders would be rare, as contact with other magic users would likely weaken your devotion to your chosen facet. Though the positive emotions won't fight each other often, they probably won't work together often unless there is an existential threat.
