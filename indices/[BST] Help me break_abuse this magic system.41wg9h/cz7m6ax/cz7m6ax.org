  Geniuses can be made to separate from a person and attach to an object when the person experiences enormous amounts of pain. It attaches to an object that's core to the pain (i.e if you're getting tortured, then it would attach to, say, a knife or something).

...this is /begging/ for a Villain to kidnap people, torture them to get their Genius out, kill them, and keep the new magic item. Either to sell for massive amounts of money to his black market connections, or to keep for himself. (And he keeps enough for himself to be a near-completely undefeatable fighter - Fear goggles that let him see danger at /any time/, activatable Anger armour that keeps him safe... that sort of thing. With the downside, of course, that every such piece of equipment is an actual torture implement and he's wearing them all...).

It's /also/ begging for a character to sacrifice his own Genius to give the Hero a Hope weapon at some point - a weapon that shows you the optimal way to use it (whether "optimal" means "allow me to survive this conflict" or "kill my opponent" makes an interesting dichotomy - it may be that only one of the above is possible).

Actually, if a Villain tortures someone with his bare hands, can he get a second Genius for himself, thus allowing him access to vastly more powerful and/or versatile magic, perhaps tapping more easily into two emotions at once?

Here's another thought - what happens if you have /no/ emotion, if your Genius is completely blank? Could that possibly open up a (very rare, virtually unknown) "invisibility" power, which allows you to take actions unpredicted and unpredictable by Fear and Hope (but not necessarily /actually/ making you invisible)? This leads inevitably to thinking of a very zen assassin who specialises in killing people with threat-spotting Fear goggles...

It's also begging for a scene where someone sacrifices their genius
