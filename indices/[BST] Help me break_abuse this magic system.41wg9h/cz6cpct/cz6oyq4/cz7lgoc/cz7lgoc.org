Emotions are complicated and weird. For example, although depression is commonly thought of as /sadness/, it is actually (according to Things I Have Read) a lack of energy with which to feel things. AFAIK, this is why antidepressents lead to suicides - depression and sadness, while not the same, do tend to occur in the same situations, so pumping people who feel bad all the time but have to where-with-all to do anything with energy... Yeah. You get them to do something.
