I love this. The bonus effect - that you numb yourself to that emotion - is amazing. It's neither clearly a downside nor clearly an upside. You'll have groups of people for whom that is the primary effect of magic, /not/ the actual magic.

That said - it's unclear what the "numbed" emotional state of someone is. If I have no hope, do I have despair, or fatalistic apathy?

I think you've also got a population that reversibly Vulcan's themselves. Cognitive traditions (like, say, memory palaces) would develop to deal with numbed states, as well as to induce emotion for specific states.

Historical note: Has magic always been around?

More thinking is required. I don't like the pain-as-enchanting aspect; it's too clearly "good/bad". I love using magic for science and operating machinery!

I like the idea of the magic working in direct proportion to the emotional mix you're feeling. I don't think it's overpowered.

You have a hugely effective self-balancer in that a) legit emotion is literally mana (big effect for big numb, long effect for long numb) and b) your most effective mages will be seriously emotional people.

Also, group ritual casting? Theater and symphonies. Hot /damn/.
