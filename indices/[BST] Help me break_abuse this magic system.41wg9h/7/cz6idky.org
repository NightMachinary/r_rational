How hard is pulling? Can it be done accidentally? Because as an avid minecraft player my mind already has some intricate baby farms designed.

Plus once you've extracted all the emotions for material goods, I'm guessing they'll be very pliable. You could leave a bit of love in there, get them some dogma, a nice Big Brother figure, and form the perfect loyal army.

Actually, forget babies. Even in the least forgiving interpretation of the rules you could teach them to pull early, say at four, and hold sessions to help rid them of those filthy, filthy bad emotions as early as possible. Apply drugs as needed.

And regardless of any of that, You have posited a world where people can remove certain emotions from their lives permanently. Surely there will be some strange social or religious groups that focus on that.
