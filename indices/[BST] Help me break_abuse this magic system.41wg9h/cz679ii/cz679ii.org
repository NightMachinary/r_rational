  if overused, it can numb one entirely - someone that keeps using anger to fight would eventually be unable to get angry anymore, and so on. [interesting consequences of this are especially appreciated]

I suggest instead, maybe keep emotions normal and human (sensitizing or desensitizing as normal humans would) but balance overuse and or overpowered variants via negative effects in keeping with the cognitive biases they create.

Love should be an exception, gets stronger with greater use time. But, love may cause /other/ emotions to go haywire - not magically, just because the actor is human (like you might get too much anger if someone hurts a loved one, or too much fear that they will get hurt, or too much joy from being together) and this makes it the most dangerous to use of all. False versions of love - clingyness, infatuation, etc - may create a lethally inaccurate /perception/ of invincibility. You have to

Too much anger, like love, has no /magical/ drawback - it is it's own punishment. via causing excessive violence.

Too much fear causes reactive precognition to very minor threats that could have been safely ignored or returns visions of events that have only a very low probability of occurring, losing predictive value.

too much continuous sadness leaves you trapped in an extremely still, unmoving, isolated sad world which cannot move on, till you go insane or fade away due to the physical weakness effect.

Too much joy and you start going too fast to control, making it easy to get ahead of yourself and accidentally kill yourself.

Hope in inappropriate, truly hopeless situations causes the precognition solution to be extremely unlikely to work (the precognition scramble to find /some/ solution, however unlikely).

Nice side effect of this is that emotions will be synergistic in a manner which imitates life.

Joy + love + hope (positive triad) = you're going fast, but physical endurance of love prevents you from injuring yourself, and hope gives you precognition to help you control your speedy body.

Anger + sadness + fear (negative triad) = slow down time, but the physical weakening is canceled out by Anger, and fear keeps you extra safe.

Joy + fear (thrill, exhilaration like a roller coaster) = going fast, with precognition to avoid crashing into things.

Joy + anger (bloodlust) = Superspeeded violent maniac slaughters everyone, physical endurance bonus prevents self-injury

Joy + sadness (nostalgia) = creates moments that last forever - often happens when your kids are getting married, etc. Time slows down but you speed up, so you move normally to your own perception even while everything stops. If you share the moment with someone it's extra fun. Very powerful in other contexts if you manage to trigger it.
