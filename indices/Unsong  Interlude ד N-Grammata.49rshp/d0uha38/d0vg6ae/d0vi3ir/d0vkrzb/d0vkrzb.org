Fuck, man. I'm sorry. I assume you're stuck at that school because of your parents? I've got double clergy parents myself, and though it sounds like I've had it less bad than you I still can't stand being around them for more than a few days at a time. Too many bad memories. Where others see them as paragons of Christian Virtue, I must see them as people, broken as the rest of us, putting on a mask for those they teach. Really shatters the ability to believe any of their tripe.

Anyway, things do get better. For me, it happened when my parents moved several states away so I didn't have to deal with their crap all the time. Get educated, get out, and if necessary remove toxic influences from your life.
