It comes and goes. ATM, I'm stuck at a religious school where I can't be too open with the therapists (who aren't all that good anyway, IMO), so I'm trying to hang in long enough to graduate (this semester and two more).

I have an internship in San Jose starting next month and have a few places that I can go to, which will hopefully make the last two semesters a little easier to handle.

--------------

I have no intention to buy a gun, for that very reason (although another reason that the Mortal Name would be so tempting is that it would make "donating my organs post-suicide" a lot easier; it's when I find myself starting to think about how to manage this IRL that I realize that I'm slipping again).
