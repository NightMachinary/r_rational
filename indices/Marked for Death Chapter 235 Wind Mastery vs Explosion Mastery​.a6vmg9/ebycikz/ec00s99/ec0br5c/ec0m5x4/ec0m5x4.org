This is correct. The rule exists as it does to discourage repeated self-promotion, mostly because authors have an incentive to post their stuff a lot, and third parties presumably don't. In theory, the stories that get posted more than once a week get posted because people are really enjoying them, rather than because some upstart author wants to drown people in links until they submit.

That said, if a third party started posting once-a-day links to a story that updates daily, we probably would make a rule against it. In the past, people have been told to maybe knock it off, given that 1K word updates (or less) aren't much content and aren't really fodder for discussion, and largely serve to dilute other content.

(I do wish that Practical Guide had stuck to a twice weekly update schedule, and that submitters would just do one link when two chapters are posted at once, or failing that, that discussion would move to [[/r/PracticalGuideToEvil]] where it has room to breathe, but that's more personal preference than mod stance.)
