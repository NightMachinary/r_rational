For what it's worth, MfD updates twice per week, typically Thursday and Sunday, and the updates are almost always 3k words or more. We've had a few chapters that hit 10k. I think it's fair to say that we aren't spamming and we are contributing value.

Also, I'm enjoying Practical Guide and am in favor of the frequent posts. I feel like this sub has quieted down a lot since I was last paying attention to posting rates (back when I was writing 2YE and Team Anko, 3ish years ago, I think?), so it doesn't feel like PGtE is drowning anything else out.
