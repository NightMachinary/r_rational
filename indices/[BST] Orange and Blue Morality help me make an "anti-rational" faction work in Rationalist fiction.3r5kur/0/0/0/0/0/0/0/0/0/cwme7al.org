  it seems unlikely that a human could write a memetic trap which will convince people when you steelman it and isn't therefore simply correct.

Then how did the Unabomber, Osama bin Laden, Hitler, and Stalin all happen? Oh, and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? And the fictional "rational" villains listed above, whom numerous people across the interwebs have /actually been persuaded by/?

Insofar as "steelmanning" means "finding the most plausible/probable phrasing of an argument or opinion", it merely consists in the particular kind of lying-with-literal-truths in which you highlight coherent-but-unlikely possibilities, and then let confirmation bias and the availability heuristic persuade your victim.

Emphasis on /victim/.
