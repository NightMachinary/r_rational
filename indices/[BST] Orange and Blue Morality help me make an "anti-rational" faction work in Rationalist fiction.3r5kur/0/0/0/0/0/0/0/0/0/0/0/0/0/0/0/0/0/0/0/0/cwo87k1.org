Why would you ever want to use a broken technique? Why would you ever want to hide information in a cognitive technique? When, using your definition of a steelman, /would/ it be appropriate to steelman?

Steelmanning (as I'm familiar with it) doesn't remove or 'hide' weaknesses and uncertainties, not that I would know how to hide things from myself through mere thought. Every time you decide not to look for evidence against the steelmanned position, you can infer the existence of unknown missing evidence, which undermines the steelman. (Hypothetical detractors would be able to say "your method of gathering evidence was biased!", which is an unnecessary flaw. Actual detractors may not know that your methods were biased, but that would mean you're consciously leveraging your undeserved credibility, in which case "steelmanning" would include bribing recognised authorities to lie for you, and your credibility would hopefully run out quickly).
