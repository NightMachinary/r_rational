That sentence referred to 'steelmanning' as I understand it: personal steelmanning. Not sharing with others or trying to convince them, but thinking up the best arguments you can against yourself. Deliberate psychological manipulation isn't supposed to be part of it because it isn't a good argument.

We don't seem to disagree in the territory, you're just using a broader definition for 'steelmanning' than I.
