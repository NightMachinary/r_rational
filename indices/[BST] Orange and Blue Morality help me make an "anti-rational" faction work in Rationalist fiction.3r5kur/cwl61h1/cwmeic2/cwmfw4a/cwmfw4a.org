The rationalists don't necessarily have to conform to the perceptions of them that the opposing faction has. It might be enough that the opposing faction /perceives/ them that way, or that they have been taught to do so by people who have their own agendas or who feel threatened by the rationalists.

Yes, it might all collapse if the Mystics were themselves rational and carefully investigated the rationalists first-hand, but the premise is kind of them /not/ being rational, just being... well, human. Even, quite possibly, well-meaning (as they see it). This makes the conflict less Rationalist vs Mystic and more Thought vs Belief - essentially, one of the core rationalist issues writ large in the metaphor of the groups' inevitable clashes.

The rationalists don't even have to win all the encounters, exactly - convincing people to be rational can be a long and drawn-out process, with many retreats to behaviors driven by fear or tradition. And then there's the fact that even when one side considers themselves to have 'won' a particular battle, the other side may not necessarily have considered themselves to have lost - they're not precisely opposed in their goals, and are playing on somewhat different (if often overlapping) playing fields. I can't see the rationalists as being rabidly anti-Mystic, for instance, and may even admire the Mystics' grim dedication to protecting people, even if the way they go about it tends to interfere with the upgrading of civilization.

It should be quite easy, for instance, to write a story from the perspective of an heroic Mystic who had been raised to be wary of the Rationalist menace (amongst many other things), but had never actually seen one in the flesh, as it were, and wound up separated from the Council for a time, meeting and talking to people who seemed friendly and curious about everything.
