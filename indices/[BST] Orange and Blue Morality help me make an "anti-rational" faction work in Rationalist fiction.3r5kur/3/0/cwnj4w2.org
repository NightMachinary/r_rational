Wow, this sounds like Bayesian reasoning for why people would follow [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majoritarianism][Majoritarianism]].

It basically boils down to the idea that on subjects where you are uneducated or have reason to believe that you are more ignorant about than the majority of people, you should follow what the crowd does or at least until you take the time to learn enough to perform better or know more than the majority.

I personally use this heuristic sometimes with the exception of major political issues, since that's a topic where there often is no clear majority.
