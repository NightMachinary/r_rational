I struggled to understand this concept initially because a) the word epistemic tends to trip me up, vocab-wise and b) the idea of epistemic learned helplessness is so foreign to me now, since almost everything I deal with in my daily profession deals with ambiguity.

However, my fianc√©e used to tell me that she "dislikes all politics" since she saw equal value in the arguments on both sides of the aisle that she decided to take no position. Now that she's in Social Work school, her views are more nuanced and informed rather than shrugging helplessly at everything political, so to speak.
