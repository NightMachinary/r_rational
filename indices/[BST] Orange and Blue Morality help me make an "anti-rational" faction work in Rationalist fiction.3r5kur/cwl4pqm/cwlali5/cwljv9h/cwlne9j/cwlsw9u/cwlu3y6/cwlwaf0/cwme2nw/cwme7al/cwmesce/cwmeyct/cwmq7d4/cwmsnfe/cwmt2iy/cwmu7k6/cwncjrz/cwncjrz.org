Do you have evidence for that?

Perhaps more importantly, though, it seems to me that if [applying rationality technique] to something can lead you astray, you're doing the technique wrong. Therefore "Don't steelman the Unabomber" => "Don't steelman", for any two common and identical definitions of 'steelmanning'.

It seems like the lesswrong and CFAR definitions ought to be safely applicable to anything. If you expect to be convinced the Unabomber was right after thinking about it a lot, you believe the Unabomber was right.
