I think that if you want to find a compelling intellectual or moral conflict, you /need/ to find places where there's a reasonable argument that takes a wrong turn somewhere. If it's just someone being evil for the sake of evil and the hero is doing something that everyone agrees is right and just ... that's /boring/. But if the hero has to untangle what the villain is saying and separate out things which are /true/ from things which only /seem true/, then you have a conflict worth reading about.

Maybe the principle should be "don't steelman the Unabomber unless you're also going to tear that steel apart"? Because I think if you just shy away from those "simple, easy, and wrong" arguments then you're giving up a large amount of what makes rational fiction worth reading. (I would place both Equestria Online and Quirrell in the camp of "simple, easy, and wrong". But that's part of what makes FiO and HPMOR worth reading.)
