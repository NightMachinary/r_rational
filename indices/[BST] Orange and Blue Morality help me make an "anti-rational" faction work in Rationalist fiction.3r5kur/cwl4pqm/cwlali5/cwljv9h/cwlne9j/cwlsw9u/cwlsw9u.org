Well, I of course believe the Unabomber was not only wrong to bomb people but wrong about society in general. Problem is, explaining how takes a lot longer than "steelmanning" his propaganda into something "reasonable" enough to actually persuade people.

As a community, we should probably have a term for things subject to the "simple, easy, and wrong" asymmetry. That's part of why arguments and persuasion are so untrustworthy as guides to truth in the first place.
