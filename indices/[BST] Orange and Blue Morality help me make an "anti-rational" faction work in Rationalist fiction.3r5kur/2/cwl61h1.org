Flip it on its head. What are some downsides of rationalism (and in particular extreme rationalism) that might make people scared or at least wary of rationalists?

- apparent lack of emotion at times;\\
- strange and unfamiliar thought processes, sometimes leading to strange actions;\\
- strange language (jargon);\\
- unwillingness to follow nonrationalists blindly and/or without question;\\
- arguing amongst themselves;\\
- somehow, despite all this, they somehow keep coming out on top of situations a lot more than than they should be able to;\\
- somehow 'magically' prepared to handle things they could not possibly have known were going to happen; and\\
- normal people who have been taught or trained in their ways, or even just spent a degree of time with them, start exhibiting the same behavioral oddities (including arguing with authority). This is particularly the case with younger adults and children.

So it's quite possible that from the outside, rationalists look like magically empowered humans or perhaps even something inhuman disguised as humans. They're too lucky, too successful, and they speak a strange language. If they collect and share knowledge, they can create or repair powerful and complex tools, know how to make alchemical miracles, are powerful healers, and are sometimes supernaturally successful military leaders/advisers, rulers, and spymasters. /And they can turn normal people into more of them just by talking./

And yet, whenever the Mystics confront them, they deny having any kind of supernatural abilities or artifacts, or contact with dark forces. They defy rightful commands, refuse to submit to the Mystic's authority, and insist in the face of all evidence that they wield no Powers, even under torture. It is the sworn duty of the Council to protect the people of the land from demonic infections, and no less so when those influences are subtle and walk under the sun as do men, concealing their poisons as naught but light words and parlor tricks.

This creeping blight of the soul, this rot of mind and wit, must be purged wherever it is found. It cannot be allowed to take root in this land while good hearts stand true.
