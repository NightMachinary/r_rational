Thanks! I've got the structure vaguely outlined and the main characters still need mini-arcs. I have a lot of the medical cases, fantasy-fantastic examples, and rationality principles all bubbling around in my brain. The major shift for me is that I overhauled the time for the setting -- originally I was going to set it in the traditional D&D 'pseudo-medieval' time, but it didn't feel right since I wanted the medical backdrop to be more than leeches and bloodletting.

It all changed a few weeks ago when I read about medicine in the 1800s in a book called "Dr Mutter's Marvels" (of the Mutter Museum fame with weird medical monstrosities in Philly). So I feel ready, esp now that it's NaNoWriMo, to start writing in earnest!
