What if they're concerned that developing these extrasensory abilities will lead to another rise and collapse of another kind of magic? These abilities sound like more different magic, and the only way to survive is obviously to get rid of everything that is magical, that works on unproven methods. The only things that could possibly be safe are proven methods that have worked for generations, and we will use force if necessary to save civilization from the unsafe path you are leading it on, etc.
