They could favor keeping what they have, over reaching for the stars.

They could believe, perhaps correctly and perhaps not, that all magic comes from gods- plural, not singular- that using these magics is a form of worship and, simultaniously, makes these gods stronger. They could be worried because unlike their, safe gods and magics, which have almost never destroyed stuff that they didn't mean to, these have horible extremes out there, and you shouldn't let it reach its true potential.

They could believe magic creates magic for other reasons, too.

Magic could legitimately be dangerous, if used haphazardly, and they make plans to minimize the threat with kill-on-sight. perfectly valid, especially if most mages didn't ever teach one another or use sufficient safety levels.

Aiming for large groups of mages may be foolish, but they think the potential for harm is greater, but the likelyhood is just as high, rather than assuming that they learn safety from one another's mistakes.

Meanwhile, mages tend to get vengeful, if they last long enough to survive, (attempted murder does that to a person's outlook) and therefore are even more dangerous in groups. they can't let one mage go, because a single mage is a bomb waiting to go off, but they can't defuse them without making enemies and making groups of mages dangerous as well.

In other words, they're dealing with superhumans who have every reason to be angry with them, but who also very likely could accidentally wreak havoc if they aren't killed. There is no third option that isn't inferior, at least not that they can see. Kill-on-sight or let them wreak havoc.
