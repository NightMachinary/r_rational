I have spent a lot of time (TOO MUCH TIME) researching about how realistic it would be to have something like darkvision/infravision from D&D and actually trying to put together the type of sensory organs it would take (eyes aren't the right size, the lens doesn't refract UV or infrared light correctly; the skin would be the organ most easily adapted to detect heat since it already does to some degree)... then pulling it back into fantasy (orcs would be the best race to have this ability), thinking about the implications (so they'd be great at tracking blood and bodily fluids, highly sensitive to heat fluctuations, need a lot of skin exposure to be effective, etc...)

So in a nutshell, I was trying to rationalize all of these ESP abilities but I was confusing realism with magic. It certainly is much easier to hand wave it as 'new magic' but that makes it much less fun when it is such a black box in a setting intended to be scientific, rational, and explore biology and pathophysiology.

Of course, all of my background characters would just call it magic and be done with it.
