  Scientists have a bad reputation because of horrific experiments in the past (think of Twig but more medieval... or the Duke of Gibea in the Kingkiller chronicles) as well as the creation of several existential threats like an unfriendly magical AI, grey goo, nuclear weapons, and bioterrorism.

Sounds like a reasonable reason to ensure nobody else is doing it to me. I'd rather the planet wasn't destroyed, thanks.

Sure, you can have some people doing experiments under /carefully controlled conditions/, but out in the wild? That would be ... actually irrational.
