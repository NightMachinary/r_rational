  There's a train track switch that forks into two tracks. On the main track, 5 people are tied up. One person is tied up on the side track. There's a train coming. Thor's hammer is on top of the switch. Will Odin allow someone who is not Thor to lift the hammer??

It's programmed to be lifted by 'worthy people'. I don't think the circumstances around the hammer apply.
