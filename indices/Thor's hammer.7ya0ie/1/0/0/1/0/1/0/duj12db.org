If Thor is on a spaceship with his hammer, and an explosion that destroys the ship happens in between the Thor and his hammer, does the hammer get blasted away as if it were a hammer mass, does it continue in the now destroyed space ships reference frame, does it continue in Thor's reference frame, or does it latch onto some other reference frame?

This is made even more interesting by the fact that the center of mass of the debris from the ship (including both Thor and the hammer) should continue on its previous course. This means that which course of action the hammer chooses to take changes the path through space that Thor takes.

One last caveat. How would this change if the explosion was an automatic process versus an attempt to move the hammer by a sentient unworthy being?
