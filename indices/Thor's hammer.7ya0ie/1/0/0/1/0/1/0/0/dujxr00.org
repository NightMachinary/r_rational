I think you might have mistyped the end of the second to last paragraph: if the hammer continues on with respect to the center of mass of the ship then it should change based on where Thor is not the other way around.

I would imagine that the hammer is at least semi-sentient and can react to the situation. The simplest explanation is probably that the hammer acts as a hammer normally but when someone it sees as "unworthy" tries to intentionally move it it exerts a force to counteract whatever they're exerting on it. Otherwise you get weird edge cases like what you described, which doesn't really fit what we see (not that we see it outside of a gravity well anyway) since when Thor lets go of the hammer it doesn't hang in midair motionless. If it just latches onto the greatest source of gravity exerted on it (I had this whole thing typed up about strength and distance until I realized I was basically describing Newton's law of gravity) then there's a chance it would go flying off if Thor's spaceship is ever destroyed, which would be funny. It would be pretty neat if Thor throwing the hammer is him putting its position relative to some other object. Superluminal hammers?
