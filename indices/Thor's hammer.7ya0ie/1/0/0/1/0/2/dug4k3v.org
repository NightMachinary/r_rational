Hmm how about: It is fixed in alignment to whatever mass applies normal force. So if it is resting on a helicopter or airplane, the earth, or a bad guy's chest, it will maintain its relative position to that object.

I'd say it bonds to the mass underneath it, but we see it stuck in dirt, so that doesn't work because it would just lift the dirt.

The question my answer raises though, is: could you dig under the hammer, and drop it into a wheelbarrow or something and then be able to move it around?
