I think the hammer divides all forces into sentient applied and not sentient applied. All not sentient applied forces affect it as if it were a normal hammer. All sentient applied forces are further sorted into unworthy and worthy. Worthy forces act as if it were a normal hammer. Unworthy forces do not apply at all.

The key here is that whether a force is sentient applied or not is completely subjective.

If Thor puts his hammer in an airplane, can the airplane take off with it? If he puts the hammer in the airplane while in flight and then jumps out, can the plane land with it? If the pilot shuts off the engines, will the plane hang from the hammer or will they both fall together? How does this change if Thor merely goes to a different part of the airplane instead of jumping out?
