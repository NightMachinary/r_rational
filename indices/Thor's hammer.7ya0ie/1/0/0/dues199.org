I would think that it is a fixed point in space, as the comics and previous movies would imply, but Thor Ragnarok specifically has a scene where Thor places his hammer in a dragon-ish-thing's mouth and it drops to the ground, pinned. But not through the ground, so...

Perhaps it is that Thor directed it to the ground, and then it remained fixed there?
