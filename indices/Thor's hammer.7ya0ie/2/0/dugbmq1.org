I do recall thinking, when I first read that scene, that it was (a) literally epic and (b) that Flicker was pretty much just faffing about with the hammer, given that she could have simply dropped the tungsten ball on the Thunderer directly. Which isn't to say it was an unreasonable thing for her to do -- it's not like she was short on time, and it was undoubtedly more interesting than running around in circles looking for the Big Bad.
