Assuming you're talking about the Marvel version: it's powered by Odinforce which basically means "it does whatever the fuck Odin wants it to do." That magic gives it a degree of sentience which lets it deal intelligently with people trying to find cheeky ways of moving it. The weapon doesn't ground cars and helicarriers when Thor lets it go, so it doesn't halt elevators either because it doesn't see that as being wielded. This intellect also lets it determine what, exactly, counts as "wielding" on case-by-case basis.

The hammer itself weighs more or less as much as you'd expect it to. Odin's enchantment doesn't give it additional mass, it just fixes it in place when unworthy people try to lift it. That also means that he can (and often does) use it to pin down enemies without crushing them to paste. The only way around that restriction of worthiness is to be so obscenely powerful that you can match Odin's power reserves in a slugfest and overpower the enchantment. That puts you so far up the power scale that I doubt you'd have much use for the hammer at that point.
