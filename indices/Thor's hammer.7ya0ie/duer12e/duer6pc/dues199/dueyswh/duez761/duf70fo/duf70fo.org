Whenever Thor isn't on Earth it would go flying off at over the speed of light. You have to have it fix itself to the planet (nearest gravity body?) and have some ability to resolve what is worthiness and what is lifting (like how it doesn't bring down the helicarrier) and at that point it's easier to just say it has some intelligence that solves these things.
