An excerpt from /The Fall of Doc Future/ might elucidate some things:

  Flicker, skin steaming as she cooled, skidded sideways to a halt back on the original slight hill where she'd first tried to talk, though it was a little hard to tell. In addition to the pouring rain, darkness, and strong gusting wind, everything anywhere nearby had been knocked flat. Not by her, either, which was a little unusual. All the surviving bystanders were long gone. The Thunderer stood near where he'd started as well, a little the worse for wear, though the fire in his beard had finally gone out. He looked to be getting ready to do something dramatic with his hammer again.

  The brief lift in her spirits hadn't lasted--now all she felt was a vague disgust. His first shot hadn't gone to ground like a proper lightning bolt after she tagged it and dodged, and had gone on to hit three einherjar. The Thunderer didn't even seem to care if he killed people supposedly on his own side. After that she had looped around behind him, just slowly enough to let each bolt track her. You'd think that after getting hit with his own lightning bolts four times in a row, he would learn, but no. So far, his response each time had been to wind up and throw another, more powerful, bolt.

  Did he realize that a stronger lightning bolt wasn't any faster? Maybe he wasn't even capable of comprehending that someone might be literally faster than lightning. She scowled. What was he doing now, had his hand slipped? She moved closer to investigate.

  /Oh, now, this is just insulting. A projectile, at me?!./ He'd actually thrown the hammer. He couldn't hit her with a lightning bolt, so he decided to try something four orders of magnitude slower? Right. Maybe he was trying to get her to lose her temper--but no, he wasn't that smart. Time to send it back, with a generous extra helping of kinetic energy. She poked at the handle with a finger to start to turn it... and it didn't turn.

  Ah ha. Now this was interesting. It seemed to have some sort of magical resistance to outside course changes in flight. She poked the handle harder, wondering where the kinetic energy she was putting in was going. Soon the hammer was glowing red with heat, which answered the question--it wasn't going anywhere very fast. Had it turned slightly? She squinted back along the line of flight from the Thunderer's hand, wishing she had the precise surveying and ballistics software in her visor.

  So. It was tracking her, or trying, and she recalled that it would return for him to catch if it missed. He probably thought that was safer than getting hit by another one of his own lightning bolts. And it would be, except... She looked down at the hammer, and smiled. /Let's see just how much thermal energy you can hold before your containment fails./

  She quickly heated it to over 10,000 K, hotter than the surface of the sun, by hand, before secondary heating made it prudent to start using projectiles. As the hammer turned, trying to follow her, she bombarded it with high speed clods of mud--there was no point wasting any rocks. She maneuvered behind and to each side of the Thunderer to be sure it would return precisely to him. She did a quick circuit of the surroundings to check for stragglers, but they had all kept running, and were on the other side of a ridge. Good. A few might get burned or deafened, but they'd live.

  By the time the Thunderer's hammer approached his outstretched hand on its return, its temperature was that of well inside the sun and it was radiating hard ultraviolet. The uneven ripples in the blazing light showed that the containment was wavering. The Thunderer stood braced against the plasma shockwaves, eyes closed, and was perhaps just starting to realize he was in trouble.

  Flicker sped away in a wide loop behind him, pulled a special 'present' she had transferred from her costume out of her bag, then accelerated hard as she turned back towards the Thunderer. She'd worry about cooling later. As she reached the right spot, she threw her projectile, hard and fast, then slowed to pass to the side. And as the Thunderer's hand tried to close on the handle of his already sun-hot hammer, she nailed its head with a quarter-kilo tungsten ball bearing traveling almost fifteen percent of the speed of light.

  /Mythology, meet physics./

  By the standards of nuclear weapons, it was not that powerful an explosion--only about a hundred kilotons. It was enough.

  Flicker slowed to cool off, the rain from the outer edges of the storm flashing to steam as it touched her skin. Then she turned and resumed her hunt, leaving the mushroom cloud pyre of the Thunderer behind her.
