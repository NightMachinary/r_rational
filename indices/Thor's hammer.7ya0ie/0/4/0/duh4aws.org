I think Voltron could wield Mjolnir. After all, he is Defender of the Universe. Now, I don't think any of one of the five Paladins of Voltron could lift the Hammer, but the Lions only allow the virtuous to pilot them, and Voltron can only be formed when the Paladins work together, so I think it is fair to say that Voltron is likely to have similar enough values to Mholnir to be able to wield it. Especially since Vision was able to lift it in Age of Ultron.
