I think the best explanation would be, that the hammer cannot be moved through direct exertion of force by a creature who is not either: deemed worthy by Odin, or capable of circumventing/overpowering the Odinforce.

So it would still be affected by gravity, and it would still be moved by an elevator or a plane. Since the person who is operating the plane or elevator isn't directly exerting force upon the hammer. The thing that is exerting force is not a sentient creature, hence it would behave the same as any other hammer at the same weight(I believe the official weight is 25lbs or something like that).

This would explain why Loki's chest wasn't squashed when Thor placed Mj√∏lnir on him. And I believe it's pretty consistent with the MCU.
