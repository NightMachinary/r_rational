  There's a train track switch that forks into two tracks. On the main track, 5 people are tied up. One person is tied up on the side track. There's a train coming. Thor's hammer is on top of the switch. Will Odin allow someone who is not Thor to lift the hammer??

Does Odin have awareness of what's happening around the hammer? How exactly does the hammer decide if you can pick it up (if it's a mind scan maybe Odin could get info from it)?
