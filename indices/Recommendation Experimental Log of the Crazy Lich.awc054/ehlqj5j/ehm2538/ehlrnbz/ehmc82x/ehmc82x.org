The novel really does make a slow weird 180 degree turn somewhere along the lines. Roland delves a lot into politics and plotting, and even helps rebuild his old country. Truly amazing politics, stuff you wouldn't think would be found on a comedy novel. But the church of law is a good snippet of the rational part in the beggining.
