Regarding UI strangeness, any better performance with [[https://www.webnovel.com/book/7979375206002305][www.webnovel.com/book/7979375206002305]] instead? I see that the link above is the mobile version of the website. Otherwise, going directly to the start, how about this? [[https://www.webnovel.com/book/7979375206002305/22025750413988334][www.webnovel.com/book/7979375206002305/22025750413988334]]

At time of writing, I haven't read enough of this fiction to form a meaningful opinion, but I was driven to use that website for some things ever since I noticed that Novel Updates had stopped reporting certain translations (most notably one of my favourites, Master of Gu/Gu Daoist Master/Reverend Insanity). That said, I have NoScript installed on my normal browser. ...And for reading several restricted stories-of-interest in parallel, not making use of meangreenking's recommended method is effectively infeasible. But the 'Library' system is helpful for knowing when there's an update, which is really all one needs when Novel Updates can't be relied on... I just hope there aren't other interesting novels (that thought had been dropped) reflected in neither Novel Updates nor this.
