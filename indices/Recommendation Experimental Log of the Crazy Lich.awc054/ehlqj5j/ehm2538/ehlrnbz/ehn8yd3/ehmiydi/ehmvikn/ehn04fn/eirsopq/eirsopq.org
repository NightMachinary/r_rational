Perhaps! In the same events, I also enjoyed the hints that led up to the teleportation Gu's refinement (which I didn't catch in time), and later on the less-climactic exploitation of that being a zombie lets you use Wisdom Gu's aura forever with no lifespan penalty (which I did! Though unsurprisingly, costs were narratively introduced to limit effective output).

I'm not convinced that the overall reality makes coherent sense--for instance whether certain major things happen because of true/Watsonian causes, or just narrative convenience, though every time more mechanics are revealed I feel joy--but I usually love Fang Yuan's approach to life (thoughts on death/immortality), even as it differs from my own (refreshing completely-amoral demonic path, versus benevolence).

Incidentally, did you know that there's a manhua adaptation now being made and translated? I've quite enjoyed going through the familiar scenes so far, paticularly the clashes with Fang Zheng. (The visual contrast at the end of Chapter 9, for instance... and the visual representations in chapter 15, or 18, or 20..!) (Though I was disconcerted at the time by the events in chapter 20 differing a little from those in the novel's chapter 25.)
