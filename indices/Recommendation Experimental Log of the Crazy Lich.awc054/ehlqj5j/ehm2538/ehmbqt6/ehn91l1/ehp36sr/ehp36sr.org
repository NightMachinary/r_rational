I'm not familiar with the company or anything about this scenario, but have they done anything except start charging for things that used to be free? Because, on the one hand, I get why you're angry about that. On the other hand, speaking as someone who has tried to go pro, it's hard to make a living creating content these days, and it seems pretty understandable to think "I have given this away for years when I didn't have to. I did a huge amount of work to create it, it's of demonstrably high quality, and it would be great to earn some grocery money from all that work"

Most people are not willing to pay for anything these days, and get angry when you suggest they should. There are tons of illegal upload sites, so they don't have to. You can't make a living on ads because everyone is using ad blockers...which is entirely sensible, because a few sites had to go and ruin advertising for everyone by using hard-core porn popups, speaking popunders, and malware ads. Patreon is an option, but money is tight for everyone and all too many people aren't interested in paying even when it's voluntary. It can work, but you need an enormous audience before 1% at $3.17 each (the average Patreon donation) becomes meaningful.
