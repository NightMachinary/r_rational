Thank you for the thorough explanation. You're right, that's a lot of pretty scummy stuff.

As to people not wanting to pay for things...I guess we've had different experiences? Or maybe it's just that I've had very mixed experiences and the negatives stand out more in the memory. On the one hand, I've had a meaningful number of people fund my Patreon and my Kickstarter. On the other hand, I've been told by (what felt like) a very large number of people that I was immoral and a complete douche for taking The Two Year Emperor offline so that I could publish it in Amazon's Kindle Unlimited program, which requires exclusivity. This despite the fact that I gave 2YE away for a month before taking it offline and clearly announced what was going to happen. And when I say gave it away, I mean all of it -- chapters, notes, all the unused content, even the cover art that I paid money for. So, yeah. Maybe I'm a little bitter but it's a hard-won bitterness.
