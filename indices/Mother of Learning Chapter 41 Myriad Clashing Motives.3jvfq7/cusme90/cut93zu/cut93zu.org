  It was always Daimen this, Daimen that. There were days when Zorian wondered why his parents made three other children when they were clearly so enamored with their eldest son. Really, going to another continent just to visit him? What, were they going to die if they didn't see him for a year?
#+end_quote

He dislikes him as his parents are obsessed.

#+begin_quote
  He was like Daimen in this way, only Daimen had actual skills to back up his charm.
#+end_quote

Daimen has skills and charm.

#+begin_quote
  His father always joked that Fortov and Zorian each got a half of Daimen in them: Fortov got his charm, and Zorian his competence.
#+end_quote

Zorian's father used him to insult Zorian.

#+begin_quote
  Zorian resisted the urge to scowl. Getting put under that spell by Daimen was one of his childhood traumas. It wasn't amusing at all.
#+end_quote

Daimen tortured him with animation.

#+begin_quote
  Poorly controlled, the spell is intensely uncomfortable. We don't want to give anyone traumas." Zorian narrowed his eyes. He didn't. Not even Daimen would... oh, who is he kidding? Of course he would have. Practicing such a spell on your own little brother was right up Daimen's alley.
#+end_quote

This is normal behaviour for his bro, implying other abuse.

#+begin_quote
  "Everything I do is always compared to Daimen and, to a slightly lesser extent, Fortov. It has been that way since I was a child, before Daimen ever became famous. My parents have never been shy about playing favorites, and since they were always interested chiefly in social achievements, I was always found wanting. My family has no use for a withdrawn bookworm, and made that abundantly clear over the years. Until recently, they ignored me completely, treating me more like I was my sister's babysitter than their son."
#+end_quote

His brother is famous, has social achievements, was used to attack him.

#+begin_quote
  since Daimen and Fortov were both relatively decent at music, Daimen at playing the piano and Fortov at playing the violin.
#+end_quote

Damien can play piano.

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, when Zorian was younger, he dreamt of being a great mage. The sort that legends were made of, the kind that revolutionized whole fields of magic all by themselves. In time this dream died as it became clear he didn't have the talent, the work ethic, or the right connections to make that happen. He was just a slightly above average civilian-born student with no special advantages to his name. But now? He had all the time he needed to build up an advantage over his peers and become truly great. Greater than Daimen.
#+end_quote

Becoming greater than Daimen is a major motivation.

#+begin_quote
  Zorian suppressed a wave of jealousy that washed over him. Zach was just making the most of his unique situation, just like Zorian would have in his place. It still bothered him, though, reminding him of how Daimen and Fortov could ask and get all sorts of help and concessions from their teachers, only for Zorian to fail in securing the same for himself.
#+end_quote

He has huge resentment for his brothers succeeding with charisma.

#+begin_quote
  "Well done," Ilsa said with a smile. "Not many students have such a firm grasp on their magic at this stage. I see someone is continuing in Daimen's footsteps." Zorian smiled back politely. He mustn't scowl, he mustn't scowl...
#+end_quote

The idea of following Daimen makes him scowl.

#+begin_quote
  "Daimen and I don't get along," Zorian said bluntly. "There is not much I can tell you about him that Kiri already hasn't."
#+end_quote

They have a poor relationship.

#+begin_quote
  but the sad fact was that she was closer to him in talent than, say, Daimen or some other child prodigy.
#+end_quote

Daimen was a child prodigy.

#+begin_quote
  "Umm..." Kirielle stammered. "Please don't be mad because mother told me not to tell you this because you would get mad at me but mother said you and Fortov were only accepted so easily because Daimen got so big and successful..." "Daimen had nothing to do with it," Zorian said, grinding his teeth in annoyance
#+end_quote

He hates the idea of riding on Daimen's coattails.

So, to summarize- he hates Daimen, hates the idea of relying on him, hates the idea of relying on charisma and prefers to rely on competence, and this has been reinforced by years of his parent's and brother's abuse.

It's not because of pride. Rationality doesn't mean ignoring emotions. He has years of experience avoiding Daimen, it's something important to him.
