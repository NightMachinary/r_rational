It isn't clear to me if Red Robe could have missed who he was fighting all those times, and I haven't gone back to check and see if there was an "oh shit" moment the last time they fought.

Would explain why Zorian hasn't been soul-murdered in his sleep yet, and way the whole invasion thing seems to have been sidelined. Zorian really has been making far too many ripples for Red Robe not to have noticed who he was. And after the spiders, why not soul-kill Zorian too?
