In addition to the examples other's have listed, there's the "loops" meta-story, which TVtropes has a bunch of links [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheInfiniteLoops][here]]. Rather than start at the start, these stories tend to focus on "OK loops are happening and all, but what about 300 loops later? What do the characters start doing? What about millions of loops later?"
