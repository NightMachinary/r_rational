There are only really two times Zorian has met RR, if I recall. Both in the same [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/26/Mother-of-Learning][chapter.]] Zorian disintegrates the vampire chick, and it reads like RR sees this and doesn't react, where Daimen would have been quite shocked if baseline Zorian had done that. After that he's at least partially disguised.

All of the "ripples" before that could have been caused by the aranae (in RR's mind). Zorian hasn't been in Cyoria until recently. And RR appears to not be paying attention to Cyoria enough to notice now.
