One passage bothers me:

#+begin_quote
  they were actually closer to animals such as ravens and pigs than something *dumb* like a horse or a *dog.*
#+end_quote

So I know that pigs are supposed to be smarter than you'd think, but smarter than dogs? And dogs are lumped in the "dumb" category? I would guess that the author mixed up the animals and it's supposed to be "they were actually closer to animals such as ravens and dogs than something dumb like a horse or a pig", but maybe there's something I don't know?
