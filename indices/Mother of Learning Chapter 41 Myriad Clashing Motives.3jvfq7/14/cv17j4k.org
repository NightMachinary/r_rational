Wow, what a huge bomb thrown into this chapter.

Even though the loop began several hours earlier and Zorian slept through it, he still managed to meet Red Robe in the aranea settlement a few hours/minutes (? 30 minutes) into the new loop after the soulkill. Does this mean Red Robe set up a spell to detect intruders into the settlement (if he already went there at the very start of the loop)? But why would it then take 30 minutes for him to show up after Zorian sees the settlement and act surprised upon seeing Zorian? Was it just a coincidence and he returned to check the situation after preparing things at the start of the loop?

Or does it mean the RR himself is not aware that the loop starts several hours before he (RR) wakes up? Maybe he's in a different time zone and actually wakes up 1-2 hours after Zorian (/cough/ flimsy Daimen theories).

Anybody else have any theories about the time gap?
