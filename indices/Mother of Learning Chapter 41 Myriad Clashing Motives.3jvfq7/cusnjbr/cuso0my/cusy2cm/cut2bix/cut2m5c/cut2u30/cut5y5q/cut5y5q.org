Ooh, you're in for a treat then. /Wizard of Mars/ has been out for a while, and /Games Wizards Play/ is due early next year.

There's a trilogy of transitional novellas between them - /Not on my patch/, /How lovely are thy branches/, and (soon) /Lifeboats/.

All of them are easily available as ebooks direct from the author, and hardcopies of /Wizard of Mars/ are available if you look for them.
