In the first episode of Sherlock, there was a character who offered the famous detective the following choice:

There are two identical-looking pills on a table. You may choose one pill or the other and consume it, and the character forcing the choice would consume the other. Any other decision would result in you getting shot. The poisoner knows which pill is poisoned.

Let's assume the choice is being offered in earnest. Forcing on yourself a random choice would give you a 50% shot at success. However, the poisoner knows you, knows your pressure points, and is trying to manipulate you into taking the poison. The poisoner also knows that you know this, so you can't just figure out which pill he's steering you towards taking and take the other one, because he will have predicted it.

This is the kind of situation Cat finds herself in. When you're being manipulated by someone who is better at manipulation than you are at resisting manipulation, the only viable tactic is to ignore them completely. In Sherlock's case, he should choose a pill randomly and take the 50% shot (although that's not the solution presented in the show). In Cat's, the best choice is to write off anything Akua says, not as true nor as false, but as an attempt to manipulate. Choosing to believe what she says, or to disbelieve it, is playing into her hands; assign it a T/F value of NULL and forget it. Otherwise, you're gambling that you know your own thought processes better than a master manipulator does, and that's a bad bet any day of the week.
