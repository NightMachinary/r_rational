On a side note, is the Bard actually a Named? Or the Dead King? We've never seen the Bard use an aspect, and her ability to show up and dodge clearly has it's limits which are almost rule based, not to mention her personal power seems very limited. In her interlude with Black, she was able to dodge 3 times before she was forced to disappear. Furthermore, her cycle of rebirth means that no one else can rise to name of Bard, and the nature of her work in the background means she doesn't really possess the cultural relevance among the people.

Similarly the Dead King never showed evidence of being Named in the flashbacks and again he created the cultural impact and is not something that is repeatable. Like a talented Necromancer is not going to be called the Dead King, especially since the Dead King would still be around. Rules wise, he can't leave Serenity without an invitation.

Now Cat as a Fae also has rules, in that she's bound by her oaths, and she's also being called the Black Queen, despite that not being a historical name and she's not gaining any narrative weight from her title. She was obviously named at one point, but is clearly no longer named and I think it's cemented that she too is beyond Names.

All 3 are clearly immortal (especially with the Dead King's implication) and all are eldritch horrors in their own right. But have clearly have some limits. Which implies that they've transcended the whole Named situation despite having Named like power and narrative weight.

To me, Cat's eventual story will mirror Neshamah's, Callow will end up with portals to Arcadia and while Cat resides in Arcadia as the last Queen of Winter, she can enter Callow at will (maybe as part of the Wild Hunt) and can be called on to protect Callow in it's darkest moments. The Black Queen title is not a sign of her darkness, rather the darkness of the situation to require her.

But Cat's origin story is not over yet.
