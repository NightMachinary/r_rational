You're right in saying that epithets are not universally bad. They can be a great tool for drawing emphasis on a specific quality, for example if green eyes are a sign of particular bloodline and the PoV character just now realizes that the person they are looking at is actually the long-lost heir. In situations like those, that one quality eclipses everything else for the moment and it can be a clever way of underlining something. However, that's a rather unusual literary device, and overusing those is usually a bad idea, if for no other reason than to keep it from becoming mundane and thus robbing it of its impact.
