I will say the typos and grammar have gotten noticeably worse since the 3 day a week schedule, and it's a bit unfair to complain too much about a webnovels grammar due to the lack of an editing process. A lot of this is a first draft, so I do tend to be forgiving of spelling, weird sentence structure and clunky sentences that take a little while to parse.

I definitely agree with you, I've never quite thought about it, but some of the epithet usage is a bit much, though I feel some are used for comedic effect. There are definitely some oddities with the constant name switching in text, but I've kind of associated their Names with their role/powers and their names with their personalities, a la Archer fought with the Saint of Swords vs Indrani produced another bottle of whiskey (I also object with Indrani and Bard having similar vices, if it's not plot relevant I'll be cross. I wish she was a pot head).

Dark skinned man doesn't read as racist in this regards because the text described Sonninke as very powerful and beautiful, but it's weird to describe a friend via physical characteristics.

Overall, a lot of your problems would be solved with a slight bit of editing and a couple of revisions, but the publication schedule doesn't really allow for it. I think we see wtc which doesn't have a fixed schedule has much fewer issues in comparison.
