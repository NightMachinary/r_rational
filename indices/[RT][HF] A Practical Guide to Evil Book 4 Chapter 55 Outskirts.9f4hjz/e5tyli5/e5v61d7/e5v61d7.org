  We've never seen the Bard use an aspect, and her ability to show up and dodge clearly has it's limits which are almost rule based

Well, she did mention something similar in [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2016/04/27/villainous-interlude-coup-de-theatre/][interlude Coup de Théatre]]:

  “Didn't walk here, sweetling. I try not to think about how that works too much. But you know us Bards,” Almorava smiled. “We Wander into all sorts of places.”

If I had to guess, over the millennia she managed to shift her Role from a religious advisor to something story-related. Black mentioned a Miraculous Ministrel and a Troubadour, so she probably used her awareness to create Names with different focus (Wandering Bard can teleport, Miraculous Ministrel can literally set the tone of a given scene, etc.). Catherine mentioned the Bards in stories being commonly described as inept, so the Intercessor definitely helped to shape that part of the public perception.

I'm with you on the subject of the Dead King, though. He mentioned in his first talk with the Bard that the strife brought by being a villain would kill him just as surely as time, which implies he was looking for other options.
