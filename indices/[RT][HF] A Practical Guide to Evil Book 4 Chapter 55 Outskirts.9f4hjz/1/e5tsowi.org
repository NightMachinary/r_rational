I'm wondering if this isn't my favorite depiction of mental illness, ever. We aren't bothered by a nagging voice of self-doubt, undermining and defeating all attempts at success. Instead, every validation and suggestion of self worth is categorically tossed aside. Catherine is every insecure classmate that castigated themselves and demanded that I build up their confidence.

Akua is the best thing to happen to the Guide not because she is /right/ but because she isn't a doormat. Masego competes in a different arena than Catherine, he'll rarely oppose her. Archer is just along for the ride. Deadhand is her sworn subordinate. Only Vivi has motivations that conceivably clash with Catherine's, and Vivi's power is to literally disappear.

Akua is the deuteragonist that we needed.
