Regardless of whether or not that's true or not, it's still /Akua Sahelian telling you everything you want to hear/. It's not.... /just/ self-esteem issues causing her to toss this all aside.

Though she does make some damn fine points, and is a lot of what I wanted someone in the story to say (and in such a meta-verse that's a horrifying thought), attacking the argument and not the speaker doesn't really apply when you're across from a Sahelian at your mercy.
