Oh totally. I think that Catherine missed out on (or strategically let pass) the chance to discuss the trope of *ruin*. Much of what she does brings her to further desperation; I think Catherine has properly identified her story arc as a tragedy. Whether or not she can wrench survival out of any given situation, it is increasingly clear that the universe is not eager to let her thrive.

It would be a good Aspect, if she hadn't cannibalized even that facet of her identity in service of a short-term catastrophe.
