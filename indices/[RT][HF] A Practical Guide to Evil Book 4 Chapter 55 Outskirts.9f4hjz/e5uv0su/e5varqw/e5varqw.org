I'm on board with what Cat's doing, mentally speaking. Always good to reflect on your core principles from time to time and ask "Do my actions match my values?"

My interpretation of their dialogue:

#+begin_quote
  *Akua*: Wtf do you want the drow for? I thought you just wanted Procer distracted, and DK+Malicia have arranged for that.

  *Cat*: I need an army I can control so I can send my citizens back to their farms. Otherwise the economy dies and we all starve.

  *Akua*: ... k, but drow aren't my top choice for "army I can control." There are plenty other options. Black's legions?

  *Cat*: Black's doing his own thing and I'm not going to meddle.

  *Akua*: Arcadia?

  *Cat*: I just snapped my soul in half trying to expunge Arcadian influence. Hard pass.

  *Akua*: Malicia's legions?

  *Cat*: Lol no I'm not conquering Praes.

  *Akua*: That's cute. You're cute.

  *Cat*: Let me preempt you. Literally everyone else in Creation is an enemy or an ally of an enemy.

  */Nobody/*: What about the dwarves?

  *Cat*: I'm just saying, if I become a net negative then I'm out.

  *Akua*: Whoa hang on, you do that and Callow ends as a nation.

  *Cat*: Duh, I'm not arguing that, this is only if I become a net negative, at which point Callow is screwed anyways.

  *Akua*: ... Aren't you super-biased on this? I don't think you can evaluate your own net utility.

  *Cat*: I keep making bad decisions. I can't afford not to think about this.

  *Akua*: You've also been incredibly successful. Even your supposed failures were going to happen regardless.

  *Cat*: Some of them. Not all of them i.e. your Folly.

  *Akua*: Okay so my little whoopsie might not have happened if you didn't suck. Crusade would have.

  *Cat*: You're kind of missing the point.

  *Akua*: And you're the only reason Callow isn't a vassal state or a bunch of principalities.

  *Cat*: Still moot, but I'll engage because that statement bothers me.

  *Akua*: Callowans don't agree.

  *Cat*: Democracy is a terrible way to make decisions. It's not implausible for a hero to have done a better job stopping you than I did. That right there's a big negative.

  *Akua*: Aaaaand Callow's independence? Thwarting Arcadia? Halting the Crusade?

  *Cat*: I'm now distracted and fully engaging with your flawed premise. Whoops.

  *Akua*: You're a good person and your enemies are as bad or worse. You're like Eleanor Fairfax. So great. I want to be you when I grow up. You might even be a hero, now that you're all Winterfied!

  *Cat*: ... You will never be my Chancellor.
