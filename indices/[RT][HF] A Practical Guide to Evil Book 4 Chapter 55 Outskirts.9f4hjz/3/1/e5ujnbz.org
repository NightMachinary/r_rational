I haven't noticed a problem with epithet use, but that's probably because I think it's generally not done enough.

An epithet has three purposes:

First, it reminds the reader who a character is (which is very helpful in a long-running story with Lots and Lots of Characters, ASoIaF being a particular offender with its realistic reuse of the same names). If we're suddenly in a fight between Hanno's party and the Calamities, after spending several chapters with Cat and the Woe, it might be useful to remind readers that two of the characters are sisters.

It also tells you in what context the POV character is thinking of the other character . For instance, "As the massive orc army marched towards us, I turned to my most trusted adviser on orc-human relations," carries a much different implication than "As the massive orc army marched towards us, I turned to my most trusted general," especially if they're the same person. Yes, I agree that it says a lot about how the characters see each other just in general, but it also tells us how they see each other /in the context of the current situation./ "The orc that was the highest-ranked officer in the Legions of Terror" tells us something about that character's grasp of tactics, as well as telling us that everyone else will probably be taking their cue, for how to respond to the situation, from that character.

Finally, it breaks up a feeling of repetition. You say it's unnecessary, and, with enough other text put between each instance, it probably is, but in quick-fire dialogue especially, how the characters are referred to can change the flavour and pace of the text.

Again, I'm of the opinion that epithets are generally underused, so maybe it's just a matter of taste. But if there is a problem with overuse in PGtE, I haven't noticed it.

But I agree with you completely abut the commas, though.
