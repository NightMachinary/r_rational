Regarding the use of titles or adjective phrases instead of names: It seems very thematic to me. We are in a story where popular epitaphs have power after they reach a certain level of ?renown/notoriety? and settle on a single individual. The little labels that show how the point of view character characterizes another character in that moment, be it as their body, their background, their Name/Role/title, or thier individual name gives a lot of detail shading. It can get annoying if you aren't paying attention and have to go back (I listen to PGTE on my commute or over breakfast) and then the discussion myself.
