I think I could see myself thinking of a friend as "the green-eyed woman" if the context was specifically about eye color, in the sense that it wouldn't especially bring to mind the time we had a long and open-hearted conversation about our fears two years ago - no matter how important that conversation might be to how I see the person as a whole.

Obviously the psychological aspect is tangential because in a literary context it's clearly a matter of taste. I've always thought the slightly unusual way PGtE handled it was neat but I can definitely see where you're coming from.
