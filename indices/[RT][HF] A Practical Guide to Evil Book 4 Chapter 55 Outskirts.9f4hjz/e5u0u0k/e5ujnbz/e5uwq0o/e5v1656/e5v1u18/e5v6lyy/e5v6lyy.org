Thinking about it, I can't say I agree.

I think of my sister more often as "my sister" than "[sister's name]". Ditto for my mother and father, grandparents, etc. When I think about friends of friends, and relatives of friends, I think of them by their relationship to my friend first, rather than by their name.

For friends whom I'm really close to, sure, the name is what comes to mind first. But for most people, it's... "I'll ask the guy who has the workload I need answers about... The guy in the desk over there... Bald guy, glasses... Tom! That's right! I'll ask Tom." The epithets come first, to give an outline, until my memory can catch up and provide the name.

But then, I've always been bad with names.
