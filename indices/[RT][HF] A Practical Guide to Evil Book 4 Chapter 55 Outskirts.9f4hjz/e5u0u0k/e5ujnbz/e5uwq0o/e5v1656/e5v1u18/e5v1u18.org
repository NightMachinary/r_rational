I don't really have the expertise to get deep in psychological implications of perspective, but I am certain that I don't think of my sister as "the green-eyed woman" or her dog as "the brown-furred canine." Even if I don't think of them by name explicitly, I think of them conceptually as the person as a whole, and there is no other word for "this person in their entirety" other than the name they go by.
