I don't know that we don't think about each other in epithets. Like, if you share a joke with your friend and you know they're going to enjoy it so you instinctively look at them laugh, it's arguable that, psychologically, what happens is that you are reflexively looking at "friend-as-whole-person" rather than at "friend-as-person-who-finds-this-funny". Or, in any case, I don't think there's any way to find out with our current understanding of how our minds/relationships work. In our internal monologues we refer to people by their names most of the time (i think? personally in my internal monologue the person is rarely named in the first place because it's sort of an "unspoken" background thought that provides context), but I don't think a first person narrative is necessarily meant to represent an internal monologue. Isn't that why a lot of authors have POV chapters with some text in italics in addition to it, to represent internal monologue rather than some other kind of description of the character's internal experience ?
