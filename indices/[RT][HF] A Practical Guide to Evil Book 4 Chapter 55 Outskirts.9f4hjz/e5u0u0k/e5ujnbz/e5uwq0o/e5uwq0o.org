I feel like epithets are unnecessary in all of those cases. You can introduce exposition without supplanting a character's name with it. With repetition it's somewhat muddier as doing away with them requires the author to frame the scene in a manner where constant referrals to the actors is implied clearly enough, but in other cases it feels like using epithets in a role they were never intended to fill.

As I mentioned in my rant, we humans never think about each other in epithets unless that carries a lot of weight with it. Replacing regular and natural use of names with something else in order to add in information reads as incredibly clunky to me, like using pajama pants in public. Sure, they are pretty much sweatpants as far as form and function go, but it's just not the same.
