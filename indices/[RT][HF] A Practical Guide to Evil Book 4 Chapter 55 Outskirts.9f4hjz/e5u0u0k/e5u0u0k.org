^{Warning: contains grammar fascism}

So, I've been sitting on this for a while, and I really want to talk about the comma use in the story, or rather the lack of it.

The set of English comma rules is a bogmire of exceptions and personal preference, but there's one recurring rule break which is particularly annoying to me. Long story short, if you start with a subordinate clause and follow with the main clause, the two should be separated with a comma. E.g. "Because we went there*,* he saw us."

That comma isn't /always/ necessary, but it becomes problematic if it misleads the reader and so it's become a really annoying grammatical tick. An example:

#+begin_quote
  but if they became an obstacle capture wouldn't be the objective.
#+end_quote

This makes the reader think that the Drow are becoming an "obstacle capture" which is a term of its own. This means that the readers have to stop and backtrack to make sense of it. Similarly:

#+begin_quote
  after the crusaders up north passed through the Stairway the old Lycaonese had begun his march in earnest.
#+end_quote

This makes it seem like the passage refers to the Stairway to which the old Lycaonese had done something to. As in, "the Stairway the old Lycanoese had built in order to cross the mountains," and again that interpretation is wrong and the reader has to re-read the passage to get it right. This also causes problems elsewhere:

#+begin_quote
  Ranker had hoped otherwise even after seeing his standard go down, but now that Wekesa's boy had disappeared the demons scrying links were stable again and confirmation followed swiftly.
#+end_quote

Here, with no clarifying commas, there are three ways you can interpret the same sentence until you reach wider context. A comma after "disappeared" implies that Masego vanished, a comma after "demons" implies that he banished them, and no comma at all implies that there's a missing apostrophe on the word "demons'" and that the sentence has something to do with scrying links which belong to the demons.

Additionally, I dislike the overuse of epithets in the story. Epithet is when you refer to someone by their title or other quality instead of their name, such as the Impaler, the Queen or the brown-haired man. They are usually used to refer to people whose names aren't known, such as "the bus-driver." If a character's name is known, they're almost never used in professional publishing. Their use is usually a kneejerk reaction to perceived overuse of the names (which is rarely an issue) or a deeper problem with diction which should be solved with better structuring rather than a band-aid fix.

They simplify characters needlessly and bring in extraneous information into the story when none is needed, and the color of someone's hair, eyes, skin or clothes is utterly irrelevant to almost all cases. Same goes with ethnicity. To me, it reads as incredibly awkward and clunky to slide in those tidbits of information when they are irrelevant and do nothing. In reality, we never think of each other in epithets because they are very shallow and just don't have the same meaning as a person's actual name.

The use of Names as epithets is a bit different beast because Names go a bit deeper than that. If an epithet has become a name in and of itself for someone, it's fine to use it, but generally it feels like they're used willy-nilly with characters hopping from Indrani to Archer and back. Then you have some really awkward ones like "The orc that was the highest-ranked officer in the Legions of Terror waited until the enemy was fully committed" where Erraticerrata is bloating a simple word into a massively long term.

How characters refer to each other is very telling of their perspective, especially in a first-person story. If Cat looks at someone and thinks of them as "the noble," that carries the implication that it's all she cares about. To her, that's all what the person is. If she doesn't know their name, that's just how it is, and all that person is to her is just another noble among hundreds. If she does know the name, it carries a meaningful implication that she just does not care about the person behind the title. Similarly, when regular people look at Catherine, they don't think of her as "Catherine" or "Foundling," because to them, she's primarily neither of those things. To an average Joe, she's "The Black Queen" or "the monster" or "the Queen." Again, that tells a lot about how characters perceive each other.

It's weirdly dehumanizing to see Catherine think of a close friend as "the dark-skinned man" which, in particular, feels oddly racist.
