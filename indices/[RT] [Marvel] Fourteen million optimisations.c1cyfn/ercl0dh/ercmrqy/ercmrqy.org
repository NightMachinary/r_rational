Wakanda is a weird place, even in the source material. Some random guy shows up in the movie, claims to be part of the ruling family and everyone signs up to his cause after he beats the king in ritual combat. The part about tech is spot on though, they have super stealth ships in black panther but fight with sticks? Screams cultural blindspots to me, even if they are really advanced otherwise.

haven't gotten to the Captain Marvel part yet.EDIT: Ehhh I feel like it's more of a trope than an actual jab at Captain Marvel. "You are not SMART smart and I personally don't think you would be useful so off you go"HPMOR has a similar moment, albeit lampshaded, where McGonagall tries to get Harry to be friends with Hagrid but he basically has the same reaction.
