That's an unfair interpretation if you ask me--Asgard is basically described as "Wakanda but even worse" and is given an equal amount of narrative derision. At the very least, whether or not it's actually true that the European political landscape made a "survival of the fittest" pressure to create stable forms of government, it's still an interesting idea to explain how super-civs like Wakanda and Asgard are undeniably stagnated compared to other societies.

As for Captain Marvel, her whole shtick in her movie is doing things her own way and telling authority to shove it. Those qualities, while helpful in other situations, are the opposite of suitable for a long-term, confined-space waiting game. The feeling that it's a dig at feminism is more likely just an expression of the stilted dialogue pervading the fic.

For sure, there are a helluva lot of problems with this fic. It has the Mother of Learning problem times 1000 where everyone has the same voice. Tony seems to forget about the existence of Pepper and Rhodes (who would have also been an ideal choice for the mission) which is majorly out of character. Black Widow (yet another great choice) gets mentioned once and vanishes thereafter from the narrative. So, going after Wakanda and CM as its major issues just feels kinda weak.
