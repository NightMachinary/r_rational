Some interesting ideas / clever tricks / cute tweaks to how the movies went. Felt a bit clunky/didactic in certain spots though (goes with the territory I suspect).

Needs an editing pass, as it's somewhat inconsistent about tense (sometimes flips between past/present within a single sentence, or repeatedly within a paragraph) and has some minor words like "the" or "a" either missing, or using what seemed to me like the wrong one.

A bit lacking in tension, with how the plan just... /works/, with no major mis-steps or failures or adversity. That is perhaps the whole point of the piece (what should in theory be possible with 14 million futures worth of foresight if only that had been used effectively).
