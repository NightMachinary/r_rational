Very enjoyable reading!

I notice that some readers have an issue with the lack of struggle and stress.

Those sre not big craving of mine, but if you have interest in improving the mass appeal, you could add a sense of struggle and tension by having nearly the entire story take place in successive failed visions.

Instead of giving flawless advice in the beginning of the story, every time Tony fails the full failure and its pain and heartache is played out for as long as it remains interesting, and then we're taken back to another thing that Strange adds to the conversation (instead of the little blurb about what happens if Thanos minions find out, they just do and it goes to crap and Strange tells Tony to zip it. A paragraph spacing later and it simpky says "No implying it either, Tony.")

After that, we read how this addition changes Tony's actions and the story then continues until we are finally in the end given the perfected ending, feeling like the characters "earned" it.

I greatly enjoy the current writeup however and don't feel as much need for tension so kudos to you for an excellent read!
