I think you're right that that's how it worked in the movie. But in this fic, he's able to advise Stark on a ton of what he needs to do during the span of time when Strange himself is dead, and therefore "blind." I guess it's possible that he skipped ahead in the twelve successful timelines and had Stark tell him everything he'd done to succeed, but I'm not convinced that would be enough information even after cross-referencing all twelve. There would be countless failure conditions where Strange is either never brought back or gets killed again before he can talk to Stark--many of which would involve decisions that victory!Stark wouldn't even think worth remarking on, since /he/ made all the right choices and never knew that a different one would have tanked the plan.
