  The part about tech is spot on though, they have super stealth ships in black panther but fight with sticks?

Iron Man uses his nanotech suit to make his fist bigger when punching bad guys, but he doesn't get written off as a primitive for it. Comic book combat relies heavily (if not entirely) on Rule of Cool. Cap uses a shield, Black Widow uses taser sticks, Spider Man uses web shooters, and Wakandans use laser spears. None of these are optimal forms of weaponry, but one gets mocked a lot more than the rest.
