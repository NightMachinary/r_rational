The issue is shielding - if shield tech got advanced enough to stop projectile weapons, shooting from a distance isn't going to be useful anymore. And if anti-shield tech can't be minaturized to bullet-size (and/or is too expensive to waste) then you have to get up close and personal with your weapon.
