They are pretty well suited for their intended purposes, resources and limitations, however.

Black Widow and Cap also use guns and have no access to repulsortech guns, Peter's suit definitely has more lethal weaponry but the web is fantastic for non-lethal takedowns and often more effective than a gun would be against opponents with high durability.

Iron man's giant foot is mocked, by me at the very least, but he did try a whole bunch of more advanced weapons before he started punching.

Wakanda are supposed to be tribal warriors who haven't fought in a war since their nation was founded and when they were put to the test it really, really showed that they were not nearly as effective as a military unit would be.
