This leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The treatise on Wakanda's inferiority was both unnecessary and uncharitable-- Iron Man and Doctor Strange get to have a rationality boost, but Wakanda is inherently backwards because it's not European?

Captain Marvel gets sent away because she's too... Moody and unpredictable? This just feels like it's there to "own" feminists.

There's a lot of missing articles. It seems to give the writing a Russian accent.
