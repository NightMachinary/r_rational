Presumably because individual actors being stupid about their weaponry is more believable than a whole civilisation doing the same. Granted it's still stupid in /both/ cases. You'd just think that /someone/ would go "Hey, guys, you know how our cutting edge armed forces would have been mowed down with trivial ease on a world war 1 battlefield, let alone a modern one? Maybe we should do something about that."
