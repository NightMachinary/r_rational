This.

Everybody seems to forget that Wakanda has not fought in an actual war for generations. They didn't do anything about the Slave Trade, they didn't engage in any of the World Wars, and all of their in-fighting is solved by ritual combat.

There are a hundred thousand ways to rationalize Wakanda while letting it keep its flavour. Why do they solve their problems via ritual combat? Because when you have such a small amount of land, a relatively small population, and advanced technology, a civil war can be devastating. You could easily write a fic about how Wakanda uses ritual combat to decide who can be king, simply because they aren't willing to risk fighting an actual war against each other. And remember, ritual combat is only ever invoked if somebody challenges the king/heir. It pretty much gives any agitators a single target to aim for that minimizes societal disruption - no need to seize the means of production if you can just train to win one fight instead. And given how insular, tradiotionalist and isolationist Wakanda culture is, the chances of a Killmonger happening were pretty damn low. If your goal is stability rather than effective leadership (because how hard can ruling a peaceful, hyper-advanced, 1rst World+ country of content citizens really be), than there are ways to justify ritual combat.

HPMOR took the time to actually rationalize Dumbledore and his behaviour. If he had just been a dumb crazy irrational old man in the end the fic would be, in my opinion, at least 30% worse. If you are going to write a rational story in a setting, then you should sprinkle rationality liberally throughout the world.

This story feels bad to me, essentially, because its what HPMOR would have been if its HPJEV versus canon Voldemort and canon Dumbledore. Thanos is stupid. Wakanda and Asgard are dumb, because the author can't be bothered to rationalize them, and the plan works perfectly. A nice rational protagonist, sure, but a much, much poorer story.
