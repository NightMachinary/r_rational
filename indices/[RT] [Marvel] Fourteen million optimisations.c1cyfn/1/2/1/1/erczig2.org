  It's outright stated by at least one BP character that guns are more primitive than their particular melee weapons.

Doesn't really matter if it's "more primitive". You can have the fanciest most advanced superalloy blade in the world, but as long as it requires you to run up to someone and fight them in melee it's not going to be as useful for combat as something that does the same job from a distance. And that takes us back to them not being able to figure out any sort of mass-produced functional ranged weaponry.
