  The part about tech is spot on though, they have super stealth ships in black panther but fight with sticks

We see a lot of higher-tech species (or, in Wakanda's case, cultures) in the Marvel-verse using a combination of guns and melee. It's outright stated by at least one BP character that guns are more primitive than their particular melee weapons.

So it's not surprising that a high-tech warrior culture would be more interested in stick fighting than you'd expect.
