To me, the racist bit was not saying that Wakanda was primitive because it didn't have any competition to force it to improve its military/government structures, it was the "unlike European countries" comparison. Because of course no other areas of the world have ever had military competition between comparable nation-states... It just reeks of "Europe/West good, everywhere else bad for objective reasons".

I didn't read the Captain Marvel bit as sexist but rather about her individual ability to sit still in a small spaceship for weeks and not start trouble, but given that he took Captain America it does seem a little suspect, or at the very least un-thought-through, which is a bigger sin in the eyes of a good chunk of this sub.
