That's a really good point, and not just because of the Captain Marvel part. This was an issue throughout the story--the characters don't act like people. They all sound the same, nobody has any inconvenient motivations or conflicts even when they ought to, and Stark behaves like an AI. He doesn't have to struggle with or work around his resentment toward Cap, because this version of him doesn't have an inner emotional life.

I feel like there's little excuse for this in fanfiction, where the characters' personalities and histories are ready-made. But I see it a lot in optimization fic--the writer describes a series of events in which the characters do everything right and fix everything, but the characters don't feel human, so the reader has no reason to /care./
