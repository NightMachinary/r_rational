This just occurred to me, but aren't you not able to see the future past your own death with the time stone? Wasn't that the whole reason the Ancient One knew she was going to die? How was Dr. Strange able to see all those futures when he died in the snap?

(unrelated to this story: how was Thanos able to destroy the stones without destroying/harming the universe? Didn't the Ancient one sort of imply that if they were gone/destroyed that it had serious repercussions? I was under the impression that the time stone didn't just control time, it enabled time to exist in the universe or something like that)
