It's funny, this reminds me of a discussion I had with a friend right after watching Endgame; I said the movie was essentially every bad fanfiction people could have written after Infinity War, as executed by competent Hollywood writers.

And now we have the fanfiction version!

Honestly though, I didn't really like this story. There wasn't a single big turn off for me, but it just felt poorly written, with a lot of bits that felt rushed or out of place.
