My head canon for how it worked was that Dr. Strange did optimize, but what he did in the movie was the optimization. If he gave Tony too many details and too much hope, Tony would get too determined and confident in himself, and just create Ultron 2.0 which would finish off Earth. If Strange gave Tony fewer details and less hope, then Tony wouldn't have tried time travel at all, he may have even committed suicide- something he even attempted it seemed by ripping out the arc reactor in the beginning of Endgame.

The 14 million possibilities may have even been a lie- something to give Tony a feeling it would be incredibly challenging, but possible- the real number of futures he saw could have been in the trillions, and he saw multiple slightly different winning futures.
