I see it as Thanos actually being insane. He spent decades committing genocide to try and save the universe. By the time he knows of the Stones, he has already done it several times.

If he could just double the resources with a snap, what does that mean for all the people he killed? Was it just a waste?

He can't see another way to use it, necause it invalidates so much of his life. He cannot conceive of another way to use it.

His world being destroyed "proved" he was right. And he followed that commitment to the end.

He was called the Mad Titan for a reason.
