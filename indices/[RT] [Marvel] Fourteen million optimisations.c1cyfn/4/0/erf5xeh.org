On the other hand, if Strange had foreseen that asking Thanos to spare Stark would cause him to kill him instead, he wouldn't have done that. And then I guess it just goes around and around forever!

In all seriousness, I took it as Thanos not knowing that Strange and Stark didn't have a personal bond. Like this is just my headcanon, but Thanos had recently killed the person he loved most to achieve what he saw as the greater good, and he was openly proud of what he saw as his uniquely strong will in being able to make those kinds of sacrifices. So when Strange pleaded for Stark's life, I think Thanos--assuming under the circumstances that Strange actually cared about Stark--was like, "Oh, of course. Unlike me, these weak-willed humans can't just accept the trade-off of one loved one's life for a shot at what they see as the greater good. This man is making a stupid and emotionally-fueled decision, and I understand how he feels, even though I and I alone was strong enough to overcome that feeling." It wasn't the rational move, but I think it was a plausible move for an intelligent, thinking character with this specific egotistical blind spot to make.

(The /really/ dumb thing about Thanos is that he honestly thinks killing half the universe is the best way to use a magic genie wish gauntlet to address resource scarcity...)
