Stephen doesn't need to spoof the gauntlet to make sure Tony is in the half that survives, because when he asks that Thanos "Spare his life" in exchange for the Time Stone, Thanos - because he is an honorable being and not a maliciously literal genie - interprets Sparing His Life as including sparing him from the snap five minutes hence.

Of course if Thanos was an actual thinking intelligent character he would have instantly realized what it means that a man who can see the future is giving up the Time Stone and dooming half of all life in exchange for asking one person to live and would have instantly killed Tony instead.
