I enjoyed it. I don't think you quite managed to capture Tony's voice, but that's pretty tough to do I think and it didn't detract too much since he doesn't actually have much reall dialogue.

There are a LOT of sentences that should start with "The" (and a few that should start with "A") where it's just omitted making them read very oddly.
