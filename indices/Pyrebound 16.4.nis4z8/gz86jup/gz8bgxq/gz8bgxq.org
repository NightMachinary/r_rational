Yeah, I couldn't think of any way to foreshadow this beyond the revelation in the rain itself to tell readers "something about a rainstorm around a pyre gives Ram the idea that Mannagiri's not invincible after all." Wellsprings were introduced waaaaaaaaay back when (Ram visits a wellspring in 1.4 IIRC, and they're mentioned maybe three or four more times in-text), but there's no particular reason the reader would hang onto them as relevant. So it was a storytelling problem with no clear solution. TYVM for giving feedback, I depend on it to know when the story's going off the rails.

(I thought of the armor as just a fun bonus to show that Ram wasn't sitting around with his thumb up his butt the whole time; the real killer app is the heatsink shield IMO)
