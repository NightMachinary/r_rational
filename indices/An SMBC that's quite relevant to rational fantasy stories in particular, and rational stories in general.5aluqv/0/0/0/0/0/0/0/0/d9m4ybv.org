Its definitely a case where it depends on the writer, but the standard explanation is that Superman is still very human-like in how his brain operates. In some cases he can perform feats of mental fortitude that surpass humans, but he still has limits. Essentially, he doesn't just, "Do more superheroing instead," for the same reason most of us can't sit down and do our jobs for sixteen hours a day, seven days a week. It has bad side effects for your mental health. This fact that he can't just be everywhere at once and do everything he wishes he could even though he is capable of doing much more than a normal person tends to be at the core of most well written Superman stories (although the example of why he spends time at the Daily Planet is rarely addressed directly).
