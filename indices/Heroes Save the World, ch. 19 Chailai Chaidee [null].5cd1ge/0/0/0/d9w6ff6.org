Maybe it's not just altruism but desire to change the world in general (and a shared birthday) that makes the kids recipients of powers, and we just haven't seen any of the assholes yet.

As a corollary, it's plausible that the strength of their altruism/desire is linked to the strength of their power. Hannah is focused on her siblings' welfare, and she can disappear coins. The two kids who want to save the world have death-precognition and possibly biological reprogramming.
