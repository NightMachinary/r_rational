Me personally I've always been a big fan of anime and I've always wanted to write my own anime type of story but yea there's much better ways to prepare yourself for an alien environment then splicing animal genes into your own. I'll be making the procedures much more sensible and easier to understand.

Speaking of works of original fiction I have a story called MASKS that follows an alternate universe watchmen type of story. I can tell you more about it if you'd like.
