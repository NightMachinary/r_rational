Also, for what possible reason could cockroaches evolve into two-handed five-digited bipeds, of all the bloody forms? They even [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/terraformars/images/b/b6/Terraformar_spreading_his_wings.png/revision/latest?cb=20130801102317][have human musculature]]. That's insane. If I was writing a ratific of this, I would... leave the roach!people as they are, have the characters be hopelessly confused about their anthropomorphism as well, make it a plot point, and then come up with some fascinatingly convoluted reason for that. Is that a human conspiracy? An unknown convergent-evolution law? Did they overtook us in biotechnology and changed their forms to exploit our empathy? Are they capable of shapeshifting? Is this a plot of a crazy AI? Is this a plot of crazy interstellar aliens? Are we trapped in a simulation? Is this evidence that the story is being written by a human author? The imagination runs wild!

A well-chosen reason here could also double as the reason for why the humanity didn't just nuke the enemy.
