Well ok, good luck with that. I'll admit I haven't seen the anime/manga but from your description and browsing the tvtropes page it doesn't look promising. There are certainly better ways to modify yourself to fit in an alien environment than splicing in animal genes, among other problems, so the fundamental premise would have to be changed to the point where you have something that looks entirely different. Something like [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Vigil][Vigil]] crossed with xcom from the ethereal's perspective maybe.

"Terraforming life forms fight off a human invasion" sounds like an interesting premise from either side, but honestly it would probably be better if it was outright original fiction.
