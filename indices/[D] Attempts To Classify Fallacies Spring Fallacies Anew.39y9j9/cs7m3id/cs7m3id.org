Things might get a bit slow on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], but I still come here for rational fiction and fanfiction, not to discuss logical fallacies, or worse, discuss the discussion of logical fallacies, or even worse, discuss the discussion of the fallacy of using logical fallacies. Looks like a cool discussion overall, but I will be downvoting it to reduce visibility.

I'm posting, rather than just silently downvoting, in hopes of directing this subreddit away from things like this and towards other things.
