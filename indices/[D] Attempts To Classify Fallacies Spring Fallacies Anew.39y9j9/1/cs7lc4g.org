I'll point out that appeal to emotion (aka pathos) is one of the three rhetorical appeals; it's not a fallacy, even though everyone seems to treat it like one. It's the weakest appeal, but that's no reason to disqualify it outright.

There's a similar confusion about ethos and appeal to authority, but I digress.
