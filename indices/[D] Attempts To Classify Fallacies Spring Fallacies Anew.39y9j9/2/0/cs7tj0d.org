Correct. When an expert claims X, there are three circumstances in which this is a fallacy.

First, the experts themselves do not agree about X. Second, the expert is not an expert in the right topic. Lots of examples here. Third, this was a response to an evidence based argument. So if I say "X is false because of Y", then an expert who says "No, it is not" has just committed a fallacy. There are no exceptions to this rule. (Yes, it applies to flat-earth believers. If your expert cannot refute the claims of flat-earthers he needs to go back to school.)
