Ted Chiang's short story Exhalation has been mentioned on this sub before. [[http://escapepod.org/2009/04/10/ep194-exhalation/][Here is a good reading of it on EscapePod.]] Also Patrick McClean's How to Succeed in Evil is [[http://podiobooks.com/title/how-to-succeed-in-evil-the-novel/][freely available as a podiobook.]] Strangely though, rational nonfiction seems more easily available in audio form than rational fiction.
