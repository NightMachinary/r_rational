  I couldn't figure out what layer of reality I was supposed to believe in, and when it got to the level of tech it did, I was just left thinking "well how the hell am I supposed to believe in anything at this point?"

Yeah this is actually may biggest problem with it. A major character blames Laura for not seeing it as a setup/trick, but really, there are so many levels of virtual realities and hyper intelligences and conspiracies I don't see how Laura was supposed to figure it out.
