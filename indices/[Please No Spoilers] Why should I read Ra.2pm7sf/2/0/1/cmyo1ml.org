Not really, /The Clockwork Rocket/ has major plot points hinging on concepts in relativity (aka "rotational science"). It's harder than hard, more fictional science than science fiction. /Ra/ does not take the story in that direction.

But they do share a theme of showing something "impossible" and then gradually giving us the puzzle pieces to reverse-engineer it. If you enjoyed it for that reason, then I think you'll enjoy /Ra/.
