Generally, the reasons I've heard for reading it and the reasons I have myself all boil down to:

1) Intelligence in characters, plot, and world-building

2) A magic system which is throughly explored and logical, and

3) An intriguing and continually expanding, exceedingly rational mystery that the characters attempt to solve.

Sub-reasons include feminism, realism, high-level science and math language used well--yet in a manner that makes understanding them not essential for story comprehension/enjoyment--and what many find to be an immersive writing style and structure.

One thing that greatly increased my enjoyment of Ra was skimming for plot/character developments on my first read-through of each chapter, then trying to wrap my head around the technical aspects on subsequent ones. Taking it a bite at a time really made it fun, and the wait in between chapters made re-reading especially desirable.
