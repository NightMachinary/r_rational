I found Ra to be bizarrely interesting. As in, I read the whole thing up to date (a few chapters before the finale) and was bored most of the time. But I was incredibly hyped and engaged after I caught up, and the story was such that I retroactively enjoyed the whole thing.

But if you've already tried it and didn't enjoy it, there's no sense in forcing it. Not everyone can enjoy something like Ra.
