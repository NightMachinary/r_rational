It's interesting that you put it that way- Fine Structure to me fell into the category of stories that are interesting and fun solely for the amount of cognitive work required for the reader to fully understand what's going on in a given scene.

By contrast, Ra was not fun to puzzle through. I'm not sure what the important difference between the two is, and 2 minutes of thought hasn't given me any insight.
