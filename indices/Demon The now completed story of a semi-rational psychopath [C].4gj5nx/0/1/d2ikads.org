In retrospect, I put the high point at Chapter 12. The timeskip is at the end of that chapter, so it's a good place to stop.

It actually felt like an ending to me. The OSS is beheaded, the main +villain+ antagonist is presumed dead, and the only people who even know that demons exist are the protagonists. Jimmy wins.

And he's left in a position to munchkin his way to whatever he wants. At first he was limited by not understanding his powers; then he was limited because he had to fight a smart enemy with more resources than him; but now, for the first time, he has no limits (he does not).
