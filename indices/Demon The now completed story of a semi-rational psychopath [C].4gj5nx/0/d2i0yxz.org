I really enjoyed the first part of Demon, but there comes a point (hard to identify when) that it just jumps over to being something else that's more disappointing. I still stuck through it at a rate of a page a day, and think it would probably read better if binged, but there are some real problems in terms of character motivations, world-building, and physics. The first few sections are great though, which meant that where it winds up left me feeling cold.
