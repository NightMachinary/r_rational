I'm going to pretend nobody's already made name for it and coin a term for my experience: Scope Exhaustion.

When it's one insane man on the run and there are a few genuine risks, it's easy to stay invested. When it's a massive global conspiracy of immortals... who cares?

Engaging stories have something at stake that I can comprehend.

(Luckily now the whole thing is complete and it's a comic so it can be consumed in a few hours. Less time to stop and think and get distracted.)
