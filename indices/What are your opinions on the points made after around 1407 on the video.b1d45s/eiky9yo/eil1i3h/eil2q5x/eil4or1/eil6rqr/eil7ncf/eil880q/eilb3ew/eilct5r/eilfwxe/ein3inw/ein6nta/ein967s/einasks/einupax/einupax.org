You can have many purposes for a morality system. It's a system of rules to handle the world, like "always be emphatic" or " obey your betters" or "obey rules 1-100 in this book". Anyone can have one or try to instate one for any reason.

If you are using a moral system as a system of control, yes you need to give up some control. This is an issue for china. They follow communism which is about sharing wealth with workers, but their leaders want to hoard the workers wealth and buy American capitalist goods and beat up people and have prostitutes and drugs, so there are regular anti government protests.

Empathy is biased as I noted. In the study the stronger your empathy the more violent and angry you get so your intuition that more empathy would solve it is false. More empathy means a lot more empathy for people of the same race and little for outsiders.
