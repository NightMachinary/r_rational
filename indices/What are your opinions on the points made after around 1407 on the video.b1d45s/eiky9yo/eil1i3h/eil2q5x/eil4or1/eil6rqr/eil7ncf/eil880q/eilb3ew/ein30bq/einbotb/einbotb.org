  If you repeatedly violate social norms in a flagrant way

But given widespread education, haven't we taught people /not/ to break it in a flagrant way? The point I'm making is that, don't our systems punish stupidity over guilt? Consider again, the higher in a social structure criminals go, the less likely they are to be punished. And the higher we go, the more the social structure (Reputation and the law) itself becomes a weapon for immoral individuals, as corruption shows.
