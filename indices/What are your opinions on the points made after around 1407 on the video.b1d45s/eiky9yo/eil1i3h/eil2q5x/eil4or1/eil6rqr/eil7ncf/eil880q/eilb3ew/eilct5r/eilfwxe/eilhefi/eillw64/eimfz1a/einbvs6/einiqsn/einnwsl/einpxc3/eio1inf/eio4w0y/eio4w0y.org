Because that's what my culture taught me ? Because our ancestors were smart enough to know pro social behaviors had higher overhaul long term utility, and set up those values and reward and punishment systems into the culture and society they were a part of ?

I'm an adult, socialized human in the 21st century, my actions and viewpoints are not representative of innate human instincts and nature.

Have you heard of the analogy where the fish in water can't tell it's using water to swim ? Culture is the water here..

What you are attributing to innate instinctual human nature is just cultural.
