Nothing there says they can't understand good and evil.. It's a learned concept, how could they not understand it if they can learn ? They do bad in spite of it, not because they can't get it.

Again you are conjecturing and bending semantics deliberately to try to make your statement true. It doesn't work. It might 'win' you an argument somewhere, but you'll still believe in a lie.. You seem reasonable, why you're trying so hard to hold on to an unreasonable, unfounded belief, it's not rational.
