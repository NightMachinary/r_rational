  Well, what's your idea of a moral person? And do they actually exist?
#+end_quote

My idea of such a moral person is someone who doesn't act from rational POV, but from their strongly internalized sense of empathy. To this person, acting immorally would not just be a betrayal of his ideals, but also a betrayal of himself, of who he is and how he defines himself.

This is the inherent difference between sociopaths and naturally empathic people. Sociopaths lack a conscience, which means empathic people have a conscience. They have an innate sense of right and wrong, which exists like an emotion separate from rational thought. Would a moral person, defined as a person who always listens to his conscience, to his empathy, do what you suggest?
