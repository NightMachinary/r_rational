  But, ultimately, both reputation and the law become systems which can be manipulated by charisma and political power, as does all societal systems. These manipulations can and has, I'd actually argue more often than not, led to individuals who will harm others to get their way.

There are always individuals who would harm others to get their way. Morality is not meant to prevent those people from existing, but rather to make sure they can't just do whatever they want, because all the other people will react together.

So yes, both reputation and law exist to channel people into behaving in certain ways, which are more accommodating to long term successful co-existance.

  Jimmy Saville, and all his abuses were only condemned post-mortem. John Wayne Gacy contributed to charity, led councils, got an amazing reputation and was only discovered through an accident. Only around 60 percent of murder cases in America actually end up in arrest. How many cases of cops abusing their powers, and then getting away is unreported?

Right! But without those systems, people would still do evil things, and they wouldn't have to try to hide it by pretending to be a good person.

And of course no one argues that the current systems are perfect.

Yes? And so would a 'moral' person.
