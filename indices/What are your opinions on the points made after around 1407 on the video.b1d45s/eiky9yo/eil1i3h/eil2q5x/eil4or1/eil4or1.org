But, ultimately, both reputation and the law become systems which can be manipulated by charisma and political power, as does all societal systems. These manipulations can and has, I'd actually argue more often than not, led to individuals who will harm others to get their way.

Jimmy Saville, and all his abuses were only condemned post-mortem. John Wayne Gacy contributed to charity, led councils, got an amazing reputation and was only discovered through an accident. Only around 60 percent of murder cases in America actually end up in arrest. How many cases of cops abusing their powers, and then getting away is unreported?

Chiefly, the question I'm asking is that, if a rational person had Plato's ring of Gyges and could do anything without fear of punishment, would he take actions that harmfully affect people he didn't care about?
