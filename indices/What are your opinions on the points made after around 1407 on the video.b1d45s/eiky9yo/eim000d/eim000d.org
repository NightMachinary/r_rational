I think part of the problem is that people generally dont understand their own value systems and their relationship to morality and game theory. My theory is that there are actually four types of morality with different functions in society: Punish Defectors (eye for an eye), Reward cooperators (golden rule), minimize suffering, and maximize flourishing. Morality only cares about the outer game, not the minigames contained within the outer game. That's why people can be rivals with each other in the context of a board game but still be friends outside it. If you lose a minigame you've only lost a small amount of payoff, and your total payoff across all minigames can still be pretty high. I wonder if people who are poor sports or cheaters tend to be people who think they have a low payoff in the outer game so they try to gain as much payoff as they can anywhere they can get it, even at the expense of other people's outer game payoff.
