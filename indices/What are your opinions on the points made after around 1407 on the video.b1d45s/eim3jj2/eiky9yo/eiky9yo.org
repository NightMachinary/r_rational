Summary of the relevant chunk of the video: "hyper-rational decision-making agents" will have their morality eroded over time if they follow game theory too closely.

Response: Only if their time horizon is short. Game theory in particular and rationality in general tell you how to achieve whatever your goal is. If your time horizon is short (e.g. "how do I win this game of poker"?) then they will lead you to cheat / do sloppy work / etc. If your time horizon is long (e.g. "how do I win a game of poker every night for the rest of my life?") then they will push you towards prosocial behavior that demonstrates integrity and thereby improves reputation, as lacking reputation makes it harder to convince others to help you.
