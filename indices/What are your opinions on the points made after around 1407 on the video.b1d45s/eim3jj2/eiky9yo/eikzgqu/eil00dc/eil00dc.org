While a goal might be rational, and you might use rational strategies to achieve that goal, becoming so obsessed on achieving that goal that you ignore any other consequences of your actions is irrational by definition (but sadly, not uncommon). That's why so many people who identify themselves as "rationalist" also identify themselves as "utilitarian": if you pretend that the only consequences of your actions are the intended ones, you're deluding yourself.

To put it another way... I'm going to define "ethics" as an optimal self-consistent moral code, defined such that every person benefits from every person adhering to it, and such that the most good comes to the most people by doing so.

If someone tries to pursue a goal, even a noble one, but disregards ethics in that pursuit, then that is harmful to society, both through the breach of ethics itself, as well as the example it sets for other people striving to achieve goals. The rational thing for society to do is to remove any incentive for defaulting on the ethical obligation by taking away whatever they've achieved, and, in addition, apply punishment so that the person is worse off for their lapse.

If you do that, then a rational actor would price the removal of achievement and the disincentive into their decisions, and continue to adhere to the system of ethics.

We, and the characters in "Billions," don't live in a world with such a well-defined ethical system (yet), but something resembling it is still there, and, whole I haven't watched the show, it sounds, from that video, like it's those societal disincentives that are punishing the characters for their moral lapses and obsession with achieving their goals at any costs. If they're not pricing that into their decision-making, then, however rational their goal, they're not really behaving rationally, even if the methods they take to achieve that goal adopt the trappings of rationality (e.g. game theory).
