Game Theory makes a number of assumptions, (which you should examine before using) and even in hypothetical scenarios, its idea of rational isn't necessarily the best way to go. All this criticism of Game Theory misses the obvious one: what do you value? Game Theory's recommendations of what to do are based the value you place on outcomes. (As well as everyone else's view, so you can predict what they do. If you see "following Game Theory" as bad, say, morally, then maybe you haven't taken into account the value you place on being moral/not being immoral.) What's next, criticizing 'expected utility theory' for 'recommending you buy lottery tickets'?
