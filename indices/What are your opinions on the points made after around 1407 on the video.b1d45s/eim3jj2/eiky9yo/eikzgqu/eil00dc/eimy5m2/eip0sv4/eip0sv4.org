Yeah. Using game theory to make decisions can make your decisions more effective towards your goals if you do it right. Whether this is good or bad depends on whether your goals are good or bad.

Unfortunately it often seems that game theory is a more effective tool for evil than for good, but it is an effective tool for both.
