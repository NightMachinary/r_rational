Without sufficient reason? That is curious.

If someone says something awful and hurtful to you , is it alright to punch him in the face? Is it alright to insult his parents?

Aren't the two actions unjust, more than the actions that caused them, an overreaction? But don't they come naturally to everyone? Are they not, understandable, despite being immoral?
