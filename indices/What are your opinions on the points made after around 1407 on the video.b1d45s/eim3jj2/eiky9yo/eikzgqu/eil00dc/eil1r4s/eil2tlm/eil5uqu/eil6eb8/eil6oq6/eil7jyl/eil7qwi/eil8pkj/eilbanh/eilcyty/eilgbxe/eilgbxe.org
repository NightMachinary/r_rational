  Of course sometimes we get angry to something that doesn't deserve (that much) anger.
#+end_quote

That goes a long way to clearing my confusion. I remember you saying something like

#+begin_quote
  Anger without cause
#+end_quote

So I was confused about what you meant there. Since we agreed people don't get angry without a cause, what you really meant was, "Anger that goes into overreaction"? Am I right here?
