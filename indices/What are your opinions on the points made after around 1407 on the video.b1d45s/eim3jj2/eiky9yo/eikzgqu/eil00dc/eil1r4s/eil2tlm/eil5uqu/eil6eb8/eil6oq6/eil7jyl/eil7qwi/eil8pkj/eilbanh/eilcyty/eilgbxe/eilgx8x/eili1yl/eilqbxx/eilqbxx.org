I tend to equate immoral with unacceptable, modulo enforcement practicality. Then you have moral/acceptable acts, and commendable acts. This is fuzzy because everything is fuzzy :P

If someone says something sufficiently awful and hurtful, with direct intent, I think can be just/moral/acceptable to punch them in the face. But not injure them severely, or not if you're a trained martial artist, etc. I don't think I'd ever do it myself, because it's... low-status?

Of course this depends on the details. In general escalating conflict is always suspect, but sometimes you have to make a stand.
