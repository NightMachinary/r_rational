There are no 'hyperrational decision makers'. At best some decision makers are slightly more rational than others. We are all running on roughly similar hardware, and that hardware is a scary collection of kludges thrown together by evolution. We are way better at rationalization than at making actual rational decisions.

I don't know the source material here, but the fact that a law enforcement person ends up risking jail time (@12:25) is good evidence that he was not that good at managing his risks, was not rational and was rationalizing instead.

So, don't trust yourself, I guess. And don't blame game theory for your own irrationality.
