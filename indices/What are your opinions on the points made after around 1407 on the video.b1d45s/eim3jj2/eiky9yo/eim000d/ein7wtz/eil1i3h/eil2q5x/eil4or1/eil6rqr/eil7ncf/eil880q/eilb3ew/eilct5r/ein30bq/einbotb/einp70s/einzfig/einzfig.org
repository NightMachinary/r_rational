  the worst offenders are punished at least.

I'm curious about that. Who do you think will escape: the average bank robber that took 3,500 in cash, or an average white collar criminal who stole 500k per crime? Source:

One average white collar crime, on a mathematical scale, is worse than 3 years of weekly bank heists. Yet it's clear white collar crime is rarely even reported, let alone prosecuted.

The system doesn't disincentivize crime. It disincentivizes being poor. Lower criminals get the stick, criminals higher up not only rarely get the stick , they get /a lot/ more tools and influence to balance the little punishment they get.

The social structure supports the social structure, and the great divide supports the greater division.

  These issues are systematic in the law reputation and empathy.

I feel you've lumped in empathy in there without proper consideration of what it means. The "Poor and unpopular" student versus " Rich and popular" one, which better describes the typical 'relateable' MC? Why is the Robin Hood archetype so common? Why is the David Vs Goliath trope so widespread?

Empathy asks us to empathize with victims and sufferers first and foremost. It's the great equalizer against the system.
