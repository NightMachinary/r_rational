  Crimes that are caught. After all, haven't you considered the possibility that all this education has simply led to the people being taught not to be caught? White collar crime and corruption among legal officials are almost never prosecuted. How many times have you seen a cop do time?

Laws and reputation are primarily there to catch the most flagrant violators, who repeatedly break the law or who do it in a more dangerous way. If you repeatedly violate social norms in a flagrant way people are more likely to catch you than if you did it rarely and in a careful way.
