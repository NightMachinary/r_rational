But what is the purpose of a morality system? It had to be instated by someone with power? How can a morality system exist beyond the trappings that ensure loyalty to that person? Wouldn't a person have to give up some of his power to ensure a universal working system? Why would that person give up his power?

On another note, isn't the problem in the situation you mentioned, anger over empathy? If the person could empathize even more, he could learn to empathize with both sides rather than giving into anger against one.
