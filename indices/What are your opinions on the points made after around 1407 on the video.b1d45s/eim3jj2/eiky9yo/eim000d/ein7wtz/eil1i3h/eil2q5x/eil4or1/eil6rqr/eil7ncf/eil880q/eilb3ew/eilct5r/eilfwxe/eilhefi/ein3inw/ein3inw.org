Empathy has four major flaws as the basis for a morality system.

1. It's prone to identifiable victims. It spotlights individuals, and encourages you to ignore others. It's not good at handling large scale issues, it handles local problems in front of you to the exclusion of larger issues.

2. It's biased towards people who are similar to you, of the same race and such.

3. It's very easy to become an empathy maximizing utility machine. For example people tend to give a little to lots of hot button charities, because each gives them an endorphin boost.

4. Emphatic people tend to be more violent and willing to hurt others to indulge their emotions. For example, anti Islam hate based on stories of Muslims raping people of the same race leads to people wanting to beat up random Muslims.[[https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/09/the-violence-of-empathy/407155/]]

I prefer cold hard reasoning, tinged with a distant compassion for humanity.
