  “The current study shows that responses to fearful faces at seven months, but not happy or angry faces, predict altruistic behavior at 14 months of age,” write the study's authors, led by Tobias Grossmann, Ph.D., an associate professor of psychology at the University of Virginia. “This confirms our hypothesis based on prior work and suggests that the tendency to engage altruistically is linked to responding to others in distress.”

That's one of the strongest thing that correlates with prosocial behaviour, paying attention to those in distress.

Working together as a team also strongly primes altruism and prosocial behaviour.

That said, most young babies and children are not very good at altruism or sharing.

How do those studies show it's linked? The first one simply shows guilt and empathy are both associated with apologies, and the second one shows that guilt improves empathy, not that empathy improves guilt.
