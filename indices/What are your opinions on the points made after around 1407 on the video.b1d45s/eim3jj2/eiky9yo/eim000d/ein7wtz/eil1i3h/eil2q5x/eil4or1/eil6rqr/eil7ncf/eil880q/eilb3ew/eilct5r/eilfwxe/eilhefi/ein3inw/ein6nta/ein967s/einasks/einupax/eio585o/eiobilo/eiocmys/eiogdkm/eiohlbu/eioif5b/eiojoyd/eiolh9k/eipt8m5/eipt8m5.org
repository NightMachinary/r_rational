On waking, I find I've put a lot of time into this thread already. Two days stretching into three. I feel like we should end our argument here.

Thank you for your time and I am sorry if you feel this time's been wasted. You've been very patient throughout the debate.

On a final note, you were indeed correct I didn't properly pick my studies to relate guilt to empathy.
