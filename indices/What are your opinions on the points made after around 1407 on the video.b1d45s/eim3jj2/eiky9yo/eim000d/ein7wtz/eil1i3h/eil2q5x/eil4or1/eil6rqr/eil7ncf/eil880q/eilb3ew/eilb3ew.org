Crimes that are caught. After all, haven't you considered the possibility that all this education has simply led to the people being taught not to be caught? White collar crime and corruption among legal officials are almost never prosecuted. How many times have you seen a cop do time?

So, your idea of a moral person is someone who only commits moral actions in so long as they benefit him, long term. They would not behave morally if it doesn't benefit them. Can you describe how your moral individual would act differently from how an intelligent, manipulative, sociopath would act?
