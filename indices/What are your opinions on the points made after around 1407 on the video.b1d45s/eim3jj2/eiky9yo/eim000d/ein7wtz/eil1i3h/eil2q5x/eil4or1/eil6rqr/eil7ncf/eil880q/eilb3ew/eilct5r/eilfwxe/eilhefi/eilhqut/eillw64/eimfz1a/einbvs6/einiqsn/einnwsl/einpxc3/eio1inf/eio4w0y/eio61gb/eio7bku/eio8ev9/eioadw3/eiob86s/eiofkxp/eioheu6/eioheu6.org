Consider this:

Empathy /is/ our innate sense of right and wrong. After all, psychopaths, people without empathy, wouldn't understand a thing you're saying about 'Good and evil'

Empathy is not instinctual knowledge, but a feeling, like guilt. And that feeling can be overruled by other emotions like anger or desperation or suppress and ignored entirely.
