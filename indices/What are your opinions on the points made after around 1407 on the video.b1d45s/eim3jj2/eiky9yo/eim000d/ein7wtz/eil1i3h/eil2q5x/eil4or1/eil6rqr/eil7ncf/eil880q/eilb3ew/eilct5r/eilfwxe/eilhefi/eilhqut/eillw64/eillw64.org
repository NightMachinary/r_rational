  only really considers the well being of people immediately around you.

I consider that familial love and friendship, not empathy. At that range, it's not really selflessness. You /like/ that person, and you enjoy his presence. In a way, when you do things for him, you're really doing it for you. Families or groups of friends can act selflessly for the people within that group, but act selfishly as a whole against outsider. It's still kind of acting selfishly on a grand scale. Nazi Germany, for example,is the perfect example of people working for those close to them at the expense of outsiders.

Interesting . Everyone everywhere seems to accept that someone out there /has/ to be pure evil. People tell long stories of men with an 'unbreakable' will. This very sub is dedicated to the idea of a perfectly rational individual that completely minimizes irrational actions.

And yet, it's the being dedicated to /good/ that's hard to swallow.

I'm curious about that. Our conscience is our innate sense of right and wrong, yes? It /is/ our morality, so to speak, yes?

(Just a sidenote: I don't believe in 'moral superiority' at all. A man who never does good, is never considerate, always gives into his raw emotions, never restrains what he wants in consideration of others and never takes the higher path is not 'evil' in my book. He's just not good. )
