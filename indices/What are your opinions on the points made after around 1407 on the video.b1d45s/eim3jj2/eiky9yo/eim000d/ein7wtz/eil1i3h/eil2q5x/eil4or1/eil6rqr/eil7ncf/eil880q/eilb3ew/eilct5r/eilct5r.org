  So, your idea of a moral person is someone who only commits moral actions in so long as they benefit him, long term. They would not behave morally if it doesn't benefit them. Can you describe how your moral individual would act differently from how an intelligent, manipulative, sociopath would act?

Well, what's your idea of a moral person? And do they actually exist?

I don't think a moral person is making those 'benefit' calculations explicitly. It's a different baseline in expectation for what will long-term benefit you, and different baseline for how much you care about other people.

In an ideal enforcement system, an intelligent, manipulative sociopath acts the same way as a naturally empathetic and moral person. In real, vulnerable systems, the sociopath looks for gaps in enforcement and takes risks to break the established rules, when they believe they can get away with it.

In the same situation, a naturally empathetic person fears being caught much more, as they surround themselves with people similar to them, and expect those people to stop respecting them if they're caught. They also surround themselves with people that they naturally care about, and so don't want to hurt.
