I don't see how any of it could be considered fallacious. I'm pointing out disconfirming evidence to your statement. That's almost the opposite of fallacious..

  There are many acts of forgiveness or people not getting mad throughout history. Is that proof that anger doesn't exist?
#+end_quote

No but it shows it's not the default. That it takes effort, that it's admirable. That it isn't easy, natural or innate, just that it happens and when it does it's worthy of recording and praising it..

  Does fasting during Ramadan disprove hunger?
#+end_quote

No It just shows people can do it and it's admirable, and a sacrifice, but not something most would choose to do everyday on their own volition.

As I said, unless there's religious motivation be it conscious or unconscious, there's little reason to believe humans are innately good or moral. Evolution optimises for survival and reproduction, it doesn't have morals.

This doesn't mean we shouldn't strive to be good and do good things. Naturalistic fallacy..
