  (or rather, maybe by your definition they wouldn't - but I don't believe that people who literally always follow their conscience exist, or are morally superior to people who only follow their conscience most of the time)

^ elaborating on that: Given that you can't /always/ know that an action you'll take will hurt others, it is expected and right to have a twinge of conscience when doing something that /might/ work out badly for some bystanders, evaluate the tradeoffs, and sometimes do the thing anyway. A person who never goes against their conscience would have to never take any risks that involve anyone other than themselves, and thus humanity passes up a lot of value.
