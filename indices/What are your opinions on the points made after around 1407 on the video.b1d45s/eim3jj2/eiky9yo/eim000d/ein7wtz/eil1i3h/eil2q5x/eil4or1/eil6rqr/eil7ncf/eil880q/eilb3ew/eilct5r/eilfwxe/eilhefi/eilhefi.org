  Would a moral person, defined as a person who always listens to his conscience, to his empathy, do what you suggest?
#+end_quote

I think so. I think the 'natural' feeling of empathy and rightness / wrongness only really considers the well being of people immediately around you. That person would also use the ring of Gyges to help themselves and the people close to them at a cost of people they don't care about - i.e. those that they don't interact with regularly. They may feel a bit bad doing it, but they'd find some justification.

(or rather, maybe by your definition they wouldn't - but I don't believe that people who literally always follow their conscience exist, or are morally superior to people who only follow their conscience most of the time)
