There is no contradiction between our data sets. Empathy is a brain system with pros and cons. It's important to recognize when it's a useful emotion and when not.

You're pushing it as a whole life panacea, but there are clear flaws in it. Empathy anger as noted, the issue of spotlighting, the fact that it makes prejudices harder to throw out, it has a lot of issues.

You're also pushing it in a place where it's less likely to be popular. Rational is all about making hard choices for the best good of the community, something that empathy is bad at.

Empathy like all emotions needs to be carefully managed and controlled. Letting it be a way of life risks excess. If it works well for you, yay, but everyone is different.
