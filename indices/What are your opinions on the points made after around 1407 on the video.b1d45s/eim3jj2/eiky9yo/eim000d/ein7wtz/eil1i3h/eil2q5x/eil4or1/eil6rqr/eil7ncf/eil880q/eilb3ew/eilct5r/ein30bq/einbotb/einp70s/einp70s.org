Higher up people make flagrant and stupid errors since they are arrogant, use drugs, and can use bribery to get out of crimes. Education doesn't stop rich kids from drunk driving cars.

These issues are systematic in the law reputation and empathy. Richer people and more attractive people are better at getting sympathy and manipulating existing systems. A fair system ensures the worst offenders are punished at least.
