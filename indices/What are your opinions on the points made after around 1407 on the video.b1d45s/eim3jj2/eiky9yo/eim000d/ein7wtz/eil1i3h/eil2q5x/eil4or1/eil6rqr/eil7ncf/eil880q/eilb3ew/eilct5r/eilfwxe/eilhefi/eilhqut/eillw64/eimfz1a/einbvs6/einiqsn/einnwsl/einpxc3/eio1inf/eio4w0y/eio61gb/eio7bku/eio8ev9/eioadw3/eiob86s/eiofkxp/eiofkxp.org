  *Empathy is an emotional reaction to another individual's emotional state. Anger is an emotional reaction to threat, frustration or social provocation.* Reduced empathy, seen in psychopathy, *increases* the risk for goal-directed aggression. Atypically increased anger (i.e. irritability), seen in conditions like disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and borderline personality disorder, *increases* the risk for reactive aggression.

Empathy demonstrably reduces the chances of aggression. Cool.

I can see where you're coming from, but it still doesn't dispute my points or my evidence.. You'd need a lot of evidence in favor of it existing, more than of it not existing.

​

The evidence is against it, we have innate systems that help us build friendships and live in tribes of around 150 people, true but that doesn't mean we have innate morality. No matter how much of those traits we pretend they could have had.

​

Science doesn't deal with 'ifs' it deals with what is, and was. When we start asking 'what ifs' it becomes conjecture.

​

If you want I could even go as far as say that empathy, compassion and conscience may be positive evidence towards your statement. But that's iffy, and still easily overshadowed by the disconfirming evidence.
