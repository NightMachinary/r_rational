  I consider that familial love and friendship, not empathy. At that range, it's not really selflessness.
#+end_quote

Empathy is just a thing your brain does when it sees people in pain, with mirror neurons to reflect their pain. It doesn't have any unique moral significance. It could be selfless or not, though it tends to be selfish more often than not because we evolved to help our families and friends.

  Nazi Germany, for example,is the perfect example of people working for those close to them at the expense of outsiders.

They didn't, they had continual infighting and battles, Hitler encouraged his subordinates to fight it out for his approval. They fought those close to them continually.

  This very sub is dedicated to the idea of a perfectly rational individual that completely minimizes irrational actions.

  And yet, it's the being dedicated to good that's hard to swallow.
#+end_quote

It's devoted to people who are moderately focused on problem solving, as opposed to story tropes where people are purposely dumb for silly reasons. Such people have flaws, failures and such. Being perfectly devoted to good is a bit much. Everyone has bad days.
