It's worse than that. This is the same tired Hollywood lies about how business people are or always become evil. Lies about how empathy and rationality are opposites. About how anyone who seeks to win doesn't care about or must give up on caring about others.

It's repetitive toxic BS in service of priming people to accept the premise that capitalism is evil. Having good actors and a story that grabs your emotions doesn't save it if you're able to notice the ugly cliches.
