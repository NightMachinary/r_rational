This is the classic Hollywood trope that rationality and empathy are not compatible, and in classic rational fic's like HPMOR, it can be demonstrated that this is not the case. Someone ignoring their empathetic urges to complete a certain action without taking into account the value loss of losing their sense of empathy, is acting irrationally in my mind.

I'm kind of sick of seeing this trope in the same way that I'm sick of similar tropes such as smart people only being written to sound smart instead of actually acting in smart ways.
