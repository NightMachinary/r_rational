  I wonder if people who are poor sports or cheaters tend to be people who think they have a low payoff in the outer game so they try to gain as much payoff as they can anywhere they can get it, even at the expense of other people's outer game payoff.

Either that, or people whose outer game payoff is so high and guaranteed, they don't have to fear losing it anyway. For example, they're disgustingly rich, or they're very powerful, so people will pander to them regardless of how shitty they act.
