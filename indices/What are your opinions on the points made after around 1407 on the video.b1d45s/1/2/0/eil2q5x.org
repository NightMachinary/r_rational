Morality is a set of rules that allows for / sustains long-term cooperation, and punishes non-cooperative/exploitative agents. Reputation is one of the enforcement mechanisms of morality.

You don't necessarily need reputation to be basis of enforcement, it could be other things - humans moved from reputation to law systems when scaling up.
