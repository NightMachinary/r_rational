I'm not involved in this discussion but I'd like to add the fact that your statement that humans have an innate sense of right and wrong sounds flawed to me.

​

Morality changes, always has, people in the middle ages found watching people being tortured and killed fun. Kids had games where they burned baskets full of kittens for fun. People used to leave babies they didn't want out in the woods to die.

​

If humans had an innate sense of right and wrong they couldn't have done certain things in the past like burn kittens for fun as kids (which are far more representative of innate human instinct and behavior than grown adults). Our sense of right and wrong is a social constructs that changes with time, culture and location.

​

Morality is a social control tool humans developed to dissuade people from acting in ways that are negative to the society they live in, and persuade them to do things that are beneficial. In a way morality needs an upgrade as far as how it deals with people you will never meet or interact with, it was not built with it in mind.
