You've drawn a Goldilocks conclusion from the results, ( Not too hot, not too cold) but I've found the different ways empathy affects anger, short term and long term .

Empathy in a single instance may trigger anger (Known as empathetic anger) but developing empathy as a whole reduces our capacity for anger.

Using empathy once may mean it is a cause of anger, but making it a way of life leads to more forgiveness in our lives.

Yes. We feel less empathy for other races, because of our preestablished prejudices. Thus, the solution is to feel more empathy for other perspectives. The solution is not to throw out empathy, but our prejudices.
