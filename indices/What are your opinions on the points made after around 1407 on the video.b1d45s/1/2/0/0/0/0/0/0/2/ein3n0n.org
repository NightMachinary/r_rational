  So, your idea of a moral person is someone who only commits moral actions in so long as they benefit him, long term. They would not behave morally if it doesn't benefit them. Can you describe how your moral individual would act differently from how an intelligent, manipulative, sociopath would act?

The moral individual would change more slowly when isolated from repercussions. The moral individual would also miss opportunities to gain in normal life when they won't be traced. The sociopath would quickly exploit the changes because they're thinking about their actions not acting on instinct. The sociopath might realise they have a moment when they can get away with something.
