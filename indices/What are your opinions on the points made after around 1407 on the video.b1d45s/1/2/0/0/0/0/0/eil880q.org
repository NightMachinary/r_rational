  But with these systems in place, a rational person could use these not just to escape punishment, but also gain more power. Reputation and an army of lawyers have been powerful threat. In essence, these systems give these manipulators more power to cause potential harm.

Well, but they also take away tools. It's much harder for a manipulator to build a band of 20 violent bandits, and run around taking whatever they want.

Systems aren't perfect, but crime is at an all-time low.

  What's your definition of a moral person? A person that's just motivated by fear of repercussion? Who doesn't really believe in acting morally unless forced to?

I guess my view is an average, 'neurotypical' person brought up in a culture that values morality, of a cooperative intent (not actively looking for holes in enforcement of morality and ways to 'get ahead').

They're still not going to pass on a windfall just because it may hurt people they /don't care about/ (like people really far away).
