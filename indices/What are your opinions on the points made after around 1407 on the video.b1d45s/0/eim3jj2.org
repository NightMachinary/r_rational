This got reported as off-topic, which I (mostly) agree with, but I didn't see it until after it had already generated what I think is some worthwhile discussion, so it's going to stay. In the future, please use the Friday Open Thread.

(A more general discussion on rationality in the show Billions would have been more appropriate, given that it was on the more substantial/thoughtful side of the spectrum where one end is "how about that show Billions?" and the other is a dissertation on the subject.)
