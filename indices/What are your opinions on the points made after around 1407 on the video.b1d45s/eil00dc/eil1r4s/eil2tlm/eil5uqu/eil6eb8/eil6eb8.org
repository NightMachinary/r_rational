  But humanity believes in forgiveness being the better and moral path.

Well, because now we have laws, and enforcements systems that don't really need you individually to seek revenge. But we still consider revenge excusable in many scenarios, and sometimes moral! Thus all the 'just deserts' 'moral porn' - people really like watching bullies get punished, or dangerous drivers caught by police, etc. etc.

And, of course, tit-for-tat is not actually the best strategy when guilt is not 100% certain; if you introduce mistakes, then the better algorithms actually include forgiveness.

  anger and hate are considered bestial and destructive.

No, that's not generally true. Anger and hate without cause are maybe considered that. But we don't think of people are immoral who get angry with cause, or hate with good cause.
