  Have to? Is that a normative statement?
#+end_quote

I feel like you're reading me very antagonistically here. But yes, I guess this is a normative statement: it is wrong/immoral to not punish transgressions ever.

  Is this coming down to emotions now? Acting on anger is justified when you feel it's justified? Don't you feel that EVERY action is justified when you're angry? Thus when someone commits an action you deem 'unjust' while they were angry, didn't that same action feel just to them, while they were angry?
#+end_quote

No, I don't think it matters whether you thought it was justified while being angry. It matters whether it was justified, and you should obviously not act on marginal cases where you can't quite tell if it seems justified because it is, or because you're angry and blowing things out of proportion.

  If we were to excuse certain punishments that were worse than the crime doled out in anger,then what's stopping people from avenging murder with murder and returning to the revenge killings and family feuds of Romeo and Juliet?
#+end_quote

How do you evaluate 'worse than the crime'? I don't think that punching someone in the face is necessarily worse than everything that people can do to you with just words. And there's an obvious difference between reacting in a moment because no better solutions are available, and premeditated murder for vengeance.
