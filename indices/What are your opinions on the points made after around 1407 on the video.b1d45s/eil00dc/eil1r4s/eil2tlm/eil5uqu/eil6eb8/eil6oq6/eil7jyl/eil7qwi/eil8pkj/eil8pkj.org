As in, by what mechanism, or for what purpose?

I don't know the biology, but it seems obvious that your brain works differently when it seems that other people are purposefully acting to your detriment. Either by not fulfilling their obligations, or actively hurting you / your interests.

The purpose seems clear - if, when you're angry, you're likely to spend effort to punish people who have so offended you, others are going to be more wary of offending you in the future. It's a tit-for-tat-like deterrence mechanism. Of course it doesn't scale (family feuds, etc), so at some point communities that figured out cultural rules that prevent people from being angry - or gave people better ways of seeking retribution - outcompeted the ones that don't. Thus, morality.
