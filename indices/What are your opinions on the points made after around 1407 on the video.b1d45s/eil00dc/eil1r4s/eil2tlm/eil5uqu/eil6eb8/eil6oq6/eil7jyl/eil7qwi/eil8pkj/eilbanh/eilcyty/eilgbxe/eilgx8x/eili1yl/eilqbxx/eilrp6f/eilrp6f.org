  sometimes you have to make a stand.

Have to? Is that a normative statement?

Is this coming down to emotions now? Acting on anger is justified when you /feel/ it's justified? Don't you feel that EVERY action is justified when you're angry? Thus when someone commits an action you deem 'unjust' while they were angry, didn't that same action feel just to them, while they were angry?

If we were to excuse certain punishments that were worse than the crime doled out in anger,then what's stopping people from avenging murder with murder and returning to the revenge killings and family feuds of Romeo and Juliet? After all, the punishment is equal.
