Um nope, not external influence, the players of this iterated Prisoner's Dilemma include the entirety of human society. That prison and the laws that say who to keep in there were put there by the society that believes in punishing defectors (and that this is a good choice of punishments). The effectiveness of those efforts is another question, I agree that the US prison system at least is not good at the reforming aspect and makes it harder to get out of the criminal life. But that doesn't mean I think prison is categorically bad and immoral and should be totally abolished because I've decided Forgiveness Is Good.

I don't think I understand what exactly you've been arguing. As it's been said, Game Theory concerns itself with achieving the goals you set. And my goals involve not just my own self-interest, it also includes as many other people as possible also benefiting. And I think that the world is a worse place if cooperation is encouraged by punishing defectors that hurt other people, and that never ever punishing anyone for anything would lead to a dramatically worse state of affairs.
