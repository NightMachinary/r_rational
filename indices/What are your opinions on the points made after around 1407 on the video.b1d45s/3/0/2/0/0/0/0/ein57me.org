Too many people in prison does make things worse. Many gangs have formed from prison.

That said, some people are dangerous enough and unwilling to change enough that keeping them off the streets is useful.

Prison deterrence is generally less useful because the likelihood of being caught is low, and people are more sensitive to the frequency of punishment than the strength.
