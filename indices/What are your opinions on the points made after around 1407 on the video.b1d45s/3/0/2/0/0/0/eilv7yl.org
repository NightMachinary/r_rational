I'll set out a thesis statement.

Punishment is unnecessary. We believe it is necessary because we want to sate our anger towards the criminals. In reality, it is encourage prisoners to actively connect with more harmful elements and our prisons actively leads to more crime. We should turn our prisons into centers made to change people into more productive members of society.

Is it all right? Really tired today, so can't build it up and connect like I usually do. Sorry.
