Punishing defectors in an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is something that will help everything stay as cooperative as possible. It's best for everyone to cooperate when they're in it for the long run, but defectors should still be punished so there is a big negative incentive that pushes people further away from defecting. Plus, if someone murders another person in the real world, it usually isn't considered immoral to put him in prison (assuming the prison system isn't overly abusive).
