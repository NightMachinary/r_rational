  I feel like you're reading me very antagonistically here.

I'm sorry if it feels like that then. I don't mean to be antagonistic.

  I don't think that punching someone in the face is necessarily worse than everything that people can do to you with just words.

One is illegal. And of course, you're automatically assuming best case scenario. Even just taking this instance as precedent, sets up obvious loopholes. What determines what words are harmful to a person?

Does it depend on the victim? Can a person decide certain words are harmful to him without informing anyone else and then go around punching people in the face for saying that word? How can one prove that a word offends someone other than the victim saying it does?

Or does it depend on the intent of the person behind the insult? On whether that person meant to hurt you?

Perhaps while you may find it offensive, but maybe from his culture, or upbringing, such words are normal and regular, or he just overestimated how close you two were. There are a variety of ways the person may not 'deserve'to be punched. How can one prove that a word was seriously meant to hurt someone, other than villain himself saying so?

Do we set little loopholes for every individual case? For considering friendship, analyzing intent, and comparing the chemical about physical pain to emotional pain registered in the brain? Or do we throw it all out and make case by case value judgements?

  premeditated murder for vengeance.

So, you're saying that you will never feel premeditated murder to be just?
