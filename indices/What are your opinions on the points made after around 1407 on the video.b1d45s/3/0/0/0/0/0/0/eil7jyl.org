Well, if I've just met you, and never did anything to you, and you are angry and do something to hurt me because you're angry, I'll consider you immoral.

(but maybe later I find out that you thought I was someone else that did hurt you, and that might change it!)

Whereas if someone say steals something of yours, or hurts you or a family member in some way, and you become angry and seek their punishment (either through authority or directly through violence), as long as the punishment is not too out of line with the cause, I don't think you're immoral.

Concretely: if someone steals your wallet, and you grab their hand and pull them to the ground, get your wallet back, and then kick them out of anger, I don't think you've acted immorally. If in the same scenario after getting your wallet back you shoot them dead, you have.

Cause for hate is more complex. Let's call hate a prolonged, 'cold' anger that influences your incentives without inhibiting your planning ability. (when you're furious, you don't plan very well) Hate can still be warranted - I don't think it's immoral to hate murderers, or people who exploit entire communities, etc. Of course there is a certain burden of proof - you have to have good reason to believe the target of your hate is actually responsible.
