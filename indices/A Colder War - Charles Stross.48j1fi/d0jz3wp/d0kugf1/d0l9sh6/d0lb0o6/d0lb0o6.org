It's a little but more complex than that, but essentially, yes.

The Laundry universe has a story arc roughly 12 books long; book 7 is in production and comes out this June (and is a major turning point) and book 8 should be out in June 2017. (Then I need to take a year off before my brain melts.)

There is a new Merchant Princes trilogy (books 7-9) in the works, but it keeps being pushed back and my US editor dying last month didn't help; hopefully book one of the new bunch will appear next summer.

Publishers like to buy long series works and if they succeed in building a following they're good earners -- which matters to the authors, when they hit middle age. (Disclaimer: I'm 51. Steve is in his sixties and I'm pretty sure his Change series is his pension plan: they sell /really/ well.) On the other hand, there's such a thing as too much of a good thing, so I'm in the planning stages of a wholly new stand-alone space opera at present (plus other development projects). Hopefully I'll have some concrete news to report in a month or three.
