What's wrong with starting a new series? Or better yet, writing a novel that's neither part of a past series, nor an attempt to start a new one?

And I guess my answer to that question, informed in part by being a regular reader of Stross's blog, is that publishers really want series rather than standalones. I don't remember to what extent that is actually about series selling better, of if it's just that they mean you don't have to pitch a scary new concept every book.
