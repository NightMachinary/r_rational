What are people here's thoughts on the Laundry series? I thought they were alright, but have gotten pretty bored of them and not read the last few. I hate when an author I like gets obsessed with a series I'm not into. It's just like S.M. Stirling and those "after the Change" books that seem like they'll never end.

I can only imagine it's a vagary of the publishing industry that pushes people to keep churning out sequels in series that sell well, but I would certainly be reading more from those authors if they mixed it up instead.
