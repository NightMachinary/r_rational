In a word, yes. I don't know if [[/u/cstross]] wants to chime in here, but my impression is that he's a bit constrained in what he can sell at the moment. Without starting a new series, Merchant Princes: TNG and the Laundry are all that's running at the moment.

Halting State/R34 can't really move forward since they're no longer near-future, but alternate-present. Hard SF has spent the last decade masquerading neatly as police procedural, but only on television.

The Eschaton Agents series is also completed, but I don't remember the reasoning offhand. The Saturn's Children/Neptune's Brood series /could/ go forward, but isn't as far as I know. Accelerando /might/ have places to go, but the book itself is a pretty complete tryptic.

As for my thoughts on the Laundry, it's managed to keep itself reasonable as the story has moved to and through CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN. Stross has managed to do a wonderful job taking the Cold War fears of an impending end to the world and shifted over to having the protagonists getting by in a world they can no-longer trust in a War on Terror sense. Several of the in-story discussions about plans to move the Laundry through the coming period of change are sobering on a level that earlier stories weren't. Some of Stross's best writing has come out in this series, in my opinion.
