  What are people here's thoughts on the Laundry series?
#+end_quote

I really enjoy every other book, apparently.

Atrocity Archives was great, Jennifer Morgue was okay but didn't really work for me, Fuller Memorandum was very good, I honestly can't remember a thing about The Apocalypse Codex other than being very underwhelmed, Rhesus Chart was good again, and then Annihilation Score had its moments.
