I really like the Laundry series, but the latest books are working a little less well for me. Partly that's because they made a shift from being spy pastiches to genre pastiches, when I feel like they would have been better off just becoming their own thing. Basically, they now have too many ideas in them that would have been better unconnected from the series proper.

I don't know, I'll keep reading them, but I wish that Stross would just find the core conceit compelling instead of feeling the need to pull in other things.
