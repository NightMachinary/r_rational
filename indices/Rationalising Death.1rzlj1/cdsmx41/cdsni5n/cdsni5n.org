A few reasons. Firstly, he wants everyone to know that /someone/ is behind all this. Heart attacks are sudden, flashy, and uniform. If the cause of death varied from person to person, it would take a lot longer for anyone to work out what was happening. People will adjust their behaviour to fit his utility function more quickly and more efficiently if they believe there to be agency behind the deaths rather than, say, an unexplained anomaly in the actuarial table for "evil people". This is also why he has them all die on the hour every hour, rather than at random intervals. It sends a particular message.

Secondly, it would tip his hand early that he can control the cause of death of his victims. At the moment, all the police know about his capabilities is that he can control his victims actions prior to their death and that he needs a face and a name to kill. In both cases, that's information that Light would rather not have had anyone find out - while he wants people to know that someone's doing the killing, it's a good idea in general to keep his exact capabilities hidden.
