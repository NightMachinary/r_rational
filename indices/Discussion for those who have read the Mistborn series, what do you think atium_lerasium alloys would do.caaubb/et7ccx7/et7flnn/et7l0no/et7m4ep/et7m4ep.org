I'm assuming the the Entities in Worm are Shard-equivalents, with Scion translating into atium and Eden as lerasium. Lerasium Hemalurgically steals /all abilities/, which I'm taking to mean all /natural human/ abilities. I'm assuming this is what the Lord Ruler had as his unknown Hemalurgic spikes. Meanwhile an atium spike can steal literally any power and better than any normal spike, which is useful no matter how you slice it. I'm also going to say that certain powers can be stolen by normal Hemalurgic spikes.

And thanks, I'll make a top-level post about the story then. :)
