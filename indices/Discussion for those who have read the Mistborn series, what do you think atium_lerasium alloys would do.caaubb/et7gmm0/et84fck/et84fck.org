From what we know, that's only for people who aren't actually Mistborn/Mistings. Lerasium burns differently for people who aren't Mistborn and for those who aren't.

At it's base, Lerasium forges a connection between burner and Preservation. Mistborns burning it increase their power. And if the person using it knows what they're doing, they can rewrite their Spiritual DNA as they wish basically.
