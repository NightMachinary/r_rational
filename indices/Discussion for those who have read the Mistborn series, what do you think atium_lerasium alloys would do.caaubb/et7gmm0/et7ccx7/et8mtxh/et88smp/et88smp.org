Coppermind says that Atium alloys create expanded metal and temporal effects.

With pewter then for instance, rather then giving someone else power I think it'd give you the capacity to use strength to maximum effect, like seeing physical weakpoints or straight up letting you see how much damage you'd cause.

Atium+Tin would let you see all the consequences of your actions before you take them

Atium + Steel/Iron could cause delayed pulls and pushes

now, Lerasium on the other hand seems to be about Connections, so maybe it could be the one that changes the target from self to someone else?
