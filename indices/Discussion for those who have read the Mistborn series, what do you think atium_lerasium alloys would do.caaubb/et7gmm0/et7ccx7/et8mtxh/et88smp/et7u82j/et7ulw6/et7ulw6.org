Harmonium or [[https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ettmetal][Ettmetal]] is the canon combination of atium and lerasium after the Catacendre. You're correct that it's incredibly reactive with water and is used to create enormous bombs. As a result, it's horribly difficult to use Hemalurgically since contact with blood will just make an explosion, but Sanderson says that is can theoretically be done. When a Metallic Art is used near Ettmetal, the same effect occurs from the Ettmetal, slowly using it up. You can somehow regulate its effects to create airships, but it's not explained how.
