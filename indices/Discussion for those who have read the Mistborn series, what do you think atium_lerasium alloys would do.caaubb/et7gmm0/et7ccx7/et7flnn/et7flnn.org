Hi, I got my information from here: [[https://coppermind.net/wiki/Metallic_Arts#cite_note-Arcanum-5971-7]]

Word of Brandon Sanderson says that God Metals such as atium can be alloyed with other common metals---in fact, that's the source of the eleventh metal, malatium, and that alloying atium with other metals would have other undiscovered effects.

And sure, right now I have it hosted here as a crossover of Worm, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/mistworm-worm-mistborn.766090/][Mistworm]].
