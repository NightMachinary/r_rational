It's been a while since I read them, but I'm not sure the alloys work that way. You can't alloy iron with, say, copper or tin to get a new effect AFAIK. The alloys also appear to work in opposites, so steel/iron push/pull, copper/bronze conceal/reveal, etc. Atium looks forward and malatium looks backwards.

Are you aware of the 17th shard website? They might be have more in depth information for you. Also [[/r/cosmere]] is a good place to ask questions. There might be Words of Brandon (WoBs) about the subject, I think the 17th shard also archives them, or maybe that's the coppermind website?

Will you post your fanfic here when you're done? I'd be interested in reading it.
