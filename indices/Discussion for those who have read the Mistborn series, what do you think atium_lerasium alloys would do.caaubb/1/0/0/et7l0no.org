How would Hemalurgy work in the Worm universe? It could be extremely powerful or extremely weak depending on what powers it works on. I mean, on Scadrial, a fullborn would have limited use for it, just a heightening of powers rather than a transfer. If investiture is the source of Worm hero powers, then I suppose it would have use if the protagonist can actually follow through.

Anyhow, I'm intrigued, and I it would make me happy if you posted updates here.
