*Steel*: Push on metals

*Atisteel*: 'Store' pushes on metals which will take effect later. Push on the future positions of metals before they arrive. Fine-grained control of pushes to, for example, puncture a steel plate by pushing only the center of it.

*Iron*: Pull on metals

*Atiron*: See Atisteel, but with pulling instead of pushing.

*Pewter*: Enhance physical attributes. (Brute, endurance, speed)

*Atipewt*: Precise intuitive sense for how far you can throw things, what you can lift, etc. Judge the Brute rating of anyone in sight at a glance. Shunt the ongoing physical enhancement of Pewter from attribute to attribute, ex. make yourself normal strength but able to sprint even faster than a Thug pewter-dragging for a few seconds, then give up the speed for pure Brute a few seconds later.

*Tin*: Enhanced senses

*Atin*: See around corners and hear through walls. Sense who can perceive you/who is paying attention to you. Extend atium's effects to cover a much longer range.
