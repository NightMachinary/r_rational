I think it's probably best to disregard canon malatium in systematizing atium alloys. For Doylist reasons its effects had to be a much closer mirror of gold than the systematic Watsonian understanding would imply; The Final Empire's plot wouldn't work otherwise. So given that, rely mainly on "[Atium's] alloys grant various expanded mental and temporal effects when burned."

I'm going to write my ideas for each in repl(y/ies) to this comment. (Each sentence in those ideas is meant to represent a distinct possibility for what it could do.)
