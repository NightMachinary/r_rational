When my post is 11 hours old, the folks from [[https://www.doofmedia.com/deep-in-pact/][Deep in Pact]], the We've Got Worm-style podcast analysis of [[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]], will start the recording of their last episode, where they discuss the epilogue.

Right afterwards, they'll begin a 24 hour livestream called [[https://www.doofmedia.com/2020/02/04/all-pact-up-details/][All Pact Up]], which will be livestreamed on their [[https://www.twitch.tv/doofmedia][twitch]], where they'll be collecting donations for a homeless kids charity.

Their 24 hour marathon willl include fun stuff like a short game of Pactdice, live writing, fanart and fanfic reviews, Tarot readings, and a live interview with Wildbow himself. This is probably the first time Wildbow has ever done an audio interview, so I'm really looking forward to it.
