If your soul goes to a hell (or heaven) dimension it appears you may have a high rate of time dilation. You might not want to come back if its a heaven dimension, and you may suffer immensely otherwise (it also might be looked upon poorly if you die in the future). In general having a demon as a passenger (trying to grab the wheel) seems a bit risky. Also avoiding sunlight and true happiness sounds pretty annoying -- Angel's moment of true happiness is just one datapoint after all. On the other hand you can probably make a ritual that doesn't have that curse, considering spike found a way without that caveat, and the gypsies /were/ actually trying to make it a curse.
