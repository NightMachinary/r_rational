In Buffy, it's stated that orbs of thessala are used as paperweights, implying they're not particularly rare. These items are consumed in the process of re-ensouling a vampire, albeit with the drawback that "a moment of pure happiness" reverses the process. "Moment of pure happiness" appears to only refer to having sex with someone you really like. So you don't even have to be celibate, just only have sex with your second choice or lower.

So why don't they use Angel to vamp Xander/Giles/Willow* and then quick soul them up before they do anything evil? In the short term, super-strong ally, in the long term, immortality.

*If being a vampire causes issues with magic then this should probably be put off for a while. The semi-canonical "Fray" series suggests Willow is immortal anyway.
