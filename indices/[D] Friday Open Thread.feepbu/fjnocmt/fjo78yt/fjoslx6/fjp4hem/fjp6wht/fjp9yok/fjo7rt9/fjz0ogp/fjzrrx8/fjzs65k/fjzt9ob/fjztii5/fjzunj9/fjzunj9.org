I think the difference in the way I see it stems from a continuous versus discrete perspective of self, or of what "you" is. In your example there are two continuous "selves" that while being the same person, are distinctly seperate, cut off by the act of teleporting.

In my opinion there is only ever one "self" and that is the "you" at this exact moment in time. Any "you" before exists only in your memory, so what does it matter if there are gaps where you sleep, teleport, etc. From this perspective there is no you to die on the front end of the teleporter, since at that exact, frozen, moment in time "you" exist in Seattle, with a fresh memory of yourself just recently being wherever you were before.

Thank you for the question, it's helped me clarify a few things to myself as well.

Edit: Something Ive considered in my goal to put it in perspective is reframing the question to look at what would happen if instead when you entered the teleporter you went to sleep and someone carried you to the new location. When you wake up you are in the new location, and while you are in the "same body," with the whole "Ship of Theseus" thing and the probability field nature of atoms themselves I think the physical aspect is much less of a question than the conscious aspect.
