I feel like I understand what you're asking, and correct me if I'm wrong, but no, I don't believe there would be a "shift" or "jump" or any kind of transition to allow you to continue your subjective experience on the other end. However without trying to be pedantic, I don't think its "another you" on the other end. Its just you, since there is only ever one you, and at this exact moment in time you are in Seattle. The "you" from before is gone, but not gone as in dead, gone as in how the you of yesterday is gone.

Additionally, I think this has a lot to do with what you consider your "continued subjective experience." In my opinion there is no way to determine whether or not it is a continued experience other than your own memories, so you could say that yes, since I remeber entering the teleporter and leaving in a new spot, that was all part of this single subjective experience I've undergone since my first memories.
