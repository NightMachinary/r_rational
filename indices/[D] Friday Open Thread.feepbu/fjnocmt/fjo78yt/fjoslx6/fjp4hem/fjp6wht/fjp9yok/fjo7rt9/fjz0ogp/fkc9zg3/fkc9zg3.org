Here's a thought experiment.

A perfect copy of you is made. An omnipotent being declares that within five minutes, one of you must die. If you volunteer to die, your copy is given a hefty sum of money. If you do not volunteer, your copy is killed and you receive a small punishment/fine.

Do you volunteer?

I expect that you'd volunteer -- based on your post it's a rational conclusion.

Personally I wouldn't volunteer. I can see that from the universe's perspective, or from another person's, it's smartest to take the money since the remainder of the outcome is indistinguishable. But from /my/ perspective, as a limited (irrational?) human observer, the-me-of-now's reality would cease to exist. Yes, someone functionally indistinguishable from me continues living, but from the perspective of old-me I'm still going to die, which (to me) is the ultimate negative utility, the worst outcome.

My overall point is that it's a matter of whose perspective you take. If you identify as you-right-now it's death. If you take an outside perspective it's not death.
