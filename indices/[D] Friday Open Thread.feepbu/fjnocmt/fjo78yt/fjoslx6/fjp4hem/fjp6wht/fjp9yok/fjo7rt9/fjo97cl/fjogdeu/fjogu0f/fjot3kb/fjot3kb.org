  But the "you" that died is just as different from the "you pre-clone" as the clone is. So yes, that individual died. But that individual is not any more related to the "pre-clone you" than the clone itself is

That's not really true, since the clone of you shares none of the molecules that made up your body whereas the 'pre-clone you,' of one second ago shares 100% of your molecules. You can argue over whether that matters or not, but it's a little disingenuous to state that there's literally no difference when there demonstrably /is./
