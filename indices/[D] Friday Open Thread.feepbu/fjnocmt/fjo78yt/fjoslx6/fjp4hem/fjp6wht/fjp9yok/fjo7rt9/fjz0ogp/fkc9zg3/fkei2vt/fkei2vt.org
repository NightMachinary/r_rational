There is a difference between the two situations - namely, that in the teleporter, there is causal continuity between the computational states (your last computational state at A is the cause of the first computational state at B), while in the example with you being killed after 5 minutes there isn't (your last computational state before being killed is causally unconnected to the first computational state of your copy after the divergence).

It's possible to hold the view that causal continuity of computational states is sufficient and necessary for the continuity of consciousness, in which case the teleporter doesn't kill you but your example does.
