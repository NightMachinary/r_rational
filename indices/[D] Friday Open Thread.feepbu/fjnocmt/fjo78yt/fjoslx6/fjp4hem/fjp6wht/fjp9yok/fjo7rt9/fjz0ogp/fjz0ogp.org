  As for continuity of consciousness, there is decent evidence that consciousness is not continuous under any circumstances and that the appearance is a lie told by our brains. But even ignoring that (it certainly isn't proven), continuity is broken by comas, anesthesia, and, arguably, sleep. Meaning that, in the worst case scenario, continuity is broken multiple times every single day and under the best case scenario, almost everyone in modern society will experience it at least once or twice over the span of their existence.

This is where I get stuck. I don't mind if I experience a lapse in consciousness, like you said it happens every time someone goes to sleep. When I think of continuity of consciousness, the part I'm worried about is continuing to experience things in general. If I step in the teleporter and then I'm disassembled, that's it for my subjective experience isn't it? Doesn't matter if another instance of me that wouldn't know the difference is spun up at the other end, I'm using this current brain of mine to experience things and when it goes, I stop experiencing things. If I teleport to Seattle, I don't expect the version of me that's sitting here at my laptop right now to ever experience Seattle. I'll get in the teleporter, be disassembled and never experience anything again, and then the Seattle version of me gets to continue on with an unbroken subjective experience.

People way smarter than me are comfortable calling this "not murder", and I do truly wish I understood why. I feel like I must be missing something
