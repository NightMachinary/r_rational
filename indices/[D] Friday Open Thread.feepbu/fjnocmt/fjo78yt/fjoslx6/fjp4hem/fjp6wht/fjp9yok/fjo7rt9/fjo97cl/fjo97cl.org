If you define "you" as "you at time t", then the clone is as similar to "you" as "you at time t+1", yes.

According to my definition, "you", every second of every day, are a slightly different person than you were the second before. A clone is as close to the person who "made" the clone as that person is at a later time. (assuming crazy magic sci fi cloning with exact duplication including memories etc.)

When you say "I, the only me that matters" as something separate from your memories, to what are you referring? What is the "thing" that "you" are that is not your memories? I argue that "you" is nothing /except/ your memories (well...and the hardware on which to execute the personality built on those memories...but you get the point).
