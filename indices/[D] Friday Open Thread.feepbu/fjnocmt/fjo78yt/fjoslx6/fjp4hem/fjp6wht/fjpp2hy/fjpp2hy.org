While I find the "atoms don't exist" argument equally compelling (although probably harder to grasp for most people, even I don't really understand it, I just take it on face value from people who understand it better than I do), the fact that individual cells don't replace quickly says nothing about how fast the atoms in those cells replace. I am quite sure that even though a cell may not die/divide, the atoms that make it up are constantly cycling. It's basically the same idea scaled down a level.

And I agree with you completely about continuity not being that important /to me/. I was merely addressing the arguments that frequently come up. It sounds like you and I mostly see it the same way. I personally wouldn't consider teleportation death /even if/ no atom was ever replaced in your body and your consciousness was completely continuous throughout your life.
