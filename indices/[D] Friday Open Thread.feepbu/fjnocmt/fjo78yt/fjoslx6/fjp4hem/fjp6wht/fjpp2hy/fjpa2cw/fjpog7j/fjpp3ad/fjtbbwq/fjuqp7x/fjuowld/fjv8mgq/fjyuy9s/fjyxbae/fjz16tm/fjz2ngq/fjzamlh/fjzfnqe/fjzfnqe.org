3 months ago I had a long argument with DuskyDay about this topic. He seems to have not absorbed anything from it, especially the idea that consciousness is not a "thing" that's "in" the brain, but is instead the action that the brain performs. He still on a gut level just isn't understanding why someone would refuse to accept "another brain is performing the action of consciousness in the same way that your recently deceased brain used to perform it" as being equivalent to "your consciousness has been preserved."

Here's a link if you're interested in a different viewpoint.
