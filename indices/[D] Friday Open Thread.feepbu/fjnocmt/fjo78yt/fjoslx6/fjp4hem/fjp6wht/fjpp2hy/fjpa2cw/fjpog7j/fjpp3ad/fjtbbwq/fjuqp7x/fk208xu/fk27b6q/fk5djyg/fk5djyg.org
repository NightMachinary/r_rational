There isn't a locality violation - the pattern is read from the body of the person and transmitted slower than light to the destination. The entire time, the pattern moves below the speed of light (or at the speed of light, if you use radio waves) to the destination, where it's reinstantiated in new matter.

Your last conscious state before the teleportation is at time t1, your first conscious state after the teleportation is at time t2, and t2 - t1 >= d/c, where d is the distance.

I think you're imagining that the pattern doesn't exist in the intervening space - but it exists in the radio waves (otherwise, you couldn't use them to reconstruct it in the new matter on the other side).
