An issue with the cell renewal argument is that neurons get replaced extremely slowly if at all.

A [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7HMSBiEiCfLKzd2gc/quantum-mechanics-and-personal-identity][LessWrong Sequence]] brought me to the same conclusion with a different argument: it doesn't make sense to attach personal identity to individual atoms because "individual atoms" don't actually exist. There's just an amplitude distribution as described by quantum mechanics.

As for continuity of consciousness, it doesn't seem important to me?

What I want is for my next mindstate to be a consequence of my current mindstate according to a particular set of rules which define me. Whether the rules are implemented by brain chemistry, by a bunch of nanobots that scan my brain and reconstruct an identical one on Mars two hours later, or by a computer that accurately simulate the effect of brain chemistry (at arbitrary speed) doesn't seem like it makes a difference.
