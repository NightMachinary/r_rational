  Something "like" the same atom does exist - namely, that which hasn't teleported.

Not OP, but that would render your argument empty - if you're arguing that teleportation kills you because you're not made of the same atoms, and you're saying that your concept of the same atom is "that which hasn't teleported", then your argument says: Teleportation kills you because you're no longer made of atoms which haven't teleported.

The reason why you don't need the same matter (whether or not "same matter" exists) is as follows: Let's assume that when preserving the pattern and changing the matter in your brain, you notice some difference. Then you can talk about it (because we can talk about our conscious perceptions). But that contradicts the assumption the pattern stays the same (because different words could only be generated by a different pattern). This explanation (in so many words) is [[http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html][fully covered by Chalmers]]. (The way it follows from his paper is that he shows you survive a gradual brain replacement, from which follows that you don't need the same matter.)
