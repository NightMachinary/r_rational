I got drawn into yet another dumb argument about the teleporter problem (in case you aren't familiar, this is the idea that teleporters kill you and create an identical copy at the destination) in yesterdays post on the front page post about teleporters.

I'm curious about how the people in this community see it. Here is my view:

Any coherent definition of life/identity that does not require a soul or other non-physical component will lead to one of 2 conclusions: either teleportation is not death or else death happens many times to every individual to the point that it is not something worth worrying about.

I come to this conclusion via the following:

The main two arguments about why teleportation /would/ be death is the fact that it isn't the same physical atoms/molecules and there isn't continuity of consciousness.

However, physical atoms are being replaced constantly within the human body and I am sure there is complete turnover multiple times over the course of someones life. Under this definition, everyone is slowly dying all the time and will die multiple times across their lifetime.

As for continuity of consciousness, there is decent evidence that consciousness is not continuous under any circumstances and that the appearance is a lie told by our brains. But even ignoring that (it certainly isn't proven), continuity is broken by comas, anesthesia, and, arguably, sleep. Meaning that, in the worst case scenario, continuity is broken multiple times every single day and under the best case scenario, almost everyone in modern society will experience it at least once or twice over the span of their existence.

I assume this community has a higher incidence of people who have thought deeply about this (probably much more so than I have) and would love any thoughts.
