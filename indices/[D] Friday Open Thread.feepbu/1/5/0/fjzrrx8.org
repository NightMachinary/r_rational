The way I see it, the specifics that create your "consciousness" so to speak are your memories of previous events. As long as you have those memories you are you, to the point where creating a clone implanted with your memories would create a second you for an instant, and then it would begin having diverging experiences and become its own consciousness. Looking at it this way, I see the physical destruction of your old body as equally important to your conciousness as say, forgetting why you walked into a room. Since your conciousness is constantly being interrupted by things like zoning out, daydreaming, sleeping, or even going into a coma, all of these things have the same effect as killing a body and recreating your memories elsewhere. With this idea, the subjective you that doesn't get to visit Seattle is probably not the you that woke up this morning, since at some point you got distracted, took a nap, etc.

Obviously not scientific, but my take on how I see it.
