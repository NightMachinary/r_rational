I mean...yes, that is the point of the discussion...what is death.

That's a great analogy. They are points on a line. But it isn't a straight line (once you include cloning at least). It's an every branching tree (every time a clone is created, the line branches). Every single version of you feels like they have a direct connection to the original, and from the originals perspective, there is no differnce between the different branches.
