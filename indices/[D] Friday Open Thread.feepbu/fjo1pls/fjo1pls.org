I have here a list of powers granted by the GLOW. That is the light lanterns of the green lantern comic books use. One thing I noticed odd was that the green light offers no extra abilities while every other light grants something useful.

I was wondering if you might be able to think up a power for the green light? I have been considering just taking emotional manipulation immunity from blue and giving it to green.

This is for an alt power Taylor that has to take on scion. She gets a ring that can access all the colors.

Thanks for any help.
