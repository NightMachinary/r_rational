Construct strength for other colors is dependent on how much the user feels that that particular construct reflects the Lantern's emotion, but green has a constant strength that is only dependent on the user's current level of willpower regardless of what they are doing. Say that you have a blue ring. Healing others is pretty easy, shielding others means your shields are super strong, etc. But if you try to make a sword to kill the person attacking you or the people around you, it's not even as strong as steel, because in a lot of cases, killing someone doesn't inspire hope. Similarly, an orange Lantern can make really, extremely strong constructs to do things that they want to do, but if said Lantern is ordered to do something they're only somewhat interested in, their constructs are weak to the point of almost failing to do the job at all.

But for green, willpower is fairly constant. Any construct you make is going to be as strong as any other given your current willpower, regardless of what those constructs are doing. Being ordered to do something you don't want to do or isn't something you're good at means your constructs are actually stronger, because you have to exert willpower to keep going even when you dislike what you're doing. Green Lanterns don't need any training to maintain their emotion even when they're doing something unaligned with it, because nothing is unaligned with willpower or focus. Similarly, you can maintain focus a lot more easily than you can being angry at something for an extended period, when said thing isn't extremely important to you, or when it isn't immediately present. Green rings excel at intermediate tasks that don't immediately cause the relevant emotion.
