Your argument for why teleportation kills you was the proposition /P/,

*P*: You need the same matter to preserve your consciousness.

I made two arguments against /P/:

1. ​

#+begin_quote
  The reason why you don't need the same matter (whether or not "same matter" exists) is as follows: Let's assume that when preserving the pattern and changing the matter in your brain, you notice some difference. Then you can talk about it (because we can talk about our conscious perceptions). But that contradicts the assumption the pattern stays the same (because different words could only be generated by a different pattern).

2.

#+begin_quote
  This explanation (in so many words) is [[http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html][fully covered by Chalmers]]. (The way it follows from his paper is that he shows you survive a gradual brain replacement, from which follows that you don't need the same matter.)
#+end_quote

If you want to keep claiming that /P/ is true, it's up to you to present a counterargument to both my arguments, and you haven't done that.

You made two statements: First, that the brain doesn't contain symbols. I reacted to that here:

#+begin_quote
  There is a way of discovering a symbolic representation of whatever is being processed in every object - otherwise, the physical structure of the object couldn't transform the input into an appropriate output. So given the physical state of the object, it's guaranteed that some aspects of the object will be a symbolic representation of whatever is being processed.

  The only difference is that in a silicon computer, it's clear what constitutes the symbols (because humans engineered computers to be easily comprehensible), but in the brain it's harder (but you can already experimentally verify it directly - e.g. by translating a brain scan into a picture the person sees).
#+end_quote

You didn't respond to that.

You also said that a gradual brain replacement would destroy your consciousness. I asked:

#+begin_quote
  So, at the end of the gradual brain replacement, you will have blacked out forever, and in your place, there is going to be a fully conscious clone - acting like you, but still another person.

  The question is, in what manner would your perception cease to exist, as felt from the inside? At the beginning, you're perceiving everything normally since the gradual brain replacement hasn't begun yet. At the end, you're blacked out forever (like after a car accident). But what do you feel in between? Does your awareness of the outside world fade out gradually, or does it stop abruptly at some point?
#+end_quote

You didn't respond to that either.
