  locality of continuity for quantumly entangled threads of reality
#+end_quote

As written, this isn't so much a coherent concept as it is a sequence of vaguely technical-sounding words, none of which make sense in relation to each other. Locality and continuity are entirely distinct concepts, and the usual definitions of each are such that "locality of continuity" is a nonsensical phrase.

In other words, no, we cannot appeal to "locality of continuity for quantumly entangled threads of reality" because that is not a thing, at least with the way those words are normally used. If you have an alternative concept that you're trying to put forth as a basis for valuing, please describe it directly, without obscuring it behind a veil of seemingly incoherent technical language. The latter, I've found, is occasionally even used to hide the fact that there /is/ no coherent concept under discussion, which obviously wouldn't be great for your argument.
