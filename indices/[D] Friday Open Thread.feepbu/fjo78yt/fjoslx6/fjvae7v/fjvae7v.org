  If you're okay with your personality slowly shifting over time, the same thing happening to your body is probably acceptable. But similar to how you wouldn't want your personality completely changing overnight, I wouldn't want my brain being replaced all at once, even if it was with an identical copy.

Your personality changing over time influences you (you're slowly becoming a different person), so it's a good idea to have preferences about how slowly you want that change to happen.

Changing the substance of your body over time (assuming the pattern is preserved) doesn't influence you in any way - it doesn't have any impact on you at all - so having preferences about it is like having preferences about other things that are causally unconnected to you.
