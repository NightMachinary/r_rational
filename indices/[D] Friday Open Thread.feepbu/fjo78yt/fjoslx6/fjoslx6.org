  However, physical atoms are being replaced constantly within the human body and I am sure there is complete turnover multiple times over the course of someones life. Under this definition, everyone is slowly dying all the time and will die multiple times across their lifetime.

Personally, I think the rate of change is relevant. If you're okay with your personality slowly shifting over time, the same thing happening to your body is probably acceptable. But similar to how you wouldn't want your personality completely changing overnight, I wouldn't want my brain being replaced all at once, even if it was with an identical copy.

  As for continuity of consciousness, there is decent evidence that consciousness is not continuous under any circumstances and that the appearance is a lie told by our brains. But even ignoring that (it certainly isn't proven), continuity is broken by comas, anesthesia, and, arguably, sleep.

I'd disagree with sleep being a break in continuity of consciousness, since your brain is still active to some degree. But yes, under my current theory of consciousness going into a coma or being put under via anesthesia would effectively kill me.

Also, the fact that many people would already be dying from the use of anesthetics isn't necessarily an argument against that being the case. If anything, it means you should be cautious to never use them on the off chance that your theory of consciousness is incorrect.
