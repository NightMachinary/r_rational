But the "you" that died is just as different from the "you pre-clone" as the clone is. So yes, that individual died. But that individual is not any more related to the "pre-clone you" than the clone itself is. From the perspective of "you pre-clone", either one of you dying is equally bad, because those two individuals are both equally related to "you pre clone", and they are not different things. [[/u/gaberockking]] point about non-binary death is a good way of thinking about it.
