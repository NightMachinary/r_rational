A way to bootstrap your intuition to see that it can would be to imagine a [[http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html][gradual brain replacement]] (your brain being slowly replaced by functionally equivalent small pieces of something else (like silicon transistors)). That makes it easier to see that it's the continuity of the pattern that's responsible for the continuity of the consciousness, and the persistence of a particular hardware/matter is only necessary to the extent to which it's necessary to maintain the continuity of the pattern.
