For me it's the fact that you could theoretically make a clone of me with my exact memories, and we could coexist together and we would be distinct people. If I'm standing next to my clone and you kill me, I'm dead (and for the sake of argument let's pretend my clone and my memories haven't started diverging yet). I don't get to continue my own experience through my pre-existing clone, so why would it be different with a clone created later?

I can't conceive of /my/ consciousness ever existing in any hardware besides /my/ brain, Ship of Theseus concerns notwithstanding. That's a whole different argument :)
