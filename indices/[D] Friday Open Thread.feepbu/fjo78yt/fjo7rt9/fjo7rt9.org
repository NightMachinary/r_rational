So according to you, a clone with your same memories and brain state is not a clone, but is actually /you/?

This question is examined in some of Peter F. Hamilton's writing. We have the technology to backup and restore memories, so when someone dies in an accident, they get "re-lifed" in a new clone body with a clone brain injected with their old memories. In the books, the characters don't have a consensus about whether a re-lifed clone is actually the same person or not, but the society as a whole tends to accept it as true continuity. They call dying "body death".

I felt that re-lifing someone is more for their friends and family than for themselves. I mean, if I die in an accident, I don't care whether my memories and personality live on in another body, because I, the only me that matters, am dead and I will not experience anything my clone does.
