Death isn't binary. If you get hit on the head and lose an hour's worth of memories, have you died? Yes, but only by a few fractions of a percent. I care about myself in the immediate future more than myself in 20 years because 20 years from now I'll be fairly dead compared to current me, but given that I care for other humans, and me 20 years from now is the least dead variant of me to exist at that time, I care about them more than any other human. (For reference, I view other humans as being mostly dead versions of myself, who share some of the same brain structures, personality, and effectively equivalent memories, but lost a lot of my memories and replaced then with new ones, and they got massive brain damage they healed from.)

So in a destructive teleport, the person at the other end is still me from before the teleport. The "me" that goes through the teleporting process will have maybe a few nanoseconds of subjective experience that will be killed, but given how prone I am to forget things anyways, that's a small price to pay.

Though really, I'd much prefer to just have two instances of me. They would later diverge from each other, but from the perspective of pre-clone me, that just means there's a little less than 100% more me.
