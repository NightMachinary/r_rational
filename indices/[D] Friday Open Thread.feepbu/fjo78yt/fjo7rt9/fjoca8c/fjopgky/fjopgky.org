  If you get hit on the head and lose an hour's worth of memories, have you died? Yes, but only by a few percent.

I expect we'll need a new category of "partial murder" at some point.

You killed some entity, and it was restored from backup, but missing some amount of time. Maybe a few minutes of realtime would be a minor infraction.

But losing a couple years of realtime (during which you met the most awesome life-partner and had many adventures together) should face punishment closer to irrevocable murder (the normal kind in the year 2020).

Motive, as usual, should also play a part. If the death was an accident that's one thing, if you did it to cover up some other crime, that's way more serious.
