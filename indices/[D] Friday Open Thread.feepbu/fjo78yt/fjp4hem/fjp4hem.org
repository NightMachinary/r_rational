Both sides of the debate agree that the transporter gathers pattern information about your exact body composition by breaking it down into component parts, sends that information to another place, and then puts together new component parts to create the original pattern.

The question is then framed as "Will the new person be /me/?"

Proponents of the "No" view could point out that throughout the entirety of your existence, out of all the things in the universe, "you" have shared one thing that everything that is /not/ "you" does not share, active physical brain continuity.

In principle, we could draw a bubble around your brain from birth, and move it around with you. Sometimes the bubble may expand as new neurons go online, or contract as they die off. But, we can all agree that consciousness lies inside the bubble. One could draw the path that the bubble takes from birth to death, and it would be one smooth curved line through space-time. Teleportation would destroy the brain, leaving a moment in time where the bubble could not exist, thus breaking the smooth line. Therefore, the new person would be a new birth of a new consciousness, and thus, not "you."

Proponents of the "Yes" view could point out that throughout the entirety of your existence, out of all the things in the universe, "you" have shared one thing that everything that is /not/ "you" does not share, a unique machine (the brain) that maps inputs to outputs.

In principle, "you" are the end result of every input that you have received. When you see a red object, you experience the qualia of "seeing a red object", "knowing that red objects exists", "forming a memory of a red object", "experiencing emotions associated with red", "weakly associating the current emotional state with red" and "sending signals to the mouth to say things like 'that is red'". If you had seen blue instead, then your brain would have formed slightly differently. There is nothing in the universe that would process a red object in exactly the same way that you do. Teleportation would recreate your unique brain. Therefore, the new person is not a different consciousness, which would process information differently, and is thus, "you."

Personally, I belong to the "Meh, whatever" view. Both seem like perfectly reasonable definitions of "you" in the same way that "something that causes an auditory experience" and "vibrations" are both reasonable definitions of "sound." To me, the teleporter problem is exactly equivalent to the old question about a tree falling in the middle of the woods. The answer is "depends on your definition."

As such, the only thing that bothers me about the transportation problem is how people react to it. Being semantics, the answer to the "Is the new person you?" question should not inform your willingness to get onto the transporter platform.

Take the bird's eye view. At time x, there is a person at position y. At time x+1, there is a person with an identical everything at position z. The only question to consider from this formulation is "where is the better place for there to be a person?" Everything else cancels out.
