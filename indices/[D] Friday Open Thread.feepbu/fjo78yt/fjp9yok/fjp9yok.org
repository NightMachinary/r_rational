Honestly your conclusions seem self-evident and I doubt I'm going to say anything on the ship of Theseus problem that hasn't already been said. So I think teleporters can raise far more interesting questions:

What if teleporters work like scanners and 3d printers? In that case, wouldn't it be interesting if there were innumerable copies of you living far away having experiences you'll never have because travelling at the speed of light is too hard for not light? What if you have endless backups to fixed states in your life? Can you ever really learn? Do people die over thousands and millions of years because eventually they're not willing to part with memories? Or they die because their definition of themselves becomes too fixed to change?
