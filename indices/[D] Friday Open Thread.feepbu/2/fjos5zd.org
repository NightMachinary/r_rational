I'm looking for a Naruto fanfiction that was recommended here a while ago.

The main character is a gender-fluid SI who gets tutored by Kakashi and in turn tutors Naruto and Sasuke. They think the MC is a bit of a paranoid nutcase due to the horrifying training.

Near the end the MC is planning to prevent all death through some sort of munchkinry and runs the plan past Kakashi first. "See Kakashi, the problem is that everyone keeps dying." "Well," Kakashi thought, "that's certainly true."

Anybody remember it? Thanks very much
