ooo, fun. too late to do it right now, but i'll give it a shot in the morning.

notes:

-pretty much ideal level of complexity, but perhaps too many variables to make solving interesting after the initial deductions

-the ships proposed made me giggle (karkat and vriska as auspictices, haha)

-the top left grid square shouldn't be crossed out :y

-vacillation was probably a little underutilized, as it could have made the whole thing miles more difficult

-maybe they could have cut down the overhead by removing the "every quadrant filled" requirement?
