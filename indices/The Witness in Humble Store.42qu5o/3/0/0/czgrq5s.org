A change isn't the right word for it. I think more of a countervailing philosophy of gamedev. Casey Muratori is becoming more popular with his livecoding series [[https://handmadehero.org/][Handmade Hero]], and there's a spin-off initiative by some of their friends called [[http://handmadedev.org/manifesto/][Handmade Dev.]]

Jonathan Blow is also tinkering on a replacement for C++, ostensibly for games, but I think it can be used for a whole lot more than that and I wish he would release it already, despite it being very unfinished. CTFE and self-directed building features prominently. [[https://www.youtube.com/user/jblow888/videos][He was doing demos periodically]] until he took a break for The Witness crunch time three months ago.

I emailed him about the language where he said to direct comments and questions, and he never replied. I think he took my mention of higher-level/higher-order type features to mean I was a type system purist. :c
