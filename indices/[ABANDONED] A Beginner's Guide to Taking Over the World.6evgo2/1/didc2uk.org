Another abandoned work. I should really lower the scope of my projects.

Really just an introduction to a world; writing is a bit of a character-dump; next scene is meeting Eos on the roof at dawn, finding out that she's a night owl, bit of discussion on nominative determinism, her ability to modify the wavelengths of reflected light, and her doubts about wanting to rule.

Superhero setting, where all Powers are self-interested actors, and have little regard for others in pursuit of their own goals. The world is split into rulerships, where unpowered/low powered people are treated as chattel, but are usually treated well (as a happy populace is more easily controlled.)

Aetos the Wise definitely has some indoctrination powers. Sotership usually transfers by killing the current Soter or forcing them to abdicate. The Soter usually has their fortress in space/on the moon. Antumbra's power is something apocalyptic, and would leverage it as blackmail to become Soter.
