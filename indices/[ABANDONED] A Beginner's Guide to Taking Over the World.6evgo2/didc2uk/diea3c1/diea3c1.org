  Another abandoned work. I should really lower the scope of my projects.

Haha, yeah, I know exactly how you feel.

/looks at his HSTW and shudders to think that he's only a fifth of the way complete.

The setting sounds interesting, though. You might want to flesh out the world a bit and put it up on DTRPG for $1.99 or just Pay-What-You-Want if you aren't going to do anything else with it. You'll probably make a little bit of cash, if my experience is anything to go by, not much but enough to buy a few more books each year.

(But then, I'm the sort of person who doesn't like letting settings go to waste, and maybe the trouble of putting it in book form and formatting and everything is pretty unattractive for you, which I can understand)
