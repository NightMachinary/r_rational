*The University*

The University is in North America, and is the only institute of higher learning in North and South America. It was established by Aetos Soter the Wise, whose (secret) power is to modify the utility functions of other people (basically brilliant inception, and uses the opening speech every year to influence all the students coming to the University). He steps down from the role of Soter to establish the University, in order to guide the next generation of rulers.

The University has some general courses in science and mathematics, but the main focus of the University is to train rulers. Heavy focus on economics, psychology and (a very skewed) political philosophy, with a very utilitarian point of view. Many required courses on "Controlling your Populace" and "Ruling through Fear or Ruling through Love?" Basically teaching the students that in order to be a ruler, you have to have people to rule over, and how to ensure that they remain under you.

Of course, the sciences have their own research divisions for the techies, which work on developing new technologies, or figuring out how the creations of the techies work. Innovations are patented and sold to rulerships around the world, to be further discussed.

The University also has training rooms, blacked out and perfectly private, for those who wish to hone their powers without others knowing what they are. Contrary to the openness of World Domination, keeping your power a secret is something many powers do, as that information can be used as a weapon against yourself (of course, why they choose names that reflect the nature of their powers is an(unanswered, no in-universe answer)other question. But at least Antumbra and Ember are slightly misleading).

Of course, the University knows all. They have agents and drones and spy networks all around the world, keeping tabs on all powers. They know the full extent of Antumbra's powers.

*The World*

There is absolutely no way I can figure out an alternate history timeline for this world; because once powers appear, the government can always coerce them through the ones they love. I will not try to integrate this onto our timeline, despite similar geographical places.

Villains want to rule over people, and thus they establish their rulerships over towns or cities, however, a single villain can only control so much territory, and villains often delegate rulership of overextended territories to friendly powers. Often, large cities are contested by multiple villains, with each villain ruling over different districts, but whenever there is fighting, the civilians always lose. Thus, civilians always migrate away from contested zones and remain in stable cities. Rulerships transfer usually when one power overpowers the current ruler, and the civilians don't usually care; most rulers are fairly equivalent.

But not all rulers are alike. How the city is run depends on the ruler, which often depends on their power.

Mage-kings and Brutes usually rule using brute strength, establishing an oligarchical government, or possibly a feudal system. Usually the ruler's word is absolute law, and, depending on how they chose to rule, may allow the citizens to live their lives with only a minor tax, or force them to build monuments in their honour, or demand their wives and daughters, or newborn sons to eat. They maintain their rule with trained thugs/police who roam the streets, enforcing the laws that the ruler lays down.

Techies rulers are usually more capricious; as their interests usually lie more towards technology rather than power. Their rule usually have less of a human element, preferring instead to rely on obedient genetically-modified soldiers or robots and drones, and their laws are usually less evadeable, establishing a more futuristic-dystopian feel to their cities. Additionally, random kidnappings for experiments are a commonplace, but many citizens tolerate it for the increased stability and access to technology.

Rulership style also depends on where the ruler lies on the fear/love spectrum. Some cities have guards at every exit, preventing anyone from leaving the city, whereas others allow freedom of movement, hoping instead to entice the citizens to stay through their quality of life. Citizens are a resource, the more the better. And you cannot be a ruler without any subjects.

*Economics*

Most cities are not self-sufficient. Most cities can generate enough power from middling powers, but botanist techies are rare enough that, for most cities, food is the greatest imported resource (followed by technology). Some rulers allow the free market to govern the import and export of goods, but this requires a good relationship with the neighbouring rulerships, or heavy guards on the import and export of goods. Other rulers establish a monopoly on imports, working out deals with neighbouring rulers and selling to their citizens at markup. After all, the ruler needs taxes in order to enjoy the position of rulership.

After all, rulerships naturally specialise. The botanist techie can produce food on the cheap, and trade with the computer techie who excels at creating technology. Whereas rulerships with a tighter control over their population can force their citizens to mine for raw resources.

New technologies are often developed by a single techie and sold to others for use. The University model is no different, except that the University has a greater global reach.

Yes there are wars, although fewer than you would expect. Cities can fight over resources or space, but the most precious resource are the citizens. There are some exceptions, with techies ruling over completely automated cities, but most rulers wish to have subjects. And as citizens flee from unstable zones, most rulers refrain from direct attacks on other rulerships. They may loot transports passing through their territory, but rarely do any conflicts escalate to all-out war. Most keep to their own affairs, in a series of unspoken agreements, spending their efforts to make their cities more enticing to other citizens, or finding better ways to prevent their citizens from leaving.

*The Soterai*

The Soter is the ruler of the World. The position itself does not come with much power, rather, it is because you have power that you come by the position. The Soter is responsible for resolving disputes between rulers, and establishing guidelines, moral event horizons, and prohibited technologies. The Soter is also responsible for forseeing and preventing apocalyptic events.

The power of the Soter comes from the seat of the Soter's power, an orbital station armed with a laser capable of wiping entire cities off the map. The Soter sees the entire world as their domain, and must work to keep their world alive.

But the Soter (usually) cannot work alone. The Soter is always surrounded by advisors, each with their own area of expertise, usually augmented by the powers they posess. Most advisors are mind-mages, capable of reading the minds of the populace, determining truths from lies, but it is up to the Soter to determine what is to be done, and to find the best action for the world.

The position of Soter is usually passed on through ritual assassination, with the successor killing the previous Soter. Usually the new Soter brings in their own advisers, those who have helped them come to power. The average reign of a Soter lasts nine years.

Only twice before had the previous Soter survived the position; the second was Aetos Soter the Wise, who abdicated to found the University, and the first was upon the succession of Virgil Soter the Mad, who threatened to destroy the entire world if he wasn't given the position. Virgil Soter the Mad lasted three weeks before the rulers of the world all secretly agreed that his constant threats of geocide were too much, and overthrew Virgil the Mad with minimal collateral damage, rendering most of Asia uninhabitable.

*World Domination*

There are four institutes in the world that grant degrees in World Domination: two in Europe, one in Africa, and the University (And one in Japan, now defunct). World Domination focuses on macroeconomics, as well as the psychology of rulers, as opposed to the psychology of citizens. They are taught the importance of existential risks and how to identify them, as well as previous attempts at immanetizing the eschaton and the countermeasures put into place.

The University is unique in that the other three institutions are based off a student-mentor relationship, with only one candidate for World Domination at a time. The University usually accepts four students per year into its program, and although there is a high post-graduate mortality rate between graduates, Soters that have come from the University are usually accompanied by one or two advisers with the same degree. Whether better advisers is worth the greater loss of potential is still up for debate.

Candidates for World Domination are chosen for their potential for rulership, in addition to their potential in assassinating the Soter. Of course, the assassination of the Soter is not an individual effort, and thus both can be taught, but the University prefers those with powers that would be beneficial as a Soter, which is why most of the candidates are mind-mages.
