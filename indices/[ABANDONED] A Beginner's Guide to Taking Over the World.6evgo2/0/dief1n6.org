Because [[/u/callmebrotherg]] seems interested in a more in-depth examination of the world (I have no idea what DTRPG is), here is a long-form dump of worldbuilding.

Inspirations: Worm (Wildbow), Megamind (Dreamworks)

*Introduction*

The question this world answers is "What if the supervillain wins?" The main difference between a superhero and a supervillain is that the hero defends the status quo, while the villain breaks it. But what happens when the villain wins? What happens when the villain's vision for the status quo becomes the status quo?

Becuase taking over a city, or country, or world, is /difficult/. It may be easy for a supervillain to blackmail or ransom a city or country, but to rule? That takes an entirely different set of skills. Being in charge, and staying in charge, of a functional city requires some amount of compromise. And this world is to examine these fully self-interested rulers, and how the manage to manage their domains.

*Antumbra*

The main character is Antumbra. Her father was powered, called Midas, whose ability was to turn anything he touches (within a maximum radius) into any element he chooses. Her mother was unpowered, and the three of them lived under a fairly typical mage-king (henceforth called Marquis, because that was the initial filler power that I thought of). Her mother was never comfortable with the abuses of power by those acting under the Marquis, and often urged Midas to move the family to a safer rulership, but Marquis was adamant in his belief in toeing the line and everything working fine. That is, until her mother was killed (raped?) by one of the commando squads that roam the streets.

The combined guilt and anger drove Midas to actively challenge the Marquis' rule, acting as a lone guerrilla vigilante/terrorist, often dragging the young Antumbra along. He was not a very good father.

Antumbra at this time was known as Painter, as her ability was seemingly a weaker version of her father's, being able to only transmute the surface of objects; however, when she is nine, she accidentally converts half the city, and her father realises that her power appears to have no maximum distance, and Painter voluntarily stops using her powers, as it can possibly be an apocalyptic level threat. Through her teenage years, she follows her father in his terrorist activities, is kidnapped multiple times by the Marquis (and meets his young son during those times), and is overall not entirely impressed with the entire vigilante hero route.

She applies to Princeton and goes to study art history (after all, she is a Painter). Towards the end of her studies, her father dies in an attempt to kill the Marquis, by transmuting a supercritical mass of plutonium in a Duke Leto/Baron Harkonnen situation.

Antumbra graduates and heads back home, and decides take over the city from the Marquis. She does so in a week, without using her powers. (How she does so, I have no idea. I'm thinking something like Die Hard). She spares the Marquis (she doesn't really remember her mother, it's not directly the Marquis' fault, and her father's war isn't her own), and establishes a benevolent rule over the city.

A year later, a letter from the Univeristy arrives, offering her a spot in the World Domination program. She accepts, and leaves her city behind. The Marquis returns back into the power vacuum, but keeps Antumbra's advisers. The city continues to be run in relative peace.

Story opens. World Domination is a graduate-level course, but since Princeton doesn't teach anything about rulership, she has to take some introductory courses with the undergraduates. The Marquis' son is just starting, and recognises her as Painter. She's changed her name to avoid her past, but it will continue to come up.

She eventually converts the entire surface of the moon into silver as a demonstration of power, and uses it to blackmail the current Soter into abdicating.

*Interlude*

There are no heroes or villains in this story. There is just Machiavellian scheming. There is no good, or evil, only the pursuit of self-interest. The only interest anyone has in anyone else is exactly proportional to how much they can help advance their own goals.

*Powers*

Powers are partially heritable, as seen from Midas/Painter, and probably Marquis/his son. Powers range wildly in function and scope (which is why Painter's unbounded power is apocalyptically dangerous). Powers, are, of course, classified, but in broader strokes and more colloquially than Worm's classification system.

- *Brute*: Powers that make the user more physically superhuman. Strength, flight, speed, regeneration, etc. all fall under this category. Individually powerful, but less flexible in application.
- *Mage*: Powers that appear magical, or possibly mental; outside the range of what humans can do. Pyrokinesis, heat vision, telepathy, mind control, photographic memory.
- *Techies*: Powers that grant the bearer hyperspecialised engineering ability. Biological, chemical, technological, etc. Basically grants the bearer the ability to work out the solution to the problem in their field extremely rapidly, and usually with the uncanny ability for their creations to function on the first try.
- *Body horrors*: Powers that grant the bearer abilities, but can no longer pass as regular humans. Lizardmen, sentient blobs of goo, guy made of bees, etc.

These powers vary wildly in intensity, ranging from a person who can generate flames from the tips of their fingers, to *Ember* (mage), who can move kinetic energy around and chill particles to (close to) absolute zero (and heat particles to fly, or fire energy blasts, etc. etc.). Those who are born with lesser powers often don't rise to the rank of ruler, and are often enlisted to more menial labour, such as power generation (they do violate thermodynamics). Those with middling powers are often recruited by rulers to serve under them, as a single powered soldier is usually more than a match for a large number of unpowered ones.

These classifications are colloquial, and often overlap as well. For instance, Fuckoff (Chosen name, *Fork*, much to the ire of the other Fork), has the ability ensoul any computer with a copy of his mind. This grants him the ability to manipulate technology to a seemingly techie level, but in application his ability is closer to a mage. (His main downfall with his power is he doesn't get along with himself, and his copies often sabotage the meat self).

I might as well get into the other members while I'm at it.

- *Fork* (mage)'s ability is to run parallel copies of his personality at the same time, allowing him to multitask and pay attention to multiple things at once, but the difficulty is in integrating the information, as communication between personalities is limited by (internal) speech/comprehension. He's got it fairly down pat, with a master personality delegating tasks to other personalities in his brain.
- *Flicker* (mage) is basically that; phases objects out of reality for a predetermined period of time. Great for infiltration and taking out enemies; and as a last resort self-defense technique. Objects stay in position relative to the surface of the Earth, and conserve momentum, which leads to problems in vehicles and space stations.
- *Estver* (mage) has mind control; he can be much more subtle than he pretends to be able to, but he can only control one person at a time. The person knows they're being controlled, but Estver can be very convincing at inception.
- *Eos* (mage). Actually a night owl, and stays up to watch the sunrise. She can modify the wavelength of light reflected off her body (to a certain factor), which gives her the ability to make energy blasts by bouncing light between her hands. Doesn't feel cut out for World Domination.
- *Vertias* (mage) senses motives. That is all, a useful skill, especially in a scheming environment.
- *Case* (body horror), conscious control over gene expression. Eventually hacks the neurotransmitter production in his brain, and injects himself with viruses containing a database of all known genes, and goes full body horror. Only drawback is that the expression of genes takes time to shape his body, so he can't instantly adapt to surrounding environments.
- *Tetra*, mad botanist (techie). Basically can engineer plants to do whatever she wants, but they're engineered, not under conscious control. Could just as easily make a strain of rice that contains all nutrients humans need to live as a biological green-goo Von Neumann machine. Thankfully, other techies have thought of this problem, and the biosphere is chock full of engineered organisms to prevent green goo scenarios. Of course, Tetra might be smart enough to get around them...
- *Sengo*, the swordsman (brute). Has the ability to perfectly bisect any object with a blade. Great at cutting cakes. (Jack Slash-inspired)
- *Assembler* (techie). A fairly general-purpose technology techie, although her main limitation is that her blueprints are not easily achievable. Best for reverse-engineering designs. (Probably works best as a MacGuffin generator, to find the missing element/etc. Or just combine with Midas to generate the elements you want. Or with Ember for infinite energy. Her limitation is only a limitation in an unpowered world)

As you can see, the classification system is mainly for colloquial use. You can further subdivide however you want, kinesis and thinker and whatnot, but I have no formal classification.

Additionally, it shows that World Domination preferentially recruits Thinkers, but also those with high-intensity powers. We'll discuss this later.
