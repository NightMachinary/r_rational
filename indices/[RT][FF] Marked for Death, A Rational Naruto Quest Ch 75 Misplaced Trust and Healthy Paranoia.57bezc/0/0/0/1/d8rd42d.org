Pretty much what [[/u/OliWhail]] said.

[[/u/Velorien]] and I have discussed it pretty carefully; when you're co-authoring, killing a character is a big deal because you're killing them for the other person too. (Plus, normally the way it's going to go is that the character will die as the climactic moment of one update and then the other author has to clean up the mess in the next one.)

Anyway, we've talked about it and decided that yes, if the dice break the wrong way then yes, we will let the relevant person die. Give the other author a head's up, but let the character die. It's made writing this a bit tense for me.
