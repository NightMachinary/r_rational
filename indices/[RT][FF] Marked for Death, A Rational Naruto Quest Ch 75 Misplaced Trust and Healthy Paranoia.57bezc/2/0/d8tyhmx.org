I don't think there's any kind of ebook out there, but on the first or second post of the thread is a link to a story-only archive thread, and you can use the arrows at the top and bottom of story posts to navigate to the next one.

Going through the story-only is faster, but navigating via threadmarked posts in the main thread will also mean that you read all the little omake/vignettes that the thread participants have written, which usually earn at least a giggle or two.
