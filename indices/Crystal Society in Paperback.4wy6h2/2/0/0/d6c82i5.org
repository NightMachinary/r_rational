I agree with Themnos that the first half of the book is very strong, and that the second half is not as strong. I'd rate this book 1 Michelin star, "an excellent example in its category." I think the second half of the book is still good, but it's not unusually good in the way the first half is. The interactions between the AI elements are so solid though it's hard not to like this book.
