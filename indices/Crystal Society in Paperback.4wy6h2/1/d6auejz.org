If you thought this book was awesome and wanted a copy made of dead wood, you can now get it for $20!

Crystal Society has a [[http://crystal.raelifin.com/][website]] with free ebooks if you don't want to spend the $5 on a Kindle version to support the author via Amazon.

Here's the version on [[https://www.createspace.com/6170199][Createspace]] if you prefer that to Amazon.

It already has been posted to this subreddit [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/42o6x5/rthsf_crystal_society_rationalfic_web_novel_from/][here]].

Here's the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/CrystalBooks/][subreddit]] dedicated to it.
