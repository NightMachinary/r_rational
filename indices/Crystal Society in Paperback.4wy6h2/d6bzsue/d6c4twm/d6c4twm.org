I read through it a while back. Everyone around here seems to love it, I don't share that opinion. I don't think it's a bad book. It starts out brilliantly characterizing the behavior of an intelligent modular general AI in a testing environment and then rapidly drops in plot coherency until the end, where there is a random very graphic sex scene in the middle of a tense situation. I almost stopped reading there.

It did have some relatively interesting aliens, (although if you want to read brilliantly depicted rational aliens I recommend you go read Blindsight) sadly, they couldn't save the book IMHO.

You might think completely differently, if anything I'd recommend reading the beginning up until they [[#s][spoiler]] for what is the best internal AI depiction I've ever seen.
