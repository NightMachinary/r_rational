That's understandable - it was in a lighter and more comedic style than usual, and they weren't dealing with threats from Katashi or Mizuchi, so the situation didn't have anywhere near as much risk involved. That said, some of the things that happened in there, especially the talks with Meltlake and the contract with Emery will have long-term impacts on the story as a whole.
