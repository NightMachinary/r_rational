Hey again, I really liked the premise and the setting of your story. Very cool to have a rogue-like dungeon that hands out magical powers. And it seems like you put a lot of thought into how adding that into a world shapes the cultures that inhabit it; the part about intergenerational occupations based on the magic received from the tower was a cool idea. And I liked the implication that a caste system arose from having those powers. I see a lot of potential in your story.

Unfortunately, the book didn't really connect with me, so I didn't finish to the end. Regardless, I wish you success and good health.
