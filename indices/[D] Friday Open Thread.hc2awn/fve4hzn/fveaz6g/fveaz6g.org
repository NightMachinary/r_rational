Well, off the top of my head...

Schlock Mercenary's versions of Gav, plus a couple of Kevyns; the radio version of the Hitchhiker's Guide has a half-trillion Lintillas; maybe David Brin's Kiln People; some of the Daves in Homestuck; the 90's CGI cartoon has at least one character get an extra copy made from their backup; Gold Digger has Array... Calvin once turned his transmogrifier into a duplicator... the Vortas in Star Trek DS9 do a serial-immortality thing, while Ba'al in Stargate ran some duplicates of himself for a while... RPG-wise, there's Eclipse Phase and Paranoia... in one of the Ah My Goddess things, Urd made a few copies who wanted the same things she did... there are a few perma-clone techniques in Naruto... the protagonist of Kumo Desu Ga Nani Ka gets a little weird with her mental duplicates... I hear that when they planned to film the never-made Matrix sequels, one of the villains was going to do this <ahem>... The Stainless Steel Rat Goes To Hell has it as a major plot point... I think it was available to some in The Rapture of the Nerds... there are undoubtedly a few SCPs which involve such shenanigans...

... and I'm positive there are many more I'm missing. :)
