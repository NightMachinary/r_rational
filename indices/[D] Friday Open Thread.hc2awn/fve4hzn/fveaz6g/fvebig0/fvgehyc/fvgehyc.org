If you like 1970's-1980's era, less-than-serious space opera, then the full "Stainless Steel Rat" series should be more than worth going through - a few years ago I hit the full set of audiobooks myself while hiking.

Gold Digger is a slightly-ecchi, somewhat-more-superpowered comic version of Indiana Jones. Array can create multiple bodies of herself, with the minor side-effect that when she dismisses them, she ends up with an extra persona inside her head.

Kumo Desu Ga Nani Ka, aka "I'm a spider, so what?" started as a webnovel, then became a manga, and is now also an anime - each has gotten to a different depth into the plot, and there are a few other tweaks between versions. There's also a silly spinoff manga, "Daily Life of the Four Spider Sisters", in which her mental selves wake up one day in separate bodies, instead of doing the other bizarre things they do in the main story.

Also, I seem to have forgotten to mention; the 90's CGI cartoon I was referring to is called "Reboot".
