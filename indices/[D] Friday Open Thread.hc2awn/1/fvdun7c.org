Just saw The Last Action Hero movie, and it was pretty great. I loved the self referential humor and the writing is really clever and ahead of its time. A lot of jokes felt like something Dan Harmon would write in Community or Rick and Morty. The movie really went all out with its premise (Arnold meeting real life Arnold) and I the move made some rational smart choices - like the villain Charles Dance planning to release villains from other movies. His motivation is very clear - that the real world is the only world where the bad guys can win. And the kid makes rational decisions and observations of what would happen in a real movie

It's a great concept and a lot of potential with that universe in general.
