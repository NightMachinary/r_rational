Looping basically allows you to act with precognition, so I would think it would largely depend on how well you can replicate your actions and their consequences. If it's similar to the Groundhog Day loop in that events will proceed down their original path unless severely disrupted, then the looper has basically an eternity to figure out exactly how to get around the precognition. If events proceed chaotically, with events sensitive to even small changes in the initial conditions, then the precog would have an strong advantage in knowing how things are about to happen, where the looper has to guess what happens next. based on previous iterations of the loop.
