If you dislike the Google Play store, then you might want to consider what the F-Droid has to offer, such as at [[https://search.f-droid.org/?q=rss&lang=en]] .

For example, do you have access to a webserver on which you can run Docker or LEMP? Then you might want to run Tiny Tiny RSS on that server, and TTRSS-Reader on your phone.

(I've become somewhat spoiled on my desktop by how well [[https://github.com/Xyrio/RSSOwlnix][RSSOwlnix]] just works, and have yet to find a phone-based RSS reader that works as well.)
