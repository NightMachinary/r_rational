Depends on how the precog works.

1) Precog through extrapolating from the real world. Precog is surprised and massively confused by looper. His power may or may not recalibrate as the loop runs its course. Looper can defeat him by following original actions and then ambushing precog out of nowhere.

2) Precog knows the future by fiat, but works on linear time only, the loop superceding him. At the start of the loop suddenly all of his predictions change in an unprecedented way. He can see the whole loop, but isn't necessarily aware that it is a loop, so will not hold back. Looper has to use the loop to learn about precog and then defeat him at a start of a loop where precog is most vulnerable and unprepared. This splits into two depending on the precog's spacial awareness.

2a) Precog is aware of his own future and the looper can keep away to confuse him or keep him in the dark.

2b) Precog knows stuff that's happening in the world even if it's unrelated to him, to varying amounts of resolution. At it's most extreme he will immediately know the cause of his sudden change of visions, because at the precise moment it happens there is only one variable behaving differently.

3) Precog is aware of the loop, but still limited by it. Essentially his power works the same as in 2, but instead of seeing some parallel post-loop timeline that will never actually happen in each loop and be fooled by it, he sees his visions cut off at the end of the loop, or some other crazy and unprecedented thing. He might be more prepared for shenanigans and, depending on setting and intelligence, be able to deduce the fact that he is in a loop more frequently and act accordingly (by holding back in timelines that remain within the loop). This one also has the same sections a and b as the previous one.

4) Precog works on overtime. He might or might not know the content of the whole loop sequence itself, but knows everything about the current instance, the fact that he is in a loop and, most importantly, the end results of the last loop and all its consequences. He will fiddle his thumbs during the loop, maybe amuse himself with cryptic communications towards the looper. In the last loop he will do what most benefits him. The looper is as screwed and outmatched as if he weren't a looper at all. Maybe the existence of a loop centered around the looper was all part of the precog's master plan in the first place.

5) Precog knows everything, including the results and consequences of him knowing everything. The universe is deterministic. Nothing matters. There wasn't really ever a fight to begin with.

I think 2 or 3 would make for the most interesting stories for a true contest. That said, given infinite determination and mental endurance the looper will always find the path to victory, if such a path is physically possible.
