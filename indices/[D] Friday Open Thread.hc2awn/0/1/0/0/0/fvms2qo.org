Duty to report if you are a danger to yourself or others. They don't report someone for being a black belt in lethal martial arts, for having a concealed carry permit, or for having extensive knowledge and practice in the fields of microbiology.

That said, a groundbreaking discovery like the existence of supernatural phenomena might be more important to any given therapist than his professional ethics, so there is always a significant risk if you're someone who can be forced to reveal your powers by a third party. If you can use your powers at will and otherwise appear completely human even under inspection you can always show off only once, when the therapist isn't prepared to secretly record and then trust that the therapist won't be believed without proof anymore than they would have believed them.
