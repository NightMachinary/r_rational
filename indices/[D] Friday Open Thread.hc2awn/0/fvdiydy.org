Superheroes are great, and therapy is important. But how often would a superhero be able to go to therapy?

Like, in a world where superheroes are a known and established phenomena, I imagine that the Justice League or Avengers could routinely hire therapists for superheroes in uniform, with appointments paid for by Bruce Wayne or Tony Stark.

But what about worlds where superpowers and the like are virtually unknown, and/or characters that haven't "put on the cape" yet and are trying to keep their powers on the down-low? If they had significant emotional or interpersonal problems, would therapy be justified given the (perceived) risks of:

A) Being insufficiently honest to make effective progress, B) Coming across as highly delusional, C) Saying too much and accidentally outing themselves and others?
