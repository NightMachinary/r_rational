True, that definitely removes or alleviates concern (B), appearing delusional.

That opens the question, however, of whether that willful exposure is itself a worthwhile risk. In a scenario where the would-be patient wants to remain unknown, I think they would need good reason to trust that "doctor-patient confidentiality" will hold up, airtight, even after the therapist witnesses something completely beyond their prior model of reality (say... an Outside-Context Problem).
