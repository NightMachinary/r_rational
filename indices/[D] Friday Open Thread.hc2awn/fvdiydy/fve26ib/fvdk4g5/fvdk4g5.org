If the character is willing to be open with the therapist about having powers, the therapist's willingness to believe probably depends on the type of superpower. If it's something that is demonstrable to the therapist, like Minerva McGonagall's ability to turn into a cat, then belief is easy. If it's internal, like many sensory powers, it may not be easy to demonstrate to the therapist, and would be riskier.
