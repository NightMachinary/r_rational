Yes I'd even go so far as to say every Yamada scene is probably paid by the protectorate.

Yes, I think your primary challenge in therapy by non public capes will come down to trust on a couple of topics: does the cape disclose illegal acts (Vigantilism), does the hero lie and talk around what they are doing, does the hero disclose powers?

If the cape is in an organization with security cleared therapists (The laundry Files) this can be hand waved away and be part of the banality of a story or express the constant psychological cost. I remember reading a passage in the laundry files where a very capable post-doc occultist described their routine for crying between meetings and then getting back on with their day and I don't think anything else quite drove the psychological cost.

If the cape does talk about what they do, with or without powers. They have to be careful, have leverage, or they may run afoul of the therapists responsibility to report someone who is an active threat to others. . . Figuring out what you can and can't say to a therapist, and what a trained observer of how people works get's out of a cape is a potential font of repeated converational tension.
