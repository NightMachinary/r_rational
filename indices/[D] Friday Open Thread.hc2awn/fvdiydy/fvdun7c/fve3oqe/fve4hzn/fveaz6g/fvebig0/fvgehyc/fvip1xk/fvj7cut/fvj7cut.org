  A nice gift from RNG my favorite copy clan has a new book: [[https://www.audible.com/pd/Heavens-River-Audiobook/B088C4DBYP]]

'Has' a new book? My info is that I have to wait until September for it to come out. :)

  I haven't found a good list of comics for the array but I'll probably pick it up if I can find it in a bound format
#+end_quote

Array appears in:

- Gold Digger Sourcebook, issues 1 and 16;
- Gold Digger Volume 2 (started in 1993), issues 44, 46-48, 50;
- Gold Digger Volume 3 (started in 1999), issues 12, 15, 18-22, 60, 76-78, 82, 119, 138-140, 142, and 145.

(I don't have quite that good a memory; that info's from [[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/array/4005-8964/]] . :) )

If you want paper versions, then you'll probably want to look for the 'Gold Brick' collections, which collect 25 issues each; there's a list of which brick has which issues at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Digger_(comics)#Collected_editions]] . If you want digital copies, then the GD-ROM v3.0 at [[http://www.antarctic-press.com/html/version_01/viewitem.php?id=5713]] collects everything up to v3 issue 125. (Of course, various people have scanned every last issue and made torrents of them, but I don't know what your jurisdiction is or what your local laws are, so I don't know if you want to hit up a torrent-search site to find them.)
