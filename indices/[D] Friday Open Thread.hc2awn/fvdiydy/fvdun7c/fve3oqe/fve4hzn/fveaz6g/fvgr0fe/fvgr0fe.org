Accelerando by Charles Stross has a copy-clan that people can join. It's not much a spoiler to say that, and it is free online: [[https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html]]

It's also multi-generational and very big on the potential "wow" factor of technology. It doesn't shy away from potential downsides but I think it is still good for both long-term and escapist themes.
