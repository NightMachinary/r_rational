You make good points about the monetary value of digital services. I definitely prefer paying for some that would otherwise be free (patreon for content creators I like, music streaming, etc.), but I guess 'feed aggregator' just doesn't rise to that value threshold for me.

Regarding the reason for switching, sounds like we might have different needs when it comes to RSS tracking. I use feedly only as a hobby, following ~55 independent webcomic or author sites. I'd never heard of any restriction on number of feeds.
