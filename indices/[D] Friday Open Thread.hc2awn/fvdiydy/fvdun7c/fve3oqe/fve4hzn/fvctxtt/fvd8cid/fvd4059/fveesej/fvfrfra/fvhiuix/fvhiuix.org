inoreader doesn't require a fee, for starters. The absurdly cheap lowest premium subscription is something like $10/year during the black friday sale.

I don't remember why I left feedly anymore, it was IDK 3+ years ago. I do remember they had some sort of new shitty feature, reduced the amount of free feeds you could subscribe to, or something like that. Whatever it was it broke my workflow enough that I looked for an alternative (or maybe it was a redesign). I can't recall what it was, my use case is pretty typical (I have a lot of feeds, but I don't think an absurd number).

I'm not a salesperson for inoreader so I'm not going to try and recommend the features or whatever. But yeah, I do still really like it.

Switching is virtually frictionless because you can export and import subscriptions, too, so you could just give it a try.

I do prefer paying for online services than having "free" services, in general. (Though I don't have reddit premium so go figure, but in my defense it costs a fortune for what you get). I feel the adification of the internet has made things a lot worse. We have tracking cookies, we have autoplaying videos, etc and we accept them as normal and lovely but paying $10/year for an app you use every day is horrifically expensive when I spend $20 a month having coffee once a week.

For example, I remember on a podcast subreddit someone said I must be crazy rich or bad with money if I spend $20 on patreon subscriptions for ad-free versions of podcasts. But $20 a month on cafe coffee is considered relatively frugal. It blows my mind that we've been culturally "taught" that digital services are "free" and that we don't think that we are the products being sold, we accept it blindly and it means that now if I want to play a game on my phone 95% of the best ones have interstitial ads or gems I can buy or shit like that when what I want to do is pay $5 at the start and have the full game.

Anyway that was a whole different rant than you asked for, but yeah.
