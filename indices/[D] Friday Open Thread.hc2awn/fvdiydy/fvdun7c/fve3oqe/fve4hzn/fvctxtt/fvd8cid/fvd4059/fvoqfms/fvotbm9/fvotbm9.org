It's part of the attraction, but not the only one; F-Droid lists apps which have what it calls 'anti-features', and lets you install them. But it is nice that it focuses so much on the Open Source & Free Software idiom. :)

My phone's in the Moto G7 family, and F-Droid has been entirely painless to use. Some of the apps I've snagged from it include: AnkiDroid (study aid); AntennaPod (the best podcast app I've yet found); FBReader's TTS Plugin (turns ebooks into audiobooks); Hacker's Keyboard; K-9 Mail (multi-account email app); KDE Connect (lets my laptop talk to my phone and vice versa); OsmAnd (Google Maps replacement); Puzzles (the collection by Simon Tatham); RadioDroid (stream internet radio); Simple Solitaire Collection (card games); Slide (reddit app); Telegram (chat app); VLC (video/audio file player). I've installed some others, but I've actually used all of the above within the last few months.
