Can anyone recommend good fiction on copy-clans? Something in the vein of the Flower Prince trilogy, Glass House, Hanson's Age of EM, or the Bobiverse, and U/DataPacRat 's good works. Current and personal events have me more down than my curmudgeon mean, mode, and median, so I'm looking for something to indulge long term or escapist thinking.
