Seems like most of the self hosted web stories were started long enough ago that royal road wasn't a big draw. The likes of PGtE, Wandering Inn, Zombie Knight Saga are all 4 or more years old, while stuff like Wildbow's work or Gods are Bastards are even older. Things like topwebfiction and webfictionguide were probably the main aggregators back then.

TWI and TZKS both now cross post to Royal road and other authors will post to every web fiction site, so I guess it's becoming more and more homogeneous
