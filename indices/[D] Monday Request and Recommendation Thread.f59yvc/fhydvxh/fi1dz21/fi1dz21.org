[[https://thesolsticewar.com][The Solstice War]]. It's essentially a re-imagining of WW2, but between communist India/Africa and a fantasy Axis, with fantasy elements. I'm copying from [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSolsticeWar][TVTropes]] (some spoilers on there).

  The Socialist Dominances of Solstice/Ayvarta is a Hindu-African Soviet Union.

  The Federation of Northern States is a German speaking United States analogue that acts as WW2 Germany. Geographically, it seems to be a counterpart to Europe, but ruled from a Scandinavian counterpart. One recently subdued and incorporated state is Frank, which is a close counterpart to France.

  - Achim Lehner is a close counterpart to Hitler, but crossed with distinctly American elements such as criminal connections and a love of capitalism and technology.

  The Kingdom of Lubon is the Kingdom of Italy but full of elves and a royal family more closely based on Britain.

  The Svechthan Union is...Russia. Again. But full of hobbits this time.

  The Empire of Hanwa is a pretty straight Empire of Japan. Kitan is implied to be China, but hasn't been referred to much.

  Hanwa, Lubon, and Nocht ally early on to attack Ayvarta, with the promise of helping take down the Svecthan Union and Kitan in the future, forming a counterpart to the Axis powers.

  The Confederacy of Helvetia seems to based on a much more powerful Switzerland with some British influence (Elves seem to be universally British in this universe, and Helvetians possess ULTRA) but not much is known about them. The Pact they mention could be a counterpart to the Warsaw Pact.
