If it isn't clear, I am talking exactly about grammar, and what is grammatically correct. There is a strictly wrong - an idiom that has no historical meaning, or a corruption of an idiom, where no direct meaning can be read, and meaning must be guessed. My point is that OP's phrasing was not this. There is a history of use of 'pass on' in this way. My honest point is that OP's phrasing is ambiguous; it would have multiple potential readings in isolation, and one of those would be the one intended.

Beyond that point, I'm not going to touch your strange ideas about objectivity and universal 'default readings' in language.

edit: I'm guessing neither of us are linguists, and no one should be reading and trusting what we're saying beyond the basics anyway, so I'll just pm you to carry on the conversation after your next one if I feel the need rather than clutter this thread.
