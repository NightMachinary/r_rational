There was a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/f3b6b4/review_why_you_should_read_the_emperors_soul/][thread]] a few days back recommending Brandon Sanderson's Novella /The Emperor's Soul/, with specific mention of it appealing to those who are not usually Sanderson fans.

As someone who definitely falls into that category, after reading the Novella I would wholeheartedly pass on the recommendation. I'm a little shocked in the disparity in quality (imo) between this and his other works because frankly I thought this Novella was superb.

(The thread linked above does a fine job detailing what exactly the Novella does well)
