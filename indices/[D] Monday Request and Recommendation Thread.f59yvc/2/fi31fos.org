Since there's people asking for military/alternative history in this thread, I might as well mention Youjo Senki/The Saga of Tanya the Evil, which is kinda rational-y and kinda-sorta this.

tl:dr; a sociopathic Japanese businessman shit-talks God and gets reincarnated in "not quite" "just before WW1" not-Germany with a bit of magic thrown in. Not full Harry Potter with wands and wizards, what's mostly used is augmented bullets/explosives, flight, and magic shields.

It was originally a light novel, and there's an anime with season 1 (and a movie that came out a few years later I haven't seen yet) that covers the events of, if I remember correctly, book 1 and most of book 2. The anime is pretty solid as far as animes go, but there's a shift in tone from the novel. While the anime plays up the battle scenes, the novel is more focused on the processes, both administrative and thought, that go on in the story. The 6th book just got translated into English not too long ago, and each is 400+ pages in length. The detail in the thinking is why my first thought is to place the books in the rational-adjacent category, but I haven't exactly examined the novels in detail.
