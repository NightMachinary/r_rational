I'm here once again asking for your base/town/kingdom building reqs.

In the meantime I have tried to pick up:

1. Doulo something? Xianxian giving it a hard meh. It suffers from the amoral ish mc and and some weird scenes involving slightly sexual moments for 6 year olds. TLDR: kinda creepy wouldn't recommend.

2. A will eternal - comedy and 50% rational. Gets repetitive around chapter 200, but I will probably finish it.

3. I shall seal the heavens - edgelordy mc in an unsustainably brutal sect. He just made inner sect and shamed a super powerful cultivator and killed a bunch of other potential inner disciples. Seriously how do these sects sustain any kind of population?

4. Worth a candle - at one point dude pics melee over magic in terms of specialization. The story seems to be leaning towards Harem and the existential shenanigans are getting pretty tedious.

EDIT: Xian xia dive was me trying to find someone doing something interesting with formations or pocket realms.

Edit 2: Good Reads bookshelf. I'm not gonna lie some of these are pretty crap, but others are good. YMMV - [[https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/92192.Empire_building_conquering_ruling]]
