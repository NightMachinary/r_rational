There's been a few good Kingdom Building stories recommended in the past but they didn't do too well lately. Off the top of my head, Release That Witch ended a while ago (rushed ending), there's also A Hero's War but it updates at a glacial (monthly) pace.

I think the proper term for the kingdom-building genre is "uplift", maybe you could search older threads for more recs.
