  The story seems to be leaning towards Harem
#+end_quote

FWIW that is one of explicit plot hooks and addressed in the story directly later on. If you're worried that it'll turn into a wish-fulfillment harem show you can rest easy.

(also there were good reasons for taking melee over magic in that context, and again it's something that the characters revisit later)

The existentials shenanigans otoh are part of the core story and don't go away, so if that's what's bothering you it's a valid reason to drop :P
