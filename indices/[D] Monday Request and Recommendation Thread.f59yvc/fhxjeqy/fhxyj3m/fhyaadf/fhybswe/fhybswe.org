That was another thing. An author can rationalize any inaccuracy by saying it's an AU story. But if all of the AU changes just /happen/ to complement the mindset of the main character perfectly, the story becomes boring, because the character is never surprised by anything. The world of /A Wand for Skitter/ surprises Taylor on occasion, but not nearly often enough to be fun. Not only that, but it starts to blend the viewpoints of the author and the main character together, until they're impossible to separate. Does ShayneT believe a person should be armed to the teeth at all times, ready to kill at any moment? /I don't know/, because he didn't do a good enough job at making it clear whether he or Taylor believed that. It certainly wasn't the opinion of Taylor at any point in /Worm/ canon.
