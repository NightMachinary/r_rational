  Worm makes it pretty clear that Taylor is in the wrong, even if you don't know how.

I think this is overstated by fandom, due to people wanting to signal their sophistication. Strong arguments in defense of Taylor's actions can be made, except the naive initial decision to infiltrate the Undersiders. Even keeping Dinah to fight the end of the world after opposing Coil for kidnapping her would not necessarily have been wrong - the average person who kidnaps children is not suitable as a reliable partner in crime.
