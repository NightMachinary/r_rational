[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-wand-for-skitter.730018/][A Wand for Skitter]] just finished its main story and is quite a good read. Now is the time to read if you were waiting for the coveted COMPLETE tag. Hook to follow:

Waking in the body of a murdered child, Taylor Hebert, once a super villain and later a super hero must discover who has been killing muggleborns while being forced to go to Hogwarts, among groups who are the most likely suspects.
