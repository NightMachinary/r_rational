I'm going to vote against this and say that it's explicitly irrational.

1. The wizarding population doesn't notice an assload of people getting killed/dissapeared by death eaters

2. Death eaters are ludicrously competent. When a death eater wants to kill a wizard, they win, no consequences or complications or discovery, unless they go up against taylor

3. Death eaters are suicidal. Does it matter that Taylor mows through literally dozens of them? No, they have an infinite supply of death eaters who don't mind getting sent into a suicide mission.

I had to drop it after those three facts kept getting abused, until it became clear that the story wouldn't get better.

The story is ENTIRELY about Hard Taylor making Hard Choices, for The Greater Good, and literally every element is only in there to serve that end.
