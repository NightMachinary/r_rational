Doing conventionally immoral things because you can vaguely construe them as being in service to the greater good is /usually/ not a recipe for good decision making. Taylor isn't an exception to this. Sure, she quickly moves past her "infiltration" phase with the Undersiders, but saving Dinah is a similarly weak justification, mostly made so she can stick around with her friends for longer. Taylor didn't /know/ whether or not she had a better chance of busting Dinah out from within Coil's organization than without. It's an /understandable/ decision, but it's not a good one.

Also, "keeping" Dinah would have been stupid. Nevermind the dubiousness of trying to keep someone who can see the future contained, Dinah was /already working with Taylor/ to steer her towards a future with the best outcome. That's what Dinah's two notes were all about, that's why Dinah outed Taylor to the Protectorate. All that keeping her under Taylor's supervision would have done was limit Dinah's ability to influence the heroes.
