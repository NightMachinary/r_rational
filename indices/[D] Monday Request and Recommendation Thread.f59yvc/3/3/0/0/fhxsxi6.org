While I did read the whole thing as it released; it reads quite a bit like mary sue self insert fiction, and the comments after every story post talking up the main character didn't help that impression. I personally wouldn't recommend it like I would some much better examples of fan fiction, but I can't say I regret reading it. Hopefully the epilogue chapter/s will tie things up better.
