[[https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/the-revival-of-rhomaion-an-age-of-miracles.227279/][The Revivival of Rhomaion]] is an alternate history story where the Byzantine empire survives. It is partially in the form of a timeline of events rather than in first person. I am only a third of the way through but so far it is pretty good.
