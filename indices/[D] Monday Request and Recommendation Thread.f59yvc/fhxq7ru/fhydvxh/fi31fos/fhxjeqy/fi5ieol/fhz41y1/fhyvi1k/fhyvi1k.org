[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22518/chrysalis][Chrysalis]] is a fun non rational litrpg. The story is fun, comfy, with a ton of good progression porn. The basic story person become a monster ant and they try their best!

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z2XRg3dy9k][Last week tonight is back on!]] It feels like a lot of the politcal comedy & satire have gone to shit the last few years but I still really enjoy John Oliver.

Does anyone have suggestions for buddy novels or movies? I want to see best friends doing thing best friends do.
