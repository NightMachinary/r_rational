I've got to say, I loved the final arc, but that final chapter is really shitty. A lot of answers that we didn't really need to hear again, and it feels like a setup for a sequel more than a conclusive ending, which it actually is.

Overall WfS is popcorn fiction and really good at it, so I'd recommend it if that sounds like something you'd like to read. Don't go in looking for something objectively good.
