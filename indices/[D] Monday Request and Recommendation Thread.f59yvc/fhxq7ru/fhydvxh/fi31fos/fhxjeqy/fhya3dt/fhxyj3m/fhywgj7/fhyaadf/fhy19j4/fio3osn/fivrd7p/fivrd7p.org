  Personally, I think it lacks the qualities that made Worm rational, and it lacks the qualities that made Harry Potter fun.

To me, it made up for it by doubling down on the qualities that made Worm fun and doubling down on the qualities that made Harry Potter rational!

- Worm fun: the sheer chutzpah of giving endgame Skitter access to all the best toys of Harry Potter, and seeing how she prepares for the death that's coming for her.
- Harry Potter rationality: filling in the cracks in JK's worldbuilding with rational explanations of exactly how crapsack the vanilla Harry Potter world is, due to the biases and blind spots of wizards and all those they interact with.
