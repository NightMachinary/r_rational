Well, there's also the thing with ShayneT writing what seems to be the most overblown, exaggerated, crack-ish interpretation of Taylor possible, to the point where one of the readers' top theories was that she isn't really Taylor, but Millie Scrivener's juvenile brain (additionally messed-up from torture) with Taylor's memories. Or alternatively, the QA shard emulating Taylor the best it can. AWfS!Taylor /really is/, like, straight-up taken from one of those shitty, boring crackfics that meme about 'escalation' and cartoon villain slash violent hyper-competent mary sue stuff and such. Which /really/ clashes with the seemingly serious plot. This is why I think the readers were rationalizing everything up so much; basically to keep their Suspension of Disbelief intact.
