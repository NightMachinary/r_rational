I think that summary really undersells /A Wand for Skitter/'s biggest strength and weakness. It's /really/ edgy. Perhaps too edgy. It's like a long, three-hundred thousand word version of that one scene from HPMOR where Harry threatens to make shivs from Hufflepuff bones.

If you like a story where nobody is a good person, because everyone is either stupid, violent, or stupidly violent, /A Wand for Skitter/ is fucking amazing. If that sounds like a chore to read through, then it's probably not for you. Personally, I think it lacks the qualities that made /Worm/ rational, and it lacks the qualities that made /Harry Potter/ fun. /Worm/ makes it pretty clear that Taylor is in the wrong, even if you don't know how. /Harry Potter/ makes it clear that things like the Ministry and the Wizarding World are parodies or caricature. If /A Wand for Skitter/ does either of these things, it doesn't seem to be intentional. At the very least, the peanut gallery in Spacebattles doesn't seem to be picking it up.
