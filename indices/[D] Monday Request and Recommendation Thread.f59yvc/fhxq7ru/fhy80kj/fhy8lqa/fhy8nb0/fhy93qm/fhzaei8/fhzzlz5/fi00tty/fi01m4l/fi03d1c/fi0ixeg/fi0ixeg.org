I'm sorry to hear you don't find this discussion interesting, and obviously it's your privilege to stop at any time. I'd ask you though not to move it to PMs - clutter isn't really a thing with how reddit hides threads by default. I see no downside to having it in the open, and it lets anyone else who might open the thread this deep join if interested, however unlikely that might be.

Back on topic:

  If it isn't clear, I am talking exactly about grammar, and what is grammatically correct
#+end_quote

I think grammar is just a tool / convention for carrying meaning. Perfectly grammatical sentences that don't convey your meaning are a mistake; 'ungrammatical' phrases that convey your meaning are not. Whether something is grammatical or not is secondary to whether it is understood in the way you want to.

#+begin_quote
  There is a strictly wrong - an idiom that has no historical meaning, or a corruption of an idiom, where no direct meaning can be read, and meaning must be guessed. My point is that OP's phrasing was not this. There is a history of use of 'pass on' in this way. My honest point is that OP's phrasing is ambiguous; it would have multiple potential readings in isolation, and one of those would be the one intended.
#+end_quote

Even granting that (and I do think that most people would not see the phrase as ambiguous in isolation), if you can say something in either an ambiguous way or an unambiguous way, and you don't intend to be misunderstood, why wouldn't you want to know of and use the unambiguous phrasing?

#+begin_quote
  Beyond that point, I'm not going to touch your strange ideas about objectivity and universal 'default readings' in language.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure where you thought I'm making claims about objectivity/universality.

What I'm trying to say is that the parsing of an ambiguous phrase is going to be biased by what other phrasings are easily thought of for each of the possible meanings. In a situation where one meaning has an immediately obvious unambiguous phrasing, and the other doesn't, I would bet that most people will default to the latter meaning until contradicted by context.
