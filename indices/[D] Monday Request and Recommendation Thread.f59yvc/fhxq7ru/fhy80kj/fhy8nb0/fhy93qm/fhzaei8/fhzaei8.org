Actually, 'pass on' here is a prepositional verb which means you can treat it as a verb such as 'impart.' It's an idiomatic use rather than the use of the verb 'pass' and the adverb 'on.' The confusion is that 'pass on' has three or more idiomatic meanings (refuse, impart, die) and can be further interpreted as a construction of the verb 'pass' and the adverb or proposition 'on,' words that are themselves ambiguous.
