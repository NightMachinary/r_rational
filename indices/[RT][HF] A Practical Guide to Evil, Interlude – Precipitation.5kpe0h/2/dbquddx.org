At the end, I smile at the thought that, perhaps, the most effective thing the sides of Evil could do when Cordelia cobbles together her alliance is just to wait until it falls apart again, /then/ strike.

Like for kings Henry IV and VI (in contrast with V), allies without enemies uniting them turn on each other for profit. Then again, that largely goes for the Evil sides too.
