I would recommend the book 'Trice upon a time' by by James P. Hogan. It's about a scientist that discovers a machine that can sent messages to itself in the past, and all it's ramifications. I loved it.

Also the Orthogonal trilogy by Greg Egan. On an alien planet in an alien universe with slightly different (and extremely detailed) physics some inhabitants try to use a special natural law to save their world. I'm not sure this truly fits the rational frame, but it's definitely about people exploiting the forces of nature to get their way.
