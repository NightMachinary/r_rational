I just finished reading [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XBFD7CB/][Sufficiently Advanced Magic]] which was recommended here a few days ago (great book by the way) and I find myself craving more dungeon crawling books. Something like the dungeon exploration in the [[http://www.goblinscomic.org/][Goblins]] comic would be amazing.

Basically if anyone can recommend a good story where the main character(s) have to travel through deadly puzzle rooms, I would be a very happy reader.

EDIT: I have been trying to find a short NSFW story posted here about two years ago about a dark lord who kidnaps a princess. I barely remember anything about it except this awful, hilarious joke. The dark lord threatens to rape the princess, except this isn't a viable threat because instead of a blushing virgin princess, she's a scandalous princess who loves having sex. It was hilarious and I was curious to reread the story.
