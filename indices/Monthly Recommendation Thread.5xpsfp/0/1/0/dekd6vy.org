No definitely not that. I've spent some time thinking about the time range and it could be anywhere from two to four years ago.

/A Girl Corrupted by the Internet is the Summoned Hero?!/ came out roughly a year ago.

It has similar themes, but a dramatically different writing style and is centered around the dark lord with frequent interactions with his saner henchman.
