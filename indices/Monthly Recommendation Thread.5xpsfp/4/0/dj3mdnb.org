So, I suppose this is gravedigging a bit but I'm trawling through old rec threads looking for things to read and I may as well answer, in case you're still interested.

For anyone else reading: definitely recommend Perilous Waif. Looking forward to further entries in that series.

Regarding Riyria: I don't remember a lot of details about it, but I do remember that the writing got /significantly/ better as the series went on. On the whole, it's still just a fairly generic fantasy series, but it's fairly light, fun, and entertaining. Don't force yourself to read it if you're not feeling it, but it does get better. I also read [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19084955-hollow-world][Hollow World]] by the same author and I'd tentatively recommend it too. Again, nothing earth-shattering, or particularly rational, but I found it reasonably entertaining.

I am surprised that you recommend Michael Manning but don't like Riyria. Perhaps you and I have different tastes, but I tried /The Blacksmith's Son/ by him and it was /terrible./ It's so bad that I won't read anything by that author. So yeah, don't read that book. :)
