I think it has more to do with being effective than being fair. You can't really get to your target demographic by saying something that that'll cause them to dismiss the article immediately. It's a problem I have generally with rational anti-sjw bloggers. The way a few of them write, it's like they're unaware that they're bad at convincing SJWs that things like public humiliation, doxxing, etc are bad. Either that or they're just writing for other anti-SJWs about how awful the SJWs are, which doesn't do anything to fix the problem.
