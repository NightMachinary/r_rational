I can second Schlock Mercenary, though I have trouble figuring out why I like it. In many ways, I think the story puts quantity over quality. A lot of the jokes don't make me laugh, most of the characters are underdeveloped, the plot never explores its interesting ideas as much as I'd like it to, and the story has to keep coming up with contrived reasons for the characters to be typical murderhobos after all that's happened in the setting.

Nearest I can tell, it's the comfort food of webcomics in the same way sitcoms and detective shows are comfort food of tv shows. It rarely achieves true greatness, but it remains consistently "good enough" that it's easy to consume and be entertained. As serialized comedy webcomics go I think [[http://www.sluggy.com/nvg][Sluggy Freelance]] is better (though much less rational), but Schlock Mercenary remains a fun space opera about sociopathic guns for hire that I read every morning.
