If you haven't checked out Brandon Sanderson's work before, you should. Mistborn is my favorite fantasy series and I've yet to read a story of his I didn't like. What I'd like to talk about now, though, are The Alloy of Law books that pull a Legend of Korra by telling a story in the same universe as Mistborn hundreds of years later. You can enjoy them without reading the original series, though the ending of all the books will be completely spoiled so I recommend this mainly for fans of Mistborn.

Where I think The Alloy of Law and its sequels surpass Korra is by changing the genre of the story. Instead of a heroic fantasy about people with incredible power shaping the course of history, these books are fast-paced pulp adventures about a Wild West-style bounty hunter working as a detective in a city inspired by Victorian London. I won't say they're better than Mistborn, but are definitely the most rational take on pulp adventure I've ever seen. Sanderson actually researched sociology and economics to build this world, and one of the main characters is a statistician.

The story is still clearly rooted in the tropes of Victorian-era pulp. There's action, mystery, and romance from the get-go, some horror straight out of a Penny Dreadful, and even Indiana Jones-style adventure later on. I can't say it's better than Mistborn, but it's a lot of fun, especially the action scenes. Wax is like a flying, gun slinging Batman who's kleptomaniac master-of-disguise sidekick Wayne can slow down time, and they never seem overpowered. The power level is actually lower than Mistborn.

There is one one thing these books do better than Mistborn. These books are /funny/. The characters can be downright hysterical, especially Wayne's one-liners and Steris' obsessive need to plan for *every* contingency. These books seriously made me crack up without ever breaking the tone it was going for, and the story is completely grounded and serious even while mixing city politics and conspiracies with superpowered criminals and shapeshifters who work for God. These books are just awesome, go read them.
