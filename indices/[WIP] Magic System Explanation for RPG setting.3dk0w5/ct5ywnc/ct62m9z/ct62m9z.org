The goal is to provide an explanation for what the 'god' is, and what the 'magic' is. That word is usually thrown out as if it's a final explanation, but what do people mean when they say it? In my system, I provide some greater background on what these gods actually are and where they came from. Some of it is still mysterious because it involves a little extrapolation of what we currently know about physics. That's inevitable, since magical effects aren't currently possible within our understanding of the universe.
