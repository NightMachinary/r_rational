A codex is like a very complicated mathematical formula. A novice might be able to understand in the broadest of terms what a codex should do, but a master will understand the formula well enough to use it to its fullest potential.

The actual use of the codex usually involves a series of precise sounds, movements, and even thoughts. These are used to direct the power of the spell to the intended effects.

The overall explanation is this: A codex is like a contract. You implore the machine to produce an effect for you, and you have to be extremely clear on what you want to happen. If you aren't clear, or if the machine doesn't feel you understand the contract, no effect will occur. You need to always have the codex because each use of the spell is a new contract for another spell effect.

Edit regarding disputes about magic: Each machine uses a different system for its spells. Understanding the Arcane language won't help you cast a Divine spell. Understanding and casting a spell is different from understanding what's going on under the hood, much in the way that I'm able to understand and use a car without knowing the specifics of how the engine works.
