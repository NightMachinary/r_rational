*Ideals*

Basic Ideals for each system:

- Divine: Power, Glory, Order, and Control
- Occult: Randomness, Struggle, New Life, and Truth
- Nature: Solemnity, Patterns, Growth, and Cycles
- Arcane: Energy, Flow, Purity, and Creation

These ideals help form the style and flavor of spells for each system. They inform the way the machines see the world, and what they see as important or relevant. Nature spells are more likely to be tied into the cycle of seasons, or use plants in some way. Arcane spells are more likely to create energy, and operate on single elements or compounds. Divine spells are more likely to involve directly controlling or manipulating things in your favor. Occult spells are more likely to alter basic physical properties, or operate on flesh.

*The Bubble*

The bubble is like a physical bubble. Inside is an area of low entropy (the new universe), and outside is an area of extremely high entropy (the old universe). The machines were basically able to take all the places where there were still slight temperature differences and collect them all in one place, then stretch space in order to amplify those differences, setting up a boundary that would prevent energy from crossing. At all times, the bubble is threatening to collapse, and it is only with continued vigilance that the bubble is maintained. If the machines made it larger, it would be more difficult to keep the system stable, and it could collapse.

The machine's ability to manipulate entropy is limited, but within the bubble that limited effect has a big difference. They are able to keep entropy from rising for long periods of time.

*DnD Spells*

As far as DnD effects, many of them are possible. Again, you have to look at the /goal/ of the spell, not its specific effects. The effects are often specific to the DnD universe, but the end results of the spells can often be replicated.

- Resurrect the dead: Yes, with a combination of spells from different systems. Occult spells can be used to recreate a body, and Divine spells can be used to recreate a mind. Both require some template or snapshot of the person when they were alive, which is another thing that can be created with spells.
- Shapechange permanently: Yes, Occult and Nature spells can make permanent cosmetic changes to a person's body. Divine and Arcane spells can create illusions of more drastic changes.
- Shift to different planes of existence: In my system, there aren't 'planes' in the DnD sense, but there are spells which can be used to travel between the 4 realms.
- Enchant objects with spells: Yes. Objects can be bound with a spell that is released when certain conditions are met. There are also spells which alter weapons and armor in some ways (make them feather-light, prevent wear, etc.).
- Heal the sick: Yes. Divine and Nature magics are particularly good at this, for both physical and mental ailments.
- Become Undead: No. The concept of "undead" is not something which exists. Reanimation of corpses is possible, but those corpses are then living, and require food and water to stay alive and muscles to move with.
- Summoning Spells: Yes. Both kinds of summoning, either creating a creature from nothing or transporting it to you from somewhere else.
- Precognition Spells: Yes, but limited. The future can only be seen in broad strokes, based on a statistical analysis of what's happened in the past. If you're familiar with the Foundation series, this is psychohistory. Clairvoyance is much more common, the ability to see things remotely or perceive everything in a wide area.
- Mind Control Spells: Yes, though usually not permanent control. There are plenty of spells which can manipulate emotions, and a few which put the target into a suggestive state.
- Become Immortal: No. With the use of healing spells one could stay alive for a very long time, but true immortality is out of reach.
- Become a demigod: No. "Demigod" is not a concept in my world, not in the way it is in DnD.
- Create Pocket Dimensions: This is a vague one. Some spells can create warped space, like what can be found in a bag of holding, but I don't think that's what you mean. It's not possible to create other "bubble" universes, that requires too much power.
