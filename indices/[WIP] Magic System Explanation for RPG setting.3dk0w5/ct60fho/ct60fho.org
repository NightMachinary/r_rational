I find that the "machines" seem to be identical to actual gods. What exactly is the difference? They can rewrite the laws of the universe and change fundamental constants. That is pretty much the definition of "miracle", so their activity is supernatural. That said, how a civilization managed to make them and how they are changing physical laws is opaque at best.

I think that what you should focus on is making your magical system consistent. Take your four systems. Since they are each intelligent, what are their goals? Are they capable of working with each other and communicating with each other? If their goal was to stop the war, why was that their goal? We basically know nothing at all about their motivations.

Also, what are the limits of these machines? Why don't they simply make the universe bigger? Why don't they split the universe into four universes each with their own realm?

Finally, what sort of effects can the spells produce? If we are speaking of "DnD type magic" does this include the wide variety of effects found in that system or does this just refer to an element of that system? I have even heard that phrase used for a system of elemental magic!
