Functionally, there is no difference. They are certainly seen as gods by many of the people in the new universe, but that's precisely the idea. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic, and the framework I've created shows exactly that. My goal was to expand on the idea of what a 'god' was, to turn it into something that is natural rather than supernatural.

The machines don't have any specific goal that they are working towards. Their original purpose was to halt the heat death of the universe, but they failed to do that. In their current state, their only real stated goals are to just keep the same thing from happening again. However, they do have ideals which they are structured around, which contribute to the flavor and style of the magics they power, as well as the style of the realm they control. It was the inhabitants of the realms that wanted spells to give themselves a survival advantage, and the machines begrudgingly gave them the ability to use some of their power.

As far as limitations, the machines operate by putting a kind of 'pressure' on space-time. This pressure creates various local effects, such as causing virtual particles to become real particles (matter/energy creation), or effecting the quantum interactions of elementary particles (altering properties of matter). The amount of pressure they can exert is limited, because too much will cause damage, like the sudden creation of a black hole. They were only able to create the bubble with a combined effort, none of them is strong enough to do so on their own. Likewise, the bubble is the maximum size that they can maintain.

Spells produce many different effects. I'm using the DnD spells as templates, so basically every single DnD spell effect is possible (excepting ones directly tied into the mechanics of DnD). For every goal you have, there is usually a spell in each system that can reach that goal. If you want to create a fire, there is a spell in each system that can do that (the following are examples which follow the theme of each system):

- Arcane: spell which creates a blast of flame.
- Divine: spell that will increase the temperature of a target volume.
- Occult: spell which lowers the flash point of a given material within a certain radius
- Nature: spell which calls down a bolt of lightning from the sky

There are also interactions between each source. The Divine Realm and the Occult Realm don't get along well, and neither do their magics. Likewise with the Nature Realm and the Arcane Realm. This is mostly due to their conflicting ideals.
