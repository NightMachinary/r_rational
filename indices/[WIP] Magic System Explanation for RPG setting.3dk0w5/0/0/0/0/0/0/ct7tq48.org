Creating more of themselves is not something I thought about before, and is a fair point. I'll have to think about the implications of that. Off the top of my head, I would think that the races who created the machines wouldn't want them to become self-replicating, and would have put reasonable restrictions on their ability to reproduce. This doesn't stop the people in the new universe from eventually learning how to make more, though.

One thing that's already part of the canon is that these machines require an incredible investment of resources to make. The races that created them were Kardeshev Type 3, meaning they had access to all the energy produced by all the stars in a galaxy. It's possible that there simply isn't enough energy left to make another machine, or that building up that much energy would take an incredibly long time with the slow trickle that the machines produce.
