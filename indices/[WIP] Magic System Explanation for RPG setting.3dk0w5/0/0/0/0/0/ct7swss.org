I have a good idea of what spells can do and what those ideals are, but the restriction on the bubble universe is a handwave.

Let me illustrate. The machines can create energy out of nothing. The machines use that energy to negate entropy. The machines have energy left over (for spells). Let's suppose that the machines can only create a limited amount of energy per unit of time. That is fine. Suppose further that maintaining the stability of the bubble requires most of that energy. Also fine. So why don't the machines use some of their excess energy to make more of themselves? They can insure that the new machines have the same values as they do, add extra energy to world and thereby increase the size of the bubble. If the machines do not know how, then they can simply research the matter until they do know how. Apart from a handwave, why don't they try this?
