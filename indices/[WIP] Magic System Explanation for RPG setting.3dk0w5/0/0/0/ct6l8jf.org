They may not currently have goals, but if they have "ideals", then what are they? If the difference between the four is to be explained, then these ideals will have to be involved.

You say that the bubble is the maximum size that they can maintain. But that is currently. Since they can violate the laws of thermodynamics, there is no reason they cannot increase the size of bubble over time. I suppose that you could just handwave that problem, but that would conflict with your goal to explain the magic. If you cannot increase the size of the bubble, then violating thermodynamics means that the bubble will slowly reach radiant temperatures everywhere. If the bubble increases in size, then this is no longer a problem.

Creating fire was not the intent of my question. DnD spells can resurrect the dead, shapechange permanently, shift to different planes of existence, enchant objects with spells, heal the sick, become undead, etc. There are also summoning spells, precognition spells, mind control spells and there are ways to become immortal, to become a demigod and to create pocket dimensions. I really doubt that your system can allow for all of these effects.
