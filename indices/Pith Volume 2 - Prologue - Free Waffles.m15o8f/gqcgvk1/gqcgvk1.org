Oof, that depiction of depression is painfully real. I'm gonna choose to focus on all the interesting hints that got dropped in this chapter instead of that so I don't make myself sad.

  “Not everyone in Paragon,” the man said. “But more than you think. And a good chunk in the field, or in deep cover. The woman who invited us here is in on it too, Scholars know why. She's a complete book-burning idiot. I can't say more than that, not at your current level. Most people, even Guardians, aren't ready to know what we know.”

  Andrew's palm grew sweaty beneath his platter. The party faded out in the background. The spectacular view of Elmidde turned to a blur.

  “That's what the Lavender Book's for,” the woman said.

Considering how well known the Lavender Book is by the time of Volume 1 (which is 9 years after this chapter, I believe), Egress has some serious influence over Paragon despite how limited this guy says their numbers are. Either they've grown quite a bit in the intervening time, their few members are extremely well placed, the people who guard the Lavender Book with their lives can't actually read it and have never tried, or some combination of those things.

Regardless, I like the implications. It's funny to me that there's a secret conspiracy controlling the wizards that were secretly controlling the world a year ago.

  Theories or no, everyone knew the implications of this. /This world is a cage./ Locked in from above, by whatever had made the stars vanish, and locked in from below, by the force that made the seas rise.

All right, this is creepy as fuck. The ocean being freaky if you went too deep was one thing, we already knew about that, but the same thing happening if you fly too high? That's extremely disconcerting and recontextualizes the ocean weirdness. It makes the whole world feel like a giant ant farm or something.

#+begin_quote
  /What they're planning for this world./ It defied logic, sanity, everything about this universe that Andrew took for granted.

  Andrew had grown up with Cao Hui's rise to power. He'd seen his share of utopian fanatics, driven by mad ambition. And the hatred. So much hatred.

  This conspiracy was full of /love./ And he'd only caught a sliver of their machinations.

This is /also/ creepy as fuck and really makes me want to learn more about this conspiracy. The fact that their plans provoke such a visceral reaction from Andrew yet he describes them as full of love is both very intriguing and extremely worrying.

  “My name is Andrew Huang,” he said. “I can see through the Spirit Block. And I think I can help you.”

So Andrew has spent the past decade with the Shenti trying to help them fight Egress. I wonder if that's why the Shenti were willing to back Commonplace and why the Black Tortoise is making a comeback. Before I'd assumed it was just nationalism and revenge, but now... well, I suspect we'll get answers soon given we already had signs Shenten would get some attention this Volume. I'll be interested to see what Andrew looks like in the modern day.
