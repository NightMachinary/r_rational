  Oof, that depiction of depression is painfully real.

The author's depiction of mental issues in general is stellar, to the point that I feel for them.

As are their depictions of other real-life issues. Not that I'm that well read, but it's the most realistically gray world I've encountered in fiction yet.

In general, Pith is the first webfiction that made me think "Who hurt you, author?". It's just... so incredibly bleak, and so hard to deny.
