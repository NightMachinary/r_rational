  Considering how well known the Lavender Book is by the time of Volume 1 (which is 9 years after this chapter, I believe), Egress has some serious influence over Paragon despite how limited this guy says their numbers are. Either they've grown quite a bit in the intervening time, their few members are extremely well placed, the people who guard the Lavender Book with their lives can't actually read it and have never tried, or some combination of those things.

A bit late to the party, but I don't think it's any of these things.

The Lavender book is "known" is that people know that it exists and has secrets, but the average Guardian thinks it's just a bunch of super-powerful magic techniques that are too dangerous to put into the wrong hands.

Even it being unreadable can plausibly be explained as another tool to protect state secrets. The fact that it has a more specific, conspiracy-related nature isn't obvious from the outside.
