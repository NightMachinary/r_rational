It's awesome. But. Is it so hard to understand how to punctuate speech in English? Surely people notice that you do this:

"Bla bla bla," said Foo.

Instead of:

"Bla bla bla." said Foo.

It's not like it's some of obscure punctuation rule; you see it all the time in books, in every dialogue ever, almost.
