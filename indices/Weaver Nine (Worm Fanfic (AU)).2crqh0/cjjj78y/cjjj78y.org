Read it. Liked it. Though I did feel (like in Worm proper) that I liked the [[#s][]] parts better than the [[#s][]] parts. Worm always felt a little too grimdark for my personal preferences, and a lot of the fanfic seems to carry that over (sometimes amplifying it). That said, the fact that it's well-written helps a lot.
