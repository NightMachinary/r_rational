  Much as I love my lgbt characters, the werewolf laywer story sounds so fascinating.

Feel I should also address this: if you read the sample, the "mysterious visitor" Fiona gets is a demon who'd be the other main character, and because demon sexuality is complicated, he's intersex and pansexual. Fiona herself is on the aro spectrum!

Rest assured that whatever I write, it's bound to have LGBT representation up the wazoo (like I couldn't even resist making Kristy queer in the BSC fanfic, though that's a pretty popular headcanon...)
