So, now my coauthor's pulled out of Vampire Flower Language^{1} , and my semester is almost over, I'm thinking about writing projects I could do in my soon to be abundant free time.

Here they are roughly the order of how 'developed' the ideas are, and a drabbley sample:

- Urban Fantasy: Fiona's werewolf story - I have a full plot sort of sketched out, I estimate it at around 30-40k words, kind of about morality, ambition, that sort of thing. However will take a lot of work to determine if the main character - "A Lawyer for the Underworld" - is a concept that makes sense, and what exactly a lawyer for the underworld would /do/. [[/r/legaladviceofftopic]] might be the people to ask. [[https://pastebin.com/dXdi5fVD][Sample]]

- Babysitter's Club Fanfic: The Babysitter's Startup - If I were to publish this, it'd have very little in the way of plot and maybe 3 or 4 chapters. It'd be low effort sort of "fun romp" for BSC fans who are also in the rationalist sphere. [[https://pastebin.com/7jeQVhxY][Sample]]

- Urban Fantasy: Zach's werewolf story - I have a character in mind and I know his personality well, but I haven't really thought of a plot line for him. From my sample, I feel like he's probably going to put his nose somewhere it doesn't belong with predictable consequences. [[https://pastebin.com/wFf8Wt1k][Sample]]

And I suppose for completeness I should add the following:

- Urban Fantasy, Historical: Vampire Flower Language - Just fuckin suck it up and finish it without my coauthor (which she encouraged me to do). I am very much scared of this as her edits give the characters souls and life - passages that beta readers pointed out as being particularly evocative came from her. Some 90k words are written and just need editing (with one major plot element needing to be significantly massaged in a way I am not /at all/ confident I can do without my coauthor). It's a gay romance story. On one hand, I really don't want to publish something that's not my best work. On the other hand, letting decent / good work go unpublished also sucks. I'm struggling here.

^{1} However, she did indicate she's changed her mind and she actually /is/ up for editing and refining some 90,000 words of prose, but I told her that one week is not enough time for me to trust that she has genuinely changed her mind, so who knows, it might all work out?
