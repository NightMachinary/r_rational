I don't know why but anything about superheroes causes my eyes to glaze over (which is stupid because I love urban fantasy and a vampire is really just a supervillain and a vampire hunter the superhero counterpart...) - they look like great resources though. I wonder how much that applies to Australian law, though.

I probably miss-pitched the lawyer story, though: it's going to have very little actual law and more Fiona coming to terms with the fact that her youthful dream of helping supernatural creatures be able to live normal, productive lives involves her having to help creatures that literally hunt humans down to drink their blood, and whether she's OK with that or not. So it'll be more a "human versus herself/human versus society" story than a "let's follow the journey of a supernatural creature who has to navigate the legal system". Not sure if that makes the story better or worse - but it means I have to learn a hell of a lot less law, which is always a good thing!
