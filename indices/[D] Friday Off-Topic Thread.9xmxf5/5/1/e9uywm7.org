Might be best to take a break from the vampire story just for a while, and then come back to it once you have had the chance to get the creative juices flowing. To paraphrase a favourite author, you've got to keep on writing even when things seem bleak.

Much as I love my lgbt characters, the werewolf laywer story sounds so fascinating. You could explore so many supernatural creatures, taking the story in so many directions. Hashing out details of a pacts and bargains.. Issues that can crop up from conflict between immortals and mortals. Tribal conflicts, seances.. This is the perfect chance to do a deconstruction of fantasy tropes ala Discworld.
