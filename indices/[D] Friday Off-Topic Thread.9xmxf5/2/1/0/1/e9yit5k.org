Well the obvious explanation would be whales, that Wandering Inn managed to attract a handful of super patrons who give hundreds or even thousands each, but on closer inspection that doesn't really hold up. pirateaba's current patreon lists 1000 patrons at the $5 tier, which basically accounts for almost all of the total.

I would guess it is related to 2 factors: first, chapters are released behind a paywall, so you can get early access to new chapters for just a few dollars. Some other authors also do this, but Wildbow and erraticerrata do not. Secondly, some of it is probably just getting your money's worth. pirateaba writes at an astounding rate, with each chapter probably in the region of 15'000 to 30'000 words. They blow every other writer away in terms of sheer amount of story they can produce. I'd imagine that makes it easier for potential contributors to justify it to themselves
