I personally think it's some of Wildbow's best work, but I'm not the average Wildbow audience.

It's easily the most balanced; there's little filler, the story arcs don't last overlong (the longest ones are two "books" long, unlike Worm's S9 arcs), but nothing feels too rushed and the timeskips aren't too jarring.

Otherwise, I think it's well-written, but it's a very specific kind of appeal. It's very cerebral and psychological, characters spend a lot of time worrying about social dynamics and emotional balance and stuff like making sure that nobody is left behind. The common simile in the fanbase when the story started over was that, where Taylor was a warlord, Victoria is a social worker at heart.

As for all Wildbow stories, I recommend taking it slow-like. Read it one or two Arcs at a time, try to read the matching reddit threads every so often, especially if you feel like there's something in the last chapter you didn't understand.
