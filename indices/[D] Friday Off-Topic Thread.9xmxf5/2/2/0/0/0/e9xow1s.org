  the story arcs don't last overlong (the longest ones are two "books" long, unlike Worm's S9 arcs)

I don't think that it's a problem, but this is objectively wrong. Ward's arcs are longer than Worm's. I don't know how long you're remembering the S9 arcs as being, exactly, but the longest of them was 83,401 words long. The longest arc in Worm period was 91,947 words long. The longest arc in Ward /so far/ was 139,878 words long.
