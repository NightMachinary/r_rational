  Although now I'm wondering how the Wandering Inn is earning so much Patreon money.

The author of Wandering Inn is the only one on the list to allow readers to read a chapter early if they donate. All of the other works mentioned just use Patreon for donations and don't provide any early chapters to read, previews, or any reward at all.
