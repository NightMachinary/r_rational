I binged it over the past week. As I started I was very worried that the points system was going to be played straight, and realizing that the writers know exactly how awful it is has been a relief.

It's been slow rolled, but you can't exactly open with "anyone who would create a hell has to be indifferent towards human suffering at best". Michael's journey from not questioning the system and his role in it to where he is now has been fantastic to watch.

I'm also a complete sucker for moments of kindness and self-sacrifice, so man there have been some great scenes in this show.
