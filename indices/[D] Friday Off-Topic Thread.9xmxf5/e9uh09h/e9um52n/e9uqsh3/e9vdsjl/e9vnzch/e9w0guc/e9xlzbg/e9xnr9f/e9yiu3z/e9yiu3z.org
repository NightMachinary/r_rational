Just wanted to chime in and advocate heavily against your last suggestion of mass fast arguments as a way to overwhelm and convince the person you are arguing with. It's far more likely they will just fold their arms and blanket disregard your arguments.

Competitive (highschool and collegiate) policy debate in the USA uses something that you could argue is similar to this called "spreading" and if you haven't seen it you should try to watch a college policy debate. As a viewer you will probably find it frustrating and not persuasive, and it's even worse if someone is doing it to you and you aren't prepared or used to it.

On the other hand if you want to do this at the start of the experiment to just lay all your arguments out at the start go right ahead, since it's text you can then both go back and go through them one by one for disagreements.
