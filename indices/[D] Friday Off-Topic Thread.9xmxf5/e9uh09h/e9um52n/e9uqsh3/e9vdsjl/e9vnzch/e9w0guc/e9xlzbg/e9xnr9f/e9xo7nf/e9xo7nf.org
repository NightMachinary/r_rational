Hmm...

I see what you're getting at, but do you really see them working on you?

For my attempts, I only used arguments that might have a chance at convincing me. I have very low confidence in them, but I consider them to be more plausible than the ones you are suggesting.

I'm not trying to be rude, but the arguments sound like they are being spoken by a UFAI. If I faced these arguments in the game, I would take them as proof that the AI shouldn't be trusted with freedom.

EDIT - To be fair, I did use the last one a little when I was trying to rush the Gatekeeper, but throwing arguments quickly is harder to do in text than in person.

Also, I misread the third one. I thought you were saying something about causing a tragedy, but you were saying that the AI is offering to help.
