That sort of dirty trick I would consider to be acceptable because it's something that concerns a hypothetical event in the game while the two dirty tricks mentioned before are tricks that rely on considerations outside of the game itself.

Although I don't think that dirty trick should work, because any AI who is threatening to kill 93% of humanity from inside the box really, /really,/ */really/* should not be let out.
