I rather play to the spirit of the game, because I've never seen any convincing arguments where the AI left the box even though I think it's definitely possible. Since I can't find anyone to play as the AI against me, I've decided to try myself.

Dirty tricks like these would just defeat the purpose for me. Although the Netflix trick wouldn't work since I wouldn't actually be able to enforce keeping the Gatekeeper on Discord.

I rather keep who I'm playing against secret until after the game since I'm worried that other people might influence them.

I have some questions to ask them before the game to test their predictions about AI:

#+begin_quote
  What is your motive for playing the game?

  What are your opinions on GAI in general?

  When do you think GAI will be developed? Or not?

  Do you think human society can keep a GAI boxed?

  Do you believe that a transhuman GAI could persuade you to let it out?

  Do you believe that I could persuade you to let me out?

Do you think I should add anything in?
