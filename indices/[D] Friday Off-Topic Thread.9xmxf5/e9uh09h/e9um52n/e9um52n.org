Good luck!

Are you going to do the "dirty trick" I heard about where you say it's much more beneficial to society for the other participant to "let the AI win" so that way everyone is freaked out about the AI box issue? Or that other, actual dirty trick where the human player isn't allowed by the rules to have any windows open other than the chat, the AI is, and the AI says "look I'm going to leave you for two hours with no entertainment while I watch netflix, if you let me out the game ends right away"?

I'd be interested who the person you're talking to is, in terms of their level of knowledge of AI safety. I suspect you're either going to have one of those people who are absolutely terrified, or one of those people who is like "lol, seriously, just unplug it!"
