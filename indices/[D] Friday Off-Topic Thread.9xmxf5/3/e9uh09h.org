Just letting people know that I'll be playing as the AI in the AI Box Experiment over the weekend!

I have a working computer and my boss isn't asking me to work over the weekend this time!!!

Does anyone want to have me ask any questions to the unknown Gatekeeper to judge their convictions before and after the game?
