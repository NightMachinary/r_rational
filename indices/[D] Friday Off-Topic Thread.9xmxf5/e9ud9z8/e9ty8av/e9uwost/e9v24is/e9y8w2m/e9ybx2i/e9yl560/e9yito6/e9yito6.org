  There are some ratings which confuse me though. Metaworld Chronicles currently hovers around the top 3 positions, having sprung up seemingly from nowhere.

I see Metaworld mentioned a lot more often in various other websites than the others you've mentioned. I think Metaworld's popularity is partly due to the author (or a reader) posting about it on a lot of recommendation sites. This is a work where someone went to the effort of putting out word of its existence, while the other works you mentioned took longer to spread word.
