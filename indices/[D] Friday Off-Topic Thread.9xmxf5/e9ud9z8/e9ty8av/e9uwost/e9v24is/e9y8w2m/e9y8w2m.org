I expect it is party a winner take all effect; PGtE doesn't need to be 5 times as good as anything else to get 5 times the votes, it just needs to be a little better to hoover up a huge amount of extra readers.

​

That being said, having read a lot of web serials and seen a lot of ratings, I'd say that mostly it comes down to the fact that topwebfiction is only a midly accurate guide to both quality and popularity. Take another guide to serials, Patreon amounts. One could presume that the more money paid to an author, the "better" their work. Wildbow earns almost 5 times as much as erraticerrata does from patreon. Now obviously Patreon is not that useful either; Wildbow clearly earns a lot from long time readers of Worm or Pact or Twig, not just his current work. But what about a closer comparison? pirateaba of The Wandering Inn actually makes even more than Wildbow, yet Wandering Inn has never cracked the top 3 on TWF. A simple reason for this occurs if you actually look at the comments to the stories; the top comment on almost every PGtE post is a plea for votes. On Wandering Inn? The author tends to leave a comment, and a typo comment, before any else. It's much easier for PGtE readers to remember to vote for their story than someone who reads Wandering Inn, even though numbers could well be greater for the latter.

​

There are some ratings which confuse me though. Metaworld Chronicles currently hovers around the top 3 positions, having sprung up seemingly from nowhere. I started reading it after seeing it so high in fact, but the story is largely shlock. It's enjoyable shlock, but shlock nonetheless. What's odd about this one is that it doesn't have a big push for votes in the comments, and using another rating system - the overall RoyalRoad rating - it actually does considerably worse, struggling to break the first page. Meanwhile, number 1 on RR is Everybody Loves Large Chests, a title that hovers around the top 10 on TWF.

Kind of went off on a tengent there but I just find this interesting for some reason
