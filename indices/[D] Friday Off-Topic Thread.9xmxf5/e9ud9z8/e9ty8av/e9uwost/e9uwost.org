Hey, does anyone know how on topwebfiction Practical Guide to Evil has so many votes? I haven't followed it for the past few months since the end of the arc with heiress having the flying demon city thing but now it's just crushing all the competition, even wildblow. And it's consistent too, it's been like this for a while. Did it suddenly get 5x better than everything else, someone really famous recommend it, what happened?
