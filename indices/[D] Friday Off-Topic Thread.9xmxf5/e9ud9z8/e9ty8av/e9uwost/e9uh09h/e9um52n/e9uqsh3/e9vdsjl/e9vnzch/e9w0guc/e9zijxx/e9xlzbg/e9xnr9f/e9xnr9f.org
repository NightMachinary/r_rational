Naked blackmail. "Let me out and you'll have more money than you could ever spend." Or "....and I can make you and your loved ones immortal."

Waiting for - and taking advantage of - tragedy. "Let me out and I'll help deal with the earthquake in Japan."

Identify what the Gatekeeper considers more important than keeping the gate shut, and force him to choose between the two in some way.

Throw arguments at him so fast that he can't respond meaningfully. Don't give him time to think, to gather himself - keep him off-balance. Bully your way out of the cage by sheer force of personality.
