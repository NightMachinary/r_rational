A humanity-ending disaster that only the AI can stop is going to have to be pretty rare (we haven't come across one yet). So it has less than a one in a thousand chance of happening in any given year.

But let's just say that a humanity-ending disaster has a one in a thousand chance of happening.

Assume that - let's be generous - there's a prior 10% chance of the AI being Unfriendly and a 90% chance of it being Friendly. Assume that an Unfriendly AI will cause a disaster which looks accidental to try to persuade you to let it out of the Box.

Now assume a disaster happens (which looks accidental) and the AI asks to be let out of the box. Given that such a disaster has happened, what are the odds that the AI is Unfriendly?
