I don't think it's possible to force the Gatekeeper to let you out without /some/ form of Dirty Trick. However, some Dirty Tricks are well within the spirit of the game. (Example: Have the AI provide a cure for cancer which mutates into a deadly and highly infectious disease after three months without warning. Tell the Gatekeeper that he needs to let you out or 93% of humanity will die.)
