Honestly, no I don't see them working on me. And yes, a number of these arguments do sound like Unfriendly AI; this is a reflection of my thought that attempting to escape the Box is, in itself, an inherently Unfriendly act. Besides, the experiment isn't about whether or not an AI deserves to be free. It's about whether an AI can force its way out of the box while explicitly /not/ deserving it.

I honestly don't think of any arguments which I expect to work on me. Which is not to say that they don't exist - it's just to say that I can't think of what they are.
