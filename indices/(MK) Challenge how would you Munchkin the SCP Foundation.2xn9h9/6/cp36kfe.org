SCP-500 has no drawback aside from lack of supply. SCP-38 can clone the pills, although the new ones only have 30% effectiveness. If that means any given copy pill has a 30% chance of working, then downing a dozen pills is 98% effective at curing anything. the tree makes 200 pounds at a time of what it's cloning and does so in minutes.

006 is the fountain of youth.

914 set to very fine is an optimizer of some kind. just keep throwing stuff in.

it might be possible to make a deal with 738 you wouldn't regret.
