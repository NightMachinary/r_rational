SCP-verse is too chaotic. Simply can't be done as written.

[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-231][Unspeakable rituals stave off the apocalypse]]. Seriously, don't click that. Try [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1348][this one instead]]. Those were just the first two I came up with. There is [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/ritual#pages][an entire category]] for that shit. [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-093][Every power is double-edged]] or it wouldn't be allowed on the site.

Anyone trying to cook some exploit up /now/ is up against almost a decade of thousands of nerds arguing. Low hanging fruit is already vaporized, and there are entries that actually sweep the problem space. Entires exist defining out things like immortality and ascension paths by having [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-349][direct blocks to any immortals]] and things that [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-076][hunt and kill anyone who gets too powerful]]...plus organizations like the SCP Foundation itself. Also, there are certain parts of future history /almost completely/ set in stone that don't include your munchkining.

To top it off, the SCP Foundation is not stupid. That's sort of their thing, in fact. How to /successfully/ contain the items. If there was an easy out, some way to give even a single person an advantage over the onslaught of chaos, it wouldn't have been allowed in the communal fiction space. [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-682][There are problems in that 'verse that are almost /definitionally/ unsolvable by using SCPs]]. Things you'd have to solve, definitionally, without SCPs.

In fact, according to some entries, the SCP Foundation has lost several times because of various things like when [DATA EXPUNGED]. Despite their huge store of artifacts, [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2000][this still resulted in the destruction of the entire human species]]. Several times. And the Earth. And the universe. Multiple times. Find more entries like that yourself. I'm worn out linking. Just remember, [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-152][it is implied that those problems haven't gone away]], just stalled for a bit. It takes a Foundation to solve* these issues because they're too big for one person to juggle fast enough to avoid /losing/. Almost instantly. And badly. Like SCP Foundation's [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/groups-of-interest][more mundane Earthly foes]] do over and over again.
