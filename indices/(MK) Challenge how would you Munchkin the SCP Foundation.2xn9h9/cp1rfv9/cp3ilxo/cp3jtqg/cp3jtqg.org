Absolutely not. At least, not that I know of. They are also HIGHLY internally hyperlinked and use a lot of HTML tricks for presentation. Sorry.

I would suggest, however, following links to other SCPs when you find an interesting one, as those will usually be of high quality and similar focus. 682 and 076 are classics and a good place to work from, in my opinion.

If you want to make sure not to miss one, simply read them in numerical order (possibly while also following the links). Most of the first <1000 are older than the later 1000-3000 series, and thus mostly a lot better.

There are also some story fics that link off of the entries, but those are usually written for people who already know a lot about the 'verse. Still, read them. They're all by people with good entries in already completed.
