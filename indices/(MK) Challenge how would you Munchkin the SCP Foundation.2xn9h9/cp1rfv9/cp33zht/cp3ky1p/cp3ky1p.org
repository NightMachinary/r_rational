You have a point. I was extrapolating a little. Let me explain my reasons for choosing this above, say, [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-096][SCP-096]], which has a 100% kill record once triggered.

SCP-076 is used at various times by the SCP Foundation to hunt high-level threats (see [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-076-2][MOBILE TASK FORCE OMEGA-7]]). He wakes up to fight at unpredictable and unstoppable times and no one knows why he activates when he does, but his behavior is suggestive.

When he does awaken after being destroyed, he kills anyone he sees. Most of the time. What is known is that he hates and despises human beings in general -- specifically, for being weak and cowardly. His only pleasure is fighting the strongest possible opponents in hopes that it'll be a good fight. A rising demigod is the sort of thing Able is thematically designed for.

Remember, SCPs are presented from an already contained perspective most of the time. What was Able "for" before capture, if he was in fact simply a Biblical killing machine? As the Foundation naming suggests, I hold he is a Sumerian weapon of last resort. It's just that the control device is missing, so he isn't aimable the way he was designed, but he still has related goals and personal objectives.
