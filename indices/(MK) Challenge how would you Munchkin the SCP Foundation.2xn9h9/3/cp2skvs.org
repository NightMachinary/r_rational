The SCP universe isn't coherent enough to munchkin. Too much stuff changes from one article to the next.

Sometimes the Foundation casually sacrifices thousands of D-class to one of their charges, or mindwipes entire continents. Sometimes they're a tiny, overworked facility that employs a few hundred people. Some SCPs are contained with advanced technology that ought to cost trillions if the Foundation actually paid for them. Others are just kept in a room with a locked door and no cameras, even though lives are at stake. Some things have been stable for decades or centuries, while others are constantly days from a containment breach that just... never... happens.

The simple fact is that most of the writers haven't read the entire archive, or even the majority of it. There's no Universe Bible, nothing that is universally accepted about the Foundation, so writers pretty much have free rein to make up background details and not worry about contradicting each other. In fact, such contradictions would be obvious if SCP articles referred to each other, which is why "crosstesting" is forbidden.

The only way to read it that makes sense is for the Foundation to be set in a multiverse. We're reading articles collected from different versions of the Foundation, with no rhyme or reason to the numbering scheme. It's not that strange an idea, considering the sheer number of parallel universes and alternate timelines that are mentioned. Some SCPs will be shared among them - 628, in-universe, is explicitly immune to being erased from history, so it will persist across timeline resets. (Out-of-universe, 628 is one of the oldest and most well-established SCPs, so it predates the "no crosstesting" rule, and also it's funny to test every new supernatural weapon on it.)

And since there's no knowledge of which SCPs belong to which universe, nor of how these universes connect to each other, it's hard to say what we'll have available to munchkin.

In short, there is insufficient data for a meaningful answer.
