I'd argue against the "not fun anymore" bit, so long as you restrain it to either a) real life, where it's indistinguishable from creative problem solving, b) musing and concepts such as this thread, where it's indistinguishable from ...creative... problem solving, and c) settings where the antagonists are munchkins too or have power scaled to munchkin'd capabilities.
