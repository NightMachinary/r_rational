After being fired into the Sun, a coronal mass ejection (CME) event of unprecidented size was triggered by unknown devices left on Dr. [[/u/gregx1000]]'s person or otherwise integrated into his body. (See Appendix A, SCPs found missing from Site-[REDACTED] as of an emergency inventory ordered following the event.)

Effects on the planet were minimized due to Project-[REDACTED], but the side of the Earth facing the Sun was still struck by sizable molten fragments from the deorbiting [REDACTED]. This resulted in over [[#s][]] casualties, mainly centered around the cities of [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED]. This also resulted in damage to Site-[REDACTED], global ash clouds, [DATA EXPUNGED], extensive international political fallout, and days of food riots around the world. (See Appendix B, U.N. Global Damage Report, Vols. 1-7.)

Dr. [[/u/xamueljones]] and all other responsible personnel permanently demoted to Class D and reassigned to Keiter duty.
