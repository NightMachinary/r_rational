This is a great summary of the problem space, and the reason as far as I can figure the best approach is not to do any of those things, but to create in isolation as much utility as possible in finite time and finite space.

My best idea for how to do this is to somehow create a Zeno hypercomputer or similar object that can preform infinite computation, then upload a seed for a civilization and do a variant of a Permutation City style launch.

Exactly how to do this is tricky, but I'd start by messing around with/examining [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-914][SCP-914]] (the most powerful and usefull SCP by far), [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-079][SCP-079]] (just change the utility function, somehow), [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-119][SCP-119]] (to put everything into once done and started up), [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-117]] , [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-155]] (Somone already did this! Also explains the concept. Sadly, it's not sufficient for my purposes, but it's worth examining), [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-158]] (might be of help for uploading?), [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-191]] (Worth asking her for help with some things, if she's cooperative), [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-291]] (to extract brains, useful for later uploading maybe?),
