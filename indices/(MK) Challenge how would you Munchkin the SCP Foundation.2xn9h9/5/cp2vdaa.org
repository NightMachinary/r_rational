The moment I realized I was in SCP-world, I'd kill myself and hope I respawned in a better universe. Only winning move in that one is not to play. Honestly: the SCP itself seems to be the best possible attempt to successfully deal with the horror inherent to that world, and few if any of its members retain their sanity, let alone have anything resembling happiness.
