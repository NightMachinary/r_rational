I'd work for SCP in a heartbeat. They're competence pornography. They have literally hundreds of world-ending threats and they show up and contain them immediately and the world goes on spinning and... I just can't imagine. Our own world would be destroyed by the third artifact found. If I could get in touch with SCP I'd just lay out the whole problem directly and the O5s would get together and figure out how to solve it and if I needed a small research base they'd just give me one and just... ugh.
