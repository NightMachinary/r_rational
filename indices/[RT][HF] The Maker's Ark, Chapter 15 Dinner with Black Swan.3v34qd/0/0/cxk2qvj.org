I was having trouble placing Egomag, and kept coming up with Vice or Vanity or something that wasn't the caliber of the other targets.

  Everyone was looking at Sam now. She'd thought DASI had been talking about blue sky ideas for a long term future.

  “Um. How soon did you want to start?”

  “Tomorrow,” said DASI.

  Black Swan smiled and looked at Sam. "So do you want to do some good in the world, and help me get rid of some harmful AIs in the process? I have a little list.“

  "Uh, who is on it?”

  “Quintillion, Egomag, Pomegranate, Nile, Minicode, WBM, FT&T, Pursuit Brooklyn, Silverman Bags, Bank of US, Countrigroup, Springs Bismark, Passport, Kingcard, and US Express are a few names you might recognize.”

I'm surprised that DASI's list doesn't have any non-US-based companies. Were they all eliminated previously, or do their names just translate poorly? HSBC would be a nightmare, I'd think, unless Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation could be plausibly named the Shanghai and Hongkong Banking Corporation.
