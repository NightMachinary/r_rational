You can do all that on the web too.

Last year I reimplemented KS in Javascript minus the visuals, complete with music and sound playing, a savefile system, progress tracking, etc. And it's all client side so you can run it from files if you want. I didn't implement scrolling back to previous lines, but that's because it didn't seem necessary and complicates the engine, not because it's impossible.
