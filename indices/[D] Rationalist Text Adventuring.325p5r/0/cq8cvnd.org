Just in case anyone gets confused:

Twine and Inklewriter are both great tools for branching & non-linear storytelling, like Choose Your Own Adventures, or the broader genre of "gamebooks".

To many, "Text Adventure" refers to the genre of games such as Zork and Colossal Cave Adventure. ("You are standing in a long hall. Exits are north, south, and Dennis.") These days it's also often called "Interactive Fiction", as such games are more story-focused than their precursors. If you're looking to make games of that sort, "Inform" is a popular engine.
