Congrats on your house. I see you have finally run out of storage room for ideas, and must upsize in order to keep them all organized.

I don't think anyone's pointed that out yet, but I wanted to compliment you on the comparison of the Visser and Jake when it came to the idea of self-sacrifice. The Visser looks at Telor's self-destruction and goes 'Why? That is illogical, but I must prepare for that kind of betrayal in the future'. Jake looks at the Marclones and goes 'Why? ...it's their choice, and I must prepare for that kind of loss in the future'.

I know I mentioned it in a thread or two ago, but I really do think the Visser could use some empathy. His choice to isolate himself and only listen to himself (completely going against his nature as a Yeerk) is slowly building up to bite him in the behind.
