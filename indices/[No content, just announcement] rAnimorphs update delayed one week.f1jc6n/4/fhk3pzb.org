Not directly related to the prompt, but I've been rereading, and while pretty much everyone has an internal Marco, I've noticed that Rachel's internal Marco seems a lot chattier than other people's internal Marcos. Like, a LOT more. And that her internal Marco manages to be more coherent and focused than she herself is, when she's dying at the hands of Visser Three. And then I noticed that she mentioned noticing herself echoing the thoughts of certain people post-mesa, which I was previously writing off as natural after you run around in someone else's mind. And /then/ I considered the thing that was happening the last time we saw her, where she was downloading from her future self, and I'm wondering now if she wasn't getting more out of morphing than she should have been, even before her death.

Or maybe not precisely that. Maybe there's some other connection between those things, or maybe I've misread entirely. Don't want to speculate too much when we still don't know what exactly happened to Rachel at the end of that most recent POV chapter. But everyone else was at the Mesa, too, and it seems like the others do a lot less of the Marco thing on net. And Jake morphed into Cassie some insane number of times, waking her up every single time, but it seems like he only ever flashes back to the things she specifically said or did, rather than thinking in direct lockstep with her, or conjuring up a Cassie tulpa.

Conclusions: I dunno! None, as yet. Just something I've been thinking about.
