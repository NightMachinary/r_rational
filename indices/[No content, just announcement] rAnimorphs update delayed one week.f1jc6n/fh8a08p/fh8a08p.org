Hopefully the first thing they do is have Temrash crawl into Rachel and try to repair the damage. Or at least, someone can morph her, turn her consciousness on, and relay her part of the conversation via thought-speak. Maybe Temrash (or Maninho, if he and Tobias get back to the others before the cradle does) can make sense of Rachel's morph visions. I think it's odd that Temrash hasn't discovered the Ellimist memory from when Helium woke up, especially since he was actively thinking about Ellimist interference in Yeerk and Andalite minds right before the fusion dance with Aximili. If he goes into Rachel's head specifically looking for clues in the moments after she woke up from the coma and each time she demorphed, maybe that will be enough to put the pieces together.

The /New Day's Dawn/ obviously doesn't have weapons, but I bet it has a supercharged version of the Chee personal force fields, especially if it was built after the Howlers came. It could probably do some damage in a space battle by projecting its shields right through the middle of the enemy ships' engines. (I'm assuming Pemalite shielding tech wouldn't be bothered by the presence of Yeerk/Andalite "shields".) Maybe the good ship puppydog can open the Mars base safely? I wonder if it can find the Z-space bridge? Deactivate the mines?

I really really really hope they remember to share all the relevant morphs with each other: Elena, Quat, off-world adventure team; before the cradle shows up.

*Edit:* The Puppyship sick bay is probably even better than what the Chee can do on their own. At the very least, it should be able to burn off morph control tissue safely.
