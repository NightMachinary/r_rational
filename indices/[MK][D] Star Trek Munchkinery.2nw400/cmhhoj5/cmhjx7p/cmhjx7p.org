  Whenever a main character really needs to be able to detect cloaked ships, they manage it pretty quickly. I'd have a team of engineers go through the list of known methods and build a sensor array that does that by default.

Why stop there? Do this with all the teching the tech solutions that have ever been used.

I would assemble a database of all the jury-rigs (teching the tech) used in all the past episodes. I would have the crew train to apply each of these jury rigs quickly and effectively. When possible, I would have them permanently modify or add on modified sections to the ship to do all the tricky things that get them out of trouble. Then instead of rushing to fix things in a dramatic manner, my crew would just pull out one of the known jury-rigs and have it ready to go.
