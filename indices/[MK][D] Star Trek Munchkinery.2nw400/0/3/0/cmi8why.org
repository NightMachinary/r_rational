Quantum technobabble and the no-cloning theory doesn't stop the fact that transporter duplicates have been created two different times on screen. It's always the same (lazy) "this can only happen once" thing that /Star Trek/ writers like to do when their technology works in some way that would revolutionize their world. They do the same thing over and over again with implants, neural interfaces, artificial intelligence, holograms, etc., in order to ensure that the world is relatively stagnant and their vision doesn't get disrupted.

But /Star Trek/ was never much about the worldbuilding, it was about the philosophy and ideas. And that explains why their worldbuilding is so thin on the ground.

My main gripe with replicators is that they're explicitly stated to be built with the same technology that transporters are. That undercuts the argument that they're not sophisticated enough to make a living thing, as does the fact that they can make all sorts of organic molecules and arrange them in complex ways. If a replicator can make a steak (which it can) then it can make dead flesh, and there's no much difference between dead flesh and living flesh. It /also/ undercuts the argument that transporters can't possibly make duplicates. And when the Federation comes across alien technology that can make living matter from a replicator (which happens at least twice), they don't react in shock or seem to have any desire to possess these clearly better technologies - because it would upset the status quo.

Now, I like /Star Trek/, but I have to watch it on an episode-by-episode basis instead of considering it as a coherent whole, and I still think the worldbuilding is fairly lazy. Part of this is because /Star Trek/ was built to be episodic in nature, and couldn't do stuff like a modern television show with heavy continuity would.
