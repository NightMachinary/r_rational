Sure, but that means that it's pretty much impossible to know what you can and can't do in the universe. The way the writers wrote the show was literally to just insert the word "tech" into the script and have someone fill in the appropriate bullshit later. The whole thing makes no sense, and asking how to exploit it is never going to produce a worthwhile answer, because the answer is probably just, "We can't tech because the tech." I /like/ Star Trek, but the technobabble makes no sense, and trying to make sense of it - let alone exploit it - seems like a fool's errand.
