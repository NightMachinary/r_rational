I have an idea borrowed from a combination of Charles Stross's Eschaton novels and a Buffy the Vampire Slayer crossover with SG-1 that turned into a star trek fusion fic (can't remember name).

- In original timeline, it follows real world history up to a future singularity.

- Advanced AI/uploads retroactively spread humans backwards in time and across space (resulting in Klingons, Vulcans, and all the near human people that they run across exploring)

- Advanced AI/uploads becomes/joins with/retroactively is the Q continumm.

- History gets altered in the process, history now fits history given in show (including stuff like the Eugenics Wars)

- The very top most elite of starfleet, and probably most of the smarter vulcans (because they are not straw vulcans in head canon universe) are aware of the true history of reality. Because of reasons (probably because they consider the true knowledge dangerous) they spread alternate stories about convergent evolution and such.

- This very top elite has also decided that AI, life-extension, genetic enhancement, self-replicating technology, and other such things are all too dangerous to experiment with and suppress the technological development. Because things are already close to a post-scarcity state and there is centralized control they can get away with this.

  - Why can't transporters be used for creating perfect duplicates of people, given what happened to Riker?
  - Why can't replicators make living things?
  - Why isn't artificial intelligence in widespread use, given the demonstrated capabilities of the holodeck?
  - What's preventing whole brain uploading and/or simulation?

All of these things are possible but are suppressed or are known but considered taboo. The top elite with vague knowledge of the disaster of the singularity are responsible for this.
