Okay

Riker duplication happened because of interference from the planet's atmosphere, only known to happen on one planet in all of known space, and then only once every several years, and on top of that it was a fluke. Even if sentient duplication wasnt politically toxic and taboo, you try studying a poorly understood natural phenomenon you only get to see about once a decade.

I don't have a canonical response, I'm sure its not a cultural restriction, but I imagine there are many more states in which a piece of matter is dead than in which its alive. This might reduce it to just limitations in the technology - we already know that the transporter buffer has to be disproportionately huge to hold all the information of a life form, and that isn't even digitised information.

Holodeck programs aren't sentient? Unless you're talking about The Doctor, who spent months to years running constantly on the Federations most advanced computers. The lack of common sentient holograms is just because the shows are set prior/during their first appearance.

Nothing prevents whole brain uploading, it happens, its not common, the closest I can see to a canonical reason is that for some reason the field of robotics isn't very advanced, and man-portable computers capable of running a sentient mind are still limited by the technology (exception: data, who was once the target of a mind upload) generally there's social resistance to the idea in pretty much every culture, except where there isn't, where it happens (eg the binars).

Time travel... Weeeeeell... Its clear from having FTL at all that they don't live in our universe, and their universe has either no or modified relativity. Let's say it works via modified relativity :p
