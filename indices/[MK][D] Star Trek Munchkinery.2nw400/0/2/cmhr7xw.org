  Why can't transporters be used for creating perfect duplicates of people, given what happened to Riker?
#+end_quote

Limitations of hardware and/or power required to store a living humanoid pattern before it degrades to a point where it would be dangerous to create. What happened to Riker on that planet is unique due to the make up of the atmosphere and conditions on the planet. It's possible to clone with a transporter using a filter of sorts simulating the same conditions but it is easier and more efficient to clone using other techniques.

  Why can't replicators make living things?
#+end_quote

Well, they kind of do. Replicators and transporters are similar in that they are 3D printers but one is specialized in living beings and the other for more common needs. At the least a replicator can create organic materials safe enough to consume but not ever shown to be used for say creating a heart for surgery. I'm torn between a glaring lack of understanding how organ rejection works and my belief this is a case of hand waving from writers.

  Why isn't artificial intelligence in widespread use, given the demonstrated capabilities of the holodeck?
#+end_quote

Fail-safes built into systems as powerful as ones the Federation has. Not cannon but reading a thread about that on [[/r/DaystromInstitute]] sometime ago made some good arguments for the case.

  How does time travel actually work?
#+end_quote

The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation][many-worlds interpretation]] for starters, helps fit the major model shown in the series. Of course, there /is/ a lot of plot relevant "subatomic particles" that come into play that could use some hard limits. Unlike the 29th century the 24th century is still working it all out but does have a Department of Temporal Investigations for such matters.

  The Trekverse seems like it has all the foundational technologies necessary to create a transhumanist society, yet that just hasn't happened.
#+end_quote

Humanity has reached a seemingly utopian society and with the capacity for FTL travel any group of people who don't share the same values can start their own version. Gene manipulation is taboo so cybernetic research and augmentation are a main line of pursuit.
