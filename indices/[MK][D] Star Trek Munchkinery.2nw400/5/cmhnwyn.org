Specific things I'd look into:

- Wasn't there a phasing device that let them fly starships through asteroids?
- There were those creatures from subspace that transported people off the ship in order to surgically investigate them -- they cut off Riker's arm and then reattached it. This whole "other dimensions in subspace" thing sounds pretty cool; let's see if we can't extract energy or resources from that
- Since time travel is a thing, let's send someone back in time...oh, say, 100 years...with a message about all the disasters that are going to wipe out planets etc and how to deal with them. Also notify them of any particular awesome opportunities so they can exploit them earlier. Oh yes, and send along a completely up-to-date science/medical/engineering database and fully build-the-infrastructure tools.\\

And yes, that last one will overwrite my own timeline. It will also save billions of lives and catapult the federation's technology forward enormously. Perhaps enormously enough that we can curbstomp the Borg. If not, repeat the process with our NEW tech level.
