It depends on which advancement you mean: mildly improved warp engines and transporters, sure, but not, say, that miniaturized site-to-site transporter from that one episode where Kim goes to an alternate timeline. On a more specific note, something like the EMH is fair game, but not the "holo-matix" bit they occasionally bring up that lets them construct an AI with ease. (Moriarty and his wife only being possible with the massive resources of a ship's computer). On shared events between DS9 and TNG, I'm not sure. My intention with the ruling was to prevent focus on that war thing that took up most of DS9, and since the wormhole just opens up a box of worms, I'd prefer to not count it as anything more than an unremarkable outpost.
