Take a combadge. Go back in time. Drop it on IBM. Go back to the future.

Pick up a new and improved combadge. Go back in time. Drop it on IBM. Go back to the future.

Pick up a new and improved combadge. This one is also a personal teleporter. Go back in time. Drop it on IBM. Go back to the future.

Pick up a new and improved combadge. This one is also a chronoporter. Send it back in time to IBM from where you stand in the future. This completes a stable time loop.

All science is now complete. Your combadge is omnipotent. You are now Q.
