Whenever a main character really needs to be able to detect cloaked ships, they manage it pretty quickly. I'd have a team of engineers go through the list of known methods and build a sensor array that does that by default. And preferably a torpedo-sized sensor array that does the same things. And put them everywhere.

If you'd counted DS9, in one of the episodes that bothered me most, an away team discovered the survivors of a crashed ship who were trapped by a portable technology-neutralizing device. After that moment, the Borg were no longer a threat in the ST universe. They simply became a convenient source of technology to reverse engineer.
