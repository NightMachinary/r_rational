It's worth noting that rational!Star Trek has been done, and it was called [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/y4/three_worlds_collide_08/][Three Worlds Collide]]. Still, it'd be really cool to see a version closer to canon.

Anyway, since you ask, I'd get people to research the Augments. Yes, they /are/ unFriendly and mildly superintelligent, but it seems extremely likely that they can be fixed or at least pointed at the enemy in some fashion.

Also, the Borg are idiots, so find them and steal their tech (while suppressing the hive-mind neural interface stuff so we don't end up turning into them.)

Finally, standing order to all starships that whenever you encounter a godlike superbeing that can kill us all with a thought, see about persuading them to disable all our enemies' weapons or something. Worked well enough with the Klingons. It's such a waste to /just/ survive these encounters, you know?

EDIT: Oh, hey, depending on how canon the Abrahms verse is here; ask S31 why the heck they're suppressing super-Transporters (via hologram telepresence so they won't assassinate me for Knowing Too Much, I bet they'd do that.)
