Use replicators to produce replicators to produce replicators, then build a nice big Dyson swarm around an out of the way star (nobody visits the systems without life bearing planets), program it to create starships, send them out to repeat the process exponentially until you have millions of ships (and replicators) for every technologically advanced species. For a suitable, replicable AI crew, use holograms, taken from a good holodeck simulation. Give them a mission of keeping peace in the galaxy, make the crew capable of surviving death by making backups (since they are at least a bit sentient) or merge similar individuals to reduce the population in case it becomes necessary. Give them personalities that can handle combat competently, but prefer peace. These soldier type AIs would then serve to buy time to pursue an aggressive program of peaceful research into genetic engineering, nanotech, friendly AI, and so on. Get a genetic program and psych studies going for every powerful race of sentients at least -- probably best to study them all. Again, use trillions of holodeck characters as researchers. If needed, sentient meat-beings could be hired on as creative aides, maybe use betazoid empaths to vet them, then train then by immersion in holodeck sims with their AI coworkers. Meat-people can be transmitted anywhere instantly via transporter as long as it is in the same solar system, so you could have a being rotate between dozens of different labs per day in the course of their consulting duties. Holo folks would have even more flexibility, since they can travel to other systems instantly via subspace.
