I really think you're not giving the writers enough credit. It's not perfect, but it's a lot more consistent than, say, Superman.

  Why can't transporters be used for creating perfect duplicates of people, given what happened to Riker?
#+end_quote

Because they run on quantum technobabble, and that would violate the no-cloning theorem. You can move a pattern from place to place, isolate portions of a pattern, or create artificial patterns; but not duplicate an existing pattern.

  Why can't replicators make living things?
#+end_quote

... the same reason existing 3d printers can't?

  Why isn't artificial intelligence in widespread use, given the demonstrated capabilities of the holodeck?
#+end_quote

Because planets that develop AI ... don't end up joining the Federation. The Enterprise encountered the ruins of several on the show.

They are apparently researching it regardless, however. Although it's possible that it's being deliberately sabotaged, given that the top-secret "Section 31" apparently suppresses certain "transhuman" technologies (except for their own use, of course.)

  What's preventing whole brain uploading and/or simulation?
#+end_quote

Well, the Federation hasn't solved physics, and they don't have unlimited processing power (they had a nuclear war before they even /noticed/ Moore's Law IIRC.)

But they do seem to have limited prototypes; in fact, it's been the basis of every experimental "AI" they've shown on the show.

  How does time travel actually work?
#+end_quote

... it's complicated. There is a consistent system for Trek timetravel set forth in the DTI novels, though.

At a first pass, it's the standard Doctor Who meta-time and "fate" pushing things back toward the way they were.
