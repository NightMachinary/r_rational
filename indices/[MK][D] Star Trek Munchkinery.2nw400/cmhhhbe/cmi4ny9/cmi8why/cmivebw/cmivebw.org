  If a replicator can make a steak (which it can) then it can make dead flesh, and there's no much difference between dead flesh and living flesh.

It's not a /real/ steak, it's /replicated/ food designed to resemble "a steak". According to TNG, it's got the nutritional balance of a MealSquare with none of the flavour or texture. Characters often complain that replicated foods and drinks don't really taste /quite/ the same as the real thing, but that's what specialist chefs are for.

There are a ton of things they can't replicate effectively. Most equipment is manufactured using (industrial) replicators, sure; but it's not as if you can just print yourself a new star drive, or a photon torpedo, or an equiv-tech civilization's currency.

  It's always the same (lazy) "this can only happen once" thing that Star Trek writers like to do when their technology works in some way that would revolutionize their world. They do the same thing over and over again with implants, neural interfaces, artificial intelligence, holograms, etc., in order to ensure that the world is relatively stagnant and their vision doesn't get disrupted.

  I have to watch it on an episode-by-episode basis instead of considering it as a coherent whole, and I still think the worldbuilding is fairly lazy. Part of this is because Star Trek was built to be episodic in nature, and couldn't do stuff like a modern television show with heavy continuity would.

One advantage of the episodic format is that there's usually an episode somewhere where the writer went out of their way to justify things, or which you can /use/ to justify things. I think that's one of the reasons it's so popular with people who like to over-analyse these things.

[... on DS9 we met Section 31, who were blackmailing a mildly-transhuman character because his - perfectly safe! - biomods were illegal. So that's a part of the setting, too. But apparently we're treating that as non-canon.]

In general, I think it's fair to say that the writers were well aware of transhumanist possibilities; and they deliberately postulated a Good Future where that stuff mostly didn't work out. (Rather like the future Eliezer postulated in Three Worlds Collide.) Genetics is /hard/. Brain emulation is /hard/. Messing them up leads to very smart and very crazy people blowing your stuff up, if you're lucky, and self-replicating plagues destroying your entire civilization if you aren't.

In TOS (which I'm most familiar with), they encountered not one but /three/ planets I can think of off the top of my head, reduced to devolved remnants of their civilization by brain emulation. They encountered a parallel Earth that tried to cure aging and wiped themselves out with a bioengineered plague; the characters were sympathetic, but unsurprised. And they encountered *Kahn*. Despite that, they've cured almost every disease, they have an unspecified but noticeably longer lifespan, and they're /still trying/ to improve. They're researching and improving their tech; and they're bargaining with more advanced races that are sufficiently un-advanced to consider bargaining.

The same goes for Generic Space Energy Nonsense; we see them improving the Warp Drive despite the fact that time travel is /really dangerous/, and we see them cheerfully poking Space Anomalies and Unknown Substances despite the fact that they generally just drive you insane and/or kill you.

Now, by TNG the Federation was portrayed as a bit more cautious about potentially-transhuman tech (and, interestingly, timetravel) - Picard was /really/, really bad at ethics - but still researching and testing new tech (also, Data.) If I recall correctly, they sent Moriarty off to be studied. And, of course, the premise of the show is still about adding to the Federation's scientific and technological base by flying out and poking stuff.
