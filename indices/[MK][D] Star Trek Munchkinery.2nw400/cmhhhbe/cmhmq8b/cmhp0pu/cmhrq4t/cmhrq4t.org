I don't disagree that the writing was oftne unnecessarily sloppy and at times insane and inconsistent (warp ten lizards o_o). But I never had a problem with any of the technologies that came straight from TNG's premise.

E.g. I'm quite happy to believe a machine could make something that I will think tastes like monkey brain, but lacks the technological sophistication to make an actual functional monkey brain, with an active mind running on it. I won't credit a replicator with godlike fabrication powers just because it feeds me.

Aside: I always thought that Star Trek's worst crimes against plausibility were done by individual writers on a budget, which accrued over its long run, rather than because the show had a philosophy of "Who cares, [insert science]". I never faulted it for having things like TECH in the original script, because its obvious those poor TECH writers were really putting their heart into it, just compare the TNG technobabble to Abrams Trek technobabble - TNG had much higher quality babble.
