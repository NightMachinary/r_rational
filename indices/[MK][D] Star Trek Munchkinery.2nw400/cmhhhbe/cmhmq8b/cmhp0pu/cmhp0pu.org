The world of /Star Trek/ is just really, really sloppily built, in part because it's the result of several decades and hundreds writers who were working against a deadline and much of the time, only really cared about putting out a standalone episode. I understand much of the canon "logic" for why we never see any technological progress, and /some/ of why the obvious transhumanist stuff never happens, but I also think it's stupid.

Take the replicators, for example. They seem to have no problem making a medium-rare steak or a cup of hot Earl Grey tea. Yet they can't make living things. This despite the fact that it's claimed that replicators use a variant of the transporter technology, which certainly /can/ transport living things. The Doyalist explanation for this is that being able to make a copy of a person at will breaks the whole universe wide open. The Watsonian explanation ... well, it somehow has to account for the fact that replicators can make a steak, with all the animal cells that implies, or the molecules of bergamot oil in Earl Grey, or any number of things that they obviously can and do make on a routine basis, but /at the same time/ can't make living things (except for the one or two times that they do).

The problem is that the writers wanted the "cool factor" of being able to create food on demand, or create an impostor of Picard, but didn't want their universe to have to become truly alien to the viewer. After all, if it were possible to make a copy of a person (either through transporter hackery or using a replicator) there wouldn't really be a reason for every warship not to have the best possible crew. Vital personnel would be cloned a hundred times over so that their skills and knowledge would never be lost. You can talk about social taboos, but those same taboos have to apply to all the other local cultures (and everyone capable of engineering the proper technology) so that a species doesn't just fork bomb and dominate their opponents. And in fact, the threat of facing a civilization that has mastered the creation of duplicates should be so great that research into making duplicates of personnel should be a top research priority - but there's no indication that this is the case.

And you can't tell me that the field of robotics isn't very advanced when they have frickin' Data walking around. That /just makes no sense/. I can /maybe/ accept that robots are impractical for most things given the existence of replicators, force fields, transporters, etc., but there's no way that Data gets made without some advanced robotic underlying technology. That strains my credulity to the breaking point.

*tl;dr* The problem of /Star Trek/ is that they wanted a lot of cool things without the consequences of those cool things.
