There are so many things that I would need the answers to:

- Why can't transporters be used for creating perfect duplicates of people, given what happened to Riker?
- Why can't replicators make living things?
- Why isn't artificial intelligence in widespread use, given the demonstrated capabilities of the holodeck?
- What's preventing whole brain uploading and/or simulation?
- How does time travel actually work?

It might be that these questions have sensible answers, but in the show, it's all sort of glossed over. The Trekverse seems like it has all the foundational technologies necessary to create a transhumanist society, yet that just hasn't happened. And not just in the Federation - in nearly every other civilization that they come in contact with. Why?
