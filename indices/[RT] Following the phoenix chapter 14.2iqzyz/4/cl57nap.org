Damn, this is good. Particularly liked this bit of description:

#+begin_quote
  The light almost blinded Li even with his eyes shut tight, he could /feel/ it on his skin, and his heart filled with joy and release at the light and the song. It was terror and beauty, joy and agony ...
#+end_quote

That "terror and beauty" bit in particular really resonates with me. In Donna Tartt's /The Secret History/, she says, "Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it." And I think that reflects this passage perfectly, in a very powerful sense - literally. I've often reflected that the powerful non-human entities inevitable in the post-Singularity world could take on a beautiful shape, but one alien and ... well ... terrifying, especially given their power.

Good food for thought. Thanks for sharing [[/u/gommm]].
