The implication seems to be that it's something like fatigue. I think that the characters are guessing conservatively at the number of dementors that they can destroy before the fatigue impacts their ability to survive and assuming that there are at least dozens of dementors in Azkaban. This, along with Harry's strategic choices in HPMOR implies that the dementor-killing effect radiates from the patronus.

Whether or not it's been proven empirically, these intuitions do seem to exhibit self-consistency.
