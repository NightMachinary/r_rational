I will say that if it's meant to be fatigue it makes very little sense, what exactly is the exertion difference between touching a dementor and just having your patronus waltz around.

I will always here make a statement that I am 90% sure she is not dead even though she killed them all. If that's the case it is evidence in favour, if she is dead it's strong evidence for the casting of the spell to actually drain something.

Also why not just kill half the dementors each, or half now half later yourself and recover your fatigue between killings if it is something that you actually regenerate (which is again very weird)
