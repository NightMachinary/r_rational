  Part of Harry's life flowed back into him

But what even is "life"? And he loses some to radiation every time? What does that even mean? Why hasn't he been experimenting with it? Does he use up life every time he casts the patronus does that mean that Harry's life is a finite value, it must be a finite value if it can run out, which sounds to me like he's shit out of luck and that's it's a really really dumb idea to teach everyone and their mother about this patronus if it's only useful for combating dementors which are about to be (have been) wiped out if it saps your "life" every time you do it.

And he killed a dementor that one time anyway without dying, I still can't possibly see from the information we've been given that he has any concept of the quantity of dementors there are and how he was able to calculate the dementor to life loss ratio to know they would kill them, certainly with the thoughts we've been privy too that seems like a much bigger deal.

Edit: It seems to me this makes much more sense as something that's messing with his mind and should be something Harry says "I am confused" to.
