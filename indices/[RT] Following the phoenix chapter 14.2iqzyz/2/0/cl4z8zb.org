In HPMOR the times Harry's true patronus has gone out of control " Part of Harry's life flowed back into him. Part had been lost as radiation." It's also described as being cast with your life force instead of with your magic. All the descriptions indicate that it takes something distinctly not replaceable to kill a dementor. Of course this isn't written in some and Harry could be mistaken about the drain he feels but it's taken as unlikely.
