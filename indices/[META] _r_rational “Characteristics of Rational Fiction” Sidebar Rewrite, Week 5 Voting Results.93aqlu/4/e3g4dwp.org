All these threads were kinda a lot of action, and for a relatively low activity user like me it was pretty opaque where and when to come in with my contributions. It would be a big drain and just a lot of action. As a result, I ended up not taking part in this. Probably there weren't a lot of people like this, so I wouldn't worry about it too much, but I may not have been the only one. Overall, it seems not to have mattered as we got a good outcome regardless, but hopefully this feedback helps.

This is not an attempt to shit on [[/u/dwood15][u/dwood15]] or any of the other people who took part in this process, or anything like that, just a personal experience that may be a useful data point for future things like this.
