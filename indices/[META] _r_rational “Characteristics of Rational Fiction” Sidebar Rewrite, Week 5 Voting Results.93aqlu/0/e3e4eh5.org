As you might have noticed, I've updated the sidebar to be the winning entry. */This does not preclude further changes./* I'd be fine with people suggesting tweaks, and I'd be fine implementing those changes with or without a vote, depending on how much it changes the core definition. More discussion is welcome, but the bias is now toward what was voted on.

If you were one of the people to submit an entry in the final week, you should have flair now, which is just a little blue shield. If you change your flair, you'll lose the shield. If you had existing text, I left that in place, but if you didn't, you got some text. If you'd like different text for your flair, PM me.

If you'd like some participation flair of your own, let me know; I don't want to exclude people who contributed to discussion but didn't actually submit their own definition. The flair is mostly just a mark that you did the honorable duty of not being a lurker.
