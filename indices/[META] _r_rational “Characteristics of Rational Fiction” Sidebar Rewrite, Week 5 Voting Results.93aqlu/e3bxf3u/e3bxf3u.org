I voted for the winner, so my perspective is a little biased, but I don't think I'd want to repeat previous steps. I'm okay with tweaking the winning solution to better fit the sidebar (maybe create a discussion thread for tweak suggestions, with the understanding that the core ideas and concepts are set in stone) or maybe trying to combine the three winners into one compromise solution. And of course, running with what we've got as the winner sounds fine to me.

One last discussion thread for tweaks does sound like a good idea, I think. People with criticisms can make more precise observations now that they're dealing with one solution in specific, and we can try to see if the phrasing can be improved in any way without losing clarity (brevity is important for a sidebar, after all).
