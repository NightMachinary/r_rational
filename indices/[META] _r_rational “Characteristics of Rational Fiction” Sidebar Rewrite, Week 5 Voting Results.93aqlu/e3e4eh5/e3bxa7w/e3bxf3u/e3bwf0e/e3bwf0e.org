*Run with it*

The winner is a bit wordy for my taste. But it hits the key notes. And, if nothing else, we should have a bias towards action.

And in the spirit of 'bias towards action,' I'd vote that we give flairs to everyone who put up a well-formed proposal. Even if they didn't win they put up a non-trivial effort. And that should get encouraged.
