This doesn't merely reword but completely omits significant aspects of the definition, like 'thoughtful behaviour', or that the story /explores/ this behaviour and its consequences.

I also feel it goes against the spirit of the definition since one of the aspects of Noumero's definition is that it treats 'rationality' as a quality that can be higher or lower, rather than a specific category.

I would thus vote against the particular tweak.
