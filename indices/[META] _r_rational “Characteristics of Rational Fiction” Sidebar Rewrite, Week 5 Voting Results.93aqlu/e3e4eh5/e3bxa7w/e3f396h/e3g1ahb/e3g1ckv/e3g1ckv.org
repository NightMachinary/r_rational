I'm going to work on a rewording of the post right now. I'm all for a link to a subreddit wiki article where we post the full content of your proposal though.

Edit: Assuming you haven't read this post yet, here's my tweak of the first paragraph:

#+begin_quote
  In "Rational" fiction, a character's intellectual agency is always put above tropes. Characters pursue their goals consistently, and the consequences of their actions are realistic within the world and the story's plot.
#+end_quote

Original:

#+begin_quote
  "Rationality" is a specific quality of any fictional work, independent of genres and settings. It describes the extent to which the work explores thoughtful behaviour of people in honest pursuit of their goals, as well as consequences of their behaviour on the fictional world or the story's plot. In highly-rational fiction, realistic intellectual agency is put above established literary tropes, and all other aspects of the narrative.
