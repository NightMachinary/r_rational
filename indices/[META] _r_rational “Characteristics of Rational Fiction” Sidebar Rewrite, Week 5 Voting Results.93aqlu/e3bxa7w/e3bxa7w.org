Now that we've got [[/u/Noumero]]'s as the 'winner', I'd like to propose we put in a cycle here to attempt to slim down the word count.

The sidebar should be a brief, high-level overview, and too many words doesn't fulfill that purpose, IMO.

Perhaps what we do, is make a wiki with the full content of the post + references (like links to fics which attempt to exemplify the highlighted traits).

Then, we attempt to shorten each bullet point without losing their meaning, and put /that/ on the sidebar, with a link to the wiki article.
