I'm fine with not making it to the academy since that curretnly is the big payoff and preparations are warranted. I do wish that Learn would learn what knowledge/skills he would need to get accepted in the academy but I get that he wants to learn about the dwarves to be a good guest and that he due to his upbringing might not plan that far ahead.
