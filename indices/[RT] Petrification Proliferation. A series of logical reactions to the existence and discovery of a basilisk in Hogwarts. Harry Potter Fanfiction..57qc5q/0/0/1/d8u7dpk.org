Agreed on all counts!

For a slightly faster pace, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][starfox5]] is notable for very well-written depictions of a wizarding civil war:

- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][/The Dark Lord Never Died/]] (complete), Malfoy faked Voldemort's survival and used /1984/ as a checklist. Hermione is a squad leader of the Special Police, and lead investigator into corruption in the 'mudblood rescue squad'...
- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][/Divided and Entwined/]] (ongoing), Hermione is not the only muggle-born to have read history - and the writing on the wall. A three-sided civil war ensues, with people making hard decisions... or easy but bad ones. If you only read one, read this - there's a clear technical improvement in the writing, and arguably in characterisation.

Hmm, maybe I'm just a sucker for reluctant-but-resolved Dumbledore, and competent Hermione...
