People keep complaining about the 'stuck in a cave' arc, but I'm going to whole-heartedly defend it. i liked that arc. Yes, it was long and had no action, but it was a transformative time for rain, both for his in-story development, and narratively. If the arc had been short, or briefly summarized, it wouldn't have had as much impact. Instead, it gave Rain time for real introspection, and set up aspects of the longer narrative.

Delve is by nature a slow-grind web serial. The earlier chapters were similarly, it's just that no one was reading them when they came out, but instead binged them all in a go. The cave arc similarly would be a noticeable slow point if you were reading these chapters all at once, but would not come across as overly-long. If you want a fast-moving story, you should either not read serialized fiction, or stick to faster-moving serials. Delve, in my opinion, has been consistent between what the author promised and what was delivered.
