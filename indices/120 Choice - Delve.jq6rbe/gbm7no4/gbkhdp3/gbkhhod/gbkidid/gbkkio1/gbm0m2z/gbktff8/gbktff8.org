I agree, but on the other hand it's tricky to convey the experience of being stuck if it only takes a moment to read. Well, evocative prose can do it, and the obelisk sequence managed it quite well with less idling. Nesting two separate being stuck alone sequences back to back inside a being stuck in a dome arc was a bit much. If the author wanted to explore the theme of stuckness, it would have been more effective to have it present in different domains, say system, physical and mental, instead of having two physical stuckings nested. Twice in a row.

Perhaps give Rain himself a bit more angst about being stuck in a dome. And also about being stuck mechanically. Tune it up to eleven in the pit, make everything he tries to escape fail, have the end of a single chapter be a deep downer, where he gives up (with soul rupture contributing). Then in the beginning of the next chapter have Dozer do an interesting thing and Rain be "Huh, interesting" and realize that in his original world all the progress people had was learning more about the world and improving their skills, not Skills, he shouldn't let a weird system arbitrate his sense of purpose. With this motivation, he could have the original digging and training montage, and finish the chapter with detecting the rescuers.

Then the obelisk entrapment could be framed as him now refusing to get stuck. The way Rain just keeps going despite all the ridiculous hardship and seeming lack of options in the void is really impressive. The prose could celebrate that more, and framing it as him applying a lesson from the pit would achieve that nicely.

Well, it's always easy to say stuff like this after the fact; that's why published books go through editing passes. Consistently producing a chapter a week is no joke.
