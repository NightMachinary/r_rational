And Delve's slow spot was really awkward too. There was really no reason for it to be dragged out as long as it did, there were so many weeks where I thought the weekly chapter was completely unnecessary and extraneous.

Hell, there's literally an entire month's worth of chapters of Rain stuck in a literal hole in the ground doing diddly squat, which could've been entirely summarized in one chapter or shorter. 4+ chapters were spent on him being trapped in a hole in the ground.

I'm glad we've moved past those arcs and have gone back to plot progression, although I will admit I still wish these chapters were faster. I wonder what the end of this lair will bring.
