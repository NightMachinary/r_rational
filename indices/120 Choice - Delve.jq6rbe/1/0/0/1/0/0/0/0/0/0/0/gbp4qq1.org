But that is how the story was written. The first sixty chapters or so were a very typical isekai where the main character figures out the world he's arrived in and goes on adventures. The worst thing he had to deal with was a pissed off guildmaster and his ex wife.

Then suddenly the whole thing takes a 90 degree turn and suddenly we're dealing with armies and city wide magic artifacts and people powerful enough to squish Rain like a bug. And not only does Rain have to deal with all that, there's no path to him growing powerful enough to deal with them. For like 50 chapters basically nothing about Rain's personal plot advances at all.

And then another 90 degree turn and we're right back on track as an adventure story where he can make choices that affect his fate again. Global politics have all but vanished completely. I don't think it's the slightest bit out of line to call that bad writing.

It seems kinda silly to argue about how someone criticizes a story. If you did like the pace yourself or how the author wrote it then that would make sense. But just saying the author gets to decide how the story flows and criticising it is out of line is a bit ridiculous. People have been criticising stories for as long as authors have been writing them. There aren't any rules.
