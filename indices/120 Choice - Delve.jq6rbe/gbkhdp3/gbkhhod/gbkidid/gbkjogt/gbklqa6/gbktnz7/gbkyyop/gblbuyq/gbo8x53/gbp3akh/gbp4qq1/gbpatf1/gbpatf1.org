I disagree in part with what you've said. It wasn't a story where he would go on adventures, he left the city twice, not counting the nearby forest. It was all still focused on worldbuilding and him understanding things.

I very much agree that the dke attack was a radical shift in the series, like...idk, the Seanchan or tower revolt in WoT, or kvothe losing his family or joining the university in Kingkiller. But more jarring in some way. Oh, I know, like the mass teleport in Mushoku Tensei!

I think it would be quite ridiculous if he DID have a path to getting powerful enough to deal with the Watch or Velika, it's raise the question of why the hell isn't everyone that powerful if Rain had a path to it. I'd consider that bad writing

But on a different level he did have paths to grow more powerful to a more reasonable degree. Rains main issue is that he has skills without the experience. Now he's becoming more battlesavvy, especially with his macros.

Now to say that global politics have vanished completely when he only left a backwater city about a week ago and thus this is bad writing just....it boggles me that you could think that. This isn't the modern age where cities, or countries, can be reached in a day by armies. If I read historical fiction where some guy leaves one of the Greek city states during wartime and doesn't get hassled by an army, I wouldn't be surprised. And the continent they're on is a lot larger than Greece. Besides the war is between the Empire and the DKE and he's not heading to any DKE City states, or to the Empire.

So yeah, I think it's kind of out of line to call that bad writing /understatement.

And to say all criticisms are justified is kinda silly. If there were no rules to criticising, we wouldn't have people considered respected critics and others who are ignored. Criticisms need to be valid.
