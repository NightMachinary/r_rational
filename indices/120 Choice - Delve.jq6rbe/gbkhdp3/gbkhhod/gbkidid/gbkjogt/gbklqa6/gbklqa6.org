It felt to me like it moved away from being an adventure story as soon as he got back to the city after the first lair. It's not nearly as exciting when events are happening to the main character and he's reacting as when he gets to make decisions and decide where to go himself. That's what got me into the story in the first place, the feeling that he's in this new world and he gets to go out and explore, not get caught up in the politics of people a hundred times as powerful as him.
