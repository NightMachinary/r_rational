Hm, so basically LessWrong is 3ish things: * Discussion group for math / rationality topics. * Archive of lots of articles on math / rationality topics. * Wikia of definitions + links to all these articles.

The book that people are referring to, Rationality: From AI to Zombies, is basically a nicer edit of The Sequences, which is a core series of articles.

If you want to learn some interesting ideas, the book is worth downloading and reading (be warned, it's quite long, ~1700 pages).

But it's definitely /not/ a necessary prerequisite for reading everything on the site.

Otherwise, if you're looking for some singular articles to sink your teeth into:

- [[http://lesswrong.com/top/][Top-ranking posts on the site]]

- [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/6ga/index_of_yvains_excellent_articles/][A collection of Scott Alexander's posts]]

- [[http://lukemuehlhauser.com/writings/#LWPosts][A collection of Luke Muehlhauser's posts]]

Feel free to just poke around and see what's interesting.

There may be some terms or ideas that are unfamiliar in discussions, like "shut up and multiply" (referring to our inability to emotionally /feel/ large numbers) but the wiki can usually point you to something, or feel free to ping me.
