You can read the 'Core Sequences' on the website: [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences#Core_Sequences][link.]]

Especially the first few sections (Map & Territory and How to Actually Change your Mind) are very important, but later parts go very heavily into FAI design, so if you're not interested in that it might be worth reading the other sequences by other writers instead. Also, 'Yvain' now blogs on [[http://slatestarcodex.com/][Slate Star Codex]], but it's best to read the core sequences first, as a lot of his stuff builds on or refers to them.
