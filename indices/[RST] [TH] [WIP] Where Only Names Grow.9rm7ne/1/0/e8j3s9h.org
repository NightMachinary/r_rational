Thanks for pointing out the typos! Not sure what happened in that last paragraph.

I'm glad you found it easier to get into this time. In retrospect, the first version was a mess in a lot of regards - I got a ridiculous amount of words deep without offering much clarity on the setting, the main characters, or the general direction of the plot, just hoping to keep the readers attention by intrigue alone. Other than just overestimating my technical skill and a lack of concrete planning resulting in poor pacing, I think my biggest mistake was how I was using the format; I approached it basically the same way as you'd write a novel, only with a bigger word count, when with a serial the inherent investment that comes from buying a book just isn't there.

I spent a lot of time thinking about how best to structure a slow-paced, ambiguous story like this in a way that could better keep people's attention early on. In some ways I think the result is still pretty flawed - right up until yesterday I was thinking about ways I could cut out the Prologue (1) part completely and throw people directly into a mystery, but I couldn't figure out a way to convey the context it provides more succinctly in a way that didn't feel forced. I hope it doesn't lose me too many readers.

(edit: Actually, I might just end up cutting it and folding some information into the subsequent part, even if it comes out a bit crudely. It looks like a lot of readers are dropping off in it right now.)

I'm open to any suggestions if anyone else is reading this, though obviously how much you can really edit a mystery without it being sort of cheating is limited.
