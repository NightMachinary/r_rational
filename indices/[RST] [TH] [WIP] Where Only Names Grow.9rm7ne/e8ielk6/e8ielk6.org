Glad you're taking another crack at this one. Murder mysteries are right up my alley, but I couldn't get into the story the first time around. This version was definitely easier to follow, immediately leading with a smaller mystery gave me something to chew on. I generally like closed rooms, meta commentary, and explicit reliable and unreliable narrators so this is ticking a lot of boxes for me.

As for the observatory mystery, I'm excited to dig into that one. All of my initial thoughts were shut down or at least touched on (the telescope was /empty/- bah, thought I had something there). I think I remember you saying in the previous version that there would be several smaller mysteries like this, and I hope that's carried forward.
