I think that enough would be allowed to make the use of it so ridiculously valuable that, if you had one, you'd only want to use it if you have no other option, or if it guarantees a final victory. However, the full span of shenanigans, like summoning a wish-granting entity and wishing for another CoI would probably be restricted/excluded, to the point where it might break the /game/, but wouldn't break the /story/, if you know what I mean.
