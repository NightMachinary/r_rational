I love how much the in story meta-analysis of the 'story' has become part of the story.

I started Practical around the beginning of book 4. Before I thought it was a story that did something excellent with the ideas of tropes and patterns and stories. The last few chapters have really elevated it for me. The call backs to previous books and the consequences of past actions creating ripples to this slowly rising, likely, penultimate crisis. It's really raised my opinion of the work as a whole.

It almost feels like a slight shift in genre, that works in the pattern that the story has been moving in. As Cat gains vaguer powers, the powers and forces in the story begin to rely more and more on the narrative surrounding the characters. It first began to become really apparent when the fae were introduced. When she got those formless but pattern following powers, the focus of the story turned more towards the idea of patterns in stories than it had before. Now that what she can do through Sve Noc is only barely explained even after all these chapters, the focus of the story has turned more and more meta.

Personally I'm loving every second of it. I feel it has also addressed power creep in an acceptable manner. Cat is much more powerful than she was before. But in such a different way that you can't compare it to her previous state.
