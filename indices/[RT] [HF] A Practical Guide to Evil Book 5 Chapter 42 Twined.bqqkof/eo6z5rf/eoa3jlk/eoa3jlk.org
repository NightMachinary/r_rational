I hope this isn't the end. Yeah loose ends are being tied up a bit here and there but the stakes are as low as they've ever been for Callow, unless the DK has made a whole lot of progress while the group is playing around in fairyland.

A finale centered on characters that weren't part of the original conflict would be just disappointing, especially if Malicia doesn't feature in it at all.
