I feel it only looks like Rain isn't learning because it seems like less time has passed than it really has. Rain hasn't spent very much time in the world by the latest chapter. It's only been a month and he's been having language difficulties for the first few weeks.

I've read ahead in the patreon chapters and Rain is getting more discreet, but I think the author is showing him learning incrementally. First Rain is learning to not say anything explicit to the Watch other than what's needed to answer the questions. Then he's learning to hold back with his skills instead of going as strong as he can.

It's just a bit slow.
