I thought that armor thing was brilliantly done. It's a way to show Rain's slowly increasing paranoia about getting hurt or killed without being too obvious. Rain has literally never taken off the armor ever since he first put it on.

It's not stated out right, but Rain is /scared/ to be defenseless without his armor. It's just that he has a tendency to overshare with those he trusts so it looks like he is being naive. Remember that he actually /understated/ his damage output to the Watch when it wouldn't result in a lie.
