Eh, he's very close to being "Too Dumb To Live" in my opinion. Or at least, he's never holding an idiot ball because the idiot ball was baked into his very character. It's only thanks to smarter characters babysitting his mistakes that he hasn't ended up in a shallow grave somewhere

My issue with Rain is that he seems incapable of learning. Even after he gets burned time and time again for showing off his unbalanced magical abilities, he just goes ahead and does it again. He is incapable of keeping a low profile mere hours after thinking how fragile his build is.

Literally this dude gets back from multiple brushes with death, the need to be discreet hammered into him, and the first thing he does is charge thousands of mana into heating pads in minutes, in a quest that almost everyone in the guild is probably familiar with and will know how abnormal that is. Let alone the above-discussed "hey dudes who are supposed to protect towns from OP adventurers, have I ever told you that I could kill hundreds of people here in less than a second with no warning, and have previously displayed no hesitation about using unknown AoE spells in public?"
