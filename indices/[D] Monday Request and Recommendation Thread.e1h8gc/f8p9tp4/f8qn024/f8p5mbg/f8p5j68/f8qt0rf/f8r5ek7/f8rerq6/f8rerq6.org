I don't think this story's been recommended here before. The premise is of a speedrunner that's specialising on a particular game accidentally ending up in that game when trying to find yet another glitch to shave off some more time from his runtimes. The writer likely drew inspiration from Castlevania / Metroidvania games, as well as games like Dark Souls and Mass Effect.

PROs:

- excellent worldbuilding --- meticulous and carefully designed locations, characters, world lore, and character backstories;
- the writer's [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork][ShownTheirWork]] about speedrunning communities, as well as their mentality, subculture slang, and so on;
- good-to-excellent characterisations: the protag feels like a speedrunner, the vigeogame's main characters have unique and detailed backgrounds, the videogame is populated with random encounters that can leave an impression, etc;
- due to its premise has a vibe of mid-to-late chapters of a time loop story;
- features some beautifully implemented rare-to-encounter ideas.

CONs:

- the first several chapters are a bit rough around the edges;
- the story's technically abandoned after the ending of the first plot arc. That plot arc itself can be treated as a good enough ending point though;
- a few eventually revealed (non-critical) explanations are somewhat lacking;
- ? it's not trying to meet the established standards and expectations of a "properly well written" story;
- ? to me, at least, it felt like the game's characters' personalities became somewhat subdued in the second half of the story to accommodate the planned plot progression. Though perhaps this could be explained by the protag being able to "push the right buttons" due to knowing from all his replays how each character would react to a range of possible inputs.
