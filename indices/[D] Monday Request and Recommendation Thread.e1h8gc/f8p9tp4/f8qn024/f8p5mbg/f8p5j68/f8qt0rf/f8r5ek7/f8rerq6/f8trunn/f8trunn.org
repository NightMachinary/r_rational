Thanks for this recommendation. Just read it in a sitting and loved the story, and agree with the issues that come with writing that sort of story.

Really would have liked a more complete epilogue that would have showed character development of the side characters. They were on a trajectory of self-destruction and confusion, then suddenly pulled into a speedrun straight toward their goals and dreams.

Crystal and Kimono in particular needed a POV chapter.
