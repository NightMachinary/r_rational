It's well written, but I wouldn't call it rational, particularly the worldbuilding. The constant war, death and destruction really shouldn't be sustainable.

The LitRPG aspect is light. There are classes and skills, but those are automatically assigned. No munchkinry whatsoever.

There are an Antinium (ant people) civilisation and goblin tribes though. Those are pretty unique.
