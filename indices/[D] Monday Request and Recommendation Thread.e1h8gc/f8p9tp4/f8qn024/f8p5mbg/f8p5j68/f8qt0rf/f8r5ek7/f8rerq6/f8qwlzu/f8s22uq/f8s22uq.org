[[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html][Lord of the Mysteries]] has some excellent worldbuilding. There are 22 hermetic pathways to power, each involved taking potions made from monsters. The main character, a Chinese keyboard warrior, was isekai-ed into the body of a recently dead magically-induced suicide victim in Magic Britain, trying to find a way home in a deadly world.

The first volume builds up slowly and felt like a magic buddy cop webnovel, but the end of the first arc made me fall in love.
