It's like the French movie irreversible. The sexual violence is more present. I would say it is filmed as a much more upsetting scene. I guess it is a matter of preference then.

The camera lingers on the girl and how she is not having a good time. The visual weight of the scene is that, this is bad and you don't get to look away from it being bad.

At least that was my take.
