Gonna second the recommendation for Glasshouse, as far as far-future works dealing with complexity of post-human identity go.

I don't think Accelerando is nearly as good these days, tbh. The early chapters were trying to be 5-minutes-into-the-future in the early 2000's, and some of the cultural references haven't aged well.
