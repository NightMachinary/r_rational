I'd love to read more transhumanist/posthuman novels. For example, I've enjoyed all of the following:

- /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine_(Egan_novel)][Quarantine]]/, /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_City][Permutation City]]/ and /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schild%27s_Ladder][Schild's Ladder]]/ by Greg Egan
- /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Music_(novel)][Blood Music]]/ by Greg Bear
- /[[https://www.amazon.com/Icon-Violet-Simon-Fay-ebook/dp/B01LY1S4O0/][Icon-Violet]]/ by Simon Fay
- /[[https://www.amazon.com/Recursion-Tony-Ballantyne/dp/0553589288][Recursion]]/ by Tony Balantine
- /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight_(Watts_novel)][Blindsight]]/ and /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echopraxia_(novel)][Echopraxia]]/ by Peter Watts

Can anyone recommend books/webserials with similar themes that explore the concept of identity and changing facets of the human condition in distant futures?

I'd be interested in any stories which focus on the philosophical implications of: human society evolving so far as to be barely recognizable by today's standards, humanity making itself obsolete, consciousness upload, people editing their own personalities, consciousness copies, etc.
