[[https://m.wuxiaworld.co/release-that-witch/][Release that witch]] is often suggested. I enjoyed it, though the later parts of the story kind of lose focus and I hear the ending is rather abrupt (I've only read about 2/3)

NSFW website [[https://storiesonline.net/s/75651/a-new-past][A New Past]] Future scientist gets sent back to present day and uses his knowledge to prevent dystopian future. Basically captures the time between current tech and true commercial spaceflight. This novel has large amounts of sex, but has more than enough plot to be counted as a real book. Sex scenes drop off as the plot gets underway.
