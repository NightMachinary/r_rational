I started reading [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28420/moonlight][Moonlight]] recently. So far it's pretty good, though I'm only about five chapters in. It's about a transsexual man living in a society that is pretty segregated: men learn to fight, women to heal. He's expected to be a good daughter, grow up to be a healer, and have kids.

The story follows the MC as he tries to find a place where he can be himself without being burned at the stake for being a heretic.
