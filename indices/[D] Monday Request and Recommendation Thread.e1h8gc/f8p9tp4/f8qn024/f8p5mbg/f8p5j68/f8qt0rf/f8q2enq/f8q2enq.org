Looking for a good uplift story a la “With This Ring” or “A Thing of Vikings”. Preferably long, preferably with minimal cases where the uplifter is smacked down by something they couldn't possibly have foreseen or planned around.

Or anything rational that's really, really long. I've read most of those in circulation but I'm always looking for more.
