I've been enjoying [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28254/nanocultivation-chronicles-trials-of-lilijoy][Nanocultivation Chronicles]] recently - it's somewhat rational, in that it spends some time exploring what it would mean to have easy self-replicating nanotech, a post-singularity intelligence, a litrpg-ish system, and what xianxia-style cultivation could be for.

The first three or so chapters are a bit dire, and I don't think you'd miss anything particularly important if you skipped straight to chapter 4, but at that point it really takes off; the story manages to blend good cheer with a post-apocalyptic setting in a really intriguing way.
