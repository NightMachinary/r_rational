Hm, Crowley and Aziraphale's arc is roughly half the story. That would be required knowledge. The second half is barely touched on at all.

I'll put the relevant bits in spoiler:

After the Earth was created 6000 years ago, Crowley was the snake who tempted Eve into eating the apple of knowledge. Aziraphale was the Angel who guarded the gate to Eden through which Adam and Even were exiled; he gave them his flaming sword. They were then sent out by respectively Heaven and Hell to keep tabs on humans and further their respective sides' agenda. However, they both came to... apprechiate Humanity, and each other's company, more than their superiors.

Azi set up a bookstore, while Crowley had an apartment. Both often met up during their tasks, tipping each other off about bullshit their bosses were pulling, small favours like that.

So when Crowley gets the task to start the apocalypse, the Final Battle, he and Aziraphale work together to stop it. I /think/ in the TV show they have an argument about running away from earth to Alpha Centauri, but I'm not quite clear on it, it wasn't in the book but is referenced in the fic.

Then Azi is sent to heaven while his bookstore is burnt down by a Witch hunter, and Crowley arrives on the scene to find the store burning and his friend missing. Later, they meet up and stop the apocalypse (part of the second half of the plot which is irrelevant for the fic).

In the end Heaven and Hell try to execute them via respectively holy water and hellflame for being traitors, butt hat fails, because they switched bodies and thus were immune to the chosen execution method (this is not in the book, but I looked it up because it is relevant for the fic). Now everyone is afraid of them because they don't know /what/ they are, and leaves them alone.
