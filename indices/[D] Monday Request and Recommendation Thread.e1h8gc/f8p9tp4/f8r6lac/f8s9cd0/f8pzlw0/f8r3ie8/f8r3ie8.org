  How much canon knowledge is required to fully understand and appreciate the story?

Fully understand: very little - you find out about all the relevant background information as Aubrey does. There /is/ something that Crowley refuses to tell her and you never find out what it is in the story, but it's not required.

Appreciate: you will not appreciate this story unless you've either read Good Omens or watched the recent miniseries. It is fan wank of the highest caliber, giving closure to a story you didn't even realize needed it.
