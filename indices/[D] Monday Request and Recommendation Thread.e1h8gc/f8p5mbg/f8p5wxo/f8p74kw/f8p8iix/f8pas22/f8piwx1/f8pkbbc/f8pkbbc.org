They understand the /concept/ of nothing, they just don't have a /symbol/ for it. Rain also explained it really badly - he used "1" and "10" and how adding 0*10 to 100 gives you 100. Which makes sense to us, but there's no reason someone using a different system would get that. Roman numerals worked well for almost 2000 years without a zero.

I think the idea of having nothing, or no effect, shows they get the concept. But the idea that /nothing can be something/ is kinda hard to wrap your head around. It took us until the 13th century before we got 0. We invented calculus and algebra without 0 being around.

e: This is how Jamus explained to Rain why they got along without it,

  “See here? These are numbers in my language. That there is the symbol for ‘one', and those two together mean ‘ten'. The round character on the end is a zero. When you write a one and a zero next to each other like that, you get ten. Two ones next to each other make eleven, a one and a two is twelve, and so on.”

  “Oh, I think I've heard of this.” Jamus said, “The position of the digits matters, right? Twelve is one ten plus two ones?”

  “Yup, you got it. So ten is one ten plus zero ones. A hundred is one hundred, zero tens, and zero ones. Written like this, see?” Rain pointed. “The zeros are there to pad out the number, that way you know the one is in the hundred's place.”

  “Humm. I can see the appeal, but-”

  “But what?” Rain sighed in exasperation. “These are much easier to work with than your numbers are. See here?” He pointed to some scribbles on the opposing page. “I was trying to do math with the value system you all seem to use, but it did not go well. I had to keep converting back and forth. How do you even multiply anything with these?”

  “Most people don't bother, or at least, not to that level,” Jamus said, nodding to the cramped script in Rain's notebook. “For day-to-day life, simple ratios are enough. Overkill, even. Knowing that a skill will boost damage by one part in ten is good enough.”

  “Come on! You just used a fraction for crying out loud! How can't you have zero!?”

  “I don't know what to tell you, Rain,” Jamus shrugged. “As I said, I've heard of systems like the one you are describing, but it isn't what I was raised with. Some people don't even see numbers when they interact with the system. If you want to know more, you'll have to talk to a real scholar, not just a dabbler like me. Remind me to introduce you to Staavo when we get back to Fel Sadanis. I think you'd get along.”
