You could try the Orthogonal trilogy by Greg Egan. It's an alternate reality where the universe has a positive-definite Riemannian metric, rather than a pseudo-Riemannian metric (i.e. our universe.) An entire alternate physics spills out from there, which the characters exploit to save their world. One of the things it does is occasionally stop the action and pose thought experiments which demonstrate elements of cosmology. For example, red light is slower than violet light, so why is the sun white? (Because it doesn't matter how fast an individual photon is. If you send out 10 red photons and 10 violet photons, they're all going to reach the destination at some point. Since the rate of entry is the same, the rate of exit will also be the same).
