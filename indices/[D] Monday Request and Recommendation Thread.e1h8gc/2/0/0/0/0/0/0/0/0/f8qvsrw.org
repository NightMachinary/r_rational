Rain is generally not the brightest or most knowledgeable. In the latest chapter he claimed that in his world people don't really have servants/house keepers beyond the super rich and actually believed it. And in general he's really bad at explaining anything from his own world ever. He's also oblivious to how his "cool outfit" makes him look to others. But the worst one yet was when he accurately told the cops just how big of a threat he is.
