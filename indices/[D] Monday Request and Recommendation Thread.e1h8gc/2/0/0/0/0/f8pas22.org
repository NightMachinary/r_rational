This one can kinda be explained because Rain apparently did something very risky/dumb when he got a rare class and overmana'ed, which allows him to learn really fast. So he can mentally min/max his build mentally because the hardest part is remembering the calculations, not the calculation themselves.

I kinda doubt they don't know math because you need math for all sorts of things: construction, finance, trade, cooking, medicine, manufacturing, tax collection, just off the top of my head. Though I think they don't have a standard system to measure distance either (IIRC everything is "strides" so I'm not sure if that's relative or what). The upper classes could be keeping advanced maths a secret, but that would make life (for them) harder in general.

Or it could be an over-reliance on their system interfaces, that gives them what they need so they only do very basic calculations or just go with what feels right.
