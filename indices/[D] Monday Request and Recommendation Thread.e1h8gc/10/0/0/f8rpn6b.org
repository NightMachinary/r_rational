I kinda liked how the plot was shallow. It was more relatable.

If you think about rational fiction like worm there isn't as much that relates to a regular setting. I am not talking shit, just like emotionally I don't connect with superheros as well. I can emotionally empathize with my tool getting dirty and not working like the swords in goblin Slayer though.
