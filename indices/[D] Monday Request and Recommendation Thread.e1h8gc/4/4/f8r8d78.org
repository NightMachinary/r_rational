"The Iron Teeth" has good world building and features a goblin main character living in a fantasy world. The MC is pretty rational although he's about half alien/animal intelligence. I particularly enjoy the fight scenes in it, they feel realistic to me.

Minor spoiler: if you find Blacknail's limited intelligence grating I encourage you to power through for a while.
