[[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]] takes place in an alternate 1920ies, but the later arcs dive into that sort of stuff a lot.

Premise: The British Crown continued the Frankenstein experiments, and conquered the world with zombie armies. 200 years later, Academies keep pushing the envelope of what's biologically possible, to enhance a ruling class of Nobles. Main characters are a group of Academy projects who were created in vats or from human children. Twig is the story of them growing up.
