Alastair Reynolds does a pretty good far-future transhumanist story - I'd start with Revelation Space.

There's also Richard K. Morgan's Altered Carbon, which explores identity versus body in a world where both can be swapped around at will. Also, ultraviolence.

There's David Brin's Kiln People, which again is all about identity and stuff. Unfortunately it's a one-shot, not a series.

If you just want unrecognizably far future madness, there's Dan Simmons' Hyperion series - it's got tech so far advanced it's basically magic.

Some of Iain M. Banks' novels also deal with identity though I don't know if it's a major theme most of the time; you might particularly like the opening of Excession, though.
