Anime is perfectly fine here. One of the few regularly upvoted content here is a Dragonball Z fanfic and another is a Naruto fanfic. I cant quite remember their names off the top of my head. If you look through the recommendations, recommendations are often categorized by anime work they're based off of.

Goblin Slayer though is one of the mainstream munchkin anime but there not much pushing the boundaries of munchkind.

Yes, its rational but the plot itself is fairly shallow. That could just be the flaws if the translation though. I can count on one hand good translated eastern literature and not a single one of them I would consider good enough to even surpass simple english crack fics.

It's a good introduction to munchkining and rational literature in general.
