I would say they treat sexual violence better than most anime. It's shot to be traumatic and not sexy. The victim has PTSD and gets therepy for.

In most anime constant sexual harrasment and violence is considered a good joke. Look at SAO. Biggest anime of the decade right? Constant poorly handled sexual violence.

You are right it is painful to watch. It should be though. It should not be a comedic life affirming sexual violence like in NGE or Indina Jones. You know?
