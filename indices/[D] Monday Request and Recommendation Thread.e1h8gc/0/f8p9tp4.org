[[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/do0x61/rt_c_ff_demonology_and_the_triphasic_model_of/][It's been recommended here before]], but not in a Monday Request and Recommendation thread, so I'll throw it out:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20177950/chapters/47807593][Demonology and the Tri-Phasic Model of Trauma: An Integrative Approach]] is a fanfic of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Omens_(TV_series)][Good Omens]] TV series, though I've only read the books and didn't miss much.

The premise: After the events in the book, mostly everyone "normal" forgets about the almost-apocalypse. Crowley and Aziraphale move in together. However, Crowley still gets flashbacks to when he drove to Aziraphale's book shop and found it in flames with his partner nowhere nearby. At his partner's urging, he books an appointment with psychotherapist Aubrey Thyme. The story is told from her PoV, and is rational - perhaps even rationalist - in that the characters have their own consistent personalities and goals, their own hangups, and strategies.

The story uses the therapist's PoV very well, in that it talks about the current state of psychotherapeutical research and common strategies. The beginning was especially amusing, because Thyme is a very sharp and observant person, but she has /absolutely/ no frame of reference to approach a literal demon with.

The book managed to keep my interest throughout, and I almost read it in one sitting. It sticks the landing, too, and leaves the characters with a satisfying conclusion.
