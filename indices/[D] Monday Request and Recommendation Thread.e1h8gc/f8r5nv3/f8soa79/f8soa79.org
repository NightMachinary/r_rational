[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31138556-homo-deus][Homo Deus]] is a speculative pop-sci books about the future. It mostly bases itself in how trends from the past are likely to change the future, but isn't particularly optimistic if that's what you're after. It's not an amazing book, but entertaining enough. Picked it up before a 8 hour train trip and never continued where I left off.

If you're okay with fanfiction there's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/psi-effect-aka-chryssalid-writes-a-me-xcom-crossover.303390/][Psi Effect]]. X-com operatives go undercover posing as Asari to infiltrate the Citadel. Everything you mentioned play part in the story, but if you're just after philosophy there's thousands of comments in the two threads discussing everything you talked about. (No knowledge of Mass Effect or X-com required, it's very detached from canon. I read it before I played x-com)
