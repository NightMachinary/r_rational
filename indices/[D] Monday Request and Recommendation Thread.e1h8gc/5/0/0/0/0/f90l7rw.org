Hiccup is, as shown in the movie, both very modern in his views (peace-loving, giving) and his ideas (he invents all sorts of crazy stuff). Combined with some creative cannon interpretation about the laws of the tribe, the Hooligan tribe sets about abolishing slavery, instituting basic human rights, revolutionizing warfare, revolutionizing travel, starting an industrial revolution, and promoting democracy. They don't /quite/ squeak over to such drastic revolutions as steam power or the printing press, but are nevertheless centuries ahead of their time. Inset future texts suggest they completely alter the course of history with their inventions and political views. It strikes me as about as realistic an uplift story you can have without actual future knowledge, just ground-breaking ideas.
