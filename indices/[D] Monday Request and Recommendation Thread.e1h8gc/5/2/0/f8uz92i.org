It was 'abrupt' by Chinese webnovel fan standards, maybe, which is to say it still took a thick Western novel's worth of setup and switched to a more Western-y pacing, where, if the Chinese author's heart was still in it, he could have dragged it out for another year or two.

I thought it was fine.
