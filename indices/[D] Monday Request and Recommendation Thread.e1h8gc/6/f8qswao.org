Word of Prime

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/129874-world-of-prime]]

One of the few Isekai that have an end and I felt satisfied by the end.

The premise is this: isekai in a fantasy world. The world obeys laws of D&D 3.X with few homerules (like EXP being tangible and hence taxable). I like the worldbuilding that has been done here.
