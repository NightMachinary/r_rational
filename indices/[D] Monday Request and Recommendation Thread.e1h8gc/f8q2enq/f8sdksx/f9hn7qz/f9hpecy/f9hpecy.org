Fair statement. I find that a lot of times people have already read all the good books in this genre so I like to suggest stuff that I found entertaining even if I know it's objectively bad. I do think the book gets better after he gets out of school, but it's still mostly a wish fulfillment book. Also my sense of what's good has probably been thoroughly corrupted by years of reading litrpg, webnovels, and questionable fanfiction.

Main reason I liked this one is that the "do-over" genre is really, really tiny and this is the only one that I've found that has a scifi bent to it. Living your life over, but with future knowledge is a fun concept, but I haven't found any decent authors that write it
