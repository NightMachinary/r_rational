I'd like to remove my recommendation for the Lightbringer series by Brent Weeks.. Last book came out, and while it's great and the ending is satisfying I don't think people here would enjoy it. I'll keep it at that to avoid spoilers if needed I can elaborate.

I enjoyed it, and am happy to have read it but I wouldn't recommend it anymore.
