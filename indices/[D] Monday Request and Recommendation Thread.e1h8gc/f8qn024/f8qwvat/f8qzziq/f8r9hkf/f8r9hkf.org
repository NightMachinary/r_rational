My issue was 2-fold: firstly, it feels like 3/4 of the book is internal monologue and/or dialogue between characters rehashing how terrible they are and all the terrible things they have done and figuring out how to move past it and live their lives anyways. On it's own, it's an interesting idea, but it seems like that is the arc of EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER. It gets old pretty fast and means that not very much actually happens, despite the book being pretty long.

My second issue is probably less generalizable: part of what I really liked about the series was the descriptions of interesting/novel ways of using the magic system, which is nearly entirely absent from the last book.

I'm not mad I read it or anything, and the story feels relatively finished, which is nice, but it was definitely a LARGE drop off in quality compared to the earlier books in the series.
