Another theory that immediately came to mind is that a programmer might approach depression the same as any other issue in their profession and try to solve it via research/books. There's no other field I can think of that has as many self-taught professionals alongside college educated ones, and everyone of these are(or should be) used to looking up any problems that arise while coding in order to solve it themselves.
