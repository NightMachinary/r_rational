I have observed a higher-than-normal occurrence of privileged little filter bubble posters on HN than on other sites, yes. There are a lot of people on there that say things like "Just follow your dreams, you'll have a lot more fun and do something worthwhile with your life while you're at it, I wonder what awesome things we'd have if people didn't watch TV all day and did things that they actually enjoyed". Their viewpoint is still poison, just a different kind than you usually see.
