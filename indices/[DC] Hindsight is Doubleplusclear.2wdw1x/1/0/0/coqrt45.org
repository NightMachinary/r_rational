I loved Singularity Sky.

I'd be specifically interested in such a take on 1984, if only because it is such a famous novel. While I think it would be very difficult to do a rationalist version of the actual novel, a sequel or continuation or "20 years later" might be really interesting. Call it "2084" and see how things turned out.
