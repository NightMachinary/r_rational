This was pretty interesting. It makes me ponder if anyone has written a serious fanfic or novel which considers the failure state of the 1984 world. We sort of imagine that after the end of 1984 that the state "won" and might have continues steady-state, but I think that there are plenty of counter-examples in history. That level of tyranny might not be long term sustainable.
