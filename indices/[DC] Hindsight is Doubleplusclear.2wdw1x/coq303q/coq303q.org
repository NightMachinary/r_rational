I enjoyed that a lot. I've lately been thinking that there's a relative dearth of fiction written as nonfiction. [[http://www.tor.com/stories/2011/08/wikihistory][Wikihistory]] definitely comes to mind, as it's in a similar vein.

(To be clear, when I say fiction written as nonfiction I don't just mean with a framing device around a narrative, which a ton of books have - I mean nonfiction as a presentation style, like a reference work that goes along with a subject matter that doesn't exist. /House of Leaves/ or /The Zombie Survival Guide/.)
