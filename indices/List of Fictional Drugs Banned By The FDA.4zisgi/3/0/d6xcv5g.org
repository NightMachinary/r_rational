*LERNERIDOL:*

PROFILE: Moderately effective antidepressant. Engenders the presumed safe delusion that the universe is fundamentally fair, with all bad things eventually compensated by equal amounts of good things.

BANNED BECAUSE: Highly publicized story of a patient flaying themselves alive in the hope that this would result in a date with a certain movie celebrity.

 

*TEGNIFARIL:*

PROFILE: Hair growth pill. Early double-blind studies consistently measured a 3% increase in hair follicle number after each dose, with no sign of plateauing.

BANNED BECAUSE: Universal patient dissatisfaction. Patients claim to have experienced no change, and react with skepticism to any evidence to the contrary. Further study revealed that instead of promoting hair growth, the drug caused the patient to be swapped with a near-identical, hairier version of themselves from a parallel universe.

 

*ACOPANIL:*

PROFILE: A psychoactive drug effective in the treatment of obsessive involuntary musical imagery, or "earworm".

BANNED BECAUSE: A harmful misalignment of incentives was uncovered during its advertising campaign.
