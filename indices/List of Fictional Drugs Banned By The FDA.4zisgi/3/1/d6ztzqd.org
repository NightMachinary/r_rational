*BENJABUTONE*

PROFILE: Skin rejuvenation treatment that removes wrinkles and liver spots.

BANNED BECAUSE: Causes the patient to physically get younger. Prolonged use eventually results in acne, reverse puberty, and death by negative aging.

*SAFFIOL*

PROFILE: Mild painkiller. Appears to operate by stimulating neurotransmitters which are associated with the placebo effect.

BANNED BECAUSE: Response to saffiol is downregulated by the actual placebo effect. For this reason, it is only effective on patients who do not believe it will work.
