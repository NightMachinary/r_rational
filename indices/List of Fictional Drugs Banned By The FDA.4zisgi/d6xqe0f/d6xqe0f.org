It was the title not the list that made me think that. Once I started to read the list I realized it probably wasn't real.

And I don't really know much about the FDA, but my mind might be too quick to jump to the assumption of "crazy people being crazy", since I've seen so many examples of crazy people being crazy. When I read a rationality blog like slate star codex, which often talks about crazy people being crazy, a part of my mind expects the blog to talk a lot about crazy people being crazy, so when I see a title like "Fictional Drugs Banned by the FDA," my first thought is something along the lines of "The FDA has some crazy people being crazy."

Another suboptimal heuristic I have (albeit nowhere near as habitual and common for me to use as that last one), is that power corrupts people, so if someone has a lot of power than there is a significant probability that they will abuse it. This heuristic is not as reliable as it first seems like it should be, and it might have also contributed to my initial impression of the title "Fictional Drugs banned by the FDA."
