Is this for real? As in, the FDA actually takes the time to write up legislation banning drugs that don't even exist? OMG!

Edit: I just did a quick google search and haven't found any evidence that the FDA bans fictional drugs. So I think what slatestarcodex meant to say was fictional (drugs banned by the FDA) and not (fictional drugs) banned by the FDA.

The brain tumor one was horrifying.
