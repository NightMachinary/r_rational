(shrugs) I thought it was an interesting deconstruction, since it's explicitly shown in canon (Kankurou vs. Naruto/Konohamaru and Chiyo vs. Sasori) that chakra strings can be used in this fashion, without preparation.

In some other story (I think it was /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5166693][Scorpion's Disciple]]/), Sasori explicitly says, "Chakra strings can be attached /only/ to prepared seals. If you could attach chakra strings to anything without preparation, puppetry would be the /least/ of chakra strings' uses." So it's nice to see different interpretations of canon.
