  (shrugs) I thought it was an interesting deconstruction, since it's explicitly shown in canon (Kankurou vs. Naruto/Konohamaru and Chiyo vs. Sasori) that chakra strings can be used in this fashion, without preparation.

True, they can certainly be useful in the same way that telekinesis can be useful. But just for the most egregious examples...

- Penetrating the otherwise impenetrable seal on the Ororchimaru v Hokage fight at the chunin exam
- Reaching "hundreds of miles" to allow Naruto to basically play an RTS, controlling an entire army consciously and fully without even using shadow clones for parallel processing
- Ripping Kusanagi out of Orochimaru's gut. (if this works, why not just rip out the organs of all of your opponents from the other side of the continent?)
- Sealing human beings inside objects for storage to kidnap them without ever being within sensory range of them. Including Sannin and Kage level opponents. Guess literally nobody else ever thought of that or how to counter it.
- On that note, he's got mastery level sealing skills without ever being trained in it.

Some things are alright, the deconstruction of the lack of secrecy in Ninja culture as shown in Naruto is good, the training of his team to be actual ninja is also good.

But nothing ever seems to even remotely challenge him, except his short meeting with Sasori who I can already tell is going to be his only real challenge because puppets are just so good guys I swear.
