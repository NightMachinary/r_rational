It feels a lot like With This Ring in +that+ many respects. It hasn't really explored much of anything thus far, though. But yeah, missing name + no soul, DC universe, ring on arrival... this is a WTR-fanfic.

(side note: Not necessarily a bad thing! WTR is good, people should read that if they aren't already; The story-only thread seems intimidatingly long but honestly each post [posted daily!] is pretty short, and the whole thing is usually really good.)
