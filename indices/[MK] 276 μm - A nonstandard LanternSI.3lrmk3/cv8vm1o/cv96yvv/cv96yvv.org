  Naruto's Compensation

So, I greatly enjoyed People Lie, and also thought Time Braid was well written, so I went to read the above assuming it would be of similar quality.

It really, really isn't. It reads like it was written by a 14 year old. The grammar isn't bad, but the plot is mediocre and the descriptions vague. Puppets are seen as a badly-explained solution to all problems, and the obviously most powerful ninja technique evar.

Naruto self-teaches himself to Kage level power by age 12, etc.

The answer to literally every problem is 'chakra strings'.

I'm only halfway through it at this point, but I can't see it getting much better.
