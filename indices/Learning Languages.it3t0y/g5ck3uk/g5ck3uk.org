I can't offer any learning resources, as really the only way to do it is dedicated study (and /really/ the only way is immersion). I disagree with [[/u/CoffeeCakeGlaze]] that structured classroom learning is totally useless--I got pretty good at French by taking classes all through high school and college, though the HS classes really only provided bare fundaments and I didn't become truly fluent until I lived in France. Then again, my college French classes (even before studying abroad) essentially were immersion, as they were taught entirely in French and involved a good bit of discussion with classmates.

I guess I might suggest finding a tutor and/or discussion group, as I don't believe any piece of software will do the job.

I do have some book recs though, both academic and fictional. These are more on the subject of linguistics and language in general rather than specific languages.

- /The Stuff of Thought/ by Steven Pinker explores two predominant theories about the neurological origin of language, and presents the author's hybrid model. Pinker is an excellent writer (and is taking some flak right now for what I think is a reasonable warning about "intellectual purity" gates in contemporary left-wing discourse).

- /Women, Fire and Dangerous Things/ by George Lakoff explores how different languages utilize categories, and how that usage shapes their worldview and brain structure. Discusses among other things color words and directional schema (i.e. absolute like our compass model vs. relative like a mountain-dwelling society's "upslope/downslope").

- /The Flame Alphabet/ by Ben Marcus is a novel about a man trying to figure out why children's speech has become toxic to adults. Not at all scientific, but rational in its own right--Marcus is an author who consistently writes books operating on bizarre, nightmarish rulesets that are only ever described partially or implicitly.
