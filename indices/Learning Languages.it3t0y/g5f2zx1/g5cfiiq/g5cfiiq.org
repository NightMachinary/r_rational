Everything I've seen so far suggests that structured classroom learning (textbooks, explicit grammar study, tests, etc.) is absolutely useless for anything other than crystallizing what you already know. [Epistemic status: personal anecdotes], though.

I've learned English /purely/ via immersion, and without ever being in an English-speaking country or speaking to a native---only by consuming English media (TV, games, YouTube, internet) until I magically started to understand. The compulsory English lessons at school? Completely ignored, I spent the vast majority of the lessons sketching in my notebook or playing with my smartphone, never did any homework, and did everything on tests (including grammar) by intuition and what /felt/ right. Still got one of the best grades in my class. And the classmates that were just as good, or better, than me? They learned the same way. The /only/ classmate I remember that learned English the 'proper' classroom way, /without/ immersing on the side, never amounted to anything despite being very dedicated and studious, and was pretty much one of the worst in class (only a bit better than those that neither studied nor immersed).

I see this sentiment all over the place whenever the topic of ESL comes up on the internet---a /lot/ of people learned English by watching shitty native YouTube videos all day purely for entertainment in their mid-late teens (so often beyond the famed super young age at which supposedly learning languages is far easier). I started probably somewhere around 14, and it took me like ~4-5 years of immersion to basically understand literally everything thrown my way. I never cared about speaking, so to this day I have a shitty accent and can't really talk without stuttering and grasping for words... but I'm literally more comfortable with /writing/ in English than in my native language, and my inner monologue is pretty much all in English. And if I ever wanted to learn more, it wouldn't really be /language/ learning anymore---I'd just practice speaking the same way a native would.

After I became comfortable enough with English to pretty much consider it 'learned' (and yes, you do eventually reach that point---I hate the meme that you "never stop learning a language" and "will always find something you don't understand". It's technically true, but usually used as a weird defeatist-apologist statement for people who tried to learn something but failed), I just started applying the same principles to Japanese. No surprises here, considering the demographic of this sub and reddit in general, right? Anyway, I used Anki to memorize some vocabulary and half-heartedly breezed through a grammar guide to get some context (took like ~4 months), yes, but after that I just read shitty Japanese Light Novels one hour daily for a year and watched a ton of native YouTube and stuff like that. I'm still not fluent, obviously. I'd wager it will take me the same amount of time English took, so 4 or 5 years. But I can already pretty much read Light Novels with a dictionary on the side /for entertainment/ and lose myself in the plot and character the same way when I read in English, so I don't really care. At this point, no matter what I do, so long as I keep consuming raw weeb stuff, I'll become fluent, so no worries about the efficiency or whatever.

All this stuff is widely known in the Japanese learning community in the form of AJATT and MIA (and Antimoon for English), but I still believe they overthink it /way/ too much, what with their focus on being as optimal as possible, when it really doesn't matter that much. Like the /djt/ says, just read more. It really /does/ work.
