I'm interested in what your level was when you started reading light novels. I'm currently learning Chinese and have a basic understanding of the grammar and know maybe 50 words. This seems clearly not enough to start reading something (I tried briefly but it really wasn't fun as I had to look up basically every word). So I'm wondering how many words I need to know.

(Btw, concerning English pronunciation, this channel really helped me: [[https://www.youtube.com/c/rachelsenglish]] . In particular her series on the sounds of English. It /massively/ improved my pronunciation. One of my goals was to be able to use speech recognition reliably and I can do that now.)
