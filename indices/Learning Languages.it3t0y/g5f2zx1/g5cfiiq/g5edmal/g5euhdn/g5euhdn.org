Thanks for the channel recommendation, I'll check it out.

I """knew""" roughly ~4k words when I started (according to Anki stats, realistically it was probably like ~2k). I still needed to look up roughly one word per sentence though, and I started on the most amateurish and simplistic web novels possible. But I had a relatively high patience for that, and using a hover-on dictionary is much more comfortable than Googling the words individually, so it wasn't /that/ bad. Took me a month to get used to that method of reading, but was pretty fun after that. Unfortunately, there's really no easy way to know when you're ready, and I've even seen some hardcore immersion learners advocate for going all cold turkey and starting reading /without/ any vocab memorized, so I doubt the exact number will help you. You pretty much need to just keeping learning vocab while regularly testing yourself against something relatively simple until you think you can take it.

(I never cared about grammar at all---I just lazily breezed through a couple of grammar guides, online posts, and YouTube videos, and then stopped caring and just let context teach me.)
