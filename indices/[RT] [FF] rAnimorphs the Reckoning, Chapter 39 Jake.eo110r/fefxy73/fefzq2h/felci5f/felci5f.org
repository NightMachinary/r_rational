I've been thinking about this peculiar quality and am wondering; does this come down to the fact that Andalites have thought speech? With most species a yeerk can cut off information flow from it's host as it sees fit, just stop touching that part of the brain. But in an Andalites thought speech can always effect the yeerk. What's more, thought speech has been said to sound like one's own inner voice. Given that, the facct that a yeerk might lose track of where it's thoughts are actually coming from makes a certain amount of sense.

The only way for the Visser to remember himself at this point would be to leave Alloran for a bit, and do some good old fashion goal factoring. But that's not an option anymore, is it?
