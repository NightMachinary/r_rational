Broke my immersion. The word is too conceptually reified. Jake's a basketball jock with good intuition, so even the Harry Potter references are kind of pushing it, and this goes much further than them. It's entirely reasonable that he'd have a similar sentiment, regarding Andalite attitudes towards unconventional ways of thinking, but he wouldn't voice that via the shibboleths of modern online social justice movements.

I also worry that Andalites might be being Flanderized, relative to their earlier characterization in the story. It was almost universally acknowledged that Elfangor was a genius, idiosyncratic yet incredibly effective. That doesn't fit well with the idea that they dislike neurodiversity per se.

  The alien slumped, dropping his torso even closer to the ground, hiding his main eyes completely.

Why would Helium be ashamed of the attitude that those who are weak or different should be condemned? That's not a part of his culture. Even though he is personally a unique exception, would be condemned by Andalite society for diverging from their Path, it doesn't follow that he'd adopt all the norms of a modern enlightened liberal universalist in a bundle. It's coherent to be Darwinist and also be a hivemind.

  It wasn't surprising. Not really. From the things Ax had told me, Andalite groupthink was incredibly powerful---what the crowd believed just was the apparent truth, a lot of the time, as difficult to question as the color of the sky.

  And if Alloran was a beloved hero, a tragic martyr, a perfect specimen of Andalite nobility and genius---

  Well, then, of course he wouldn't have had anything to do with shit-rats.

Pretty disdainful, for Jake. Rejecting that mindset, yes. Failing to see its pull, no.

#+begin_quote
  There was no anger or frustration. There was, if anything, a begrudging respect, tinging the boundaries of a larger surprise. He would not have thought Telor capable of self-sacrifice, had made no plans for that contingency, except in the general sense of having readied himself for disasters of similar---and greater---magnitude.

Shouldn't the Visser be more disdainful? Self-sacrifice is the antithesis of what he stands for.

  They were not, precisely, the source of his unease. They were watching, certainly; interfering, without question---but they had yet to impede him directly in any detectable fashion, and while he would not claim that he had tried everything, still he had spent long weeks endeavoring to divine their intentions, to provoke unambiguous response, and thus far all for nothing. If they intended to reveal themselves, it would clearly be at a time of their choosing; what plans could be made in ignorance, what defenses set against their sight and their reach, he had already done.

It is curious that the gods would appear to the Animorphs but not to the Visser, now that I think about it. I guess that means that the Visser is more stable, less susceptible to being influenced by minute changes in his environment.

#+begin_quote
  He was not one person.

  He was not one person, and never had been. Alloran had always been the enemy of Esplin, and Esplin the enemy of Alloran, and the hostility between them had not ended, had merely gone quiet, and somehow he had not noticed, because---

  Because he felt like one person.

  Not in words, the thought. More a feeling, a formless confusion, and along with it a sudden ratcheting of his awareness, a stepping-back of perspective.

  His goal---the goal, the true goal, the only goal that made actual sense---

  He had thought---he supposed---that Alloran had converted, seen the wisdom of the quest and dropped his petty, personal resistance. He must have thought that, at the time, only he couldn't actually remember---

  (Flagged.)

  And now came the true dread, the rising horror, for the creature that was the Visser turned his stalks inward, searching, searching, and finding---

  Nothing.

  There was no clear division within himself, no two agents arguing---just himself, a tangled mass of fear and confusion, ambition and fury. He was Esplin, and he was Alloran, and he remembered both, remembered being both, but the two had fused, and both were in control---he was in control, no part of him any less than any other---

I have a hard time buying this. There's a fundamental asymmetry between Yeerk and host according to everything we've seen so far. Even if Alloran is in the top .01% of individualistic Andalites, that shouldn't give him the power to merge himself with the brain parasite. Plus, why would he choose this moment to use such a trick? How would the Visser not having previously noticed it would occur? It feels like a last-minute plot device.
