Jumble of thoughts as I read the chapter:

#+begin_quote
  They noticed, and as he watched himself through their eyes, he could see that they were taking it, on some level, as evidence of distance. Of judgment. Of other-ness. That his apparent calm meant that he was not-like-them, not-one-of-them.

Let's take a moment to appreciate that Jake is seeing into the mind of these Andalites, via the eib through Alloran, via the Leeran hypersight through Quatazhinnikon, via morph-control.

  I was as sure as I'd ever been that somewhere deep inside of Visser Three, the part of him that was Alloran was biding his time. Waiting his chance. Doing everything he could to throw a wrench in the works, to nudge things into place for an eventual fall from grace. I was as sure as I'd ever been that Alloran, of all people, would never, ever give up the fight.

I'm not entirely sure how Jake got here from "Alloran is able to see past 1984-type bullshit", other than "well, I guess that means he's a super-competent rationalist badass and of course a super-competent rationalist badass would be like this." Maybe that was the intent, but otherwise I didn't quite follow the leap.

Switching to Visser's POV... are we in his head via Jake and Quatazhinnikon? That was my first thought, but as the memory progresses, it seems like it's too new to be in Quatazhinnikon's memory, unless I've got the timeline confused.

welp that escalated quickly, but then, so has this whole fic so

CRY. CRY YOUR HEART OUT JAKE YOU NEED IT.

  One further promise he made himself, in unison across all of his various bodies---that, should the estimated odds of critical failure for plans not involving the Earth drop below one in seven, he would immediately trigger the destruction of the planet and establish a permanent blockade over the Z-space bridge.
#+end_quote

Visser Three determining his criterion for sacrificing the earth reminds me of the conversation chapter 37 Marco', where they discuss the criterion for when to sacrifice the earth, and that quote,

#+begin_quote
  “If we are being jerked around,” he said. “By the Ellimist, or Crayak, or whoever---if you're trying to trick somebody into blowing up the world, it's a lot easier to get them to flip the switch if they're already willing. If they've already made up their mind what would get them to do it.”
#+end_quote

Particularly noteworthy given Visser's own concerns about being "jerked around".

Furthermore, I don't know how literal Visser is being with his one-in-seven figure - if he's really doing numerical calculations on the odds of "critical failure for plans not involving the Earth" - but I can't help but notice that one-in-seven is kind of an arbitrary number which clearly results ultimately from Andalite convention.

Great chapter, thanks for writing as always.
