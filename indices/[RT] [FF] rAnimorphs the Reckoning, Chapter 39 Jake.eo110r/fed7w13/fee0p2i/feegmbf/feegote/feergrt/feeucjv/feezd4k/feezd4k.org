I think a big part of the reason this whole story is so interesting to me is this whole exploration of what "self" means. And the /reason/ that interests me is because it's somehow an idea I've never explored in myself.

I've /always/ been of the default assumption that I should forever continue to learn more and grow, but it's only been in the last couple of years that I've realised that "acquiring knowledge" isn't actually doing anything for me and I've attempted to shift into self-improvement.

But I'm also coming to the realisation that I don't know what my "self" even is at this point. I don't know what I want to be. I don't quite have that guiding star. In that Rachel chapter, seeing the drift between her current self and her "previous" self, she had the revelation about the sculpture/sculptor thing, and also realised that her previous self had no concept of the sculptor at all. She wasn't really shaping herself, she was just... /being/. Growth was happening, but there was no intention or direction behind it.

That's kinda where I am now. I'm starting to become aware that I /can/ shape myself, but I'm yet to decide what I should be shaping myself /into/, and that's causing me a bit of anxiety. That anxiety has been present for years, but thanks to this story exploring those concepts I at least now have a concept of what that anxiety is actually /about/.

I came for the Animorphs nostalgia, stayed for the writing, and now find myself questioning my sense of self. No idea if any of that was intentional on your part, but your sharing inspired me to share. (I also feel obligated to condense some of this writing into a review, now)
