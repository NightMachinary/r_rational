I am intrigued that Seerow's backdoor has shifted from being 'read the morph's mind' in an early Esplin chapter to 'use the god computer' now. NB I didn't bother to reread the earlier chapter but remembered the previous use of the phrase so maybe Esplin meant the same thing both times and I misinterpreted it the first time.

The anecdote about Mertil was <i>extremely</i> interesting. If we could have a whole 'the life and times of Alloran-Semitur-Corass', I would be delighted. It also coincidentally marks a return to what I had taken to be important, the question of Alloran Vs Esplin.

I don't watch Rick and Morty and welcome a fun explanation of what Scenario 4 is in that context.
