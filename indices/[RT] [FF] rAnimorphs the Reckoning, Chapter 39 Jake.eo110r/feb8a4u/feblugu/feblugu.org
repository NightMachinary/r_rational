Previously Esplin thought of "Alloran's little backdoor" to refer to being able to access a morph's mind; "Seerow's backdoor" is how the Visser is now thinking of the way-into-the-hypercomputer which Seerow initially found and used to build the morphing tech.

I might benefit from switching up the phrasing since it's Esplin/Visser's thought both times, and the same word "backdoor."

In a Rick and Morty episode featuring recorded memories, two characters accidentally erase their entire episodic memories and a third character, witnessing their confusion, says "is this a Scenario Three?" After the two characters reveal that they have no idea what that even means, the third character goes "Oh---it's a Scenario /Four/."
