Oh man, Alloran hit HARD.

From what I understood of Esplin's goals, Alloran sabotaged them real good. The way I see it, Esplin is dead (so is Alloran, really) and his goals are kaput. That doesn't make this new "Visser" character and his clones any less dangerous though.

I am a little confused about his plans now, though, and I guess most of it was in place before he died. So I guess I'm also questioning Esplin's original goal. Is it his goal to rule the universe? (Seems absurd). Wipe out any threat to his continued existence (basically everyone in the universe)? Make everyone in the universe Visser-controlled? Achieve godhood (now that he is fully aware of their existence)?
