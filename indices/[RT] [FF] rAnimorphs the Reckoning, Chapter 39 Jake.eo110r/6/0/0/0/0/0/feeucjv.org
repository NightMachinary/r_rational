Both V3 (and, to be honest, me) resolve this with something like a "sculptor/sculpture" distinction, as referenced in text by both Esplin and Rachel.

Yeah. The idea being that there's some /Platonic ideal/ of who-you-are or what-you're-trying-to-accomplish. It may be only partially clear to you, and your methods of moving toward it may be only partially effective, but you have a "statue" in mind, a kind of guiding star, and so as you carve away the marble, the ever-changing present-day "you" evolves according to a known principle or principles.

And as you get clearer "sight" on this vision-of-you-and-your-goals (that's treated as sort of having always existed, outside of yourself), maybe you make some updates to the plan, "moving a foot" metaphorically, or trying out some entirely new process for sculpting. But these changes are sort of backwards-compatible in that past-you would have endorsed and embraced them at any point (and if past-you /wouldn't/ have, then present-you doesn't, either, until more work can be done).

So V3 looks at a range of possible behaviors, say, and can evaluate some of them as /clearly/ alien/not-him (he doesn't give a shit about swathes of flowers on a hillside, the way Quatazhinnikon does; nor would he create a continent's-worth of monsters just to watch them fight). Other behaviors are clearly familiar/him-shaped (like pursuing biological immortality). He's indifferent to, or ambivalent about, behaviors that don't clearly break down along these lines, but as he grows and gets more experiences under his belt, he'll be more and more opinionated about which ones were wasteful or purposeless, and which ones "qualify" as part of what he's trying to sustain and keep going with his life extension efforts.

(I want to be able to keep building LEGO spaceships basically forever, or some updated, more sophisticated future equivalent, but I'm not super interested in preserving my own ability to derive extremely mild hedonistic enjoyment from extremely unhealthy foods. One of these I would "cut out" of my own code, given the chance; the Visser just thinks he has the right (nay, the /moral obligation/) to cut things out of /other/ people's codes, too.)

Thus, for instance, the model of Ender Wiggin that twelve-year-old me carried around on his shoulder and asked for advice from time to time knew nothing of the Sequences or of Circling or whatever, but /the instant I became aware of those things,/ it was clear that the Platonic Ender definitely had those in his toolkit/endorsed them. Picking them up was a change to the sculpture-of-me, but it was also largely mundane within the scope of the larger plan. I was just "becoming more myself," according to a preset and unchanging vision of what-the-ideal-Duncan-looks like.

(Even though past Duncan /didn't know/ that he had deficits in the specific arenas of rationality or interpersonal relating, and wouldn't have been able to predict them in anything but general terms.)
