I hope it's okay for me to feel, like, super proud about this, and grateful to you for sharing.

As far as deciding what you "should" be shaping yourself into, if I might offer a piece of advice, it would be something like: practice building up the /yes, that's it/ skill within yourself. Like, the skill of noticing when a phrase perfectly matches an emotion, or when a proposed meal perfectly matches the hunger you're feeling.

I think you're most likely to find fulfillment (rather than disappointment or failure or discontent) along a path where you /recognize/ what you "should be trying to shape yourself into" rather than generating it from whole cloth.

Like, when I first encountered the character Ender, the overwhelming feeling was "ahhhhhhh, /that's/ it." It felt familiar, not new.

I bet the "optimal path" for you will feel familiar, at least a little bit. It'll be like putting on an old shoe that still fits perfectly. And the skill of /recognizing/ your own psyche's response of "yes that's it" is one that a lot of people are rusty with, and can improve by trying.
