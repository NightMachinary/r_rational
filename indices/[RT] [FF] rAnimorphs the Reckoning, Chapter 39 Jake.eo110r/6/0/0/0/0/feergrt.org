I understand that perspective, but I'm still struggling with how flawed it is. (And I get that it's probably the whole point from an author perspective).

He wants to continue to live, as he is right now. If his values change he considers that a failure because he is no longer him. But what constitutes a value change? Every moment he is alive, he's taking in new information, processing it and adjusting his trajectory based on that information. Does that not mean he has grown as an individual? That he is "greater" than he was yesterday, even if it is by the most miniscule of amounts?

I guess that from his perspective, growth and even value drift may be acceptable, as long as it's still him in control of it. If his multiple clones start drifting in different directions that's a problem because then they are different individuals and therefore in competition.

This new thought process he has discovered with an inner conflict disturbs him because he feels Alloran may be responsible for it (which he likely is). He rejects the notion of what he sees as a foreign invasion into his thoughts, even as he is unable to distinguish any of those thoughts as foreign.

I kinda lost what my point was going to be, just processing the information for myself "out loud" I guess.
