  How would you go about healing the Visser?

I think he could use some empathy. From [[/u/DaystarEld]] 's post below:

  Who could I possibly identify with, except one who would apply the same labels of good and bad as I, and in the same proportions, and with the same actions resulting in response? If I brought about a being greater than myself in every way, and that being chose what I would not have chosen---not in specific, not as a result of greater perception, but in principle---then I would have failed, and killed myself in the process.

We have 7 Visser clones running around now. Funny coincidence - we have a bunch of Marclones too. Bet the Visser would find that interesting...but that's tangential. Who could the Visser possibly identify with? Himself. Excellent, there's 6 others who now meet this criteria. Each clone will struggle to find an alternative to 'dissolution or death'. I have no doubt that every clone would help the other(s) survive, but what happens if there were a situation where there are two clones but only one can survive? That could be an interesting compare and contrast to the Marclones chapters.

The Visser failed to plan for Telor's self-sacrifice in this recent chapter. Is it because the idea of self-sacrifice is unthinkable to him?
