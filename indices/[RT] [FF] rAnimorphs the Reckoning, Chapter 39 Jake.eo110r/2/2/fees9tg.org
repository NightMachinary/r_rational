(Haven't read the other replies yet. Also, I'm not sure I'm answering the question as intended, but no harm in trying.)

So I think my main reaction is that I'm not sure I'd expect this to be possible. I mostly just feel like the Visser has fundamental values that are incompatible with mine, and that means he needs to be "fixed" from my perspective but from his perspective he's just fine.

With a human there's the concept of "be the best you you can be" which isn't necessarily your /current/ you, with the implication that you can change to better encapsulate your own values, and to some extent your values will change while doing this but your current values endorse that in some sense. (And also sometimes people change in ways that their current selves approve of but their past selves wouldn't.)

And something like that could apply to the Visser. But I'm not sure I'd be very good at figuring out what "a better you" means for a human, and the Visser isn't human. (His Yeerk flesh was brought together before human contact IIRC, so he hasn't even absorbed any human that way.) So even if it does apply, I think I'm out of my depth.

Also, I don't know if the result of this would be less likely to kill everyone, or if "try to make the Visser less likely to try to kill everyone" is even at all the point of the exercise.

Still, if I were to try...

One thing I might try would be "don't you think the universe would be more interesting if there were other things left alive in it?" With the hope that he then comes to value other living things for their own sake. But I basically expect that to fail to convince him. It would be a pretty astonishing coincidence if the best way he can keep himself entertained, is by not destroying everything I love.

More promising, though I'm still not hopeful: he kind of seems to value self-preservation to a literally impossible extent. Like it's not clear that past him would endorse current him as a continuation of himself; or that current him would endorse clone-hims-in-the-near-fduture; or even that current him would endorse current-him-in-the-near-future. (How old is he? A few human years? No way he's done growing, whether he likes it or not.)

So if I can convince him of that... there's nothing that says a being's fundamental values can't be fundamentally unsatisfiable. But it's the sort of thing that might cause them to shift to fundamentally valuing something different, which might be more stable and /hopefully/ less likely to try to kill everyone. (Or, in humans, it might turn them into nihilists. But sometimes nihilists become hilists, as well.)
