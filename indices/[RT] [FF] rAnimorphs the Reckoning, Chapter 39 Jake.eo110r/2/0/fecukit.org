So it feels like the biggest block in the way of a peaceful r!V3 is his megalomania/ego. He's actually /worse/ than r!Voldemort because I could conceivably see r!V being content with true immortality and matching intellects to challenge/play with him, while r!V3 also has the urge to expand himself: to actually /be everywhere./ Like his end goal is not just to ensure immortality + duplication + non-value-drift, but he would not in fact be satisfied with r!V's endgame because other versions of himself challenging each other for funsies implies other versions of himself with too many potential differences for him to feel safe. He wants to be a single-minded super-organism.

This seems best spelled out from chapter 38:

  There pulsed within me the Yeerkish drive to expand---to spread and conquer, to pull all that I could into my own experience, to touch reality at every point. But there was also within me a deep and unrelenting horror of unbecoming---of waking up one day and not even noticing that I had ceased to be myself. Perhaps it came from Alloran---or perhaps it was the work of the gods, a subtle intervention in the chaotic moment when I was neither still Cirran, nor yet Esplin---but it had been with me since the beginning, had fueled my efforts from the very first, from that frantic moment of panic when I realized that I had but a single cycle to find an alternative source of kandrona before being forced to choose between dissolution and death.

  All right, you might think, as I had in that desperate beginning. Find a way to duplicate yourself, then, and form a coalescion out of that.

  And indeed, this was the first of the favors I had begged from Quatazhinnikon, in exchange for my vigil over his fragile kingdom. Yet as we drew closer to success, I began to realize---

  If you take an insect and double its size, it will not survive---it will fall from the sky---be unable to breathe---chemical reactions inside of it will cease as molecules drop from cellular receptors that no longer fit.

  In the same way, if you take a set of traits and double them, you will no longer have the same person, for all that the relative relationships between those traits remain constant. Different traits have different payoff matrices---they result in different rewards at different strengths. If a person possesses trait A at eighty percent of its effective maximum, and trait B at forty percent, then upon doubling that person will find trait B more influential to their overall personality than before, as A hits its ceiling and B closes the gap. This is a simplistic example, more false than true, but it is generally instructive---one who has become both twice as angry and twice as patient is not in any sense the same, and the nature of Yeerks is such that twice the flesh is twice the personality.

  And if you desire to spread across a universe---to persist across trillions of bodies, last for trillions of revolutions---to double and double and double again, without end---then even the tiniest such differences will eventually be magnified to tremendous scales, shifting one's priorities---and therefore one's self---in unpredictable ways. It had been the work of a moment to separate Esplin from Cirran, and in that moment, Cirran had doomed itself---I share almost none of its values, and the universe I would bring about is not one that it would have chosen. I dared not allow the same fate to befall me.

  For what is an individual, if not the effect it would have upon reality? Who could I possibly identify with, except one who would apply the same labels of good and bad as I, and in the same proportions, and with the same actions resulting in response? If I brought about a being greater than myself in every way, and that being chose what I would not have chosen---not in specific, not as a result of greater perception, but in principle---then I would have failed, and killed myself in the process.

What's not clear to me, and I guess my first question that needs Word of God: does this urge actually include the need to conquer all other sapience? Does he want to be THE only sapience? Or if he were assured of /true immortality/, would he then be okay to share the world with lesser beings, or equals-that-could-not-harm-him?
