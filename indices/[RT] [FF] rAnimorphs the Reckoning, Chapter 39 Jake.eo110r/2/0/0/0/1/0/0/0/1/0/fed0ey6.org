Yeah, I think those people are crazy. Like, I can sort of force myself to imagine what they mean, but it's like forcing myself to imagine that There Are Five Lights or something.

I do not think there are quality differentials or pacing differentials exceeding ... 15 percent? ... between any of the Jordan-written books. Sometimes the world slows down, and it's sometimes /right/ to show that rather than cutting to Six Months Later; Harry Potter VII wouldn't be as good of a book without the Forest of Dean because the Forest of Dean is a crucible for his character. I know which books in Wheel of Time have fewer events in them, and I reread those just as often.

Or, to put it another way, it's like those people are saying "Yeah, actually, you can skip the whole first fifteen or twenty minutes of 2001: A Space Odyssey, it's just some monkeys being influenced by an alien artifact."

Like ?????? You're talking about skipping ... /why?/ Are you ... are you not actually along for this ride??

Like if you only want to take part in a Circling circle while it's being /about/ something, or like if you only want to play soccer in the playoff games, but you don't want to go to practices or play skirmishes or lesser games. Or like saying "you can skip all the parts of Fight Club that are about, like, this weird relationship, and get back to the fighting, which is the whole point."

The people who say those things /don't like Wheel of Time./ It's not that Wheel of Time has failed them; it's that they were expecting something that it isn't (something it consistently was, and stayed, the whole time).

In rationalspeak, they can't pass Wheel of Time's ITT. They can't express what it's trying to be sufficiently well that their criticism is then actually valid critique; they're criticizing it according to standards it's not trying to meet. Like complaining that Moby Dick doesn't have enough action, or Star Wars enough awareness of intersectionality and the gritty realities of institutional injustice.

Disliking it is fine, btw. People can change their minds about a movie half an hour in. It's just not a sign that Wheel of Time has betrayed them or whatever.

If I bite into lasagna and I taste ricotta cheese, I don't blame the lasagna, even if the ricotta cheese wasn't visible from the outside. /It's a lasagna./
