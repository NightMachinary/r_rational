So, as I conceive of him, he definitely wants immortality /and/ omnipotence in the sense of being able to reshape the universe as he sees fit.

But he's demonstrated a willingness to share the world with lesser beings already, in his compact with the Arn and his attempts to forge a pact with the Chee. He doesn't love the idea, but it's thinkable, and even actable-onnable, if the tradeoffs are right.

He wants the resources of the universe to flow according to what seems, to him, to be the constrained obvious correct answer. He's not actually making all that many /choices/---he has an algorithm of sorts that is merciless; once you see what /should/ be done, that's what you /must/ do.

Most of his hatred/despising of other individuals and groups comes from what he sees as their /ineffectuality/---that they're not even /being/ what they're nominally trying to be.

I imagine he could probably tolerate a universe full of /effective/ Others, provided that their existence didn't impinge upon his own lifespan or liberty. Or at least, that's a thing he would probably admit even now, prior to any healing.
