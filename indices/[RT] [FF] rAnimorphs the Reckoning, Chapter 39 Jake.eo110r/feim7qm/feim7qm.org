So glad to see this update again! Jake's a lot smarter than he gives himself credit for, and I like the backstory for Alloran.

The tone in the Visser sections is interesting to me because even though it's in the third person, it's very much his voice. And this

/But the enemy had rolled those cubes for him/

seems like a humanism that he's trying to invoke but slightly missing the mark with. While this

/and there were enough/ */fucknesses/* /surrounding the situation on Earth/

is highlighted as a humanism in-text. Why is he doing that? Is David still in there somewhere? That seems like a much worse downgrading than fusing closer to Alloran.

/Donna Marina was also in play/

I would think Marco's mom would blanch at having a president during an alien invasion named that.
