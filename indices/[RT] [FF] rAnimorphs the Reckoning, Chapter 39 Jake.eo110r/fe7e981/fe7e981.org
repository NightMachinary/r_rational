I feel like Visser Three totally avoided reaching the most important conclusion due to a mental blindspot.

Visser Three's prime motivating goal has always been preservation and persistence of his personal identity and sense of self. This was why he always refused to return to a Yeerk pool like other yeerks - he didn't want any pieces added to or subtracted from his identity. He wanted to remain himself, always, forever.

Yet upon discovering drastic and radical changes to his identity and sense of self, which occurred without his prior notice, his main concern now is how it will impact his future plans and actions. Rather than being alarmed at this failure in his foremost overarching aim, and re-evaluating on the basis of that failure.

Visser Three cites "Know victory" as a central creed. Yet he has lost, and still doesn't even notice that while he stares it in the face.
