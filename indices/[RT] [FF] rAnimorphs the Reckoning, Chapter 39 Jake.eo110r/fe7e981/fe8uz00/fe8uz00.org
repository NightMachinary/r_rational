Oh damn. As if one Visser Three wasn't bad enough. Now we have seven of them.

I was surprised there was one on the Andalite home world. That seems like a bad sign for the Andalites, both that he was able to put a Visser there and that they now have a Visser there.

I do wonder how well he's going to be able to collaborate with his duplicates. For now they have basically the same memories, but soon those will begin to diverge. For now he sees them as him, but that may not last. He's not even sure how well he can collaborate with /himself/.

(I suppose that periodically having them all hang out together with a Leeran could help there, if they can arrange that in time.)

Errata:

#+begin_quote
  (Those being the ones which had not been vulnerable to straightforward splicing and reprogramming, and which now went dark and dormant, awaiting the Visser's instructions.)
#+end_quote

I take it the ones that went dark and dormant were actually the ones that /had/ been vulnerable?
