  However, I think that the state of being at war with yourself is just, in a sense, the default state of all intelligent beings. Intelligences are composed of subsystems with their own simple "goals," and the goals of the higher level system emerge from the competition of the lower level goals. Inner conflict seems to be integrated into the algorithm for intelligence by default

Broadly I agree with this.

In the original Animorphs canon, it was pointed out as something unique to humans (or Earth). [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/7jm32a/text_animorphs_an_alien_discovers_our/][Here's the passage, for reference]].

Rather than this being unique to humans though, in this canon I see that perhaps the yeerks are unique in lacking this (this is just a theory I'm working off at the moment). I imagine an initial yeerk pool as an unintelligent organism; a stagnant pool of biological material. Unthinking, unfeeling. Eventually it starts splitting off shards that encounter foreign brains. Suddenly they encounter a second voice, one that the yeerk does have control over, yes, but it provides that competition that yeerk thought process lacked. That shard learns from the competition (as well as sensory inputs, memory, etc) and shares that with the coalescion.

But there would still be that element of the competing voice belonging to the controlled and not the yeerk itself. So while the yeerks as a whole have this whole competing voice intelligence forming -- just like every other intelligent species -- it's not coming from within. Thus when Visser Three starts encountering this inner conflict in his own mind, it seems like a foreign invasion of his thoughts. It's just not a thing the yeerks had ever had to deal with.

If that's accurate though, then perhaps Alloran isn't quite as responsible for the inner conflict as it initially seems. Perhaps just sowing some seeds of doubt by his former presence and current absence.

On that note, I do wonder about the Visser's current biology. Obviously he's a clone, but is he a clone of Alloran being controlled by a clone of Esplin? Or is the result of the Visser's experiments a new (Andalite?) brain with Esplin's memories and values? Does it have something like the morph tech's yeerk control tissue present?
