[[/u/AstralCodex][u/AstralCodex]] is correct about the neutron explosives; we'll see Jake's reaction in part 2.

Honestly, V3 started out as third person because that's how it was written by ketura, who sent me the omake and then allowed me to repossess it. I liked it as 3rd person because that made it feel distinct from the other viewpoint characters.

Then I screwed up and forgot when I wrote the next Esplin chapter.

I stuck with first person for a while, and then this one felt somehow more appropriate "at a distance" ... it let me do more poetic prose, for instance.

Overall, this entire story is, for me, a way to experiment and grow as a writer, trying new things in a sort of low-stakes way, so whenever there's been an opportunity to stretch in a new direction (reddit interludes, weird perspective, trying to write a stroke from the inside), I've just defaulted to "give it a shot." This chapter, with the weird back and forth between Jake and V3, plus switching back to third person V3, was another instance of that.
