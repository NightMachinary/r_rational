First thought: there might be some amount of similarity between them and the telepathic species in /A Fire Upon The Deep/? (They aren't telepathic with other species, just themselves, since IIRC some of their brain activity is encoded in EM waves between two antenna-things.) So that might be a source of more thoughts on the subject.

Second thought: huh, in some ways those are actually more like the Yeerks. If they get too close to each other they basically stop being individuals, and indeed most "people" are actually 3-4 of them in a close pack. And if one leaves or dies, the remainder will want to be careful about who replaces them, to avoid changing too much.

(It's been a while since I read the book.)

Another intuition pump that might be relevant here is Greg Egan's short /Unstable Orbits in the Space of Lies/.
