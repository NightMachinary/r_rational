  I'm not entirely sure how Jake got here from "Alloran is able to see past 1984-type bullshit"
#+end_quote

It's not spelled out in text, but the idea is that Jake is getting a "feel" for Alloran's gestalt, by looking over all of the memories, and combining that with his sense of "some of what makes Esplin inexorable as an opponent is derived from Alloran as the substrate." I think if anyone other than Jake were making the claim, it would be unfounded/a stretch, but Jake's the guy with the pretty good black box.

The Visser sections were present-day Visser, yeah, not Q-memories.
