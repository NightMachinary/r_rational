Me: *wakes up Monday morning*

Holy shit new r!Animorphs what a great way to start the week!

*reads a little bit*

Fuck yeah Telor, you really fucked up Visser's plans and now Earth is basically saved and it's all good.

*Visser kills like 5 billion people with a flip of a switch*

Oh... oh no...

So yeah, that was intense. Can you elaborate on how the neutron explosives work? He mentions that it leaves the human infrastructure intact so I'm just imagining humans exploding on the street which isn't great. That's a definite blow to humanity and I was really hoping to get Jakes reaction to it this chapter, although the scene with him and Elena was amazing.

You may have also touched on this before, and I apologize if you have. In earlier Visser 3/Esplin chapters it seems like you went back and fourth between 1st and 3rd person. After the most recent Esplin chapter was done in 1st person I assumed you were just going to keep it that way, but is there a reason you're back to 3rd person? Does it have to do with how Esplin and Alloran are now one?

Also I love how you consistently take aspects of the canon story and retell them in an even more fucked up fashion. Poor Mertil...
