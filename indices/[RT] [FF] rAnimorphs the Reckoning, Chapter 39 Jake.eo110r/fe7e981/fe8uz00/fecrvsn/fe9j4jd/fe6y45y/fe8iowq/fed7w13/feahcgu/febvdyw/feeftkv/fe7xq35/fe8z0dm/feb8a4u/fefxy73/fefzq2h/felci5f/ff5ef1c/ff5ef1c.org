Coming back to say that I'm adopting this as canon, though I'm not sure if or when or in what form it will make its way into the text:

#+begin_quote
  With most species a yeerk can cut off information flow from it's host as it sees fit, just stop touching that part of the brain. But in an Andalites thought speech can always effect the yeerk. What's more, thought speech has been said to sound like one's own inner voice. Given that, the facct that a yeerk might lose track of where it's thoughts are actually coming from makes a certain amount of sense.
