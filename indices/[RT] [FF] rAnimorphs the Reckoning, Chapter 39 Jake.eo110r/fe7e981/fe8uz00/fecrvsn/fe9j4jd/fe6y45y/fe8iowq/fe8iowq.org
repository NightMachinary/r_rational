Great chapter, always good to see this story update. I never managed to read the entire Animorphs story so it always feels like things are going over my head but I usually manage to keep up with most of what's happening.

The Garrett interlude from a few chapters ago really helped clear things up, I had been (and still am) considering doing a reread because while things don't feel close to ending it does feel like the beginning of the last arc is being set up or we're already in it.

That's pure speculation though, I can't wait to see where this goes.
