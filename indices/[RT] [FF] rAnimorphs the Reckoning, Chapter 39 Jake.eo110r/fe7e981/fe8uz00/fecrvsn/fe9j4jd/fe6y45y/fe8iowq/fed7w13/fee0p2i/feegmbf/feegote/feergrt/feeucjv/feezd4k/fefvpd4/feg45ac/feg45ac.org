You SHOULD feel proud. This is something I likely would have worked out eventually, but this story made me think about it in a different way and the thoughts are crystallizing sooner.

Thanks for the advice, too. A lot of self-help advice preaches practicing gratitude, and I keep hearing about studies that say it will increase happiness, but I never really understood it, myself. The "yes, that's it" feeling makes a lot more sense to me and I suspect is probably part of what gratitude practice is all about. Again, crystallizing advice I've heard elsewhere, bringing me that much closer and internalizing it and practicing it. I get the ideas behind gratitude practice, but your "yes, that's it" advice actually feels like "yes, that's it".
