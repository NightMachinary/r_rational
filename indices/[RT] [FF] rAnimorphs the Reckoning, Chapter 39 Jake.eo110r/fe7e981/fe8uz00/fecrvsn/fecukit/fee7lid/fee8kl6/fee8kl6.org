  The Visser failed to plan for Telor's self-sacrifice in this recent chapter. Is it because the idea of self-sacrifice is unthinkable to him?

My thinking is that he just thought that Telor in particular didn't have it in them. Moderately impactful spoilers for part 2: Telor didn't actually sacrifice themselves; Ryen-with-an-e managed to make it out of the Brazil pool and eventually up into orbit, and successfully acquired the full coalescion. He came back down to Earth and morphed it, sacrificing himself in the process; Telor was willing to die in its original body because and only because it knew it would be reborn in backup.
