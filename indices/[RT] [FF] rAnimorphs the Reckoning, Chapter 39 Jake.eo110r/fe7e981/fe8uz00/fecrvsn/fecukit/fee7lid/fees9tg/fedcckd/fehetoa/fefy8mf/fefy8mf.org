Split him into a million distinct crystalized fragments, different versions of his original personality, and let them dynamically change and interact., cooperate, fight, evolve.

In other words, promote him into a pool.

Force the pool to mostly cohere by one part expedient use of incentives and, over time, one part learned adaptations. Yet also, force that the pool's shards specialize. Prevent them from being redundant - chemically? Memetically?

He wouldn't be healed from the perspective of /other characters/, he could end up more powerful and monstrous than ever, but it'd certainly be character development by his own terms! Value drift is the last thing he wants, but if it's value drift accompanied by a power boost then he could be made amenable to it.

And then once that happens, collapse him back down to a single individual, some particular weighted average of his previous parts, so that he has to resort to working with others to satisfy the drives and methods he'd been accustomed too during his time as a collective - not just seeing them as an extension of himself and his purposes, but seeing himself as a (misaligned, still selfish!) extension of them and theirs.

Basically, he needs to struggle in order to grow, which means he needs to have his goal of self-consistency rudely violated, but in a way where he can still be around afterwards as /almost/ the same person.
