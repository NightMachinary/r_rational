  Ah, okay, so I figured those alliances were to further his ends, but would not actually be safe if he wins. I have no concept of whether r!V3 is a "being of honor" in that sense, so this helps a bit.

My model was that the /entire point/ of those deals was that Visser Three couldn't be planning to break them after he wins, that the value of using a Leeran is that both parties can see that the other side has made a credible pre-commitment. And the interesting mechanic is that there's no external agent forcing each side to keep the deal, but the deal is only possible if each will keep their side without anyone forcing them to. Analogous to the final arc of HPMOR, or Parfit's Hitchhiker.

So, in a sense, it's not about being a "being of honour" inherently, it's about being able to adopt a sense of honour when it's genuinely in your interests.

And this also struck me as one of the first "wow, r!Visser Three is a genuinely terrifying villain" moments, because the ability to make credible pre-commitments isn't one that a cliched villian should be able to have
