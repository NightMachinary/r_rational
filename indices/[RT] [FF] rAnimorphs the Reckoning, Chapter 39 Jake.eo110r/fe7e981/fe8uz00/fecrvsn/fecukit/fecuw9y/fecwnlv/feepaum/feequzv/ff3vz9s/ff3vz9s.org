  I wanted to show that V3 is capable of cooperating with himself across time, including being able to make binding commitments for benefits that can only be achieved if the commitment is Actually Sincere.

Does your model of V3 consider /I always follow my pre-commitments no matter what/ as a core enough value that violating it would count as a "death"? Would he actually be vulnerable to the trick someone suggested a couple chapters ago, where the kids hold him hostage by threatening to ram the Hork-Bajir planet with the bug fighter?
