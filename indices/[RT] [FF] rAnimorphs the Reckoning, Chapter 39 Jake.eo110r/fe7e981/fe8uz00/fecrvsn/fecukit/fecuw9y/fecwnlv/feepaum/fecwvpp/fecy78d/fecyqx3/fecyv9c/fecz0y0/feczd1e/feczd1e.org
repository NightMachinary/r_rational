  The people who complain about it being "too long" or "too slow" are confusing "I guess I just don't actually like this world and this style" with "this is badly written," which it is not.

Most of the criticisms on this seem more to do with inconsistent pacing/quality between books (like I've heard people say there are a couple books you can skip entirely and just read a three sentence synopsis on and not miss anything of value). To be fair it's hard to keep a consistent quality between books in any case, let alone in a series so long... I think Dresden Files is my go-to example of the best case of a series that actually gets better book by book for over a dozen books running, with arguably a dip in the latest one (though this might just be my anti-theism influencing things).
