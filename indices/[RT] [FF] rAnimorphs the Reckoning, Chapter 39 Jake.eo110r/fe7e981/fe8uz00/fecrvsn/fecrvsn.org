Okay, so, interesting (to me at least) hypothetical:

How would you go about healing the Visser?

Like, in Harry Potter canon, it's stated that feeling remorse for his actions would re-knit Voldemort's soul, and allow him a normal afterlife; in HPMOR, Harry concludes that Voldemort is utterly unafraid of redemption and not the least bit worried about it happening to him.

But like say you had it as an instrumental goal to /fix/ this guy, and return him to something like balanced self-actualization, as opposed to ... anxious megalomania?

I'm mostly interested in theories of what specific fears or deficits he has, and what healthy mental structure would replace them, rather than answers like "go on a cruise and do a bunch of drugs." Like, what do you see as his specific dysfunctions, in a clinical psychological sense, and how would they be meaningfully patched.

aaaaaa there are like 437 people I should tag but I can't remember them all [[/u/DaystarEld][u/DaystarEld]] [[/u/CouteauBleu][u/CouteauBleu]] [[/u/ErekKing][u/ErekKing]] [[/u/ketura][u/ketura]] [[/u/knickersinaknit][u/knickersinaknit]] [[/u/liegroupe8][u/liegroupe8]] [[/u/philh][u/philh]] u/you, yes you, the person reading this here "tag," sorry I couldn't pull you up, I don't have you indexed that way, also there are probably lurkers who've never spoken up before but who have interesting thoughts to add on this one
