Most of this is super helpful, and will result in useful tweaks before I put out part 2; thanks.

The bit about fusion, though, is not a last-minute plot device; it's been in the story since Ventura; Esplin wondered a bit about Alloran's silence, then we saw Ax and Temrash establishing a deep bond, then we got confirmation from the gods that there's a peculiar quality to the Andalite-Yeerk bond in particular.
