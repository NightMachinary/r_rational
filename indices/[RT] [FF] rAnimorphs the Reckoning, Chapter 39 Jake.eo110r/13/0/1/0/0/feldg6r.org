FWIW the Esplin/Alloran fusion felt very natural and well-foreshadowed to me, mainly because of this line in the hypersight sequence:

#+begin_quote
  The beginning of a new ending, a possibility to match his own, not one but /two/---
#+end_quote

The Visser thinks of Ax+Temrash as an existential threat, and "not one but two" after we've been told that part of the conflict between the gods is "Unity vs. Harmony"; and the way the beginning of the Visser section evokes the beginning of Chapter 34 was a cool way getting the reader to keep the game in mind while we're reading about the fusion.
