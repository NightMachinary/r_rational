Great chapter, though not enough Jake! (Guess more of him is coming in part 2).

But the Visser parts were great - I've been craving another "Esplin" chapter, though it's interesting that this iteration of him is just referred to as "Visser" in break with previous precedent, suggesting that the melding of Esplin and Alloran is now complete. Also, it seems the dominance of single POV chapters might be at its end.

The Visser being at war with himself was great; that's peak rationalist style right there, having a character thinking about thinking about thinking...

So one major thing strikes me as unrealistic or flawed about the Visser which also I noticed previously in the chapter when he was thinking through his plan for immortality. It seems the Visser believes that the ideal goal for himself and his clones is perfect self-alignment: no part of himself should be at war with any other part, but rather all parts at a singularity of purpose. In this chapter he is disturbed when he thinks his Alloran-side might be trying to subvert him. However, I think that the state of being at war with yourself is just, in a sense, the default state of all intelligent beings. Intelligences are composed of subsystems with their own simple "goals," and the goals of the higher level system emerge from the competition of the lower level goals. Inner conflict seems to be integrated into the algorithm for intelligence by default. The Visser in this chapter is too worried about whether part of himself is pulling in a different direction than the other parts, when he should just be worried about what he thinks is the right thing to do, at the object level. After all, he just /is/ the composition of Esplin and Alloran; his "true goals" have already shifted.

About his expectation of perfect alignment from his clones, this seems like an impossible fantasy. The Visser executed clones for just the /slightest/ drift, from some random noise in the cloning process and a few minutes of different memories. If his idea of alignment is really so fragile to circumstance, then he will never achieve his dream, for it is nearly physically impossible to prevent small drift in that way. He should focus on goals that are robust to random changes and conducive to cooperation by similar agents. If Visser 3 is unable to cooperate with beings so close to himself, then his dream is folly and he is doomed to be a tragic figure. Sure, he's striving for a unified consciousness spread across multiple beings rather than independent clones, but A) that's also going to run into drift problems for the same reasons, and B) he's already failed, because now there are seven independent clones of him running around, if there weren't any already.

The little we get of Jake is excellent. It's about time he broke down crying, after all he's been through. Looks like he's going to have another heart-to-heart with Marco, which makes me very happy.

As a side note, the friendship of Jake and Marco reminds me a lot of some of my own friendships, and has partially inspired me to have some really great, deep conversations with my friends, as recently as a few days ago, so yeah.
