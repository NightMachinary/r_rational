Also this is a bit of a tangent but I can't help but wonder how Leerans work. As in, what was life like for these hyper psychics who live in a perpetual fantasy drug trip before the Yeerks came along and crashed their party? Do they have individual natures and personalities? Do they have a society? What would their society even look like?
