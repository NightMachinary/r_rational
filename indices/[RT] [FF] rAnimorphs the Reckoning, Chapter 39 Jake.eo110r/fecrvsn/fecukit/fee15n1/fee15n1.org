I accept DaystarEld's analysis of the visser's issues as accurate and propose that the way to fix the problem is through the Chee. He already claims to be amenable to being nice to dogs. If they can trust each other enough to come to an agreement, I am sure something can be worked out where the visser gets his mind uploaded to a robot for the low low cost of being nice to dogs. The Chee are seemingly pretty close to being a hive mind - it should be easy for the visser to make a few or more than a few extra robots which his core robot controls and which don't have the value drift problem of his organic spare bodies, since he can hardwire his opinions into himself in robot form. Chee bodies are tough and long lasting which should assuage his concerns about death if he takes sensible precautions. I have been assuming this as a non-zero risk in the actual story, judging risk from the perspective of the animorphs.
