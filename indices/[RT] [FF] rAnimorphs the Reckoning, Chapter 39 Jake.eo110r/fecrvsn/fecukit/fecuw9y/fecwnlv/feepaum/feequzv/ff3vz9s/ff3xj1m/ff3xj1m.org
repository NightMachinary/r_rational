More like "I always follow whatever pre-commitments are only made possible by being followed no matter what."

There are some pre-commitments which he can make Ã  la HJPEV thinking "any oath is an Unbreakable Oath if made by the right person." But there are others where he will happily lie. A lot depends on the capacity of the other person to distinguish; V3 actually has a /vested interest/ in other people knowing that some of his commitments are kept and others not, and at least some degree of ability to discern the difference.

Leerans help a lot.
