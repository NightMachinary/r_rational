It's popular, but the /explicit narrative/ around it is "eh, problematic, mixed bag, antiquated," etc. Like, it's something that vastly more people will quietly enjoy than openly criticize, but the open criticism is itself sort of ... unassailable? Like, criticizing the criticism can get you labeled a sexist or an apologist, for instance, or out you as someone unable to judge literary quality.

The inverse of how criticizing 2001 for having two trippy unnecessary art pieces on either end is more likely to land as "Daystar has no taste" or "Daystar just doesn't get it" than it is to land as "huh, actually, now that you mention it ..."

Or, to use a personal example: Moby Dick *S U C K*
