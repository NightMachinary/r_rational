Some of these examples definitely hit harder than others, for me: the Fight Club one feels like an obvious missing-the-point on the viewer's part, whereas I'm one of those unsophisticated philistines who thinks 2001 was a good [however many minutes the HAL9000 plot is] short film bracketed by two boring/trippy art pieces that only technically can be called a "movie."

I'm a fan of Stephen King though, so I'm definitely not averse to "filler" as long as it's engaging. More of something I love is just more of something I love.
