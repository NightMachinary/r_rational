The people who complain about it being "too long" or "too slow" are confusing "I guess I just don't actually like this world and this style" with "this is badly written," which it is not. You know that feeling where you never want the book to end?

The people who complain about sexism are cherry-picking; there's a big difference between "I can construct a claim that this work is sexist by adversarially sampling 4,400,000 words" and "the contents of that claim are representative of the work as a whole, or its message, or the dozens of named female characters."

(there's also some sex-negative bent to those comments as well)

idk what other criticisms there are; those are the only two I've heard.
