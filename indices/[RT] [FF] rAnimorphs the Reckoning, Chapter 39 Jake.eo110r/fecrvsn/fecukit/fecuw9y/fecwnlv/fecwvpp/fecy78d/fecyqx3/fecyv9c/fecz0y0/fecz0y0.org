What it does particularly well is /comprehensively/ include /every/ fantasy trope or archetype in existence, yet bend each of them into a new and interesting form. There's a Tom Bombadil, there are Dementors, there are witches and wizards, there are knights in shining armor, there's a cut from a curs√©d knife. But each is uniquely done, and I know of no other fantasy world where they're /all/ there.

There are plot elements laid in that pay off /eight books later./
