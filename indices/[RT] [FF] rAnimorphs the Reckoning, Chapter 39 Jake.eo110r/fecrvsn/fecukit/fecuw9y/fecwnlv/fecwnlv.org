Ah, okay, so I figured those alliances were to further his ends, but would not actually be safe if he wins. I have no concept of whether r!V3 is a "being of honor" in that sense, so this helps a bit.

The next question is what he values beyond his winning state. To quote the latest Worth the Candle chapter, edited to avoid spoilers:

  "So tell me, if you value good for its own sake, what does good look like to you?”

  “What do you mean?” The tone of their voice made it sound as though they suspected that this was a trick. It /was/ a trick, but not in the usual sense, since the follow-up questions would (ideally) help with the process of reframing how they looked at the world.

  “Imagine that you died tomorrow, and in your final moments, the Dungeon Master came to you and said that you could make any changes you wanted to the world. You would have no limits whatsoever and no worries about time, just carte blanche to alter the world. What would you do? You can take your time to think.”

  “And what would you do?”

  “I don't want to poison the well with my answer. If you'd like, I can share my thoughts once you're done. Again, it's fine to think about it first. I would prefer that you think out loud though, because I'm more interested in your thoughts than your answer.”

  “I think you want me to say all the obvious. No pain, no terror, nothing forced on anyone, a happy world where every day is better than the last and nothing negative happens to anyone at all.”

  “But that's not what you actually think?”

  “For a very long time, the best moments of my life were when I was enacting justice."

  “You mean that you slaughtered anyone you wanted."

  "You haven't mentioned the torture, but you don't need to pussyfoot around it, because when I say justice, I mean that too. In a world without pain or terror, there would be no badness, but with no badness, there would be nothing to bring justice against. It would simply be gone, replaced by nothing.”

  “You yearn to right perceived wrongs. In this perfect world, do you think there would be nothing to replace that yearning? Nothing to replace the warm feeling of satisfaction when you've dealt out perceived justice?”

  “You said that I would be dead, not able to live in the world I had created. So I suppose the question is whether I value justice, in the abstract, for its own sake, or whether it's simply because justice makes me feel good. I'm not sure that I know. I would be depriving others, but not myself."

What is r!V3's answer to the hypothetical? Assuming he has one and it's not "if I'm dead it doesn't matter" or some cheat to come back to life.
