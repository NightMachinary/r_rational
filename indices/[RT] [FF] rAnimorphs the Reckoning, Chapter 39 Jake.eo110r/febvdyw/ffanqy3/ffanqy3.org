  I can't help but notice that one-in-seven is kind of an arbitrary number which clearly results ultimately from Andalite convention

I'm glad someone else noticed this! I wasn't going to share this theory because I thought it was too weird or abstract or whatever, but here goes.

We know the gods have done a /lot/ of active work shaping the evolution of relevant species, right? Temrash points out how incredibly unlikely it is that you'd get a bunch of intelligent life from different planets so similar to each other, and all compatible with Yeerk tissue, and Andalite biology and culture so perfectly shaped to miss noticing it. I would guess the number of fingers and number of original pools would be way simpler to shape via coincidence than fine-tuning all that neuro anatomy, and like [[/u/tjhance]] said, there is no way that 1/7 is the exactly optimal probability the Visser should be using here. It's either too cautious or too confident.

Also:

- Knowing the exact chance of failure where you should cut your losses to keep from wasting resources is a critical part of the game
- The Ellimist (probably) once made a tree grow for thousands of years, just so a Pemalite (maybe?) would trip at the exact moment the Howlers howled, tainting their collective memory with overconfidence
- Alloran's only real weapon against Esplin is messing with his cautiousness/arrogance (speculating that Alloran and Esplin are pieces that belong to different gods)

I think it's totally plausible that one or both gods pushed the Andalites and Yeerks to anchor on the numbers 7 and 13, specifically because they're close to, but slightly higher or lower than the "correct" probability he should be assigning at one or more critical points, just to push him a little further into cautiousness or arrogance. I say V3 because he's the only character I can think of (besides maybe the Chee) who makes enough Bayseian calculations for it to matter.

Of course maybe I'm just overthinking a nice worldbuilding touch. If that's the case, a very tiny feedback:

  an eventual victory ten thousand revolutions in the future was still immeasurably better than permanent defeat

Should be seven thousand or thirteen thousand, unless the intent is to show the human influence getting to him.
