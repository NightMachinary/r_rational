  That seems like a bad sign for the Andalites, both that he was able to put a Visser there and that they now have a Visser there.

Worse than that, even. Just the fact that he /tried/ is a bad sign. If he gets caught, that seems like a lot of important info that he's just given to the Andalites. So he's not gonna try unless he's confident that they won't catch him, at least not in a way that reveals anything he really doesn't want known.
