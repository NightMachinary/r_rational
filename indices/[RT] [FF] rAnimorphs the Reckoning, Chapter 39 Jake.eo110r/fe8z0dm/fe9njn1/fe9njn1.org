Re: Neutron Explosives. I read it as a more advanced version of a [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_bomb][Neutron Bomb]], which is a nuclear weapon “designed to maximize lethal neutron radiation in the immediate vicinity of the blast while minimizing the physical power of the blast itself.” The Visser wants to kill key humans, but preserve the infrastructure, and that's in line with the design objectives of neutron bombs irl.
