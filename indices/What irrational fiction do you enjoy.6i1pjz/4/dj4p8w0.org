Quite enjoying Malazan Book of the Fallen. Here's the opening of the current chapter I'm on. No spoilers.

There is something profoundly cynical, my friends, in the notion of paradise after death. The lure is evasion. The promise is excusative. One need not accept responsibility for the world as it is, and by extension, one need do nothing about it. To strive for change, for true goodness in this mortal world, one must acknowledge and accept, within one's own soul, that this mortal reality has purpose in itself, that its greatest value is not for us, but for our children and their children. To view life as but a quick passage along a foul, tortured path -- made foul and tortured by our own indifference -- is to excuse all manner of misery and depravity, and to exact cruel punishment upon the innocent lives to come.

I defy this notion of paradise beyond the gates of bone. If the soul truly survives the passage, then it behooves us -- each of us, my friends -- to nurture a faith in similitude: what awaits us is a reflection of what we leave behind, and in the squandering of our mortal existence, we surrender the opportunity to learn the ways of goodness, the practice of sympathy, empathy, compassion and healing -- all passed by in our rush to arrive at a place of glory and beauty, a place we did not earn, and most certainly do not deserve.

It's a pretty close articulation, if not perfect, of one of the major issues I have with an afterlife which I don't think very many people religious or otherwise even are aware of or accept.
