I just coined it in an attempt to describe the ... convoluted, hallucinogenic logic of Unsong. It's a brilliant work, and in part it seems like an utterly rational story about Qabala and Judeo-Christian biblical mysticism... but it keeps stepping off the edge of the cliff and keeping on going. And I just couldn't be arsed to keep finding my footing over and over again so I could follow it.
