  This is right-wing rhetoric. Verbatim chan-tard speak. "Wah wah, pandering."

  Nobody has a diversity checklist. It is a lie invented by literal fascists.
#+end_quote

It's funny that you try to sit on your high horse and spout this shit with a straight face. "Someone doesn't agree with me, must be a retarded something-chan poster". Yeah, buddy, great logic there. Superb.

You think there aren't diversity checklists? Fuck, I worked as an HR person for a few years. We had fucking diversity checklists for non-critical departments. I did my best to subvert them by ignoring the name and just reading qualifications, but when managers literally say "we don't have enough women, hire more women" and ignore the response of "you've see everyone we vetted, and we took the best candidates", there's only so much you can do.

  Good on you that you're not a rapist. Not so good on you that you're incapable of abstracting from the fact that men are overwhelmingly the perpetrators of sexual violence.
#+end_quote

What the fuck, this is exactly the fucking shit I'm talking about.

No, we aren't. Amazingly, sexual assault is split roughly 50-50, and is primarily perpetrated not by "stranger danger", but by relatives and family friends.

At least when you dump the fuckshit mcstupid definition of rape as "forced penetration with a penis" and apply the common sense definition of "forcing someone to have sex with you when they did not wish to do so", as well as dump the bullshit stats of "rape" as "next morning regret" accusations.

  We do teach little boys it's okay to violate girls' personal space. We need to stop that.
#+end_quote

We teach little kids that it's OK to violate each other's personal space. This is not a gendered issue, and you need to stop trying to make it such.

  Also, Clinton literally had slaves (prison labor) to do her housework when Mr. Clinton was govenor. Clinton would ahve been far less destructive, yes.

As opposed to everything Agent Orange has fucked up in just the last few months?

Yeah, Shit Sandwich would have been better.

  The real solution was of course Sanders.
#+end_quote

Bernie "white people can never understand black poverty" Sanders? Bernie "nuclear reactors are bad and need to be shut down forever" Sanders?

Don't get me wrong, Sanders was the Least Bad of candidates we've had in two decades, but he had many, many policy issues.

  Buddy, every serious activist I know is trying to get people to stand together, and white guys like you are the problem.

  Black people? They fucking know it's about class-warfare already. They are ready.
#+end_quote

Haha, nice pedestal you've put an entire arbitrary phenotype on, there.

No, mate. People are people, no matter what color. Some understand and want to help, some think education is "fo dem whipipo" and sling rocks for a living.

  They are waiting for you to stop demanding that the Feminists get the TERFs under control, and that they add "not all men" to their tweets. If you're really as leftie as you say, then you can overlook your differences with the social justice movement and focus on fighting capitalism.
#+end_quote

There's nothing wrong with capitalism, you loon. Capitalism is a system of competition and meritocracy. The issue is unregulated capitalism and a culture that worships kipple. When monopolies (regional or otherwise), duopolies, oligarchical business conglomerates, and such are prevented from existing by law and people stop buying the new iStupidshit because a new one came out this year oh my god my status symbol!, we'll be well on our way to a decent form of economic management.

It's like communism; great on paper, but then we let fucking people get ahold of it.

  I have some issues with the fact that your social awareness is near nil and that you're parroting alt-right rhetoric while pretending to be a leftie.
#+end_quote

I have some issues with your burning field of strawmen, your attempts to discredit arguments with "no true scotsman" fallacies and ad hominums, and the fact that you can't try to find common ground with those who disagree with you, but instead immediately start throwing around insults and insulting labels.

  Let's meet in the middle. PM me if you want some contact info so we can have an IM discussion; I rather dislike writing these essays.
#+end_quote

As i said above, no thanks on the IMs. I'd prefer our disagreement be handled openly, as a matter of public record.
