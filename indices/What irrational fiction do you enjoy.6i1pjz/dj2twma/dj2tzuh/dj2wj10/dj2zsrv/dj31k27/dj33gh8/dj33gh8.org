  Punch up.
#+end_quote

Holy fucksticks, let me address this before we do anything else. No, don't fucking "punch" up. Or to the side. Or down. Don't "punch" at all.

This concept that it's somehow okay to attack people physically for the crime of wrongthink is how you get the berkely riots, or the current fracas at Evergreen college, or the "bash a fash" mentality, or any of the other nonsense going on.

You're not helping anyone get better, just dragging others down into the dirt with you.

With that out of the way, let's discuss.

It's not that I dislike "social justice nuts", as you succinctly put it. My SO and I are fairly liberal (in the classic definition; in support of free speech, free thought, and all that horrible, horrible wrongthink nonsense) and left-leaning (we support things like UBI, single-payer healthcare, mental health treatment for criminals rather then incarceration, prison reform, etc). And yet, we hate the modern left and the social justice causes with a passion.

Which is weird, you'd think. On paper, we should be a perfect fit.

But the problem is that social justice activists seem to share you "punch up" mentality while attempting to dilute many complex social problems to as few centralized boogeymen as possible. Everything wrong is because of "misogyny", or the "patriarchy", or "white men", or in some crazy circles "men" in general. You can't be racist against white people, they say, because racism is "power + privilege" (which may be true in a vaccum of academia, but in realistic practice is horseshit; I can't wander into certain neighborhoods in my city because I'm the wrong color, and I'm white). The patriarchy is keeping women down with institutionalized misogyny, they say, ignoring the fact that the majority of college degrees are now earned by women, and the fact that, despite being from the same disenfranchised generation with few real prospects, there are initiatives that prioritize getting women into jobs (never dangerous jobs like welding or difficult jobs like garbage collecting, but jobs like managers, executives, etc) on the basis of sex alone, so that a checklist of "diversity" can be marked. Men are the cause of society's problems, they say. We gotta teach men not to rape, they say. I'm not even going to touch this one, it infuriates me so much.

There's no social outreach here. Everyone is either with you, or against you. You can see it very clearly in our recent election, where we were forced to choose between president Agent Orange (Trump) or president Shit Sandwich (Clinton). Despite the fact that both were terrible candidates (though I'll be the first to say that Clinton, while Terrible, was the Less Bad by far of the choices), there is a nasty culture war between both camps, and both camps hate each other. Neither tribe is willing to even attempt to understand the other.

The crux of our problems is in the fact that our economy and media is controlled by a few elites and conglomerate. That we have no prospects to escape a corporate dystopia future in a blighted and flooded world, that every bit of "race war" is just class conflict, and social justice activists want to fucking tear down those who they should be standing shoulder to shoulder with.

So, yes. I have some issues with socjus cancer infiltrating even what I considered, and I use this term with the irionic grimace of realizing whose terminology I'm borrowing, a safe space of rationality and meritocracy, not "muh feefees" and "socjus bash the fash whitey is da devul", to use a crass metaphor.
