I don't see a debate. I see two people shouting insults at each other and refusing to hear each other's arguments without resorting to taunting, baiting, mocking, and other devices that are very good for making you feel good about yourself, and not very good for uncovering useful truths, changing people's minds, changing your own minds, or doing anything else generally associated with the word "debate". Your argument is entertaining, childish, and entirely inappropriate in a thread devoted to talking about what kinds of books and movies people enjoy. There are public forums much better suited to debates and shouting matches than this one; take it there. If nothing else, please take a few hours to "tone down some of the flashing tempers", as you put it; you're getting in the way of your own truth-seeking by turning every exchange into an emotionally charged conflict. Thank you.
