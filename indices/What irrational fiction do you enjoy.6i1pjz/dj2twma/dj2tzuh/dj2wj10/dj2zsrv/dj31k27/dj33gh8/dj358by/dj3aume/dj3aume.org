  What. The. Fuck.

  Like.

  Did it ever occur to you that "punching up" was a metaphor? Like, do you honestly believe your political quote-unquote opponents are violent psychopaths?
#+end_quote

Oh, goodness me, a metaphor? However did I miss that, what with you so firmly declaring it at the tail end of a seriously presented rant?

Oh, I hope they don't lynch a nigger over this. Oh, no no. That's a metaphor too, you see.

#+begin_quote
  No, you can sit your ass the fuck back down and we can hash this out in a conversation over instant messaging.
#+end_quote

No, thank you. I prefer my conversations to be a matter of public record, not back-room chitchat. If this bothers you, please refrain from initiating conversations on public forums.

#+begin_quote
  I never accused anyone of wrongthink, and you seirously lack any ability to think two steps ahead of your ideology.
#+end_quote

Dearest me, I wonder why you would assume that my mentioning that the socjus cancer insists on decrying anyone who disagrees with them as wrongthinkers to be about you.

Unless...you're looking to build a strawman?

#+begin_quote
  I disagree with you and you immediately conclude that I must be an anti-american, anti-freeze peach, anti-democratic violent anarchist.
#+end_quote

Whoowee, boys, look at that there'un big 'ol straw man being built.

#+begin_quote
  Grow up, man. We're both reasonable people. We can discuss this like civilized persons in a free democracy, and I promise I won't throw rocks at the neo-nazis.
#+end_quote

It says a lot about you and your argument when you jump straight to accusing people who disagree with you of being neo-nazis. Do you know what a neo-nazi is, mate? Because anonymous randos disagreeing with you on a public forum ain't it.

#+begin_quote
  So, just to be pedantic for a second: you hate gays, lesbians, transgender people, black people, and other minorities standing up for themselves? Way to be left-leaning.
#+end_quote

/fwoosh/ and there it goes. Strawman's a-burnin.

No, you insufferable fool. People of any denomination have the right to seek a comfortable and honest life on this earth. However, your phenotype, sexual preference, and genitals give you no special privilege to happiness or an easy life, and I will not support any sort of "affirmative action" that props up one group of people on arbitrary reasons at the expense of another, or many others.

#+begin_quote
  Boom there it is.
#+end_quote

You've never read a book, and you're parrotting the opinions of right-wing populists who want to drive a wedge between people like you and people like me so we don't realize they are stealing our money and wrecking the planet.

And you were saying something about purity games while pouring the gasoline on the straw man?

#+begin_quote
  You're butthurt because you're a white man and you have it bad and all these nasty people are calling white men bad. But you're not bad! You're virtuous!

  It's OK, man. Calm down. They are not talking about you. Unless you habitually disrespect women, black people, poor people, queers, and so on. Ideally, you shouldn't be butthurt about it, but say "yes, as a white man I think that white men in general have done bad things, and even though I am myself innocent, I am mature enough to acknowledge that I am part of a group with blood on their hands."
#+end_quote

Firstly, piss right the fuck off here, mate. No, I am not part of any goddamned group with "blood on their hands" because of my goddamned phenotype, something I have had zero input and zero fucking control over. I am a first generation immigrant, the son of a poor russian and a poor jew. We have seen exactly none of this magic "white pirivilege" that everyone espouses. We had to learn the language, adopt the cultures, and work our assess off to be considered americans. And we worked our goddamned asses off. My grandfather, before he died, became an aeronautics engineer at NASA. My father owns a string of stores, and my uncle is a senior network engineer at a large corporation. None of this shit was handed to us for our "whiteness".

As for "blood on our hands", fuck that "sins of the father, sins of the son" bullshit. I'm ethnically jewish by blood, and I don't give a rat's ass about the holocaust except so far as that it happened and we should work to prevent such a thing from happening to any group of people again. And let's not forget it wasn't just the jews who suffered and died there; the actual, real life nazis killed homosexuals, retards, and others. I have never, in my life, looked at a german and thought "you are part of a group that has blood on their hands", because they fucking don't. They were never part of the group that did it, they would never consider being part of the group that did it, and most of their current population wasn't even alive at the time.

So, kindly piss right the fuck off with that.

  People are crazy. This is not news. Crazy people occasionally have a point.
#+end_quote

The fact that a broken clock is right once a day does not make it any less broken. Even if, by some chance, they've gotten one thing right, the baggage that comes with them is unacceptable.

#+begin_quote
  Also, notice how you called them man-haters crazy. I know you're talking about women.
#+end_quote

No, you don't. The misandrist fruitcakes aren't just women. There are plenty of whiteknight male fruitcakes.

#+begin_quote
  Lesbians most often.
#+end_quote

No, they aren't. Most of them are heterosexual fruitcakes that are "politically lesbian", which is it's own brand of crazy.

#+begin_quote
  Some of them have been traumatized by men, and that's OK.
#+end_quote

I can't tell what you're trying to say here. Are you saying it's OK for them to have been traumatized by males, or that it's OK to sling shit on all males for the trauma a single or small number of males inflicted on them?

Because neither of those are OK.

#+begin_quote
  +Some+ Many of them are just assholes.
#+end_quote

At least on this we can agree.

#+begin_quote
  Again you're generalizing from the loudmouths. Bad rationalism.
#+end_quote

The only people representing the movement are loudmouths. They've almost completely edged out others.

  Slavery. Segregation. Lynchings. Policemen killing black people in the streets with no repercussions. Pay gap.
#+end_quote

You godsforsaken loon. Slavery happened to EVERYONE. Segregation happened to EVERYONE. Lynchings happened to EVERYONE.

Police officers killing black people on the street? Hah. Fucking where, mate? Are you seriously trying to use the small number of newscast high-profile police killings (more then half of which were voted "not guilty" by a grand jury afterwards, but that's not interesting news when your intent is race baiting) of black males as evidence?

No. We definitely have massive issues with police accountability, but they fuck everyone over. We definitely have perception issues on the police forces of black americans, but that's the end result of a hell of a lot of shit (including on-the-job training and experience) that needs a major overhaul of poor american black culture AS WELL AS american police culture to even begin to be solved.

And, if you consider massive public outcry, riots (that destroyed the business of people completely ininvolved), and an endless media circus to be no repercussions, I don't know what to say to you.

As for "pay gap", there isn't one, not really. People who invented the pay gap to feed to war machine of the culture wars compared average incomes (which include billionaires and multi-millionaires) instead of median incomes, and failed to factor in job types, hours worked, and dificulty of work. surprisingly, when you account for everything, the pay gap shrinks to 1-3% at most, and economists who actually study such things argue endlessly about statistical drift.

#+begin_quote
  This is demonstrably false. Women want to be welders and garbage collectors just as much as men do; but both jobs are so heavily entrenched as man-professions and so much more based in tradition that it's slow and hard work.
#+end_quote

Oh, haha, thanks. I needed the laugh.

Oh, wait, you're serious.

Man, I'm laughing so much it hurts.

Mate, the reason these jobs are male dominated is because they require long, arduous hours, and jobs such as welding are dangerous as fuck. Women generally don't apply for them, because a desk job as an HR something or other doesn't occasionally explode or drop I-beams on you, nor does it require getting up at the crack of dawn to haul tons of literal garbage out of filthy cans into filthy trucks, and the desk jobs pay well enough. Men have to take them, because we're expected to provide in this country.

Let all the men not show up to work tomorrow, and let's see what happens. Just one day.

  Management and academia listen to reason, at least; hence why change happens faster there.
#+end_quote

Shows what you know, which is clearly nothing. Management listens to the loudest complainers, and academia listens to itself.
