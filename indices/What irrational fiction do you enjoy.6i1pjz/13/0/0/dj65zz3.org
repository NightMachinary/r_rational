I hated that episode too and found nearly all of that season to be an endurance test, but the episodes since Clara left are worth watching. Not that all of them are great, I've found most of them to be just okay, but I've yet to see one I didn't like and that's still a big step up. At the very least you should watch The Husbands of River Song, that episode is fantastic.
