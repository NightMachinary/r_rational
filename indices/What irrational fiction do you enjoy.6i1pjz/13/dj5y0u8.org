I keep coming back to Doctor Who, though that may be childhood loyalty as much as anything. What I find in general is that I can stand scientific implausibility, and even self contradictory implausibility, and I can stand idiotic protagonists up to a point, but I can't stand protagonists who always fall through the same emotional flaws time after time after time, especially when ordinary people I know are capable of doing better. This is what ruined The Flash and Supernatural for me (as well as the whole 'literally Hell' deal in the latter)
