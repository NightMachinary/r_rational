I don't know if it's better /written/, but I certainly find it more /fun/. Even when it pulls a Deus Ex Machina it feels intentional for a pulpy story like this, it's supposed to be kind of goofy. The action, comedy, mystery, and chemistry between the characters are all hugely enjoyable and know exactly how serious to take itself. I love the occasional shout outs to the penny dreadful.
