I agree, but what really got me to stop reading wasn't that it went off the cliff but that I didn't enjoy what I found there. I know a lot of people like The Broadcast, but that just wasn't what I wanted from a story like this. Uriel's reveal about souls is what finally did me in, the story has just become unpleasant to read by that point,
