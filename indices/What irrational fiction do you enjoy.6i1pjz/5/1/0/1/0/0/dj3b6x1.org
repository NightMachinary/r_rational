Yeah. Him just deciding North Africans wouldn't have souls but retain all other aspects of being human was just distasteful and discomforting. Apparently he did it because souls are a limited resource for humans, but that isn't how souls have worked in literally any religion or mythology so it just seems random and bizarre.
