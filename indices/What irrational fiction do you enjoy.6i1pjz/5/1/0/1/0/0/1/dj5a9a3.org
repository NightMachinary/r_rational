When I read it, it looked like Uriel did that in a genuine but misguided attempt to help; that without a soul, there was no person inside the body, leaving all of them philosophical zombies, who could /look like/ they were suffering (from war, hunger, etc.) but without /actually/ suffering because there was no-one there to suffer.

(In other words, Uriel painlessly killed off an entire race of people to prevent them from suffering.)
