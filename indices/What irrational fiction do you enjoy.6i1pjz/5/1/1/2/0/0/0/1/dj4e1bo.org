Nothing in that paragraph is necessarily false. A good deal of UNSONG is dedicated to pointing out that that interpretation is naive, but it is not actually /untrue/ in the strictest sense. Anyone who can memorize a few dozen words can be a doctor and a farmer, and in that sort of world there is no reason to charge for either service. If not for the intervention of the aforementioned "international system of governance" (intervention which may or may not be ultimately beneficial or necessary) a great deal of material suffering could be alleviated. So the stance of the characters is a possible rational stance given their information. Does the fact that Harry in HPMOR reaches the conclusion that the government of magical Britain ought to be overthrown make HPMOR an iconic work of fiction advocating for the overthrow of any real life government?
