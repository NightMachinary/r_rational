As a member of the observing public, /will you get a room you two/. A thread about /fiction preferences/ is not the place for insult-laden rhetoric. Leaving it in the public record is currently doing nothing but /ruining the public record/ so, please, argue all you want, but do it in an appropriate setting and consider using some degree of civility.
