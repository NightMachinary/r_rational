Abridged Series. By their very nature, they tend to be pretty irrational, mocking and exaggerating the plot holes and characterizations of the canon materials to extreme lengths or reinventing the characters entirely to make them even more crazy and funny.

Friendship is Witchcraft, DBZ Abridged, Hellsing Abridged, SAO Abridged, etc.

Along the same lines: Darths and Droids and D.M. of the Rings are also enjoyable.
