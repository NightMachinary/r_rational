I don't feel like his intelligence matches his behaviour, personally. I can't think of a single point where Quentin does something genuinely clever. On the other hand, we also get very little insight into his thought processes, and his decisions are almost entirely formed based on what the plot requires, so it's probably just an offshoot of that.
