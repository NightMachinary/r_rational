I'd have to think more about WoR, but is Mistborn really /ir/rational fiction? I think it hits most if not all the sub's descriptions of RF:

- Sanderson typically uses "hard" magic systems, aka ones with very clearly defined rules, and sticks with them throughout the series (even if the reader doesn't necessarily know all the rules at the beginning).
- Problem solving is done through intelligent application of resources, particularly in the first book (there's a lot of creative use of very specifically defined powers, such as the ability to mentally push against metals)
- Factions are driven into conflict by their beliefs/values - one of the main themes of the series is exploring what actually motivates the "heroes" and "villains", and as we progress through the series its shown that with greater perspective, people become more defined by their beliefs than by a black and white morality. Not to get too spoilery, but [[#s][series spoiler]]
- I'd have to go back and reread to confirm, but I can't remember any character actions that occurred just because 'the plot required it'; to my memory, they all occurred for very plausible reasons.

Just because it wasn't explicitly written as RF, doesn't mean it couldn't be considered as such.
