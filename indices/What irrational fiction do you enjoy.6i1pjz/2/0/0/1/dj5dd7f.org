There are multiple Fate/Stay Night Abridged... 3 based on UBW Fate/Stay Night, and one or two based on Fate/Zero. Fate/Cero is pretty good and has a decent number of episodes. The UBW abridged series I would classify as okay, good, and very good. The best one only has one episode, so I hesitated on recommending it.
