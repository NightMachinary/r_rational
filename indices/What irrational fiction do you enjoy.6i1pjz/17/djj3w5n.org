I can't believe nobody has said diana wynne jones. Chrestomanci? Howl's Moving Castl? Nothing is less rational than most of the things that happen in all of her books, but they're magical and glorious and the main characters have spunk and wisdom and genre-savviness and they are /the/ books to read to your kids, just saying.
