I'd be hard-pressed to name an enjoyable book that was true nonsense or without reason, but for /alternative/ sense and /alternative/ reason, the obvious classical recommendation would be Lewis Carroll, e.g. The Hunting of the Snark (read it aloud!). Lord Dunsany is also good for this.

Longer books that make alternative sense: /A Wizard of Earthsea/ by Ursula K. LeGuin, /One for the Morning Glory/ by John Barnes. Those continuities both have consistent alternative epistemology that's depicted as working inside them, but isn't rational epistemology, but isn't horribly annoying either. Some elements of that in Terry Pratchett too.
