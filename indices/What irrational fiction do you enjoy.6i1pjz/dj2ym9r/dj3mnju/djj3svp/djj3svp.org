I'm one of (what feels like very few) people on reddit that actually loved the books. There's something about the characters that resonates with me; maybe their terribleness, maybe their very human weaknesses. They aren't absurdly fallible. The threads of magic woven in are hopeful. The lost years after college when these ridiculously fortunate souls are adrift in drugs and alcohol and stupid lowbrow dramatic shit when they should be /better/, could be /better/. Janet. Especially that moment when she tells Quentin about what happened in the desert. The writing is very pretty, which helps me sink into it.

It doesn't feel hopeless to me. Honestly. And they do change. Quentin particularly towards the very end. Alright, I'll agree that the first book is a bit /much/ on the emo shit but by the end of the series he's very nearly an adult. I know people like the characters in the book. Sad, angry, edgy, fortunate people who have the chance to go on magical adventures but keep fucking up despite everything. And maybe one day growing up. Grossman taps into something real for some of us while letting the magic thrive.

I can get how it's not everyone's cup of tea.
