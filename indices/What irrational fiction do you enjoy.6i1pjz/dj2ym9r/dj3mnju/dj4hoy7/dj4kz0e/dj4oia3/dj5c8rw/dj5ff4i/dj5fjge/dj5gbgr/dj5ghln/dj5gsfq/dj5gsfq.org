  seeking an escape from the real world
#+end_quote

That's an incredibly broad description. It covers pretty much every possible action he could take other than going back to not being a magician (which, incidentally, he /does/ do at one point). Is being a drug- and booze-fuelled party animal an escape from the real world? If he were really trying to escape from the real world, why not join Alice in magical research at that point?

Quentin doesn't ever properly plan, is seldom aware of what he's trying to achieve through his decisions, is very shortsighted, and generally doesn't come across as competent or smart in terms of how he steers the plot.
