Irrational enough to make me stop reading. [[#s][Spoilers for the ending of book one]]

[[#s][Spoilers for the ending of book two]]

And this is after we're repeatedly told, not shown, that he's supposed to be some super-intelligent wonderboy. Quentin's character can be divided into two parts - how he acts, which is pretty much just 'whatever it takes to drive the plot', and how he feels, which is pretty much just 'depressed/horny/depressed' with occasional breaks for alcohol or drugs.

...in summary, I don't really like Quentin that much. He starts off as an interesting and flawed character, then wallows in those flaws for two books without improving much. Every time it looks like he's taken a step in the right direction, he just backslides.
