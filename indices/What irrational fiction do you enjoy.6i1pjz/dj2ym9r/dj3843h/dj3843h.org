I actually got most of the way through a rational alternate ending for LeGuin's /The Farthest Shore/ (third book in the Earthsea series). I might see if I can finish it today, but here's the work in progress: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/117SC9zOYhLX4mkyK3RBVV5HB0uDEm0i1gaIzMoIpTyQ/edit?usp=sharing][The Path to the Farthest Shore]] (4,400 words at the moment). Spoilers for the book, obviously.

I loved the series when I was younger, but /The Farthest Shore/ really annoyed me when I recently reread it. Much of the dialogue before the perspective character (Arren, true name Lebannen) interjects is directly adapted from the book, including how Ged treats one of his closest friends.

My take on it hopefully doesn't require any background for the series, but it probably helps. I tried to rationalise the characters rather than the setting, because the setting's irrationality is part of its appeal.
