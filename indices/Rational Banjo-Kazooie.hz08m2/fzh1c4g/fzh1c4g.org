Rational Banjo-Kazooie: Chapter 2

​

_______________________________________________________________________

​

Banjo sighed with relief as he broke through the underbrush and saw the mountain looming before him. He'd gone exploring Fungi Forest but never anywhere near this deep; nowhere he'd ventured in the wilds compared to the days he'd just been through.

​

He felt nervous about Tooty locked up in that tower alone but Bottles had assured him the witch's plans were firmly delayed. "She stiffed the contractors on her latest lair renovations. It was easy to get a guy on the inside to make sure what we needed to break down, broke down hard".

​

Banjo felt a rage start coursing when Bottles let on they'd intentionally let Gruntilda think it was time to capture Tooty. The mole had fixed him with a steady look from behind his thick-rimmed glasses. "You know how these things go".

​

Banjo did. And that's why he was out here, three days in the opposite direction of the tower holding his sister, looking for some "shaman" to "teach him magic". But he knew how these things went. Reshouldering his backpack, Banjo started on the last leg of his journey.

​

​

The mountaintop was serene compared to the lands it overlooked. Lush grass, stout trees, the churn of a waterfall casting its hypnotic backing over the soundscape... in the distance it looked like the jungle Bottles mentioned peeking through the canyon wall. As far as he'd dared roam bear country as a teen the lands behind Razor Ridge were firmly off limits to any warm-blooded creature...

​

After he'd made it big on the racing circuit he'd taken a blimp down to Autumn Heights in the South Seas for the Tricentenniel Horntop Hop; that glimpse of the legendary Donkey Kong Island in the distance sparked frissons of the unusually serious warnings his older friends and relatives had given him against staying away from such places.

​

Banjo shook his head. He was looking for a village, and it was probably not deep in the foliage. He spotted a trail up the hillside and began trudging his way, hoping it wouldn't be far.

​

​

The village was exactly as it had been described. In fact Banjo had been hoping for something more primal but even the totem in the center - JubJub? - was simply hewn, its rough gem eyes set uneven, without craft.

​

The villagers began to stir from their huts as chatter noticed this stranger watching from the hill. Purple, bulbous-nosed with bright red feathers stuck at a jaunty angle from their headbands... as they began wildly pointing and yelling among themselves a masked figure stepped out from the largest, farthest hut against the canyon wall.

​

Given a reason to draw his attention the hut's shape resolved to a skull in Banjo's perception, crude but stylized once you got the idea. The shape of the mask enclosing the man's head standing on its stoop helped contextualize it well enough.

​

"Ah! Eekum-Bokum!" called the masked figure. He rattled his totem-stick overhead and the villagers began chanting, stomping their feet rhythmically as to make the entire mountain quake. Banjo felt the earth shift under his feet and steadied himself, his heart spiking.

​

"Ah, hello!" Banjo called out in return. "Bottles the Mole sent me, to find the shaman Mumbo Jumbo?"

​

The figure smiled mischievously from beneath his mask slit. "Ah, yes! And it seems you have succeeded! Congratulations!" He rattled his totem harder and the mountain began trembling anew.

​

Feeling uncertain but unthreatened, Banjo started forward. Seeing the stranger unafraid to join them the tribe put up a cheer and began dashing this way and that like a mound of disturbed insects, gathering armfuls of food and firewood and piling it in the center of the village underneath their idol.

​

Mumbo had walked down to greet him, slapping him on the shoulder. "Bear! Friend. Come, join us for jubilee. Jublin Jubilee!" He threw up his arms and everyone rang out in reply. Banjo smiled. "Guh-huh!"

​

​

He'd seen some heaping bonfires staying with his cousin Brash - his competitive spirit meant he always tried to throw the biggest ragers, topping last month's all summer long. But those wildest teenage nights looked like a damp huddle-near next to the fervor with which the Jublins threw themselves into this celebration. As Mumbo explained, "Autumn harvest, spring renewal, winter remembrance. Not enough parties!".

​

As the flames leapt higher in sheets and piles they began tossing entire bales of strange-smelling leaf into the center. The acrid smoke made Banjo's nostrils burn but it was well matched to the simple wines and fermentations he kept getting offered in wide bowls; before long he was dancing and clapping to their music with an intensity that delighted the younger tribespeople and brought a gleam to the elders' eyes.

​

Every villager wanted some time with this novel figure stepped out of stories from who-could-tell. Banjo found himself being pulled this way and that, into huts where they'd wave tablet sketches in his face and point excitedly at different details; he didn't remotely know the language but tried to appreciate what they wanted to show him and responded with broad, simple gratitudes.

​

Looking back into the blear of the early hours Banjo could never tell when unconsciousness finally stole over him.
