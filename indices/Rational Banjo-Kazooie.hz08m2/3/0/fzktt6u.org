Chapter 3

​

He came to on a broad reed floor, a hut flickering in a ring of torches. Banjo rubbed his paws against his eyes blearily as he sat up, trying to deny the pounding headache and swirling displacement as he oriented.

​

Mumbo was sitting on a throne - more of a deep chair, woven - looking down on him keenly, immense blue eyes almost glowing in the dancing shadow. He waved his totem-stick lazily over the armrest conjuring the briefest sparks from the cap. Banjo squinted - well he'd have been squinting anyway - and sure enough it was recognizably a skull.

​

"Your first look is my Mumbo magic stick?" Mumbo asked curiously. Banjo dipped his head.

​

"Ah... sorry. Just didn't get a chance to see it earlier."

​

Mumbo nodded. "Often don't get a chance to see everything we want. Gotta keep your neck turning!"

​

Banjo grinned. "Seems like that'd be kind of tough with the mask".

​

Mumbo laughed, his jittering wand erupting a veritable shower of pink; throwing the hut's decor into sharp relief. If Banjo had wanted primal here it was - if only the flash hadn't sent a shockwave across his nerves. What he remembered of those walls in the moment before his eyes screwed would long stick with him in that timeless drift before sleep, until later adventures wrought worse torments upon his twilight ponders.

​

"I suppose this is your hut. Also skull themed?"

​

"Yes! Well, no. Shaman hut. But Mumbo shaman, so my hut".

​

Banjo angled himself to kneel, pulling the soft cushion that had laid beneath him head to spare his knees. Mumbo watched how methodically he shifted with faint amusement. "Perhaps Bear do it up too hard last night?"

​

Banjo laughed. "I don't know that I've ever done it up harder. You Jublins know how to do".

​

Mumbo smiled, its warmth dulled by the mask enveloping his face. "Yes. But also important for first lesson in Mumbo magic"

​

Banjo nodded. "Good. I was hoping we could get right to it. I don't know what Bottles told y-"

​

"Thought you wanted to get right to it".

​

Banjo chuckled. "Allright. When do we start, then?"

​

Mumbo cocked his head, wide eye impossibly expanding...

​

"No way. With this hangover?"

​

"Like I say. Important for lesson. This also help with both". Mumbo waved his totemstick in a wide, lazy circle; instantly the torches changed to a dark bright blue. Within moments Banjo lost sense of his distance to the torches, or to the walls or Mumbo; or their relation to each other.

​

"I've never... met that many clans who burnt plants to feel out of their mind"

​

Mumbo's mask didn't move; the purple of his body receding under the hue's cast.

​

"...so what's the lesson?"

​

Mumbo raised his stick. "Mumbo magic give power to transform. Thanks to JuJu, protector of Jublins. Shamans provide for JuJu, JuJu provide Mumbo magic."

​

Banjo nodded, his head swimming in several senses but following

​

"Very dangerous. Many seasons shamans only transform animals. Mumbo's teacher say, is that enough? Teacher cast out from JuJu!" At this both Mumbo's eyes widened. "He learn many kind of magic. Return to teach Mumbo better Mumbo magic. Also other things." The mask tilted down. "Is Bear ready for Mumbo magic?"

​

Banjo paused, not needing to consider but weighing the impression of taking the step seriously. "Yes."

​

"Oobidiba, oobidiba, oobidiba..."

​

​

Banjo was everywhere at once. He was back in the cabin with Ma and Pa as he took a hairpin pass to first place in the Willow Woods Invitational Cup. His friends were splashing, calling for him to dive and join them in the crystalline tranquility of Cotton Top Cove; surfacing he found himself deep in those horrible pipes with that... whale

​

Every memory and daydream and potentiality roiled around him and through him. Every fight he'd gotten into, every fork in the forest path he played out in endless permutation until he lost the thread of his true decisions. All he could hold onto, hold himself together with was that this was him, he felt like himself; recognance, on an intuitive level.

​

A vein of attention like a thread caught suddenly in the light; every wilderness adventure and day spent exploring consumed his train of thought. He tried to keep grasp the rest of it, the everything-else that was himself but the concepts decayed as he fumbled for all at once.

​

He crested strange vistas: goliath monuments, islands in the clouds, prehistoric landscapes with dinosaurs out of picture books. He wrestled with a living torch in the deepest recesses of a vast machine. More wonder and impossibility than he could take in all at once and he found himself whiting out in the corners of his...

​

Like a puzzle-toy shifting its faces to reveal new colours he unfolded a twin to every moment, a doubling of self that overwhelmed his sense of self. FEAR and GREEN and... banana?

​

The dissonance gave him anchor but he'd long lost any pattern in the timeless deluge; looking from ape to bear and bear to ape, their every experience and subliminal thought perfectly balanced against the other he couldn't conceive there was ever a him that had been either. The notion of individuation disappated and the being of every Gruntling and Gnawty and God-head..............

​

The pole of the ape and bear but that collapses into singgularity, deepest elements inverted. The crocodile, fierce, bulbous and manic as the witch grows fell and deep - their forests bleeding ghastly and whimsical into each other and everywherrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

​

"OOMENAKA!"

He looked down at himself, spreading his arms.

​

"Whoooaah" said Banjo the Squirrel.
