Light can travel around the Earth (if light bent like that) about eight times in a second. So if teleportation worked at the speed of light, the maximum delay would be about 1/15 of a second if you traced the surface, or about 1/25 if you punched straight through. Was there a confirmation that teleportation is exactly instantaneous and there's not even a minute practically unnoticeable delay?
