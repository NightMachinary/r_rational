Energy within the loop doesn't get expended. It is /changed/. The expensive stuff is:

1. the pocket dimension
2. the dilation itself around the dimension
3. acquiring and arraigning all the matter in the dimension to match the template
4. Moving souls around.
5. Administrative overhead of the guardian.

You need 1 source of magic equal to that of the area enclosed, but you shouldn't need that amount again since it's not expended at the end of the cycle--only misplaced.

All this assuming that energy in this world is neither created nor destroyed--same as energy in the real world.
