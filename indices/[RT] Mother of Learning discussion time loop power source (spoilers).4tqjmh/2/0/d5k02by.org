  When creating pocket dimension, it may be possible to specify its content cheaply

That doesn't make sense to me. Creating an arbitrary amount of matter and energy, cheap? Doesn't seem likely.

  defining content may require privileged divine casting...may occupy arbitrary large amount of pocket dimensions.

Either of those possibilities would certainly strengthen the idea that the Maker must be a god. If not before creating the Gate, then certainly afterward.
