I actually think that the Maker /couldn't/ be a god. Or, if it is, it is a massively incompetent one.

This is due to the mechanism Zorian used to enter the loop. The fact that the entity in the Gate was massively confused that there could be multiple valid Controller markers means that the Maker must not have known anything about soul magic or Ikosians. The Maker was clearly massively incompetent or ignorant of what was possible with magic if it didn't take into account this possibility when it apparently ironed out most of the other bugs one might expect when programing something like this.

We don't know much about gods, but they are generally not the kinds of entities which would completely forget about an aspect of the universe they lived in when making a powerful artefact of ancient myth.

So here's another possibility: What if the Sovereign Gate is the /reason/ the Gods have vanished? What if they have been locked away by the mortal who created the Gate, their power siphoned off and used most efficiently when the realm they are imprisoned in is close, during the Planar Alignment?
