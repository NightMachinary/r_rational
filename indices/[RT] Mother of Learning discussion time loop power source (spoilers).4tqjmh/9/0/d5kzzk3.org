I think energy reclamation is a part of the deal. Every month, everything within the loop is converted to energy, then remade according to the original template pattern. All the energy during the loop, even any heat that doesn't escape the loop boundry can be repurposed, which greatly reduces the cost of recreating the loop every month.
