Even if it charges from an external source, it couldn't, as you said, "recharge from the looping world itself," since any energy the loop gained would be energy that it had already expended. It couldn't really recharge, but perhaps it could be made more efficient if it had a mechanism to reclaim energy used to simulate. But I really don't know if it would even be worth it, as most of that energy is used to keep the simulation accurate. Also, come to think of it, we don't know for sure that the loop /doesn't/ recycle all the available energy at the end of every iteration.
