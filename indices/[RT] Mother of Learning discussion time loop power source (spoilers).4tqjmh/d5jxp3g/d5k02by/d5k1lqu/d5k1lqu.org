  That doesn't make sense to me. Creating an arbitrary amount of matter and energy, cheap? Doesn't seem likely.

Think typical mindscapes, only renamed pocket dimensions, no arbitrary modification after creation, and precision indistinguishable from reality.

Or, in MoL terms, using true matter conjuration is cheaper then moving matter between dimensions. You created it there? It does not help you here much.

There is some evidence that moving matter between dimensions is cheap, though. So I find this theory unlikely as well.
