We have no info on pocket dimensions mechanics. Given that, few thoughts:

- When creating pocket dimension, it may be possible to specify its content cheaply, but energy/matter transfer between dimensions is costly. In other words, pocket dimension spell is divination heavy. Or defining content may require privileged divine casting. There are rumors of ancient mages, possibly empowered by gods, doing true matter conjuration, after all. No gods - no true matter conjuration.

- Gate may be located in its own personal pocket dimension with power source unrelated to the host and copy world. In fact it may occupy arbitrary large amount of pocket dimensions.
