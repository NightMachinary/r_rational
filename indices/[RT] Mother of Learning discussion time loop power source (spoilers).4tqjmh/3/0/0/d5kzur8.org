1. I agree that assets like mountains and such are probably not reused wholesale---seems to me like a lot of energy would have to go into rechecking fidelity to the original template. However, much of the energy can still be recycled if "destruction" means converting all matter to energy, then recondensing everything according to the original template pattern. This annihilation and repatterning is possibly what the monthly cost of the loop is referring to.
2. Simulations require operating power during the simulation. However, an actual copy only needs the initial energy investment. This is just another point of consistency with what the Guardian said.
