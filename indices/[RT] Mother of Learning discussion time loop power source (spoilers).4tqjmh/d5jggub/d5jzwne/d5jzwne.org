  it couldn't, as you said, "recharge from the looping world itself," since any energy the loop gained would be energy that it had already expended.

Well, there is such a thing as regenerative braking...

#+begin_quote
  most of that energy is used to keep the simulation accurate
#+end_quote

Source?

I wasn't under the impression that any (or at least any significant amount of) energy is expended during the iteration. Zorian seems to have discovered the opposite: "Wait," frowned Zorian. "So the time loop spends power per iteration, not according to how much time passes?"

#+begin_quote
  we don't know for sure that the loop doesn't recycle
#+end_quote

Good point; it might. Except my thinking was, this is an exact copy of the world and its surroundings - not an illusion, but a real and working copy. So, if the power source was anywhere in the vicinity, then it would be recreated inside the loop, and would thus be supplying power - potentially for longer than the 400 years that would otherwise be available for recharging. If the Gate is indeed making use of that already, then that would mean that charging time inside the loop is actually more important than the charging time in between, and that the length of each loop will greatly affect the capabilities of the next loop (eg this reduced loop would mean much less power available next time).
