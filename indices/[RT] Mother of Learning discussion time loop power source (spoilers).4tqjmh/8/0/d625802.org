#+begin_quote
  draws power from the planar alignment
#+end_quote

As discussed elsewhere in the comments, I don't think that this is quite right. It /relies/ on the alignment, but not, I think, to supply power - rather, the alignment vastly reduces the /cost/ of dimensional magic.

#+begin_quote
  the planar alignment allows the excess mana of each planet to be used in rituals.
#+end_quote

But the loop is recreating each of the planets, each time. Six planets can't supply enough mana to create six /thousand/ planets, each of which would then be a mana source as powerful as the original six!
