The time loop draws power from the planar alignment. That's why it has to be activated on or near the summer solstice.

It's weaker this time because the ritual happened a month before the solstice. The planetary alignment only happens every 400 years or so.

  They were regular like the progression between night and day," Ghost Serpent replied. "Every four hundred years, whenever the planets aligned.

  Zorian took a deep breath, a shiver running down his spine. Of course! How could he have missed it till now? This year's planar alignment, signified by several planets aligning with their own, an event that took place once every 400 years or so. The last time such an event happened, a city of mages took advantage of it to teleport their entire city all the way from Miasina to the southern coast of Altazia, performing the largest feat of trans-continental teleportation to ever be recorded. If someone wanted to mess around with space and time on a grand scale, this was the time to do it.

The creation myth of this universe states that there were several dragons the gods defeated, and the last they made into the planet humans inhabit. My theory is that they made the other dragons into planets in the solar system, and the planar alignment allows the excess mana of each planet to be used in rituals.

  According to Ikosians, the world was originally a swirling, shapeless chaos, inhabited only by the 7 primordial dragons. One day, the gods descended from the higher planes of existence and killed all of them save one. This last one they refashioned into the material world that humans now inhabit, turning her body into dirt and stone, her blood into water, her breath into air and her fire into magic. The vast networks of tunnels stretching beneath the surface of the world are dragon veins, now empty of blood that had been turned into the seas but still flooded with magic emanating from the Heart of the World -- the fiery, still-beating heart of the primordial dragon that rests somewhere deep underground. Far from being content with her fate, the Dragon Below still rages against her bounds, giving birth to natural disasters like volcanoes and earthquakes.
