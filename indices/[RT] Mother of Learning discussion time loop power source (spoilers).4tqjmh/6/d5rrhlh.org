Okay, so it is, and nearly from the beginning it was, obvious that the author is heavily drawing on Time Braid. The question is of course how much.

I'd say that indeed yes, gods are the most likely suspects for creating this loop/simulation. I mean it's similar to the point where even Zach/Naruto both have fuzzy memories of how the loop started, and in both cases, it's more likely that Zorian/Sakura will figure it out how it's started. So the answer is most likely along the TB premise, where it's shenanigans of gods that enable such powerful magic to work. Or perhaps they're just really technologically advanced (even more so than in TB) and are capable of doing this through technology with some massive power source like a power plant near exploding supernova or some bullshit. (Nevermind the impossibilities i'm a tree (well only a branch really), I don't know half of the stuff usual humans do.)

Also in both cases, RR/Sasuke was removed from the loop. I think the real question we should be asking ourselves is who's Hinata. It's supposed to be someone shy but with some awesome powers.
