Not sure.

Does the planar alignment usually coincides with that? Does it also appear every 400 years? Because if that's so, then they could, thanks to weakened borders between the planes simply siphon the energy from the positive energy plane. Otherwise nuclear fission is reasonable choice for gathering energy, ... With access to other planes you could easily dispose of all the nuclear waste too. Or you know some matter/antimatter thing from Star Trek.

Also, I wonder where do they store all that energy. Because if it's on the planet, then there's the issue of energy having to be reproduced in simulation. Ugh ...

(I'm sorry, I know I said nothing useful.)
