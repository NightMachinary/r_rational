If by "it" you mean the planar alignment, then chapter 22: "planar alignment, signified by several planets aligning with their own, an event that took place once every 400 years or so."

Er...there's no evidence that that exists in this storyverse. Although the idea of siphoning energy from /somewhere/ is...interesting.
