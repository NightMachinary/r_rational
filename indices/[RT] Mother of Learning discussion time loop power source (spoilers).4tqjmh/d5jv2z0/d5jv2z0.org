It is possible to calculate an upper bound, actually.

A loop lasts no longer than one month. It has a fixed light cone.

To clarify, if an object is farther away from the looper at the start of the loop than the distance photon covers in the duration of one loop, then the looper and the object cannot interact with each other: they can't travel faster than light, so the loop inevitably resets before they meet. (As example, no entity looping in a nanosecond-long loop will be able to affect anything beyond a sphere of radius 0.3 meter.)

Unfortunately, I cannot find any particulars about the MoL loop's length. I only know that it lasts 'a month', starts 'after two in the morning'^{[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/41/Mother-of-Learning][ch.41]]} and ends '2 hours and 40 minutes after midnight'^{[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/40/Mother-of-Learning][ch.40]].} For lack of better numbers, I'll go with '30 days long'.

30 days × 24 hours × 60 minutes × 60 seconds = 2.592×10^{6} seconds. 2.592×10^{6} × 3×10^{8} (speed of light) = 7.776×10^{14} meters = ~5.198×10^{3} astronomical units. In our Solar system, that's past the Kuiper Belt halfway to the Oort Cloud. (Volume of the corresponding sphere is 1.97×10^{45} m^{3} or 1.4×10^{18} Sol, if you care about that.)

Since the time loop works under extreme time acceleration, nobody in the non-looping universe will be able to notice any discrepancies afterwards, so I cannot think of any reason why the Time Loop Creator would create a template bigger than that.

Admittedly, that's not a very small template.

Of course, it all only works under the assumption that FTL signaling is impossible.
