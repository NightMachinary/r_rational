From the description of the loop it seems clear that it is a closed system, and as such it doesn't gather any energy. Makes sense too-whatever energy gathering thingy you make on the outside, it won't work, since no time passes on the outside.

As for how much power it would need per iteration, it might not actually be as much as people make it out to be. There certainly would be a huge power requirement to initiate the loop for the first time, but after that you could probably reuse a lot of the assets. E.g. tectonic plates don't move much in a month, and change even slower than that, so you would only really need to shift them backwards a couple micrometers, but won't actually need to recreate them from scratch. Mostly you would need to change the surface layer of the planet, and that's not much.
