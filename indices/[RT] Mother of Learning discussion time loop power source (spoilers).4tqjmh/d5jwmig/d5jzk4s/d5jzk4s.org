  it seems clear that it is a closed system, and as such it doesn't gather any energy
#+end_quote

OK, but it has to have gathered it from somewhere, at some point, because the Guardian referred to running out of power. So we're still looking at a situation where 400 years of energy collection allows you to operate 550+ years of loop. That's pretty massive energy collection throughout those 400 years. Offhand I can't think of any external power source that would supply so much energy.

#+begin_quote
  you could probably reuse a lot of the assets
#+end_quote

Maybe you could - but looks like it doesn't. From chapter 55, "When an iteration is over, everything in it is destroyed." And the length of the iterations doesn't affect their power requirements, apparently, which it would if resetting were a matter of undoing changes. The loop isn't winding things back, but rather wiping and starting over.
