Any universe supporting magic has weird energy things going on. The body holds only a little bit of energy that can be used intentionally. This problem is often solved by the existence of souls. Souls are kind of like a mana battery in that case, allowing significantly more energy to be stored and refocused into spells.

For the universe, assuming similar physics and a roughly similar energy density, it would be a cool explanation if the universe itself had something analagous to a soul, and this soul stores energy from the multiverse. This would allow the universe, or sections of the universe essentially, to "cast spells" that might have the effect of creating loop-creating effects.

The real question becomes, how does an individual access the control functions of spacetime to make things like time loops occur?
