Wow, first off, massive respect for you being able to bust out all those details off the cuff. You've won me over on them not being bad skills at least.

Still Velocity just seems too shockingly good. Velocity Mages are known to be able to act with twitch reflexes at hyper speed while still having used higher faculties of thought within those reflexes. This to me would synergise so ridiculously well with his multi-magic build, not even taking into account whatever Virtues would get lumped on top.

And one of biggest limitations on Velocity is air starting to slow you down at higher speeds, he already has air magic cutting out one of the big drawbacks Velocity would normally have.

Void is a big risk for June right now, and the Velocity/Air/Dodge skill combo gives him reasonable reaction time and capacity to avoid it. (Or at least maneuver his body to get hit in a non-vital part).
