Another thing I really liked about this chapter was the whole "does Dorisland just need fascism?" thing. That this would be shitty and a 'problematic' resolution to the plot is lampshaded when the characters outright discuss that being a shitty narrative resolution, and why ("fascism's good when its us doing it!"). And then, by treating the situation like the real world to a greater extent than people in the real world treat real world discussions, AW introduces a satisfying resolution.
