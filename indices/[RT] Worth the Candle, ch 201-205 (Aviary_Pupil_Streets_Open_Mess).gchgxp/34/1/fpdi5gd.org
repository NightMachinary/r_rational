Is there another magic style that makes you a demigod at level 100 /and/ is powered by a single substance to the point where being there allows you to train to arbitrary extents? Bone magic isn't it, because you actually drain anima ipsa (soul stuff) to gain powers the soul the bones belonged to had.

Maybe being able to "claim" an arbitrary amount in the elemental plane of Gold would make for an insanely powerful (and insanely insane) Gold Mage.
