No one is going to read this but I'm putting it here so I can point to it if I end up being right:

It's been heavily foreshadowed that Mary is going to sacrifice herself/be sacrificed. Also things are solidifying between her and Joon. Joon had a conversation with Grak about confessing his feelings and getting over his compunction about having sex with her, and it's been several chapters since then, which means it's not going to happen because that's not how stories work.

I predict Mary is going to be turned into a zombie before they kill Blue-in-the-Bottle. She'll either die or, more likely, Joon will gain new magic/break the exclusion and save her.
