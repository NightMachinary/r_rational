I do think that it is interesting to think about, but I also agree with Juniper that his start to Aerb really demanded phys. Kind of sets a tone for what the rest of the campaign would be like, and I think the story has largely born out that Soc is a poor path. (For example I'm not sure how the Mome Rath situation gets solved by Soc Juniper or how he would deal with the level up problem.) Their must be a possible path though because Juniper even mentions that all setup challenges must be potentially solvable. I just don't see it unless there are some truly obscene levels of DM manipulation going on behind the scenes.
