My headcanon for the DM is that he bought a VERY good VR game system. But Aerb is his own design using the creation tools and based off June's memory. So its a really good backbone system, with a terribly put together world.\\
The system itself automatically handles tensions and narrative development unless the DM f*cks with it, which he repeatedly does, not realising his 'improvements' just add extra suck.
