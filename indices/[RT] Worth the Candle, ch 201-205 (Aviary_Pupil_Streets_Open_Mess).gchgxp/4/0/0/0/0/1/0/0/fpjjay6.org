This is getting deep into assumptions here. Surely if social abilities had this kind of power Reimer would have mentioned it? I guess you could argue he doesn't know but it seems like a shallow foundation to build speculation on to me. That said the ideas are cool.

For Mome it's possible social fu would have let Juniper dismantle the cult early, but I'm not sure. They had Valenicia after all and she's currently our best approximation of what maxed out social looks like. (Yes being a non anima limits her usefulness but I think the point largely stands.) To be fair though a Soc Juniper would have no reason to go to Li'o so they wouldn't be there to prevent Mome Rath's summoning or kill it in the first place.

You had a significantly different reading than I did of the level up situation. For one thing, he did directly fix the problem. It is permanently solved, not a band-aid. Second perfect rationality is not a universally agreed upon thing and the soul dictates what a person values. A perfectly rational Juniper dedicated to the level up would be insanely dangerous because he'd take the optimal path to getting level ups morality be damned.

For P Space you might be right, Social Juniper might dominate in combat there. The problem is without magic, he could never get there in the first place which is the primary reason I brought it up. Uther had to use some novel combination of magics that Raven didn't understand to get there, and that magic would require mental.
