I get the idea in broad strokes, but that answer doesn't satisfy me in the two specific cases I mentioned. For Mome Rath you are taking as a given that Juniper would get some way around the anti-memetic effect in the Soc path. That seems like a big assumption to me. With anti-memetics in play he can't leverage his social skills to get an army as he'd forget about the problem the moment he left.

Even if you can finagle some solution for Mome Rath it doesn't answer how Soc Juniper would deal with his level up addiction without mental investment. Also if they do go to P Space that seems like something that a Soc Juniper would not be able to do.
