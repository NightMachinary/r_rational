Do we know anything else about Manifest?

But yes, entity from another dimension is more plausible in a setting where other dimensions are a thing. Or even if it isn't from another dimension, it still seems like a clear-cut supernatural and alien danger like the Void Beast or the Cannibal or the Television God. Doris Finch is different in that she was completely human until she wasn't and I'm really curious how that happened. Also, all other Exclusions seemed like there was this existing ability or interaction or monster that was subsequently deemed setting-breaking by the DM and isolated. Doris Finch is, till now, the only one that seemed directly created for the purpose of being an exclusion.
