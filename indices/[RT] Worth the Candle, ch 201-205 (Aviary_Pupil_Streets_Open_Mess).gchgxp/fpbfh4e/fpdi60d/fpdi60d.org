I mean I don't think Jesus made up that label, that came later. And the story isn't so much assuming that Samaritans are shit by default, and more working off the shared animosity between the two groups.

It's also relevant that we're talking about societies where most people are desperately poor and the rule of law is relatively weak (at least when traveling between cities), so spending a bunch of money on some random stranger is going to be maybe unusual even if they're part of your in-group.
