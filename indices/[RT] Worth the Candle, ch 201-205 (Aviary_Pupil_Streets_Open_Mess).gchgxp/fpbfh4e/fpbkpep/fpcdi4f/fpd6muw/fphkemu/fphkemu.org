  As neither half of the split can risk waiting 24h and potentially losing everything, she must split to persist her gear by robbing her new clone.

yeah this loophole does seem to be the crux of the problem. just to be clear, my understanding was it's not that the clone whose gear *wasn't* going to persist splits, and now one of those two has permanent gear; rather that each clone will split at the 23 hour mark to reset the timer and steal that clone's stuff.
