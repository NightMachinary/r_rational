The problem here is that she wouldn't have known that the clothes on her back had a 50/50 chance of lasting just 24 hours. Imagine you've got the ability to clone yourself and everything you're holding. How many times do you do it?

Because I can imagine a situation in which Doris realised what she could do, cloned herself while holding food or money, then repeatedly cloned themselves while gathering the resources together on one Doris until they had enough food for every Doris.

And then 24 hours later, it all disappeared and suddenly they're without food or any other resources and there's a couple of hundred of them.

Doris, burned by cooperation within a day of getting her ability, then realises that she's better off looking after herself rather than working with that /bitch/ who wasted all their food.
