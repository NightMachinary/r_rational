I didn't think of it until we met Blood Doris, but probably a big part of the reason that all Finches are horrible is evolution. The very first duplication ended terribly because she was stuck in a bad frame of mind, which naturally made the next several end bad due to suspicion. From that point on, cooperators died and defectors lived, until the sort of aggregate Finch moved all the way into defector territory. Its a combination of normal changes to a person over time and selection pressure from differences in reproduction rates.
