> From that point on, cooperators died and defectors lived, until the sort of aggregate Finch moved all the way into defector territory. Its a combination of normal changes to a person over time and selection pressure from differences in reproduction rates.

maybe more gradually than this, though. Not all cooperators died, but cooperators didn't reproduce as aggressively. All it takes is one with the mentality that they are willing to reproduce to create a gang and use force to get her way; poof, you've got an army all with this mentality. It's more like a cancer, really. One individual starts a splitting explosion and eating up more resources, and then everyone is forced to play by "fight or die" rules.
