I still consider that to be very tight timing, game wise. I mean its textual - Joon & Co pretty much roll their eyes when they hear its happening "oh wow the DM really threw this quest hook at us didn't he?" If the in-game characters think its neatly wrapped up with a bow, who am I to disagree? it doesn't matter that they could have shown up a month or so ago, we never see those months as an audience - for us its a plot point mailed right to our doors, same-day delivery.

And I would not spend more time on it either - I am saying it should be restructured so it doesn't require that. Like with Blood Doris being present for a longer stretch, having multiple interactions with the crew so that her listening to them feels more realistic. Or the whole plot having been foreshadowed in previous chapters, or connected to them in some way (like say the Dorises noticing the End is Nigh signs and launching risky projects they wouldn't have in the past). I don't think you even need to change much, just integrate the plot more into the world.
