The timing wasn't that tight. The Blues said the crisis had been ongoing for over a month when the team arrived. Blood God Doris was also not going to come out for another week, but they let her out early. The only suspect timing was Pinno, but eh library timelines. The timing was again not that tight because he went in early when he heard the team was going in.

FWIW I don't think the plotline would have benefited much from more time spent on it. It was already as Juniper put it a sub sub quest that if they wanted to they could have easily skipped.
