I can tell I am in the minority here, but I didn't love these chapters! Not that they went close to the "bad" territory or anything, I think everything here was just too "neat" so I felt it difficult to suspend disbelief. Like, them showing up just as the Doris EZ is having its largest crisis in history is brushed away as a plot hook by the DM, sure that's true, but hanging a lampshade on it doesn't actually resolve it. It is actually really rare in WTC for something to happen just so the DM can give Joon & Co quests; most have been set up by the DM but a long time ago, and the group either actively seeks it out (Falahter, Bethel) or it occurs in response to their actions/situation (Everett's Group, Larksupr, Raven). Even Lio was a bit of a ploy by Uniquities to get them involved. They even show up here randomly; they try to kill Blue-in-a-Bottle once via direct assault and then just give up and go Finch'ing.

The resolution suffered from a similar problem - the idea of them all being Dorises sort-of papers over the fact that the central 'antagonist', who is their own person, isn't met till the last chapter and is pretty much immediately completely understood and reasoned with. From our perspective we know who Doris is, but from blood!Doris's perspective these are some random strangers telling her her life story. She shows up and is immediately resolved. I think it would have worked a lot better if she was an active player through the whole arc, maybe having recently emerged and the Doris EZ is in an uproar over it. And of course now that its done they are going to just pop off to their main adventure, sight unseen, no big deal.

The chapter had many strengths, don't get me wrong - I liked the dive into Mary's biases and hostilities around the tragedy of the commons and accepting weakness and feelings in others (connecting back to Anglecyn was great), and Star Magic was hilariously pedestrian, real "intro to calc TA" vibes from those tutoring sessions which was great. I just though a thin thread pulled it all together, maybe as a property of trying to move things towards the end-game, and I think the pacing & narrative logic were off-kilter as a consequence.

(As always, thank you AW for the updates and the incredible work)
