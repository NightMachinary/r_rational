  This again has no relevance to my objection. Blood Doris could do what she wants, any path to choose, go for it. Why would she listen to Joon & Co's advice on it?

I don't think you've internalized that Blood God Doris is still Doris. She's spent decades living in a hellscape of her own making, that she rightly blames herself for, a significant fraction of her life as a slave to atypically awful slaveholders, eating human flesh to survive. Doris hates and distrusts herself. She hasn't seen anyone but her clones for decades. Why would she not take the discussion?
