This again has no relevance to my objection. Blood Doris could do what she wants, any path to choose, go for it. Why would she listen to Joon & Co's advice on it? Why are they relevant at all? Why wouldn't she simply walk past these strangers and go on to figure things out? Its like you are in the middle of a corporate strategy meeting and a cold-caller walks in and you just invite them to participate. People don't normally invite strangers to advise them on crucial life decisions.

I just didn't buy the story's justifications for this conversation happening. My emotional reaction to the scene was "oh the plot needs go this way now", which inhibits immersion.
