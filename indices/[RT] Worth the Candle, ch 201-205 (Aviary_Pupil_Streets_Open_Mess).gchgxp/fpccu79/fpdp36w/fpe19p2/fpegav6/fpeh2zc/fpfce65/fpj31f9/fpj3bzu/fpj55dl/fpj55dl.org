Doris isn't gratuitously evil. She's fully willing to discuss things and work them out with others, even herself. Doris doesn't backstab Doris for no reason, she does it because she's playing zero-sum games. A discussion isn't a zero-sum game; this one in particular is clearly positive-sum. Avoiding help would only hurt her own instance.
