I like how she's absolutely horrible, but in a very mundane sense. She's not particularly sadistic, she can actually be reasoned with, and if you're interacting with her socially she's only slightly annoying. But because of her self loathing, philosophical views, and general attitude towards other people she set up this self perpetuating "society" that makes everything blood curdlingly terrible. The fact that at literally any point she could have gotten over her personal troubles and made the EZ into a paradise makes Amaryllis' loathing understandable, especially when Doris has had literally millions of chances to do things right.
