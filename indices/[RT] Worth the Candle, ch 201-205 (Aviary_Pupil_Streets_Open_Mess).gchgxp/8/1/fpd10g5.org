    Hopefully this wasn't just because you learned that pacifism comes with buffs

  LMAO. You can just feel the irritation at Joon going off the plot rails.

Was it really going off the plot rails? The way Blood God Doris was waiting for them, it sounded like it was specifically set up to allow this sort of social victory. Maybe the DM didn't think it very likely, but I don't think it was unforeseen as an option.

  Really hoping we get an answer to this eventually - if it's horrible and barbaric, then I suppose putting an end to it could be part of Blood God Doris's (and Doris Finch's in general) character arc.

Probabilistic binary geographical search using the entrails of slain Doris clones. You can only narrow things down with successive sacrifices because they're technically the same person, if you tried using random normal people each new data set would have orthogonal data.
