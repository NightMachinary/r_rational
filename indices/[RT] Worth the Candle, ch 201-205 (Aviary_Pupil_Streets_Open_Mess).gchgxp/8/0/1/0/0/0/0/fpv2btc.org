You don't need 100 clones.

Doris 1 has 1 Elf bone makes clone Doris 2 with 1 Elf bone.

Doris 2 takes Doris 1's elf bone has 2 Elf bones, makes clone Doris 3 with 2 Elf bones.

Doris 3 takes Doris 2's elf bones has 4 Elf bones, makes clone Doris 4 with 4 Elf bones.

Doris 4 takes Doris 3's elf bones has 8 Elf bones, makes clone Doris 5 with 8 Elf bones.

Doris 5 takes Doris 4's elf bones has 16 Elf bones, makes clone Doris 6 with 16 Elf bones.

And so on forever (or until you hit carry capacity)

So the number of Elf bones is 2 to the power of the number of clones less 1.

21 clones would mean 2^{21-1} or 1 million bones
