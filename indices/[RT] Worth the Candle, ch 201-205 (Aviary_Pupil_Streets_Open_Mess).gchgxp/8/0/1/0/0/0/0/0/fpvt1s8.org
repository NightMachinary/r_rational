Oh, right.

Also, now that I think about it, the Dorises producing the bones and getting killed don't have to be the same as the ones actually using the bones.

The detection system probably works a lot better if you have a bunch of bone-mage Dorises who specialize in using elf bones, and progressively get better at it (possibly with the help of a genetic algorithm), and a bunch of unrelated slave-Dorises dying over and over to provide the elf bones.
