We have very good reason to believe that Doris is not a Druid. For one, being a Druid requires a Locus and the only remaining Locus is accounted for. For two, Doris has completely the wrong mindset for Druidry. And for three, if there were some subset of Dorises who had access to Druidry, the remaining Dorises would intentionally try to ruin that for them as a spite thing/power move.
