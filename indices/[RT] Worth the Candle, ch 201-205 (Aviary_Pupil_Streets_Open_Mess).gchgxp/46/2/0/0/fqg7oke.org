Yes, really.

Thrown Weapons has the virtue Range Finder which doubles accuracy for the purposes of distance. This notably applies to everything, not just thrown weapons - it makes him more accurate with Gem Magic, Rifles and Entad ranged weapons, including those made via Ink Magic. Also Juniper personally likes thrown weapons, which tipped the scales.

Research, Analysis, and Logic taken together gave Juniper the synergy Virtue Narrow Expertise: Multi-Magic, which doubles his effective skill for the purposes of using two magics at once and allows him to treat his effective skill level as 20 in skills for the purposes of multi-magic benefits. They're also generally useful when it comes to making good plans instead of bad plans.

Logistics gives the Worst Case virtue, which imposes a floor on how badly Juniper can fail at logistics - not to the point where he can never fail, but to the point where his failures can never be more than somewhat bad. Because Logistics got a virtue at 10, there is hope that getting it to 30 will give something else good on top of this as a low-hanging fruit.

Optics improves his vision and has strong synergies with Gem Magic - in addition to allowing him to significantly improve the clarity of a lens or prism shaped gem on the fly while ignoring the facets requirement via a Gem Magic virtue, the improved vision stacks with the improved accuracy from Thrown Weapons and the homing nature of blue-spectrum Gem Magic projectiles.

Engineering offers Runtime Analysis, which allows him to automatically make a number of deductions about how a piece of equipment would work without actually having to use it. It is also important for making use of Earth knowledge with regards to importing technologies not otherwise available on Aerb. Ditto for Alchemy, which handles the chemical side of things and which is important for identifying novel subtances.

Mathematics went in on the basis that it works well with a mental build and because they were hoping it would have a synergy with the Research/Analysis/Logic/Logistics/Optics/Engineering/Alchemy/Library Magic cluster of abilities that he already had. This hasn't panned out virtue-wise, but it might do something at level 30.

Personally, I would argue that swapping the Gold Magic in-case-of-glass option (which could be done using a companion just as well) for Fire Magic would be a great idea if he's already rocking Alchemy, but I'm guessing they don't actually have the Entads handy to unlock Fire Magic and historically going to Athenaeums to unlock new Magics has resulted in Spontaneous Quests, so I can kinda see why they're holding off on that one.
