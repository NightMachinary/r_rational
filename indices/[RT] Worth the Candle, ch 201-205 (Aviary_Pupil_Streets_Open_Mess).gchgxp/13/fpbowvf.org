Wow it's really impressive how the writing makes me start with absolutely loathing Doris Finch to feeling enormous pity for her in the span of 4 chapters. Like the whole part with blood god Doris Finch was pretty awe-inspiring, just the sheer concept of how she came to be is so logical and internally consistent.

"Tragedy of the commons" indeed.
