It boggles my mind that even after so much discussion of the *Blood Plane*, an absolute mastery of *Blood Magic*, and a new *Blood God* Doris - there still wasn't a single point where /anyone/ in the cast thought to bring up */Aarde!/*

Do the Gods of Aerb literally not matter under any circumstances??\\
205 chapters in, and there's literally not a single development where Juniper has an excuse to tell us about them, or just mention how they might react to something like this, or compare Aarde's known powers to what BGD is capable of?

I just don't get why the Five Gods are such nonentities in our perspective of the world... Is it a deliberate joke by the DM as the Only True God or something?

If we reach Fel Seed without them mattering even once I'm gonna go crazy.
