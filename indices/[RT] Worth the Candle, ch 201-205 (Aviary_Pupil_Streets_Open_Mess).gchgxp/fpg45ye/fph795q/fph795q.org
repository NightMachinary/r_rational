I kinda appreciate the point but from what I've gathered it's a combination of 1 deliberate avoidance and 2 them being less sapient entities and more like giant space whales that mostly ignore Aerb entirely except to occasionally turn a mountain into liquid mercury for inscrutable reasons. Also a pretty obvious endgame twist from a more Doylist perspective.
