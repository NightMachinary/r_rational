Regarding only the 3.5E Book of Exalted Deeds, not WtC, there are several "vows" that you can take, each of which requires a feat. To get the Vow of Peace, you first need to take the Sacred Vow, then the Vow of Nonviolence, and then, finally, the Vow of Peace. Feats are one of the most important character optimization points for a character, so giving up three of them is pretty extreme. From the Vow of Nonviolence:

  First, you are constantly surrounded by a calming aura to a radius of 20 feet. Creatures within the aura must make a successful Will save (DC 10 + one-half your character level + your Cha modifier) or be affected as by the calm emotions spell. Creatures who leave the aura and reenter it receive new saving throws. A creature that makes a successful saving throw and remains in the aura is unaffected until it leaves the aura and reenters. The aura is a mind-affecting, supernatural compulsion.

  Second, you gain a +2 natural armor bonus to your AC, a +2 deflection bonus to your AC, and a +2 exalted bonus to your AC. This exalted bonus does not apply to touch attacks and does not hinder incorporeal touch attacks. Brilliant energy weapons, however, do not ignore it. It does not stack with an armor bonus. If you also have the Vow of Poverty feat, the natural armor, deflection, and exalted Armor Class bonuses granted by that feat all increase by +2. If a creature strikes you with a manufactured weapon, the weapon must immediately make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half your character level + your Con modifier) or shatter against your skin, leaving you unharmed.

  Finally, you gain a +4 exalted bonus on all Diplomacy checks.

Basically, people are more willing to engage in diplomacy with you, you're quite a bit harder to hit, and you can break weapons against your skin. Sacred Vow also increases Diplomacy, though not by a huge amount.

Overall, it comes with enough special requirements that even if you have the book, you're unlikely to take it, but especially paired with Vow of Poverty, a low magic setting, or a character that it works well with (monk), it can allow some leverage.
