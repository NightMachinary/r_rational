Yeah, I figure that she's not really on their level... but with the insane feats she's been theorized / prophesied to have, what even /is/ their level?

I really thought that we'd at least meet a Cleric by this point, or even just learn what the rest of the gods are all about.

And "Aloof, inscrutable Gods" is definitely a possible trope here, but does someone like Aarde really not care in the slightest if a sudden Blood Demigod pops up out of nowhere?

It feels like we're missing some important detail about them, just like how we missed the "Oh, Doris EZ is a self-perpetuating dystopia by the way" detail until this batch, and I'm so curious what the catch is.
