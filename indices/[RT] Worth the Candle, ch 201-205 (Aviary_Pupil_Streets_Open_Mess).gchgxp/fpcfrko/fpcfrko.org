LMAO. You can just feel the irritation at Joon going off the plot rails.

So, I'm still /very/ curious about how their Heisenberg scrying works. This kind of magic has never been mentioned anywhere other than "that thing the Doris Finches can do".

So she has a unique kind of magic to find people, and she has a unique kind of magic to clone herself. It seems... /odd/ that she would just /happen/ to have two kinds of entirely unique magic that no one else even knows about. So I've assumed for a while now that she somehow uses cloning for this, by Munchkining it together with some other magic, in a process that (presumably) involves killing loads of clones and at the end you have a clone that knows where whats-his-face is. Maybe through an entad that, I dunno, kills you if you lie or something, and they keep narrowing it down? But it can't be /just/ that, it's probabilistic, and from the Larkspur thing there's maybe Library-style time travel involved as well.

Really hoping we get an answer to this eventually - if it's horrible and barbaric, then I suppose putting an end to it could be part of Blood God Doris's (and Doris Finch's in general) character arc.
