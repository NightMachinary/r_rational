Someone else brought up Amaryllis's suggestion that it's elf bones, and I'm inclined to agree especially now we know the bones could be duplicated (is that new information? I forget how much has been established about Doris's abilities before this update).

I can see how they have cloned sweatshops where they give a bunch of Dorises a bunch of books on known magic, and kill the ones who don't learn it. I'm less sure how they'd use this setup to invent new branches of magic - the success rate would be astronomically lower (it's 0 until it happens), so the Dorises in charge would produce no results and get /themselves/ killed. (or it works, and they take over and kill the ones in charge - another risk they have no reason to take)

The plan would be a moonshot (which probably means something different on Aerb and is offensive to elves, but fuck the elves), and that requires taking more risk than the Dorises can handle.
