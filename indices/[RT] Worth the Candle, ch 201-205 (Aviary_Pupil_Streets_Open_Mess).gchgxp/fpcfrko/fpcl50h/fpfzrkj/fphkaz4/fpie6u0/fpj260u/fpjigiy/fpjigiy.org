I don't think it is. When Doris duplicates as a combat strategy it's a survival attempt. Remember Star Doris? The way Doris views her duplication is that it gives her a 50-50 shot at survival. If Doris is duplicating for a fight, its because she believes that the small percent chance she will be a surviving clone is greater than her chance of winning the fight without duplication.
