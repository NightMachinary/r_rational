Having intellectual knowledge is not actually a good thing for Doris in the text as presented. The Star Doris we see in story is a slave forced to work on threat of death and there is no indication the Doris's situation is better with other magics. Even the Blood Mages were slaves until they grew so powerful the Blues could no longer control them. Now you could clone yourself with the intent of enslaving your clone, but Doris doesn't actually like those odds. 50% chance you end up as an enslaved clone performing magic for yourself is not what Doris wants. Remember, she is lazy. The same applies as we scale up the number of Dorises. What Doris does instead of cloning herself is she finds some other Doris enslaves them, then using various forms of coercion to make them work on projects with a sub 1% chance of success. Sort of similar to monkeys with typewriters until something works.

If Doris was a different more cooperative person maybe your schemes could work. Its Amaryllis's primary complaint about Doris after all. However that is not the Doris we see in text and that's why her society is as fucked up as it is with only a few different magics being known instead of all of them.
