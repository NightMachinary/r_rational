At first I was going to say that OP June is still only one person and between the spreading of the lashing glass, Datura desert, and the necrotic field possibly covering all of Aerb he can't be in enough places at once to save everyone. Of course I somehow forgot about Doris Finch. If Blood God Doris can be convinced to teach June how to clone himself then June has a much better chance.

There's also the time loop exclusion acting as a wild card here. If suddenly it's reseting time on all of Aerb (except the exclusionary principle exclusion zone in theory) then it might be that nobody wins. Eternal stalemate reigns instead.
