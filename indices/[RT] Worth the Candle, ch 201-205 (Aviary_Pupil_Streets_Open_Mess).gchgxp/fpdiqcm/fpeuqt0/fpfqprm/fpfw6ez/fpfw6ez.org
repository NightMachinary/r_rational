I imagine a human made into a God would win that one. Suddenly all those excluded synergies (of which many previous holders still live) are back on the table. Someone like Joon could for example get his Still magic up to 100 and then use the souls of a bunch of people to push ALL his other skills up that high without getting excluded.

If exclusions get excluded. Joon wins. Joon wins *hard*
