I strongly disagree, cloning a bunch of batteries is one of the least interesting things cooperating Dorises could do. If you really wanted to make a double-exclusion, I'd suggest making Bethel force Doris to clone her a hundred trillion times. Remember that each Bethel can contain as many entads as you want, and is larger inside than out.
