  but from blood!Doris's perspective these are some random strangers telling her her life story. She shows up and is immediately resolved

It's abrupt, but I don't think it's unbelievable.

From Joon's point of view, they've spend some time getting familiar with Dorises, to the point they start understanding what makes them tick.

From Blood God Doris's perspective:

  “Fuck that's good,” she said, tossing the canteen back across the ward to Grak. As it passed through the ward, the blood simply slid off it, leaving it clean. She looked round at us. “We traded with the Blues, as much as we could, but we knew that they weren't happy about it. And eventually, there were too many colonies in the blood exclusion, too many factions that were stripping the place bare, even with the heavy losses we were taking from the natives. There's some scary shit out there, when you can only see through your sense of blood, probably even scary if it were crystal clear water, but it's damned near impossible to kill every last one of us, and we can wear down nearly anything, or clog their maws with bodies until they're choking to death on pieces of us.” She looked proud of that fact. “It didn't take us long to be the dominant lifeform of our exclusion. And it didn't take long for there to be an arms race among the colonies.”

She was /happy/ in that brief period of time where her civilization was halfway functional. She's nostalgic of that time.

I think it makes sense she'd be so willing to be convinced (besides the extra incentives, like food and warm showers).
