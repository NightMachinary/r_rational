Yeah, you crazy man. Or maybe you are just super naive and sheltered.

Doing nothing and leaving means nothing changes. she still has to deal with endless betrayal of magically multiplying violent cannibals (as the tyrant now rather than the slave)

Leaving Joon means the violence continues ... forever. Maybe you are too young to understand, but problems don't just go away. Unless Doris changes something her life will continue. And opportunities can be lost forever.

Sometimes you just have to take a chance and listen to a stranger rather than go back to an endless cycle of killing and eating yourself.

If you had ever experienced real violence, or had ever thought you were stuck in a hopeless situation, or if you had worked at shelters where victims of violence try to put their life back together, then maybe you would understand these chapters better

I'm tired of dealing with your insanity.

if you didn't like the chapter *write a better version* don't bother replying until you do
