Let's say that every Doris in the plane of blood has the capacity kill every other Doris, and there is no chance of a successful defense, either one of two things happens, either every single Doris dies because they kill each other, or exactly one Doris is left after killing the others.

Well if every Doris dies, then the Dorises from the material plane repopulate the plane of blood again. Given enough time (even if 99% of the time all the Dorises kill each other and 1% of the time a single Doris lives) it only takes one “winner” to win forever and become blood god Doris
