Being able to boost skills using blood and the ability to control blood other than your own is more complex than being able to boost skills using blood. The blood in other Dorises is already attuned to Doris, and all she needs to do is steal it by killing them, but controlling blood other than your own is a separate skill. You'll note that the blood in the building is all Doris blood. If she could control the blood in the plane, there would be no need to use her own blood to coat the building
