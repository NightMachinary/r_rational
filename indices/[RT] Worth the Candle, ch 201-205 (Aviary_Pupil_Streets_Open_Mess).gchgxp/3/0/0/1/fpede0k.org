Reminds me of the game [[https://agar.io/][agar.io]] - imagine the little bubbles (you and other players) are your blood magic, and the agar specks are acts of practice that slightly increase it, but the best way to increase your blood magic is to absorb another blood mage who is less powerful than you are.
