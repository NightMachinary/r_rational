  “There's a feedback loop,” said Raven. “A blood mage with an excess of blood can draw on the power of that blood in order to boost herself, and that boost can make it easier to squeeze more power from the blood. At a certain tipping point, which is more like a hundred times normal blood volume, they can get taken over by something else, unless they're sufficiently skilled at handling it.”

Killing a clone releases all of the Doris blood that she had. Drawing on the power of that blood boosts her ability to kill other clones, releasing more blood for the blood god. I think as soon as any Doris developed the ability to draw on the power of her blood to boost herself, the entire plane would only have a single Doris in minutes or hours, so long as she didn't pointlessly make a copy of herself midway through (the only copy with the ability to kill her). This would still hold even if the first Doris finished learning the technique an hour before some other Doris managed to do it, because it would snowball so incredibly quickly.

Unlike for other blood mages, she wouldn't need to develop a technique of extreme hypertension beforehand, since she can hold usable blood in other bodies. She could learn the snowball technique, and make actual use of it, before ordinary blood mages could.
