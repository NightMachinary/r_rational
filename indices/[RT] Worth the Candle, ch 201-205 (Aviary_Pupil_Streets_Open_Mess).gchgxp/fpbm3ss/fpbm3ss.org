Oddly enough, this entire affair with Doris Finch was incredibly uplifting to read and I was uncertain as to why for a good while.

I think it's because of the sentence:

#+begin_quote
  "She's the person who ruins everything. She is the tragedy of the commons".
#+end_quote

Normally this is where I expect to start seeing tragedy shortly after with flashbacks to [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][Meditations on Moloch]] on how easily tragedy of the commons can pop up and how hard it is to escape it. However, we instead end on a hopeful note where Doris has actually done so and is potentially building a better future despite being someone who everyone thinks is beyond saving.

I also love the irony of how evolutionary arms races usually ends in Malthusian catastrophes, but here it resulted in salvation.

My only disappointment is that there was a literal god of blood, but there wasn't anyone screaming, "Blood for the blood god!!!"
