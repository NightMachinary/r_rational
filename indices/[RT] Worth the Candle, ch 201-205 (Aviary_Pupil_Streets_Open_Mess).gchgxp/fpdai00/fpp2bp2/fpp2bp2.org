  Portals take so long that it requires untethering, which means an immense amount of work on the backend. Not only that, you have to make some predictions of where the stars will be, sometimes up to three months in advance, which is no mean feat. The planes themselves move, if slowly, so if you want something that lasts, you need to figure that out and compensate for it. And the problem gets worse for further planes.” (WTC 202)

  If the circumstances call for a permanent solution, star mages are capable of laying additional lines for “untethering”, which allows the effect to persist even beyond the movement of the stars. (A Brief Description of Aerb, chapter 5)

The portal is untethered. It doesn't need maintained to stay with the star alignments.
