So one thing that isn't clear is how the heck is blood mage doris keeping that portal open? A portal to another location is stable for a few months, a portal to another plane is stable for a corresponding time where bother planes' star alignments haven't shifted significantly, but here they have the third challenge of keeping the gate inside the exclusion zone, which should translate to a much shorter period of stability.

Also, the team has been unusually chatty about the library around the Dorises. I wonder if they left enough clues that the new ruling Doris can find out she needs to stop anyone from mentioning that she is ruling the world in book form, so the library folks don't come after her.

Edit1: Also^{2} , Did the dorises stop aging because the original finally died? If so this would give us a timeline for when the Dorises likely started cloning each other to kill, or at least when the original finally started doing it too.
