Hey now,

I just wanted to tell you that this detailed character analysis of Doris is a great complement of the text and an all-around all-star.

As an aspiring writer I only wish I could get my analysis game on your level.

I usually am a fast reader and tend to miss lots of the characterization details, so I appreciate the peek into the deeper layers rather than having to go play in the surface-understanding sandbox.
