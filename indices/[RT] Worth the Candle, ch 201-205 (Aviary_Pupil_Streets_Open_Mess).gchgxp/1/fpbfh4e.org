It took me a while but I think I get why "Good Samaritan" is considered offensive. Samaritans were a group of people that weren't exactly liked by the people Jesus was preaching to, and Jesus was saying that a group that you wouldn't expect to be kind can still be your neighbor more than your fellow citizens. But saying the "Good Samaritan" implicitly says that all or most of the other Samaritans are bad. If we replace Samaritan with a group that exists in popular conception outside of the Bible, the offensive nature is clear. "The Good Jew" or "The Good Korean" would be horribly offensive phrases to modern sensibilities. On Aerb, it would basically be the same for the Samaritan Orcs.

I wonder if the Amaryllis clones could use star magic, because most of the actual work of star magic is doing math. Even if they're unable to lay the actual lines due to DM fiat, they could still help enormously with star magic projects.

I can definitely see why the WB doc says that the Doris Finch EZ would be a paradise if the person excluded was anyone other than Doris Finch. Being able to duplicate entads alone is absurd, and a person that could actually get along with themself could break the world over their knee even locked to a 31x31 mile patch of land.

I had the thought of using DF to duplicate Bethel, which is honestly pretty scary. Could easily get her excluded.

I absolutely love Amaryllis' description of Doris. "She's the person who ruins everything. She is the tragedy of the commons".

The dynamics of a person that can duplicate themselves at an absurd rate is really interesting. Conservation of Dorises is super neat, and the hinted at evolutionary arms race of how Blood God Doris came to exist is really cool. Every Doris has the same blood, they're in a zone filled to the brim with blood, and there are huge selection pressures to become better at blood magic because every added bit of skill and power gives more survival power. A Doris who becomes slightly better than her neighbors at blood magic could quickly populate the entire zone with copies of herself, with no conventional limits on scarcity of resources, culminating in a god of blood.

Absurd amounts of blood compression seems like it would give extremely good protection against void rifles, one of the few conventional things that Joon doesn't have a real counter to. Normally, someone shoots you in the head, it eats through the negligible amount of blood and skin, them into bone, and then eats a couple inches into your brain. But with extreme blood compression, someone shoots you in the head, and it has to tunnel through something like a gallon of blood before it can hit your skull or brain, which void just can't do. Plus, it reactively shoots a spray of blood right back at whoever shot you.

Awesome batch, tons of things to love
