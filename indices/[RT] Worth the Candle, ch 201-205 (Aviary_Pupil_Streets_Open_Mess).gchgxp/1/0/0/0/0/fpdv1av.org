I'm not talking about thw horrific dystopia she ended up in, I'm talking about when she first split and was still a part of normal society. Again, that's /Doris's/ problem. She explicitly acknowledges that her initial behavior was due to psychological issues, and that by simply sharing her stuff and that by cooperating with her clone she would have been able to avoid this whole mess. The problem isn't the cloned gear, it's the inability to pool resources and engage in cooperation.
