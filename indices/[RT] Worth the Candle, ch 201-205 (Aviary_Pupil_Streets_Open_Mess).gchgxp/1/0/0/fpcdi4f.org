Doris as we know her started naked and alone, with the only tool available to her creating another Doris that's also naked and alone. Can you spare a set of clothes for your clone? Congratulations, you're now in an infinitely better place than Doris was. What Joon was saying wasn't that he /would/ have ended up like her, what he was saying was that he understood every impulse that went into creating her because he could see those same impulses in himself.

Where Doris went wrong was that she cut herself off from any kind of social safety net. She had no reason not to defect because she had nothing. She wasn't hooked into the promises of society, that said if you cooperate you'll be able to harvest the slow fruit of cooperation.

Think about placing yourself in her shoes. You make your first clone, what do you do? Do you kick them out naked, or do you give them clothes and find them another job? Do you recognize that two clones have fewer needs than two separate people, for example, that sharing a house halves rent, that pooling your money together to get a nice toy means that you can share it, and so on?

Sure, there are a lot of failure conditions. But there's a lot of stuff that you could do to fuck up your life right now, and with clones you're usually in a strictly better position than without clones. For a lot of people, the worst case is that you have a massive gang that doesn't have a lot of trust in each other working minimum wage jobs and not sharing resources. The middle case is that cooperate poorly, working less and spending money on stupid shit while not actually changing your circumstances that much. The good case is you do what Amaryllis suggests and leverage the massive amount of latent cooperation between all your clones to Get Shit Done and like, at least pool all your minimum wages together and buy stock or something, living off interest so that you can be fuckups without a risk of going bankrupt or something.
