> Think about placing yourself in her shoes. You make your first clone, what do you do? Do you kick them out naked, or do you give them clothes and find them another job?

starting to seriously consider these questions - assuming it worked like the story and after the split neither knows whether they are the "original" until the 24 hour mark and gear disappears, one thing I might do is intentionally obfuscate which is which. at 23 hours, both put everything we were wearing in a box and shake it up. Sit naked for 1 hour. after the 24 hour mark passes, we re-dress and proceed with our lives, not knowing which one was "primary." I think creating equality between the two clones is key to ensuring cooperation and avoiding abuse or resentment.
