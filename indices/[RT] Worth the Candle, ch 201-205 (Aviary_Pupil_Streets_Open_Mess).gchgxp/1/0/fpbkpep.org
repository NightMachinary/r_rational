  I can definitely see why the WB doc says that the Doris Finch EZ would be a paradise if the person excluded was anyone other than Doris Finch.

What I love the most about this batch is the turn, from Mary (and to an extent the narrator) believing this in the depths of her bones and holding Doris in the utmost contempt, to the relatability of everything Joon says while talking to Clone Zone Doris. At the end, Joon is pretty clear that he probably would wind up like Doris, given her power, and so is the (at least this) reader.
