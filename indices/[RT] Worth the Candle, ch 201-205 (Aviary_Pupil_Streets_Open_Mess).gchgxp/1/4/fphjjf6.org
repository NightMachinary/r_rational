yeah the doris finch chapters really blew my expectations of what the exclusion zone would be away. I was expecting some powerful weaselly manipulator; the libertarian hellscape we got was so much more rich and interesting. It took a common rational fic trope ( kage-no-bunshin self-splitting) that is often munchkined into omnipotence in these stories and turns it on its head with some really interesting social insights.

it is interesting though that entads still exist that allow cloning, even though DF's cloning was excluded. this seems different than other exclusions, where ALL instances of that magic just...stop working. I wonder if there's a reason other than plot necessity that this one is a little different.
