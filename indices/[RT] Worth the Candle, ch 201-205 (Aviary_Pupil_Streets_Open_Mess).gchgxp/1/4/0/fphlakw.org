  Despite being “magic” “items”, the magic of entads does not belong to any particular school of magic, even if the effects of the entads closely resemble that school, or the entads interact with that school in some way. One of the important impacts of that is that entads are able to dodge the exclusionary principle; though portal magic is excluded, there are still functional entads that can create portals outside the exclusion zone.
