Everyone's got the gushing covered on the brilliance of Doris Finch's reciprocal determinism and her EZ's commentary on human condition (plus the long awaited diplomacy ending), but this mini-arc was also a bunch of wishes come true. Paranoia, redeemably* grey villains, Joon successfully mapping his pattern to the lesson at stake in another step to his own actualization. But my favorite part by far was the social clues and cues foreshadowing the resolution long before Juniper laid out the correct answer - the inductive pay-off was marvelous.
