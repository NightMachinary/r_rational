If all of them are using void rifles and they fight that often, they likely use them more than the rest of the world combined would without banning them. I feel like someone should have brought more powerful entads so they'd stop using the void rifles. Any danger that someone stuck inside an exclusion zone using a known entad is going to cause isn't going to be nearly as bad as summoning the void beast.

Assuming you thought that universe is better off existing anyway.
