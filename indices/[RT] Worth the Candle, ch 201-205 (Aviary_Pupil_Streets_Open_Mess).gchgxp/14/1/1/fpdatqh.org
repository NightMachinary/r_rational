There is an apparent (artificial) shortage of Steel Mage Dorises.

Plus the fact that there was no branch of Meta-Magic Doris kind of indicates that things haven't played out for long enough to become homogeneous, and I'd extend that to homogeneous environment too as you pointed out with the 'empty land' and also the lack of proliferation of that Cleaning Entad^{^{TM}} .
