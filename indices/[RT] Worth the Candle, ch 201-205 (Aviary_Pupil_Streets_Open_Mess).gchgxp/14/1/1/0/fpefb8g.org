I'd argue Doris is her own ecosystem. several core strains of Doris who've specialised into an eco-political niche, so you have Blood bound Dorises, Star mage Dorises, Pustule Dorises and others that have picked up other skills, magic, pseudomagic or entads to survive in and create their own "niche" in the doris ecosystem.

Hell, the plane of blood colony was an example of that. Blood mage dorises rapidly adapted to the locale, and as soon as a beneficial mutation arose (Blood breathing) that strain of Doris rapidly grew and evolved it's own arms race, a-la cambrian explosion.

Another example is Star Doris receiving a working flashlight. She's no longer just a Doris who fills a niche of amateur Star Mage, She's Amateur Star Mage and Flashlight (+ components) user, at least, until she's ganked for it. That's a massive economic niche for anyone who, well, needs light. The Blues weren't giving away their light sources, weren't they?

I'd argue each Doris is drastically different, it's just that there's not enough differences. They all call themselves Doris.
