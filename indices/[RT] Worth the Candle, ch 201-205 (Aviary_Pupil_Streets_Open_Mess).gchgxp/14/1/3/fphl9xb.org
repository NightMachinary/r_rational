It's entirely possible that duplicated steel either doesn't work for Steel Magic or results in buildings which are subject to the same 24 hour clause as the duplicated steel. Once Dorisopolis gets big enough that the cost (in time, effort and non-duped steel) is more than the marginal value of another magestone building, the city stops expanding. As for population density, there's presumably some equilibrium point where clone generation in the city is equaled out by murders + clones fleeing the crowded, murder-filled city for the comparatively less populated wastelands. Since Dorises Finch have unlimited void weapons, plague spells and itchy trigger fingers, it is entirely possible that the level of crowding depicted is the maximum level of crowding that a heavily armed population of Dorises can tolerate.
