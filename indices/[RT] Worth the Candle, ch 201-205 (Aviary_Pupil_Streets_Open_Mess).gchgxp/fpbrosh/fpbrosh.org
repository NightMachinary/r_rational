We finally have confirmation on where Arthur is, although I'm surprised that Doris gave that information out so easily, since it's the location of the single most searched for person in the history of Aerb. If Doris was going to charge ridiculous amounts for the finding of any individual, why not Uther? I'm shocked that she couldn't get concessions of some kind for the EZ with that kind of leverage.

Then again, the information isn't all that usable, given his location...
