Well to quibble, the first is already world ending on it's own. Dropping it in the DFEZ doesn't really change that much except maybe to accelerate the timeline. The second would not be dangerous because the cloned entad should not be able to strike outside the zone and the rate of death for it on it's own would be slow.

That said I get your point. There could be an entad with some outrageous effect that requires human sacrifices or something that Doris could then exploit without needing to clone it.
