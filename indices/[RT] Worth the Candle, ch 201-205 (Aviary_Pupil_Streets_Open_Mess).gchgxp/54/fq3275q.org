How would Doris' power interact with souls? Since each clone has the capacity to perform magic or can be invested with entads, that indicates that each one has a soul. So after death are the souls released like normal, go to the hells after 30 minutes, then disappear after 24 hours? That must be really weird for the demons, or really good, since they would have a constant influx of temporary souls.
