From a meta perspective, 7 simultaneous companions edges towards having too many to have on screen at once, especially if the story wants to introduce other characters and actually give them screen-time and development. I think the fact that people were hoping that the newly introduced characters would be companions is a sign of how well they were thought out and written.
