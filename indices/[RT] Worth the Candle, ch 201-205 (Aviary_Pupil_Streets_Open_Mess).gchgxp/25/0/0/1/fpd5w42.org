Keep in mind, it's not just the tragedy of the commons, it's overshooting as well. You'll need a lot of resources to keep your new faction together.

At the minimum, you need food, water, living space, and weapons.

If you start with one gun and clone yourself 100 times, then the next day you have 99 clones without guns, clothes, or any other possessions, unless you have some sort of facility to produce large amounts of clones, kill them and take their stuff.

Even if you want to cooperate in principle, you're terrified of death, and you absolutely don't want to go to the "clone yourself and get killed a bunch of times" factory, which means your society needs mechanisms to enforce attendance. The clones controlling the mechanisms of enforcement also don't want to go to the suicide factory, so they're probably going to end up as a ruling class.

And keep in mind that, unless you're a steel mage, you start off with no infrastructure and no way to build it (and even if you can build things, the EZ is probably overcrowded anyway); which means you're going to have to fight other factions for living space (and other resources). Fighting other factions involves being sent to die for a war that doesn't directly benefit you; again, even if you wanted to cooperate in principle, you're probably going to change your mind when being sent into the (literal or metaphorical) meat grinder. Unless you have some kind of suicide squad collar (keeping in mind everything you make disappears after 24h), the soldiers you make aren't actually going to want to go on the front lines.

With all those considerations, I can kind of see why the society would be so dysfunctional. I'm not saying it's an unsolvable problem, but any non-external solution has to account for the facts that clones both really don't want to die and need kill each other on a regular basis to get their food and keep their equipment.
