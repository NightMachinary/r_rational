Not just in light of Anglecynn, but diplomacy has been very underrated throughout the story. It's interesting to think about the chain of events, quests, and approaching a SOC-oriented Joon could've taken through Aerb. Diplomancy is an unbalanced meme for a reason, even if that's not how Juniper DM'd or how most TTRPGs go. Some of the micro-level encounters could've changed, but midgame and endgame quests that have popped up multiple times (The Library, some kind of encounter with Fallatehr) would still need to thread their way through the story. And who knows how (or even whether) diplomacy style quests would scale or not.
