This was a fun sequence. Not just in terms of the obvious excellent characterization and so forth, but also in /showing what sorts of paths an alternate Juniper could have gone down/.

Where the last arc was the arc of "sometimes the main characters are going to miss opportunities for diplomatic resolution" and the arc wherein we got to see what a physical-combat-focused Juniper might have looked like, this arc was the arc of "sometimes threats that seem unsolvable via diplomacy /aren't/" and the arc wherein we get to see a tiny slice of what a more socially-focused Juniper might have looked like.

(Possibly I'm biased in this reading due to my overwhelming habit of playing face characters in RPGs; but it's not /too/ much of a stretch, I think. And getting to see what sorts of options would have been open to a Face!Juniper is a lot of fun. It's made me start wondering what the diplomatic solutions to some of the /previous/ arcs would have looked like, now that it's clear that there are frequently hidden options in that direction.)
