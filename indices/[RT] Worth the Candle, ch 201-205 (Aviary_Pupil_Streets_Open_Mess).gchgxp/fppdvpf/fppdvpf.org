Would any of you like to have Doris's power IRL? There's some minor benefits, but it seems more trouble than its worth, especially if you're in a relationship.

Ignoring the issues of disposing of corpses, and items disappearing after 24hrs, would you be willing to use it for item duplication?

For me:

- Sedated throughout cloning and killing: maybe...
- Sedated throughout killing only: Initially no, convinced myself into a maybe...
- No sedation: fuck no

With the maybes I'm not sure what the long term impact would be. Would it get easier due to anthropics, or harder due to trauma?
