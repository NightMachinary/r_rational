A lot of times, flat characters exist because the character was created to serve a specific purpose (an antagonist, a love interest, etc.) but the author hasn't bothered to give the character any attributes besides the purpose they serve, or think about what drives them to be the sort of person that takes the actions the plot the demands they take.

The way AW writes, characters generally act the way they do because of realistic motivations rather than acting in arbitrary ways to serve the needs of the plot. Even if they really do only exist because there is a specific purpose for them to serve, he still gives them a personality such that those actions make total sense for them to take. The act of actually ensuring that a given character's actions are motivated results in the character developing a degree of depth.
