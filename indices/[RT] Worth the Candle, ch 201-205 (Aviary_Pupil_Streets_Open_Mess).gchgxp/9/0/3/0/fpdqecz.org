I'm not gonna pull out cites, but AW likes to make a character a broad stereotype and then give more details over time. Mary, Fenn, and Grak are all presented as stereotypes (ruthless and cold; carefree; gruff and goal-oriented) and AW gradually adds detail and nuance and has them show vulnerability. The Loyalty mechanic, meta as it is, is great for showing which statements and actions resonate with a character.
