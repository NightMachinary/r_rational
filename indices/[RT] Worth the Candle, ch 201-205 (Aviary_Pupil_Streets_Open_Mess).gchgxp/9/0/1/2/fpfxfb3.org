Don't you see? Doris is like Shrek, and Shrek is an Ogre, and Ogres are like Onions.

Doris /is/ an Onion, or rather, */[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMHgxGSuBG8][Onion is a Doris!]]/*

We already know that there are Bladebound Dorises. We already know that when placed in a secluded environment fit to learning their craft, with only themselves to fight against, Dorises are prone to acting like a *Neural Network that culls itself over and over to achieve apotheosis.*

In a much earlier experiment in the EZ, one such Doris surpassed the rest and achieved such a Mastery of the Blade that she could [[https://i.imgur.com/1Ly4SkL.jpg][cut away her very being, her ability to Duplicate, and thanks to that she escaped the EZ.]]

We also know that Onion was sent to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ssnw2GA657s][Exclusion Zones]] for Trials by Adversity multiple times... And that miraculously, he survived them all. OR DID HE?

Really, all it took from that point is to get a shape-shifting Entad and take over the original Onion's body. It's practically canon at this point, so obvious.
