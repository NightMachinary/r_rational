This is one of my favorite batches so far.

In addition to the spectacular characterization of the Dorises Finch (Juniper calls them "Doris Finches" but he doesn't understand the One True Way To Pluralize People) this batch shows a lot of growth for our protagonists. They finally arrive at a diplomatic solution to one of their quests.

"Missing the social/diplomatic solution" has been a running theme since Fallatehr. From chapter 95,

  “But that wasn't really what he had misgivings about. He thought that we jettisoned any chance of a successful working relationship with him through aggressive mistrust.” She grunted as she made a long reach, going to full extension of one slender leg for just a moment. The only way that I'd be able to follow her route was going to be with my superior reach.

And then it's brought up again in this batch with regards to Anglecynn,

  I finally caught up to what Amaryllis must have been thinking, which was that if there had ever been a social solution in Anglecynn, we had mostly missed it, and if the Doris EZ was similar, then the thing that would guarantee we went down the combat path would be treating the Dorises how you'd assume they should be treated, just based on what you heard about them.

Amaryllis comes in talking shit about Doris because she can't cooperate, because come on, cooperating with yourself is easy, you just have to decide to do it. In the end, it wasn't just Doris that needed to cooperate with herself, but it was Joon&party that needed to extend their own trust and cooperation to Doris as well. Extending their trust to someone else, that's fucking difficult - I can't overstate how difficult it is, especially in a world like Aerb - but that's the challenge they overcame today.

  “You're saying we should defect against Doris? That justifies a lack of trust in us.”

  Amaryllis was watching me, and I could feel her mismatched eyes boring into me, stripping me bare. She was good at reading people, but not that good if she was in the wrong mindset for a proper reading to take place. Maybe she could see that Doris wasn't actually afraid of us, but maybe she thought that was because of typical Doris fatalism, not because she had the upper hand. Maybe she thought that I was being headstrong, not that I knew something that she didn't. I wasn't trying to make my face readable, because Doris was watching us, but I was hoping she would understand.

  “Okay,” she finally said. “You're right.”

And in the end they got to forge their own way with the quest.

In other news, I absolutely love AW's sense of humor. I actually just laughed for a straight minute at this joke.

  If that book the Dungeon Master had shown me, Worth the Candle by Juniper Smith, was written in my authentic voice, I had to believe I wouldn't have just glossed over all the mundane stuff. The book of my adventures on Aerb would have had some grim and dark stuff, but it wouldn't have been only that, not unless you were willing to cut out playing Ranks with Grak, or Amaryllis introducing me to rock climbing, or the long conversation that Fenn and I had about why anyone would voluntarily use the awesome power of the internet to watch some stranger play a videogame (and yeah, it would have taken twenty pages and then abruptly ended with a sex scene, but I would have included it all the same).
