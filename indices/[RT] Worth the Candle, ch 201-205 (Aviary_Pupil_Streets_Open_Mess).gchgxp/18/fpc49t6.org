What are we to make of the Earth flashback beginning chapter 203? The connection to the rest of the chapter and arc seems reasonably clear, but in isolation?

  It was one of those awkward arguments, the kind that I didn't like when I looked back on it, but which had passed easily enough. No one had really been mad at each other, but it had been uncomfortable, and even running it over in my head afterward, I didn't know quite how I could have fixed it.

Let's take some wild guesses. There seem to be points of friction within the group that go unaddressed. Reimer is resigned to hear about the worldbuilding, Craig is uninterested, Maddie /is/ interested, Tiff is halfway interested.

Grammatical nitpicking by the players at each other: "can"/"may" "hewed"/"hewn"

So maybe the point is just that Juniper didn't have enough SOC to know what was the impetus of the mood of the room? Or that /Arthur/ failed a SOC check, and asked a question that divided the group?

Or maybe the point is just that the whole idea is too grimdark, a connection to the narration immediately following the flashback.
