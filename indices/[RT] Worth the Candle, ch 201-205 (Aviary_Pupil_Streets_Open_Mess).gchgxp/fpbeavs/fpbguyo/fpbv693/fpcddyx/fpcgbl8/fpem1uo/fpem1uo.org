I think the fundamental problem is systemic effects that make members of a society self-identify as part of an outgroup. Wealth is one of the more common ways for that to happen, but there's also race, religion, and all the other things we've fought wars over.

Doris is interesting because she self-identifies as an outgroup that's entirely composed of herself, which could probably be interpreted as a convoluted metaphor for any number of mental illnesses.
