I think my point is that it's two different effects. It's not that too little wealth and too much wealth both corrupt. It's that scarcity forces certain behavior and induces a certain psychology of hoarding and self preservation. As a separate effect, power over others stunts empathy and enables abuse. This is why it's not about absolute wealth for the powerful; there's nothing inherently corrupting about specific resource levels. Your whole point about relative wealth is really pointing at a power differential.
