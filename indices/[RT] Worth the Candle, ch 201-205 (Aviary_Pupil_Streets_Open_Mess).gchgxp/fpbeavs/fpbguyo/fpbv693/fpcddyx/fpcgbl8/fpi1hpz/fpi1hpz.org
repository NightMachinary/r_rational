with the rich it's not so much about the physical resources as it is Power. wealth is a component and trapping of that power, but fundamentally it is the ability to exert power over and objectify others that is damaging psychologically.

on the flip side, poverty is the same everywhere; it's the actual, absolute scarcity that is damaging.
