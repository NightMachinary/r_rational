I think the crucial point there is comparative wealth, rather than absolute wealth. I.e., a post scarcity society in which everyone is equally wealthy wouldn't be that different from what you generally see in a developed country, but a rich king in the paleolithic would tend to be an asshole to his fellow men, despite having an absolute wealth comparable (if a tad lower) to the median citizen of a developed country.
