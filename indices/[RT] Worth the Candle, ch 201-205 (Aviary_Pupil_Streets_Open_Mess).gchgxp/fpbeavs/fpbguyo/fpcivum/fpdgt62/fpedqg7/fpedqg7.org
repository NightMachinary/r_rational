There is an inherent tension between systemic problems that require systemic solutions, and individual solutions to escape (or exploit) systemic problems. An individual who has implemented a solution to exploit a systemic problem, then becomes part of the systemic problem and defects from attempts to solve it systemically. Mere escape from the problem makes one less invested in keeping it around, though attitudes to getting rid of the problem for others [[https://i.redd.it/q5tmfm14rpw31.jpg][can go either way]].
