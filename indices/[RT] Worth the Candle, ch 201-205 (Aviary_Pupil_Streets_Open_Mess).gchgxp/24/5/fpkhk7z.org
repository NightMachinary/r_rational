  Whenever a Doris is created, she appears as an exact copy of her progenitor, meaning that the clone has air in her lungs. If a clone breathes out across the boundary, does the cloned air vanish?

this is a good point - what are the effects on air currents just based on displacement effects of the new clones? also all that matter being created has to go *somewhere*, even if they are being killed and eaten. Shouldn't there be a massive proliferation of bones and hair?
