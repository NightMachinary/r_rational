It was pretty much outright stated that offense came to dominate in their struggles, and a single blood mage could alpha strike an entire colony of lesser Dorises. I would imagine the highlander result is just the natural outcome of that. Or Clone Zone just got so far ahead relying more on blood magic than duplication that she realized creating duplicates that might actually be able to fight her would be dumb and just wiped up the rest without cloning.
