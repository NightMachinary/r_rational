It's a little odd that it resulted in salvation, though.

Wouldn't Blood Doris, on her way to godhood, have kept continually making armies of clones, so there would be an army of Blood God Dorises, not just a single one?

That there's a single Doris left implies that progress was not linear, it was either exponential or by discrete stages. I would guess that Blood-Level-100 Doris unlocked a virtue that allowed her to kill all other Dorises instantly, including Blood-Level-99 Dorises.
