The impression I got was that when people or things are prevented from leaving an exclusion zone it's because the zone boundary acts as a physical barrier to them, and not because they disappeared if they tried. As for sending electricity out of the DFEZ, I don't know how the physics would work out if you had cloned electrons trying to cross the boundary directly, but even if it doesn't work you can still get electricity out of the zone. All you need is for someone to provide some electric motors. Doris clones batteries to run the motors, and the motors spin magnets to generate electricity that is free of cloned electrons. Hopefully you don't end up triggering a new exclusion, after all Captain Blue was able to sell his zombie made merchandise without drawing more DM intervention.
