Not that limited.

Give a single Doris an elf bone, strip her of all weapons, handcuff her or otherwise tie her up, tell her to make a hundred clones at gunpoint. Once the clones give you the answer you want (with multiple redundant cells so you can compare results and know if they're lying), kill all but one of them, picked at random. Have some deadman switches, like a bomb that can blow up the entire building if they try to rebel (or more likely, an underground room that can be flooded or filled with smoke).

The clones have an incentive to cooperate (99% chance to die vs 100% chance to die). The logistics are hard, but it's just a scaled-up version of something Dorises do every day, and it's not that much more ambitious that the other projects we see the Blues do.
