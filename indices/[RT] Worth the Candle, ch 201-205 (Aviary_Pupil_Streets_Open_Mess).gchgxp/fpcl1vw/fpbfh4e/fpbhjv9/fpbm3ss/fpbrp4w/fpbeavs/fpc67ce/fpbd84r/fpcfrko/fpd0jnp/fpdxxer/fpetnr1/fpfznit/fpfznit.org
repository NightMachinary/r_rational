If you need a thousand elf bones to get a reliable location at one moment, and you need a new location every five minutes, your strategic reserve is going to run out of bones fast (especially since that reserve was built up by secret means, eg pillaging elf graveyards).

On the other hand, if Doris has one elf bone, then she has infinite elf bones.
