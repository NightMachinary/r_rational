Yeah. Well and Joon questions whether BloodGod!Doris even meaningfully /can/ split, given the nature of her power. If she was present in each of the non-coagulated bits of DorisBlood throughout the facility, then maybe two bloodGod!Doris's could merge. Maybe we'll discover she even has a general merge function now which works with all Doris's, to complement the forking.
