That's a map territory confusion. Doris 'can't cooperate with herself' in a very specific way - she has to murder clones of herself as a means of survival. That doesn't mean that she can't execute plans which involve her repeatedly cloning herself, it just means that she can only due that if previous or expected future clone murders have created an equipment surplus. Dorises will fight over who gets their current equipment, but only if there isn't a weaker third party they can coordinate to steal from. Which, in the case of the Blues, there apparently was.
