No idea - I guess the author didn't think it through. When I read that book (in 1995) I didn't question it. But it was definitely sending a "scan" of a destroyed object, and the thing is, once you have a scan, you're right - you can print multiple copies, which means it's more of a matter printer than transporter. But then that's true of most "transporters" in fiction.
