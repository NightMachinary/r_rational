That would be really cool, though if elf bones work for this, it raises the question of why everyone has been making deals with Doris Finch instead of using Anglecynn's strategic reserve, especially now that they finally have regained power in Anglecynn. Maybe the cost is lower to deal with DF, but given Amaryllis's surprise at Larkspur going to DF instead of using elf bones, it's likely widely regarded as not.
