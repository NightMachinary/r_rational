  There's a passage in the /Principia Discordia/ where Malaclypse complains to the Goddess about the evils of human society. “Everyone is hurting each other, the planet is rampant with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war.”

  Malaclypse: “But nobody wants it! Everybody hates it!”

  Goddess: “Oh. Well, then stop.”
