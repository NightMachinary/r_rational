Nah, I think it could easily be hundreds. All it would take is one Blue getting a wild hair up her ass, putting all the different research topics she thinks could give her an edge into a hat and then splitting off clones and drawing until she has one version of herself trying each project. Admittedly, the odds aren't great for any particular clone (most of them will hit dead ends) but from the perspective of the Original Blue, at least one of them is bound to find something good.
