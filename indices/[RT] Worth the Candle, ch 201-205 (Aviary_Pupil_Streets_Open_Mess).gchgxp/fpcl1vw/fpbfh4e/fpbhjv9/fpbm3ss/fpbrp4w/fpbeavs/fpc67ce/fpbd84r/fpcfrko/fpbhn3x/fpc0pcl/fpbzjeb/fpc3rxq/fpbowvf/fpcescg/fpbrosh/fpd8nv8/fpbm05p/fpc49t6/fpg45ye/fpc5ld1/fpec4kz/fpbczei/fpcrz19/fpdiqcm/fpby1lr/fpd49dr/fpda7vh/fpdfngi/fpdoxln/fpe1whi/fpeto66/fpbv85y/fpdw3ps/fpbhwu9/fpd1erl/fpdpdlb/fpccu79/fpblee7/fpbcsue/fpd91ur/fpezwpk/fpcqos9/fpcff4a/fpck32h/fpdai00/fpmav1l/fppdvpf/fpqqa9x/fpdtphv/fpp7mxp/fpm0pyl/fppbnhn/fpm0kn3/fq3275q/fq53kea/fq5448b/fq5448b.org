Oh right, they did say that about soul magic. So maybe it's some massively complicated connected soul through spirit? That would be interesting. Yet somehow each clone is distinct enough to be a separate entity in some sense when it comes to the soul. Very weird.

Also, on another note, how do you think her copying looks like? The clone just pops into existence next to her or some weird fission?
