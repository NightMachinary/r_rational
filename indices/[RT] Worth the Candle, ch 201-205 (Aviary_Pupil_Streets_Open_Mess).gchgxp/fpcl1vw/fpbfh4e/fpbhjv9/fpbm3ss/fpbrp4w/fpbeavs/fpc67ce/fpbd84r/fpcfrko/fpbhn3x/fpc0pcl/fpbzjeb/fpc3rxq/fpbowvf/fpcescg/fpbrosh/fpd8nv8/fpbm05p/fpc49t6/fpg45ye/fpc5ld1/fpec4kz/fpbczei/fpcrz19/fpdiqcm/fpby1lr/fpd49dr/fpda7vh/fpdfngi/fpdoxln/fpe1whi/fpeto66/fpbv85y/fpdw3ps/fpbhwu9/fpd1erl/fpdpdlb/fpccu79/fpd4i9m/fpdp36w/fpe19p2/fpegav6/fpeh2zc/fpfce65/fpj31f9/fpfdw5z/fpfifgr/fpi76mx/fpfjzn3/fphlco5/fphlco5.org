I think you don't understand what reddit is for (or how discussion or writing works). That might be something worth looking into, like seriously. You don't get the medium you are posting in or about, maybe talk to someone about that so you don't repeat the mistakes you made here. Not some quippy rebuttal, you can be a better person, I don't how else to say that authentically.
