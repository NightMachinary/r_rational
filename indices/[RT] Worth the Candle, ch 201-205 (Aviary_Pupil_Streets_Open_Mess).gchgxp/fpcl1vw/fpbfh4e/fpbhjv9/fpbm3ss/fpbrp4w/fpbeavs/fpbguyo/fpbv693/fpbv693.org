Maybe I'm reading too much into this because I grew up in a third world country, but to me DF resonated as a kind of metaphor for why a poor crime ridden country remains poor and crime ridden. There's a saying where I'm from: "good morals start with a full pantry", and the reverse is doubly true. Being food insecure and unsafe has such a massive impact on a person's psyche, to an extent that I don't think is well understood yet.

Again, maybe I'm reading too much into this, but Joon's "there but for the grace of god" epiphany with regards to Doris felt very familiar. I used to low key fear and despise my countrymen, and how could I not after getting robbed and beaten and cheated? If I had stuck around, who knows how I would have fed into the cycle of misery?

It's a bit of a mind fuck to think your empathy and high-minded principles are in large part a consequence of your material privilege, but there it is.
