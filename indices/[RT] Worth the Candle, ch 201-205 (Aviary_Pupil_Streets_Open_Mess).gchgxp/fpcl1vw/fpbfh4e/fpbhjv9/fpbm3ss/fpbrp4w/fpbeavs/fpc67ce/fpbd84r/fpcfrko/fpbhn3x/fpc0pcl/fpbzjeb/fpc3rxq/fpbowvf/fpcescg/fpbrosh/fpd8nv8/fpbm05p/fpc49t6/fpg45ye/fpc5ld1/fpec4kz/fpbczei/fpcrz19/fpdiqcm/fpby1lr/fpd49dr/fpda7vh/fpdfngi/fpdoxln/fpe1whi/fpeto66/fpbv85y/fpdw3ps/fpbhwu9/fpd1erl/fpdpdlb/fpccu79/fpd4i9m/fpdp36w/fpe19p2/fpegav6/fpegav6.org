That doesn't really connect to my objection - I have no problem with Blood Doris being different, of course she should be, thats the plot. My objection is more "why didn't Blood Doris just leave the room and blow past them? Why did she even leave now, having been able to leave at any time?" I understand that in-story reasons are given for this, they just feel thin to me. Blood Doris is stripped of a bit of agency to make the plot work.
