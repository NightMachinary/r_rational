I think they might be avoiding meeting the unlock conditions for Velocity Magic on their own on purpose, because overshooting the minimum possible margin for that would have long-term negative impacts on whatever Athenaeum manages it (Might and Motion per the Wiki).

And right now they're theoretically on a short clock with killing the Captain, so maybe they don't see urgency in spending time brute forcing either Magic when Joon honestly already has a really solid multi-mage combat setup. There's also the possibility that they'd end up picking other things for those slots, given the info Reimer is compiling for them.
