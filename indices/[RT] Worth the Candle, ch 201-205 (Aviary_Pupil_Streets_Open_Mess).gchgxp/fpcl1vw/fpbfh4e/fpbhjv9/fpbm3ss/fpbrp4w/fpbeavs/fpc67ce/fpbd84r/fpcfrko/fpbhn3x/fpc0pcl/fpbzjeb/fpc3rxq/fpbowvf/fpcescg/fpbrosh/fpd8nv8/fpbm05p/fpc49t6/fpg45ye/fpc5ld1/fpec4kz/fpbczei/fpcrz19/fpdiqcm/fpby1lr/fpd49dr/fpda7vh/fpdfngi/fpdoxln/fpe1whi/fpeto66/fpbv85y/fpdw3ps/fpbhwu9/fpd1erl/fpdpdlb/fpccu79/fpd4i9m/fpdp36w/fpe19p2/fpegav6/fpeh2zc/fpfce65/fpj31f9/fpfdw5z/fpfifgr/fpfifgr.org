You are missing the obvious option 4: "Do nothing and leave". Which to be clear Joon & Co make explicit they are letting her do, pretty-much opening line of the last chapter is "We are letting you free" And sure, she can chat, have a snack, but that doesn't mean she wouldn't wander off on her own after without having changed her entire life direction and trusting a group of strangers with her secrets.

You are trying to nickel-and-dime it, but its not the objection. The point is that the in the four chapters leading up to the final one, the main characters do not interact with the actual plot at all. They personally learn a lot about the Dorises, so it seems like it from our perspective, but in actuality there is this totally new, very experienced uber Doris out there that they do not touch till the end. Then they change the entire direction of Doris-dom via the power of words in a chapter. I just don't buy the effort-output ratios, its unearned.
