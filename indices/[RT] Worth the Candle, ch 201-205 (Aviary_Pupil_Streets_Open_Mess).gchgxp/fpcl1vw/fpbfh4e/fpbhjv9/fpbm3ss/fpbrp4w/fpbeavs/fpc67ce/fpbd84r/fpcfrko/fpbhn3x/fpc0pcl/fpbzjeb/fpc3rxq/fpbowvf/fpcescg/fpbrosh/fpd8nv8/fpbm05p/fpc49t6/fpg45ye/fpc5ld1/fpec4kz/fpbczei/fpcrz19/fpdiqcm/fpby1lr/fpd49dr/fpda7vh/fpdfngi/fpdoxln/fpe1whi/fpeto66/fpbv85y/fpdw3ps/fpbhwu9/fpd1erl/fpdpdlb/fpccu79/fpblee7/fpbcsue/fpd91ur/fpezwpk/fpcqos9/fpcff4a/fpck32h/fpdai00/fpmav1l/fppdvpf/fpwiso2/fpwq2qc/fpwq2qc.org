  For starters, if I use the power only once, and send of the clones to a different country, the odds of both versions of me dying of a random car accident or something similar drop to almost zero. That's already pretty great.

Personally, I don't see too much benefit from this. If I was dying I guess it's kind of nice knowing there's another version of me out there, but meh. I'm a continuity of consciousness kind of guy. I see the clones as two separate people. A death is a death.

Organ donation is a good use. Logistics/legality would be tricky though.

W.r.t to the last one: you could, you know, not kill them; the logistics alone seems terrible.

You could also learn things faster. Have one clone learn something then provide an optimised lesson to the rest of the clones.
