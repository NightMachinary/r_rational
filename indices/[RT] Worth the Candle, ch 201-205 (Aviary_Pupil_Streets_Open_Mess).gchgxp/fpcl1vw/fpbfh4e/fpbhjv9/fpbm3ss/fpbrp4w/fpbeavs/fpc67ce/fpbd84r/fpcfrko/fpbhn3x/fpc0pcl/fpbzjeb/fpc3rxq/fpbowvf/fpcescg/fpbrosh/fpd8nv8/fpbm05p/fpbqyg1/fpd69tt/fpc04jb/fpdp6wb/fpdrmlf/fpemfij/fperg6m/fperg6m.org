I think you're not wrong but at the same time like we already have what 12-ish characters that are still running around and being on screen at least once per chapter bundle? More if you count some of the characters mentioned but not seen, and plus or minus the gaming group as actively effecting the current narrative.

I mean they are and are generally a big part of the experience of reading WTC, but like considering their bits are generally self-contained I can understand why someone wouldn't consider them a part of the actively written about group centering on Jun's current adventures.
