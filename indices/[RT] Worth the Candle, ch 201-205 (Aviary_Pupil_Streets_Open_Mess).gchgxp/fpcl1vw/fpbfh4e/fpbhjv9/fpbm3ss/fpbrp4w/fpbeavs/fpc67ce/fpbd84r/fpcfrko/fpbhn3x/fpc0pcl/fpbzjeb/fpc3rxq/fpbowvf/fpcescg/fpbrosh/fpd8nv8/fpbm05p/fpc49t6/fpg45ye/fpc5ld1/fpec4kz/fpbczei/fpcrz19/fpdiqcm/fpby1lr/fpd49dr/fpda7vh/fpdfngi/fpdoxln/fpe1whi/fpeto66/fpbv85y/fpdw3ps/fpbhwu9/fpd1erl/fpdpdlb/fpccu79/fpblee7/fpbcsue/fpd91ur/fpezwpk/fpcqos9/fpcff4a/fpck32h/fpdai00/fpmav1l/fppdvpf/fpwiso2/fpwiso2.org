Yes, absolutely yes.

For starters, if I use the power only once, and send of the clones to a different country, the odds of both versions of me dying of a random car accident or something similar drop to almost zero. That's already pretty great.

I can provide hundreds of test subjects to test for dangerous treatments, provided these treatments can be done with me anesthetized for the entire duration (for instance, cryogenics).

It's macabre, but I can provide cheap food to starving people everywhere in the world (in most cases, the clones will probably be fed to pigs or other animals or used as fertilizers, rather than fed to people directly), assuming I'm not excluded.

If I'm willing to have doomed clones live for a few days or more before execution, I can solve extremely complex math problems, engineering problems, programming problems, etc (though we run into the "9 women can't make a baby in a month" problem fast).

Seriously, the number of applications is staggering.
