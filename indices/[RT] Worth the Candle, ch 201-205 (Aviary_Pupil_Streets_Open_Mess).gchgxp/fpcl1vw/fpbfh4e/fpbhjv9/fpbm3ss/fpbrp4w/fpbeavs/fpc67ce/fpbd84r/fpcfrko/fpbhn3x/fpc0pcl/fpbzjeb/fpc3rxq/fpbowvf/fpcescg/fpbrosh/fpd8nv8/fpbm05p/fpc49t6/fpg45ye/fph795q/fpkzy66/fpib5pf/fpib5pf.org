Far as I can tell BGD is not an actual god. I understood the apotheosis to be metaphorical not actual. She is a Blood Mage with the highest possible skill in the magic and arbitrarily high amounts of her own blood at her disposal. I don't think she is a god in the sense most Aerbians think of them, but you are right we don't know because we have almost no info on them.
