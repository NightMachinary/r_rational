  Why are they relevant at all? Why wouldn't she simply walk past these strangers and go on to figure things out?

She has three option:

1. Do nothing, sit there

2. Listen and possibly get free meal and shower

3. killing and eating herself

Before she became the blood god, she was stuck doing three, but now that she is the blood god she is now doing 1, and can continue to do 1 indefinitely. Option 2 just came up and is going to go away (forever) as soon as Joon leaves. She can always go back to option 1 or 3 later. She chose to do 2, and you can't possibly see why option 3 might be unattractive? There are no other options in the Exclusion Zone

Let's do an experiment, the next time someone offers to talk and grab lunch with you, instead kill someone and eat them. After all, talking with someone breaks your suspension of belief when a person could be dealing with cannibal murderers instead. Report back: was fighting to the death to eat a person exactly as attractive as listening for 5 minutes?
