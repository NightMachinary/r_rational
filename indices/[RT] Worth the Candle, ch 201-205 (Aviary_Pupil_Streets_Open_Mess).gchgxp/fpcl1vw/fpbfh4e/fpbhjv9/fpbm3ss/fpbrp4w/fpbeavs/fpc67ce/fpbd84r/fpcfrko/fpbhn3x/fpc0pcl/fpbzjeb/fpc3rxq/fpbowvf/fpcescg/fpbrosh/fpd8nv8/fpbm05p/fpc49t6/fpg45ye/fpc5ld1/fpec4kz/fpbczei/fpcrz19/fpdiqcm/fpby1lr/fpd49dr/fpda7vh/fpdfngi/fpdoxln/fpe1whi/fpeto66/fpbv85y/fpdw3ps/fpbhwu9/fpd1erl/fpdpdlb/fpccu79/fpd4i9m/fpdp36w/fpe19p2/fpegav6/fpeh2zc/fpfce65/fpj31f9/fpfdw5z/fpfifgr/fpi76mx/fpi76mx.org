I think what you're missing is that she didn't want to â€˜do nothing and leave'. She'd been standing there for days, waiting for someone to show up (possibly imperial agents), because she was tired of the way her life had been, she wanted it to change, but at the same time she felt hopeless to accomplish it on her own, even with godlike power. She didn't know what to do to change things, she hates and distrusts herself, there's this pervasive idea in her mind that whatever she tries will go wrong (and she has millions of herself out there to prove her right) so instead she wants someone else to tell her what to do, to give her a direction, a push. She is still distrustful of these people, because of course she is, but at the same time she is relieved that maybe her wish came true and someone showed up to tell her how to fix things and convince her that now it's actually possible.
