As far as not unlocking Velocity magic goes, its kinda hard to unlock it without making enemies of the Athenaeum responsible. They don't know the current benchmark and overshooting the benchmark makes it that much harder for new Velocity mages to be made in the future. I imagine it might be on the to-do list at some point (Velocity Magic IS very good, after all) but they'll want to do some research first and get ready for the whole Spontaneous Quests/Narrative Problems complication.
