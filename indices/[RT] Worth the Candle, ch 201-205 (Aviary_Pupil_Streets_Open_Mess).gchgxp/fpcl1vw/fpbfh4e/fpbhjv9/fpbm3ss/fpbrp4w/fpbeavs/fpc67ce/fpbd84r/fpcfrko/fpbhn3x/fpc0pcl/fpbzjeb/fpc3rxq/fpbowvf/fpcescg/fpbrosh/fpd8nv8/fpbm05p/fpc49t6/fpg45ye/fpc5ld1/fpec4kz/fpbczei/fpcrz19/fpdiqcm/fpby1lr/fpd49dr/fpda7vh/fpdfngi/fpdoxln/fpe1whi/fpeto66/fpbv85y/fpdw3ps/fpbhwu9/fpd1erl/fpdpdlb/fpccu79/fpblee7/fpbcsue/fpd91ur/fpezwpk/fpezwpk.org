Does anyone remember if we ever got an explanation of how Doris Finch got the duplication ability in the first place and what she changed about it or what limits she broke that warranted exclusion? Because it is kind of weird. I mean I can't imagine a predicted scenario where her ability would have been /less/ broken and the skill seems to both be trainable (she lowered the casting time), but also doesn't have a lot of non-broken mundane uses. And the "equipment lasts 24 hours but person lasts indefinitely" part seems not like something that got slowly scaled to that point.
