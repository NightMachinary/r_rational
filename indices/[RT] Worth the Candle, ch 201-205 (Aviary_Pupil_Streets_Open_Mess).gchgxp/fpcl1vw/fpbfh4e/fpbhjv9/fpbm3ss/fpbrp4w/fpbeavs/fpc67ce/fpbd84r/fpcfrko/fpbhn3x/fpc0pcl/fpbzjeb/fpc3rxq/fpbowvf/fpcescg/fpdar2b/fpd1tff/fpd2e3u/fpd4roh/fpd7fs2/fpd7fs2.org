Well, void weapons are one example, but you could imagine others. We know that televisions (in timelines where they're invented) sometimes display magic images from an evil god that can mind-control people watching them; that god gives rewards to followers that do human sacrifices, until he's eventually summoned to our world (or something like that, I don't remember the exact details). Dropping a TV in the DFEZ would be disastrous.

Or imagine an entad with a remote effect, like, I don't know, a gun that can kill an arbitrary person anywhere in the world as long as you keep feeding it human flesh, or something like that.

It wouldn't be quite word-ending even then (people could always napalm the entire EZ to the bedrock), but there might be an entad combination that /would be/. Even knowing that exclusions and the Library act as safety nets, it's pretty cavalier of the Empire not to put serious effort into making sure so new entads (or long-range canons) ever enter the zone.
