Yeah, I wrote the comment after reading like the first chapter. When your understanding of her flaws is just "she can't even finish a conversation with some outsiders without starting the Clone Wars" and your understanding of how Amaryllis sees it is just "/The Prestige/ made her go on angry rant about how Doris is trash," it's funny. But when Joon actually started talking about what he saw in Doris, and how Blood God Doris could be different... that cut deep. I saw WAY too much of myself in that last chapter.
