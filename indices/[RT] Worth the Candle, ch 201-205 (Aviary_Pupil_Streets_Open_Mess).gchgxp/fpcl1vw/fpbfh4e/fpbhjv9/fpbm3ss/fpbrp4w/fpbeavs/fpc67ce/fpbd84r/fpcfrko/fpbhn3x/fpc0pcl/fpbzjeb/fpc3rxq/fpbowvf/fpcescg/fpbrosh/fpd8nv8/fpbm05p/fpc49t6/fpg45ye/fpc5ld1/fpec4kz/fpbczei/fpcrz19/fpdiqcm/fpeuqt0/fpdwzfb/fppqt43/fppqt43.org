Is Dorris energy or dorris dervied energy allowed to pass?

If Dorris throws a rock does the energy she imparted on it continue past the exclusion zone?

Can you use Dorris's body's stored chemical energy to create something else that can pass the zone? I.e. can Dorris mushrooms pass the boundary?

There are loads of ways to abuse the lack of conservation of mass/energy If any of these are allowed.
