Part of the quest description says explicitly that she discovered the one weird trick though.

What was weird about the earlier statement is kinda hard to describe. Like it's a double negative for information "we can't definitely say we don't know." We don't actually know how any of the enpersoned exclusions happened. We're left to assume it's something like peak still magic + skin magic after a top expert in the field goes too far but it could just as easily be something like braiding your hair a certain way unlocking an OP branch of skin magic at level 1.
