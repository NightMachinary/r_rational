I first thought that for Star Doris, and then was super duper hoping for it with Blood God Doris. I wasn't sure at all about remaining Companion slots. Seven slots taken, though Fenn is dead until at least the endgame of God!Juniper, so maybe that slot is open. Was it stated that there is supposed to be seven?
