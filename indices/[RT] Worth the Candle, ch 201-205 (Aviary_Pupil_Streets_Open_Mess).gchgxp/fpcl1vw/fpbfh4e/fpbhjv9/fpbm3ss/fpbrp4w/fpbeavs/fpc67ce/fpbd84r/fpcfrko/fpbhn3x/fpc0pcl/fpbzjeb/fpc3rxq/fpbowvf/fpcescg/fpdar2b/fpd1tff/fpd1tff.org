Yeah, there's a few details where I feel the Doris's power isn't quite applied to its natural conclusion.

For instance, it seems the DFEZ is treated like a wasteland with occasional cities, but I feel it should be an uninterrupted megalopolis of slums and misery. Any space not claimed by a city would eventually be claimed by the occasional desperate Doris, and with the ability to make an army of herself, it would be pretty much impossible to maintain a no man's land.

Maintaining an empty space in the DFEZ would take /logistics/; it would essentially require machine gun nests so that everyone knows that, if you walk into that space, you're going to die, no matter how many of you there are.

I really don't see how there could be any empty space (including abandoned houses and the like) that isn't crawling with Dorises, unless that space is actively defended with terrifying violence.
