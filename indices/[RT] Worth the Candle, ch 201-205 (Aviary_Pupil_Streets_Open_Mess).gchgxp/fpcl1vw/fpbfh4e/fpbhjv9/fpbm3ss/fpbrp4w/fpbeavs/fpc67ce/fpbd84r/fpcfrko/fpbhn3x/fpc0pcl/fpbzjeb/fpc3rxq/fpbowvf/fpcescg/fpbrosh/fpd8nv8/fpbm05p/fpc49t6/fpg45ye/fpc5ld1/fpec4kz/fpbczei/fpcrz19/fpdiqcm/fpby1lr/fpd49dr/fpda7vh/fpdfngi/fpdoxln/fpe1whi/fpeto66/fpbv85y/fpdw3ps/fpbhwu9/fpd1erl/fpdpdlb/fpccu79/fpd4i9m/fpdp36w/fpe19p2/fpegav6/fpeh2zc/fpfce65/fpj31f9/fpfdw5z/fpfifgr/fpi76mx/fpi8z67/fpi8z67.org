Oh I get all of that and (very briefly, for sure) mention it in my replies. I understand that the narrative did provide these reasons for the actions to occur, its not a hack writing job so of course it does. I just don't buy them! Its way too convenient for the protagonists that all of these reasons lined up exactly, with no effort on their part to make that be so, just for them to resolve the problem in five minutes. Mary even points it out, saying something along the lines of " this wouldn't normally work, its only working because its a DM plot". Which is another lampshade hanging that doesn't actually make a problem disappear. Its not just that realistic that this uber person would wait for weeks, not have their own plans, then trust in these random strangers so fully.
