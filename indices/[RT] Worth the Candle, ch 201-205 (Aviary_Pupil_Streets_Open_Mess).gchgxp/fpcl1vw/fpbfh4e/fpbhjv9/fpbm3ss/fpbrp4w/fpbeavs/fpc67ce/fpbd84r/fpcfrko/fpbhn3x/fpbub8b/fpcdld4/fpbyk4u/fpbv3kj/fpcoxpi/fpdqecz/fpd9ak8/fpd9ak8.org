Thanks!

I might be willing to do something fairly constrained like this - a single character or relationship, over a few chapters - but doing something that requires going back and re-reading all of WtC, taking notes along the way, would be off the table. I have a little more spare time due to the stay-home situation, but not /that/ much.
