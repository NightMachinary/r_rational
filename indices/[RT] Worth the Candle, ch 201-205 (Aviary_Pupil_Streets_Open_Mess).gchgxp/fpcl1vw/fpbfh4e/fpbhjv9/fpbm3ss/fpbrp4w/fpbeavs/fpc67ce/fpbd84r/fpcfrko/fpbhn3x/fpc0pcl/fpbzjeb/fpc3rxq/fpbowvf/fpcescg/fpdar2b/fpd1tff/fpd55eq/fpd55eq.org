Doris' key problem is that she can't work with herself. She also views every clone as their own discrete person and not a continuation. For example Star Doris asked to make a clone with the full intent of attacking herself if not chosen just to give her a 50% chance of survival. Create an army ploys don't work unless there is overwhelming incentive to do so. She doesn't want to die and all her clones inherit that.
