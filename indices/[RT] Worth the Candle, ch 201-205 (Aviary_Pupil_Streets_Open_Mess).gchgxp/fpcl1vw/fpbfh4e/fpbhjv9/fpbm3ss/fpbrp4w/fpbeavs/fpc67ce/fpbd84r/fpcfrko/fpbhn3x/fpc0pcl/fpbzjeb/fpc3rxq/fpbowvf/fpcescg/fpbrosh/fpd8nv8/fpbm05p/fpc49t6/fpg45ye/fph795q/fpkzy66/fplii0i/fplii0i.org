One of the 5 Gods of Aerb. The Blood Magic spell "Aarde's Touch" is named after them. In an Infinite Library future, they personally confirmed there was no living thing left in Fel Seed's exclusion.

(I'm just now realizing that I might have been bamboozled, and it was never actually confirmed that Aarde is related to Blood Magic...? Maybe they're a God of Fire or something. Fuck.)
