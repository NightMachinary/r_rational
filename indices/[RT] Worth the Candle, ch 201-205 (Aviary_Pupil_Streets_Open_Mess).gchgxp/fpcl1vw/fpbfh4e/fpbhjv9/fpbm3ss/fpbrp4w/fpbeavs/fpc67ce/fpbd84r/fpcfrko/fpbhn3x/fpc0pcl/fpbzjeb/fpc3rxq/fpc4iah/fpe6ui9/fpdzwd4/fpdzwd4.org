  Okay, so what's the deeper understanding? Raven wants to interact with the Dorises honestly (if also circumspectly), but it's hard when there's more danger?

I think this is an example of Raven reacting rather than thinking things through. She just really doesn't like the idea of being right next to a human shaped nuke.

Raven has had centuries of being the baddest and toughest motherfucker around, can you blame her for being uncomfortable?
