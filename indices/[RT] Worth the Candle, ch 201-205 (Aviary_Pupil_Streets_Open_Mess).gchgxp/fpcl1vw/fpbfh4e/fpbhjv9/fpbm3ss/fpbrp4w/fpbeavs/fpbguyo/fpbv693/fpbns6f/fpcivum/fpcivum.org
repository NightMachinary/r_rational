  The fact that at literally any point she could have gotten over her personal troubles

How? Generally speaking, people can't just "decide" to be different, any more than someone depressed can just "decide to not be depressed" anymore. The solution requires systematic changes, partially from not living in desperation so that you have time to set up new systems, but also you have to set up systems that make the best/right choice the easy one.

And systems like that take a lot of time and intentional effort to get right.
