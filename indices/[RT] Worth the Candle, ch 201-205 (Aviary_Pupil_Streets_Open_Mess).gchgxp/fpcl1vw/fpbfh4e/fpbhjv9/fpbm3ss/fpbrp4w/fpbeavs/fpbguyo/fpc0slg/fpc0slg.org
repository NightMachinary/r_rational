I think most people could relate to Doris. It was almost chilling for me to realize I'm pretty much exactly like Doris, I often and still do procrastinate on important things while doing inane shit until the very last moment when I finally feel the smallest bit of motivation. Doris makes for quite the interesting case, the scenario of a completely ordinary type of person pushed to such an extreme. After long enough, others see her just as a completely irredeemable person instead of the result of the conditions and process Joon talked about. Really reminds me of the Dark Forest Theory and the Prisoner's Dilemma a lot of other novels use.

...And maybe I'll finally finish the thing I've been procrastinating on for way too long now. That really hit way too close to home.
