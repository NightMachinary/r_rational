Here's my point: Doris Finch seems to have been an ordinary non-supernatural human who one day woke up with the ability to duplicate herself which then immediately got excluded. She didn't try to push the boundaries of any magic. She didn't find that one broken trick (DMs hate her). She isn't some cool monster that surprisingly turned out to be both OP and exponentially growing. She isn't more setting-breaking than expected.

In other words she and Fel Seed seem to be the only exclusion zones that clearly have been crafted with the purpose of being exclusion zones. At least with our current knowledge. And Fel Seed is a special case.
