I think I agree with your guess. And it would be a good callback, considering we haven't seen anything related to luck for a while. And Doris Finch and Luck were introduced around the same time-ish.

Luck seems to be exactly the thing that should break through an anti-scrying entad. Partially because it's not actually scrying, and also because it's /luck/.

It's also the same brand of dumb bullshit Doris would come up with.

Yeah. 100% this.
