I think it's less the material privilege and more the material inequality which degrades empathy.

I think a human born into a lush paradise with other humans will grow into a better person than a human born on a throne with slaves, even though the two have similar material conditions. The wealthy in our world are closer to the latter category. Meanwhile, within the latter society, the slaves will grow into better people than the one on the throne, but worse people than the ones in the paradise.

In the real world, there's a strange effect where the former warlords can create sheltered bubbles for their grandchildren where they only meet other high-resource people, sort of mimicking some but not all features of the paradise. However, the moral conviction of these bubbled people can usually only go so far, because they ultimately have no incentive to deconstruct the blood-built edifice of their bubble. Especially once they grow up and must take on the mantle of power, with the incentive to maintain that wealth, they'll find their ideals becoming more... flexible.
