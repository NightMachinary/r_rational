500% yes. But I'm probably in the minority of people who would be more than willing to die/etc for the greater good of the clone Collective.

I'd institute self rules such as the equitable sharing of assets along each split, etc. When someone clones themselves, they are essentially giving up half of what they have to pool their added manpower together.

The main benefit of cloning is you gain access to a group of people who share similiar values and beliefs to you and that you have a very good idea of their mindset/loyalties up until when you split off.

I can easily see 10-12 of me moving into a large townhouse together and co-labouring toward the Clone-Collectives mutual benefit. It wouldn't be a lock in thing, clones could leave if they wanted, the clones that wanted to stay could simply split off a copy of themselves.
