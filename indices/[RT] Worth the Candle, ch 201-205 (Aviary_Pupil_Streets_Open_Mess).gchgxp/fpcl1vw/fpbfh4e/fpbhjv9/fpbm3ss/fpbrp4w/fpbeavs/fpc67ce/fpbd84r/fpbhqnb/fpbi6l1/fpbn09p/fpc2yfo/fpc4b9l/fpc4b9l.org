This sounds like something [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] would be able to show a lot better than me; I'm much more of a pantser, and while that doesn't mean I'd have *nothing* to show, I don't think I'd have a lot that feels like it's worth the viewer's time compared to just watching a lecture on workflow by Brandon Sanderson or something.

(I don't know if Sanderson has such a video or I'd link to it, but he has so many lectures on writing available I'd be shocked if this hasn't come up already)
