Anecdotally, out of all the scion class, the children of arts-industry (movies, books, pictorial arts etc) multimillionaires seem the most grounded and compassionate, especially the ones who follow their parents into the work.

I suspect this is because the success of art is directly related to its relatability to the masses; if the child of a successful actor is to themselves become a successful actor (eg Ben Stiller, Domnhall Gleeson, Angelina Jolie, Liv Tyler), then even with the leg-up past the initial barriers, they /still/ have to be capable of convincing on-screen portrayal of some relatively ordinary person. They still need to seek out direct exposure to how relatively ordinary people live. If they are to portray a character from an author's book, they meet the author. If they are to portray a real person, they meet that person, and that person's associates.

Fundamentally they are /role-players/ that get significant professional success just for /role-playing/. Especially with modern directors and screenwriters encouraging much more improv, and actor input into character development. This is specifically why Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul is /so good/ - Vince Gilligan encourages a very high level of actor investment and contribution into their characters.
