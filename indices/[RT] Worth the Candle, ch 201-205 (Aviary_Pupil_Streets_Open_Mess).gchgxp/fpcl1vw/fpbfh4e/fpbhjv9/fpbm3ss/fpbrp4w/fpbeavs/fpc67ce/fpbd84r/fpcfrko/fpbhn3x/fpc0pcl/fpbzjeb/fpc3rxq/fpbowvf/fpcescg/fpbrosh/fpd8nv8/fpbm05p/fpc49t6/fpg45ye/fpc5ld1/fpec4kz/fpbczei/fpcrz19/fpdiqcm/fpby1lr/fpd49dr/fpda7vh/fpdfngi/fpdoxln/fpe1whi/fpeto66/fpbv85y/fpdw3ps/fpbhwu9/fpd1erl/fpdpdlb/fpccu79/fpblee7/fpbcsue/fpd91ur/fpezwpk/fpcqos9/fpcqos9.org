Mr Wales, I am extremely disappointed with you.

You have a character that ascended to demi-god status by swimming in oceans of blood, being pitted against herself again and again, in an evolutionary process that culled the versions of her that didn't improve fast enough, until she became the ultimate master of blood.

SO WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL HER THE RED QUEEN?
