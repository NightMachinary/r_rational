Doris and her cloned stuff are confined to the zone; what does that mean, exactly? Does cloned stuff vanish as soon as it crosses the boundary?

- How high up does the boundary go?\\
- How far down does it go?
- It is a dome? A column? An irregular shape?
- Whenever a Doris is created, she appears as an exact copy of her progenitor, meaning that the clone has air in her lungs. If a clone breathes out across the boundary, does the cloned air vanish?\\
- What about light? Does the light from those cloned flashlights vanish at the boundary?
- Do void effects vanish?

Imagine an open circuit consisting of a loop of copper wire and a light bulb. In the real world if you close the circuit by attaching a battery to the two ends of the wire then electrons will flow and the bulb will light up. The interesting part is that the electrons in the water behave like water in a pipe: They all start moving the moment the (battery is added / faucet is turned on). The [[https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/circuits/Lesson-2/Electric-Current][drift speed]] of electrons is quite low, maybe 1m / hour. If the wire is a few miles long it will be ages from then the battery is attached until the first electron from the battery actually flows through the light bulb -- until then the light bulb is being powered by the electrons that were already in the wire.

Now imagine that the battery is cloned but the cable and the bulb were supplied by the Empire and are therefore not cloned. The bulb is outside of the zone with the wire crossing the border. When Doris connects the battery, does current flow? Does the bulb stay lit as per normal until the battery is drained, or does it shut off as soon as electrons from the cloned battery cut off the flow by crossing the border? If it keeps flowing, that means that Doris is the solution to the Empire's energy problems -- run a power cable in, have Doris clone batteries or coal or nuclear fuel or etc and send power out.
