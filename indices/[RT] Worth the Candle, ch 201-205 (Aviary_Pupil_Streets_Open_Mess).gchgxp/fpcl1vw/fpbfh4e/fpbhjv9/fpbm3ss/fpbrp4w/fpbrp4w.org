It's incredibly impressive that the story can go from climactic non stop battles in Anglecynn to the team somehow finagling a diplomatic response to someone everyone has given up on being diplomatic with. I was engaged the whole way through, and even if they could have killed Blood God Doris it's really neat to see them take a step back and realize it might not be the optimal path. (On a side note it'll probably be helpful for Raven to see that quests are not ironclad and that they do indeed have agency.)
