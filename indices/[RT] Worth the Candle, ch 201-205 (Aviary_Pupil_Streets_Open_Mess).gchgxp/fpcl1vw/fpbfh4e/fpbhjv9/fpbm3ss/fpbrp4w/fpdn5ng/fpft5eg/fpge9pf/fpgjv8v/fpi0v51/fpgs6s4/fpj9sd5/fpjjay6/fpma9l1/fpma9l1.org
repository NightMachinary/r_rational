You're totally right that its all speculation and I'm extrapolating. But I choose the believe that the system is written such that all situations have a PHS/MEN/SOC solution. Some harder or easier, but that there are no 'lol you picked the wrong stats, instant lose' scenarios unless June makes significant mistakes to force himself into such a situation.

edit: Oh its a very good bandaid, but he never figured out /why/ the level ups were addictive. I think a SOC June would solve it that way, cutting it off at the source rather than using magic to permanently smother it. His MEN solution was a selective lobotomy/brainwashing of himself with Spirit Magic.

Even Uther needed entads to get to P-space, June would get there the same way.
