A high SOC path for Mome-rath would have involved the necessary social insight and weaving that he would have not only noticed that people were acting oddly but been able to track down the cultists. He then would have been able to turn around that fatalistic "Let's end the world" guy and talk him down. Preventing Mome-rath from ever being summoned at all. He also would probably have gained some powerful SOC skill unlocks likely capable of overcoming some of the anti-memetic effects, maybe even something like "Things trying to hide from your attention become MORE obvious than if they were not". A sort of super-sherlock that is also good with people.

At a certain point, a SOC character campaign becomes extremely collaborative, delegating out and choosing the right people to unite Aerb in its own defence. June only gets called in to flashpoint events that require the perfect hail-mary diplomatic touch from left field. He becomes famous not as the 'impossible warrior, Uther reborn' but as the 'great uniter, Uther reborn'

Max Level SOC June is finding ways to stop the decline of Aerb society and social-engineer its systems to prevent future exclusions. He probably also realises that Uther/Arthur was never the answer, that the only person who can reckon his internal struggle, is himself. He helps ordinary people perform the extraordinay, Aerb learns that they don't need a singular hero with fabled awesome power, but can collectively hold off the horrors together.

People don't want to fight the current June because he is a fierce warrior who could likely win. Max Level SOC June puts people at ease, because everyone knows that wherever he shows up, the optimal solution for everything that no one else could think of is not far behind him.
