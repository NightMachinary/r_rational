Given how little we know of SOC virtues (which would have a bigger impact than MEN and PHS really) all we can do is speculate.

Mome Possibilities:* It's likely June wouldn't have even had to deal with the anti-memetic effect. Penetrating the cult before Mr Mome and his back lice were even an issue.* Given how all other magical effects are slowly being discovered to be accounted for in the system somehow (bladeborn are PHS, magics are MEN) I think its actually quite intuitive that Memes and interacting with them are unlocked in varying degrees by pushing up SOC and SOC skills unlocking synergies similar to how multiple PHS unlocked the bladeborn etc.* Even without though, June could do two-step removed social-fu on himself similiar to that chick that could resist Soul-fucking even though she was entirely under its thralls. A SOC June likely has many options like that, the ability to pre-condition and even retroactively post-condition himself to undertake tasks even if he himself no longer knows why.- The point is, there are possible ways. The game is still set up for conflict, and I consider Memes to be a form of SOC attack for which a high level SOC character should have defenses.

Level Up Addiction:* Probably the same thing here, where June can ignore his own wants and desires with perfect rationality if he chooses to. He would be utterly addicted to leveling up, but able to indefinitely act as if he was not.* In fact, rather than slapping a bandaid on the level up addiction with Spirit Magic, a SOC June likely could have directly removed the cause of the addiction rather than magically hiding the symptoms.

P-Space:A SOC June would utterly destroy anything they liked in P-space. In fact he would be insanely overpowered there. Its all about conceptual and abstract connections, a SOC character is a god there. In fact in might be advantageous for him to remain there and use the enormous power he could amass there to push influence back onto Aerb similar to how the original inhabitant did.A SOC June in P-Space is the equivalent of Blood-God Deloris.edit: In fact that's probably how a SOC June defeats Fel-Seed, they go to P-Space and find a way to erase the conceptual linkages of Fel-Seeds existence, unknitting him from reality.\\
Uther was powerful in P-space because of his Fame among other things, A SOC June would have amassed so much public and political influence he would be a tsunami of force in P-Space.
