I'm reminded of Undertale. When I first played it, I killed some monsters and talked with others, and it was incredibly hard to do either because I was not specialized (and also because I'm not actually good). But then I tried a pacifist route and I was surprised at how the problems actually had non-violent solutions. It's the kind of thing that seemed hard to believe from my tropes-filled priors.

Edit: I meant Undertale, not Unsong.
