Note that it's not just "go to another plane where you're not excluded". The other plane /has its own corresponding exclusion zone/, inside which the excluded stuff works, same as in the "normal" plane. Outside of that zone, it's excluded as usual.

Apparently a huge part of the problem for the Finches was working out how to connect to the part of the Plane of Blood that was actually inside the corresponding exclusion zone, since otherwise they wouldn't be able to pass through the portal.
