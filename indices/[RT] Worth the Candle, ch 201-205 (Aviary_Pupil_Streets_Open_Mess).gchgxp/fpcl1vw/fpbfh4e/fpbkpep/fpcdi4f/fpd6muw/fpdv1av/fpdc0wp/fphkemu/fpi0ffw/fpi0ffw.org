Yeah that's the point I meant to get at, if I was unclear. After a split, if both Dorises survive, they must continue to split prior to the 24h timer because all of their stuff *could* disappear and they cannot determine who has the permanent gear. Plus the longer a branch, the less likely any of their stuff is permanent and the more of an incentive they'd have to continue to clone their gear.

Doris becomes unmanageable veeeery quickly because of this feature, and it's only compounded because her main method of attack / defense is splitting.
