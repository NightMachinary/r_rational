We don't know for how long she got to run around as a part of normal society, with her power active, before she was excluded. I suspect the exclusion was immediate. The Republic of Doris Finch is described as very barren and bare, not just because the Dorises have absolutely stripped it, but to the point where it was probably 31x31 miles of nothing much to start with.

If you "Dorised" right now, including the exclusion consequence, you'd probably be inside a house with lots of little duplicable resources, inside a town or city with an enormous amount of duplicable resources.

For some reason it seems that she wasn't anywhere near anything of any use at all. Maybe the original Doris (wisely) conducted her research into potentially excludable magic way out in the boonies, in a tiny shack. Which speaks well of her potential to re-humanize.
