That's handled in the chapters we were just shown, it's implied that the literally billions or trillions of dead dorises have essentially salted the earth (not least because, you know, sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, iron, and so on are extremely vital to the human body).

If you Dorised right now you'd have half the resources you did before, because now you need to kill your clone. And it's important to note that it was confirmed that Doris is mostly just a fuck up, and isn't a sociopath or anything. She wasn't going to immediately resort to killing a copy of her just because it'd dupe something for her. Remember, every duplicated resource either dissapears in 24 hours or requires you to kill someone every 24 hours for the rest of your life. Are there things that might be worth that? Definitely, as long as you've got an insta kill closet and you're chill with patternist theory. It's still something of last resort that you don't use unless it's literally your only option. For example, you're stuck in a barren EZ where you can't buy anything of value and anything that is valuable is already hoarded and claimed.

Again, "tragedy of the commons". The reason there is nothing of value in the EZ is because Doris can't cooperate and will defect at the first sign that she can gain a temporary advantage. Sure, they started with a lot of stuff, but then they ate it all and didn't husband it and shit broke and now there's a couple million doris's fighting each other for scraps.
