hm I'm rereading this now and the situation is even worse than I thought:

#+begin_quote
  the loophole was that if a clone with an hour left on the clock for their equipment made a clone, that new clone would have their clock reset
#+end_quote

The NEW clone gets the clock reset. The old clone doesn't. so murder for resources is almost demanded. essentially no one would have permanent gear, either; the odds of anything you find being an "original" item are vanishingly slim in this scenario. So you really are forced to be splitting and stealing /constantly/.
