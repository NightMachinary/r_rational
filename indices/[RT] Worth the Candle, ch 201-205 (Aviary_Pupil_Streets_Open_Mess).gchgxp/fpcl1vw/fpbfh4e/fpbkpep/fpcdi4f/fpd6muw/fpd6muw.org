I love the points you've made, but you seem to have missed that 'kick them out naked' is not quite accurate.

When Doris splits there is a coin flip that Clone A is the original or Clone B is the original. They do not know which is the clone and which is the original. The original's gear will persist past 24h. The cloned gear will disappear after 24h.

It's the fact that no clone can persist past 24h without their standard of living massively degrading that was at the root of the Doris Problem, which escalates their need for an initial split to be resolved with one Superior Doris and one Inferior Doris. The Superior Doris gets to persist with gear after 24h, the Inferior Doris does not.

If the splitting conflict is not resolved immediately, and Doris escapes herself... There's infinite escalation. As neither half of the split can risk waiting 24h and potentially losing everything, she must split to persist her gear by robbing her new clone. And the Doris population grows exponentially as branches grow without being reliably trimmed.

Why rob your clone, and risk retribution, when you can kill it? Why not victimize other Dorises if you're already willing to 50/50 killing yourself via cloning? Why not continue to clone yourself, if that is your best offense / defense against other clones?
