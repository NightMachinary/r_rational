  Samaritans were a group of people that weren't exactly liked by the people Jesus was preaching to,

I don't think that's necessarily true. The parable itself works just as well if you use "a firefighter, an accountant, and a Yankees fan," or any other set of 3 descriptors where the highest implied social status is obvious and goes first. The message was just "be like Sam" with a bit of spice thrown in to show the priest was not like Sam and did not set the correct example. The phrase "good samaritan" doesn't appear in any text until the 17th century, and by itself is enough to create the perception that Samaritans were, in general, bad, because most humans use lazy cognitive bias.

Offensive, in this context, means it's actually harming people in measurable ways.
