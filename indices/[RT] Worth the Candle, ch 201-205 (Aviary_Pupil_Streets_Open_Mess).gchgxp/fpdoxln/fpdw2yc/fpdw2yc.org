I wonder how well Valencia's approach works for Doris. The point isn't to understand or manipulate Doris, but to try helping her to be a /better/ person. Meanwhile, Valencia is trying to learn how to be a (good) person. Maybe not the best fit.

But she could certainly read a Doris like a book, to the point of anticipating everything Doris did. That fits with your hypothesis.
