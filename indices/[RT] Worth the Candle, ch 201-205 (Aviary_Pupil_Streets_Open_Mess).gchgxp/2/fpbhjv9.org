So Arthur is halfway down a dimensional tube in the center of the Fel Seed EZ. Excluded magic still works in a corresponding part of parallel planes, accessible via good Star Mages. Arthur was an unparalleled Star Mage. If the Fel Seed EZ on Aerb is completely warded against, Fel Seed can still come back years later. Supposedly in the alternate timeline a god confirmed the Fel Seed EZ on Aerb free of Fel Seed; although not-literally in Aerb's EZ Uther has on a pendant with amazing anti-scrying power.

Hrmmmmm.
