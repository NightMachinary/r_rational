Eh, Doris isn't alone. Of the Thirteen Horrors, Better with Loops, REDACTED, Doris, and Unwavering seem like effects that are pretty clear cut random magic appearing in an otherwise normal person. Also possibly true for Manifest, and Everything Eater. I don't know, look at the empersoned exclusion zones again when you get the chance. I personally feel that the GM pretty blatantly created half of these on purpose to set up adventure locations.
