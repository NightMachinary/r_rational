  So, as far as I saw in that notes chapter there is definitely not enough information on any of your examples to assuredly put them in the same category as I felt Doris falls in after reading the last two batches of chapters.

I don't actually understand what you're trying to say here. Doris is noted for being a magical prodigy though (the quest describing her as precocious, her figuring athenarium magics out on her own) so saying she's research independent isn't quite true.
