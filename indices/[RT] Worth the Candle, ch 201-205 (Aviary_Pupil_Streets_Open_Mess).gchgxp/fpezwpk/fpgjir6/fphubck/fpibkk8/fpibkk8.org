You can ask the same question about a lot of things. For example where did Herald come from? Where did Fel Seed come from? Where did Manifest come from? I'm sure some of these have interesting answers, but at some point you can really only point at DM fuckery. Maybe for Doris in particular she happened to mutate a gene that gives duplication as a bloodline magic. A bunch of people could have this gene now but they'd never know cause the magic is excluded.
