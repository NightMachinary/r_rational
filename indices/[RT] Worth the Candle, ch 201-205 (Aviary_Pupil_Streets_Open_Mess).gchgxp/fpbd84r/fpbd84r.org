Note: This is the second part of a two-part "batch", starting [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle/chapter/489717/notes-iii][with ch 196 here]], discussion of those [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/galt0r/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_196200/][here.]] Thanks for reading!

Also, I added some new goals on [[https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales][Patreon]] which are probably of interest to you even if you're not interested in patronage. You can read those there, but the tl;dr is that after we do the one for a full list of exclusions, it'll be some kind of Aerbian slice-of-life thing, and after that, another tabletop session (though I'm split on who it would actually be: Earth group, Earth counterpart group, Arches group, or maybe some other one, like Mary and tuung, or Fenn running her own thing in some alternate timeline, or ... something).
