I have a suggestion, have you guys considered making a video and showcasing ways that you have organized your notes for your stories and advice for how to create files that make it easier for a writer to write and not get bogged down in trying to fix their notes in order for everything to match? If the writer is the engine of the story, then the notes are the gears, cogs, and pistons.
