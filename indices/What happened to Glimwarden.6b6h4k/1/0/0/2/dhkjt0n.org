I had a thought when I read DWoD, I was late to the discussion so I don't think you saw it (If you did see it and it was just super wrong, feel free to tell me so, hehe), I'll ask once more:

#+begin_quote
  Are spirits an analogy for intuitions? Is the process of turning them into magical items an analogy for sublimation? Essentially... A well adjusted person (Sophia) has control over the mind (world) because she respects the remnants of the old world (spirits) that it was built from. This would mirror the process of maturation a person undergoes as they understand the context and purpose of their instincts and learn to move with them instead of against them.

I think it'd be worth writing about these things. I questioned the efficacy of doing it analogically. I'd question the efficacy of communicating anything analogically. But it'd still be cool if true.
