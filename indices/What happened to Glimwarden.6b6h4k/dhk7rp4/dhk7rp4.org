I think the author was getting a little burnt out, and also wanted to focus on some other projects for a while. He recently finished the Dark Wizard of Donkerk, which in my opinion is easily a publication-quality novel. [[http://www.alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html]]

Hopefully he'll get back to Glimwarden some time, as it was starting to get interesting. We'll see, I guess.
