The Wordpress part of my website actually does have something like that feature courtesy of an addon I installed. You can go to a random chapter of /Glimwarden/, highlight, then hit Ctrl + Enter, and it will send me an e-mail with the highlighted part, which is usually enough that I can figure out what's wrong (and usually fix within a few hours of it being reported).

However, the kind of editing that I want to do on /DWoD/ is more like ripping out characters who aren't doing anything, adding in chunks of exposition if needed, excising plot threads that go nowhere, etc. And since all that stuff needs to be done, and would doubtlessly introduce /more/ grammatical/spelling/consistency errors, I kind of want to hold off on sending the whole thing through a copy-editing pass.
