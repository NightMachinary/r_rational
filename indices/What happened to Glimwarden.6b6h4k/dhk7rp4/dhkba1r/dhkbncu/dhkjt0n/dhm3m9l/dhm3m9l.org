That's not the analogy that I had in mind, but spirits were always designed to follow a more social model whose pathways were intuitive rather than explicit. [[/u/daystareld]] and I have an upcoming episode of [[http://daystareld.com/podcasts/rationally-writing/][Rationally Writing]] where we talk about /Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ in-depth as the focus of the episode; it should be out within the week (edit: or month? I don't actually know the schedule).

I do think there's more to be said about intuitions than was said within the text - it's one of the things that I'll keep my eye on for future edits (or the inevitable sequel).
