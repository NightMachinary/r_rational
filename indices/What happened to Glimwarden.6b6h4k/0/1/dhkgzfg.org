I wanted to share some Glimwarden fanart on the next thread update for the story, but since it's on hiatus, I'll post it here.

 

[[http://lonsheep.deviantart.com/art/Glimwarden-Dinner-at-the-Black-Mare-651092984][*Dinner at the Black Mare*]] featuring that tasty horse noodle [[http://i.imgur.com/kvPhYm4.jpg][soup]] which I drew to look like horse pho.

 

Thanks for creating such an engaging world!!!
