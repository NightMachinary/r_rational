It's on indefinite hiatus. I have the next two and a half chapters written, but I want to make sure that everything is in order before I start publishing again (since some of the problems I have with it now come out of just putting a chapter out because there was a deadline, rather than editing and refactoring until I was happy with it). Right now I'm thinking that I might just write up until the planned end of Book 1, then release that at a chapter a week. And then take another long hiatus so I can work on other things that caught my attention.
