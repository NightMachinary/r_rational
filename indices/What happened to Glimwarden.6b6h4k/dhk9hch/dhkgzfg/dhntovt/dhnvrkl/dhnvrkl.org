Thanks!

I use written descriptions as a springboard to designing a character's look. On a conscious level, I know that Sander has eyebrow-ish length blond hair, but when I pick up a pen to actually draw it, it turns out there's a lot of ways it can possibly look, while still being compliant with the story's description.

[[http://i.imgur.com/fckRVCC.jpg][*Here's*]] a character concept sketch I drew as a warm up a while ago. Sander wears shirts and pants, Melanie wears a dress, Chloe wears Langust's armour, and because the story doesn't need to dwell on the details, the readers' imaginations can fill in the blanks between the concepts. I enjoyed creating a visual that tries to match the atmosphere and feel of the Glimwarden universe.
