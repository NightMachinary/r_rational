This is great! It's always a little odd seeing someone else interpret my characters, since I have this clear mental image in my head, which has to meet up with that interpretation. And it gets reconciled in my brain a little bit, so the way of think of Sander is now closer to how you've portrayed him.

Good work, and sorry about the hiatus.
