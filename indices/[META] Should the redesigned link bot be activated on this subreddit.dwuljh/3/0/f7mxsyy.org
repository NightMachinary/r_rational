  this subreddit's wiki should have an added rule for story pages (if it doesn't already) that forbids adding anything that is not a neutrally written description of the story.

Disagree; I think if we're going to have recommendation threads in general, we could do with a page that aggregated reviews instead of the same things being said each time the story was mentioned.
