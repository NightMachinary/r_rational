  The bot now only directly links to the work when it detects an unlinked title.

Bruh. You have /got/ to make this thing "opt-in" and there's still no option of opting out. If I mention Worm, your bot shouldn't do /anything/ unless I purposefully summon it by saying something like "link(Worm)" or something. If people are having a conversation about a work and your bot exists in its current form, people are going to avoid mentioning the work in their comments to avoid doubling the length of the conversation.

--------------

"What do you guys think about Worm?"

"I like Worm well enough, but it's too long."

"I hate Worm, first person perspective is garbage."

"I would normally agree, but Worm is one of the few works that manages to do a good job with the first person perspective."

"I think Worm is the pinnacle of Rational Fiction as a genre."

"Are you serious? Worm doesn't meet the criteria to be qualified as rational."

"You absolute /clod/, Worm is one of the works that defines the genre."

--------------

Is your bot going to extend those seven comments out to /fourteen/ comments, providing a link every single time somebody mentions Worm? Because that's just straight up clutter. I'm pretty sure it's not possible for your bot to be smart enough to detect when a conversation is happening and only provide a link for the first mention of a work. Now that I've physically typed that sentence out and read it back, it actually seems like something that might be pretty simple. If you can figure out how to do that, then great, that's the second best option and is more than acceptable. It would be better if the bot had to be purposefully summoned, but if you put in the work to force the bot to not make an additional comment for literally each and every single individual mention of a work, then you'll have done your due diligence and deserve to have your bot implemented.
