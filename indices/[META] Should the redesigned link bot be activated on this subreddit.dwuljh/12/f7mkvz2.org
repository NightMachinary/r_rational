I will be seriously disappointed if you are run out of this subreddit. I'm not going to go through and reply to every other thread here, but I will say that I feel you've done your best to be civil and take every argument seriously. I'm very troubled about what it means for this subreddit going forward if people like you are going to be kicked out for trying to make something cool for the community and to take its feedback seriously.

So I guess this is my petition to the mods to deny [[/u/Lightwavers]]' request to be banned.
