Why is death of the author an absurd argument? If a work is good, it is good. Ender's Game is good, and continues to be good even for gay people who justifiably hate OSC and therefore don't want to give him any money whatsoever. Even some of his more recent work is good. (Though much less of it, which probably isn't coincidental, and not as good as his earlier work, which probably /is/ coincidental.)
