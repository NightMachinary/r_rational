Have you seen JoJo Rabbit yet? If not, here's the trailer, it gets the point across:

The quote that sticks out the most for me is

#+begin_quote
  You're not a Nazi, JoJo. You're a 10-year-old kid who likes dressing up in a funny uniform and wants to be part of a club.

Do you remember the bit in HPMOR where Harry tells Hermione about how people just a few hundred years ago used to recreationally stuff cats into a basket and then roast them over a fire and listen to their screams of terror for entertainment? And then he asks her if she truly believes there's a genetic difference between her and them, like, if she believes she wouldn't've been a cat-roaster if she'd been born back then? I have three daughters, and they're all biologically feline. I love them more than I love any human. I would almost certainly think it was funny to set cats on fire if I'd been born a thousand years ago, or wheneverthehell they did it, because the "nurture" part of "nature versus nurture" is probably more important than the "nature" part.

Point being, *if you'd been born in different circumstances, you could've wound up being a Nazi.*

Nazis are not inherently evil. There is no "Nazi gene." If one of your neighbors is a Nazi or a homophobe or a Republican or whatever other ideology you find repugnant, and you're inviting the neighborhood to a barbecue block party type of event, you don't go to your neighbor's house and say "if you crash my bbq I'm calling the police," you say, "hey man, I'm having a BBQ, and if you can keep that shit to yourself then you're welcome to try socializing with the rest of us."

  I'm a firm believer that you can actually help these people be better

The way to do that is to allow them to interact in normal society without ostracizing them, because they got the way they are by being stuck in a filter bubble. If you don't allow them to be part of the group, all you've done is strengthen the filter bubble that got them there in the first place.

  A lot of people don't want to spend time with people [who] think they are subhuman.
#+end_quote

That's literally the only way physically possible to convince that type of person that you aren't subhuman.
