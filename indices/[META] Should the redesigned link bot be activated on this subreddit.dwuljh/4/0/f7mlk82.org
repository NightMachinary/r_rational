  When you say, "I'm dismissing your arguments because the arguments you expressed made it clear that you're a Nazi supporter, which makes it clear that you're arguing in bad faith," do you not see the irony? I think it should be self-evident to most people why "I'm going to dismiss you entirely because I have analyzed your arguments and diagnosed you as being part of the Evil outgroup" is a terrible mode of conduct, and if you're one of the people who don't regard this point as self-evident, I'm not sure what could be said to persuade you.

First, just as a general request, when you use quotation marks, can you please /actually/ be quoting what a person said (or, at least, indicate that you're paraphrasing)? I had a much different opinion about your post when I thought that this was, word-for-word, what [[/u/Lightwavers][u/Lightwavers]] had said.

Second... I know that we strive to be better here, but, I just don't see how "dismissing the opinion of someone in an apparent outgroup" is a ban-worthy offense. That's about 90% of all political discourse. Yes, I absolutely agree that it /shouldn't/ be, but you're essentially asking for someone to be banned for normal human behaviour (even /contemporarily/ and /culturally/ normal human behaviour).

Finally, in response to:

  However, there are certain kinds of behavior that are so deviant that it makes me think that one simple interaction of "hey, we don't do that here" is going to be enough to correct that decision. For example, if I walk out of my home at 8 AM on a Saturday and see my new neighbor defecating on the sidewalk, I don't expect to get a reaction of, "Oh, my bad, I'll refrain from doing that in the future." And, even if my neighbor says, "Oh, my bad, I didn't realize there was a community standard against defecation, it's actually really common where I'm from," it makes me fear that the next time I walk outside, I'll also have to tell him, "By the way, we also prefer that you confine your sexual escapades to the interior of your abode rather than doing it out here on your lawn in full view of the public."

I disagree with the idea of banning someone because of some intuition about what they might do in the future.

Yes, Lightwavers screwed up. I don't think there's anyone arguing to the contrary here. But a ban seems like a /ridiculously/ over-the-top overreaction to the crime committed, especially given the community rule "Unless you're obviously a bot, spammer, or troll we will start by talking, not removing posts or handing out bans."

I'm agnostic on the idea of the reinstatement of the bot (really, if someone describes something interesting, I can LMGTFMyself, but I don't deny it's more convenient to have the link at hand), but I am ardently against banning someone for two offenses, one of which you describe as "[not] where the strong reaction is coming from," and for the other, your rationale is (I'm paraphrasing here): "he can't get away with saying 'he can't get away with this, not in this neighborhood,' not in this neighbourhood!"
