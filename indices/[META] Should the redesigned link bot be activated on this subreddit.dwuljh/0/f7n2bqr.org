OK, moderator here. Per [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dvsizg/meta_regarding_ulightwavers_objectionable_author/f7f32tl/][the last thread (comment)]],

#+begin_quote
  Halt [the bot] indefinitely and send a message to the mods before starting it back up. I don't like waking up to this kind of drama, and I don't like bringing automated drama into every single recommendation thread or offhand mention of a work.
#+end_quote

I explicitly /do not have an opinion/ on the bot, but while it's not back the drama is. Please remember the rules of the subreddit:

#+begin_quote

  - Post links to or discussion of rational fiction only; otherwise use one of the weekly discussion threads.
  - Keep [[/r/rational]] pleasant and on-topic.
#+end_quote

As benevolent dictator, I'm locking this thread and adding the following pronouncements:

- There will be no bots on [[/r/rational]] except for those run by the moderators.
- If you want to suggest that we run a bot, contact us /privately/ by modmail. No public threads.
- Future threads on the topic, outside our weekly discussion threads, will be removed and result in a short temp-ban.

These are aimed at preserving our community, which was doing fine and I believe still is if we put this behind us. As always, if you see something you think is off-topic we encourage you to dowvote it, and it there's a pattern to use the report and modmail options.

Private conversations over modmail is a /great/ option if you have a problem - we see them quickly, and it's the minimum-drama option.
