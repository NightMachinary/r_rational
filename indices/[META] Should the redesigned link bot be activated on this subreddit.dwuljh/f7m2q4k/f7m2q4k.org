I'm basically a lurker these days but I found the previous stuff you were doing with the bot alarming, particularly the pushback that implied that if the mods disagreed with you they must be bigots. I'm fine with a pure link bot, but I don't think you should be the one administrating it. I don't consider you trustworthy or credible on this.

So, I've voted against the instatement of this bot.
