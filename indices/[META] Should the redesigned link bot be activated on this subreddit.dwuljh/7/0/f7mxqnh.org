The point of the Wiki isn't that it has a "low quality" tag, in fact that'd be prohibited under the netiquette I proposed, which says that Wiki posts should only contain people's personal reactions and if negative should not be written to imply that anyone else shouldn't enjoy the work. The point of the Wiki would be to aggregate reviews, including negative reviews, and that would prevent people from having to repeat the same info over and over each time somebody mentions or recommends a particular fic. It'd create institutional memory, which is usually a good thing.
