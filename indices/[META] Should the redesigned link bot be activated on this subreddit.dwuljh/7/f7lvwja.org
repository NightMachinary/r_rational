I think a link bot would be a nice thing to have but not something we /need/, specially not if it comes up with /baggage/ of its own. Why can't it just be a simple link bot like [[https://www.reddit.com/user/The-Paranoid-Android][Marvin]] from the SCP sub? I mean users that want to discuss the quality, themes, politics, and enjoyment of the fics can start a thread in this sub, it's kind of the point isn't it? To discuss rational or rationalist works of fiction, as per the sidebar.

And I call it baggage because I think that is what it is going to end up being, the same thing as before the redesign except with the extra step of it being on a wiki, a point of contention that will only bring more drama and negativity in the long term. It's merely my opinion, but I have a reason to think this:

Good faith. This is a relatively small and low-key sub, there aren't that many users active at any given time, and it's not a sub that's constantly flooded with content. I'm not going to say we're all friends here or that we know/recognize each other, but there is a community here with a considerable number of regulars. Good faith and this community's cooperation (along with the mods' unseen hand) is what keeps it running, it makes things like the popular recommendation threads work, and seeing (almost) everyone being civil and relatively calm as far as discussions of any particular fic or topic goes makes one want to keep on coming here.

I'll be blunt: You messed up. You should have asked the community first about implementing the bot (and how far you should go with it) and then you should have asked the mods for permission once your bot was ready to go. Because this isn't something that affects only you but the entire community and its moderators, and it was done without our consent and without giving us the ability to either opt-in or opt-out (unlike with a plugin or something like a Greasemonkey script)

For that, and for your overall (rather unpleasant) character, I do not think it wise to trust you with this task. Letting someone who isn't open to discussion, who thinks their own morals and opinions are above others, and who has no problem dictating what others should think? (As you did with the bot before the redesign) Frankly, it sounds like a recipe for disaster.

I don't want this to be seen like a personal attack, because I don't know you nor could I care less about you or your views, but I care quite a lot about this sub and the discussion it has to offer, I'd rather not see an entire community jeopardized by a single individual's will. Again, good faith, I don't think you have much of it. I'd rather leave all this work to a more level-headed and trustworthy individual.
