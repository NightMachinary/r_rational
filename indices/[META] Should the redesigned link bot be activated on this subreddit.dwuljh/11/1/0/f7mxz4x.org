What about a community that is unconditionally intolerant of intolerance? I think that's more what many of us are concerned about, particularly when the decision of what qualifies is being made by a self-appointed person who seems, let's say, ill-suited for the role.

Frankly, I think worrying about this sub, which is quite possibly 25%+ Jewish, being overrun by Nazis is paranoid and silly. A out-of-control autoimmune disease seems way more likely to be a problem than Nazi AIDS.
