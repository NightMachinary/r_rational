I hate to downplay it with a meme, but this is why we can't have nice things. So much overblown drama and grandstanding over a controversial implementation of a useful tool that didn't really affect anyone before the arguments started in its wake.

In the spirit of being rational about this, some talking points:

- A poll that only a fraction of the userbase will vote on (and others might manipulate) isn't reliable or valid. Also, you're baiting controversy by including loaded questions. Users don't have the right to decide whether someone will be banned. And responding to every random person's loud opinion on why you suck just derails the actual discussion.

- It's a objectively useful tool that you took the time to code (and nobody else before you, I might add). At this point, it's entirely the mods' discretion. Since lots of people are calling into your "trustworthiness" in reinstating a bot that has clearly stated functions, maybe leave the running of the bot to the mods? I agree with [[/u/Amagineer]] that the bot should have its own account though.

To everyone else, he made a mistake. It's not the end of the world or the sub. Be positive. It's disheartening to see a post cautioning against negativity trigger so much of it.
