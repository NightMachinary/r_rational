  It gets rather murky whether or not we should even link material (which might be free of hate) from an author who holds problematic views. Some don't see that as a problem, others might considered the mere act of linking (resulting in views, engagement, or purchase) as supporting the ideologies.

  So, I'm just wondering where we draw the line on what we consider keeping shit to themselves?

I think there was some recent nonsense related to this discussion regarding an author called "Zero HP Lovecraft" who is certifiably "alt-right." I didn't chime in, but I thought at the time, "do people not know anything about the actual HP Lovecraft?" Lovecraft was extraordinarily racist, far and away above and beyond what people might nowadays excuse as being normal for the time period. I know next to nothing about Black Ops IV, but I know the "Nazi Zombies" stuff from BOIII leaned heavily into Lovecraftian stuff. Tons of modern stuff is openly inspired by Lovecraft. I'm sure most of the people reading this comment have read at least one of Lovecraft's works.

I've gotta go to bed, but I come down firmly on the "death of the author" side of the debate.
