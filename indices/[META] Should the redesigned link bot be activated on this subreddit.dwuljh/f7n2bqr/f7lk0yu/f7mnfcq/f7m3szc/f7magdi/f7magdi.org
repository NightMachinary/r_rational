[EDIT: To clarify the purpose of this post: My position is not "[[/u/lightwavers]] should be forcibly ousted from this community," but more, "[[/u/lightwavers]], your behavior /really sucks/, please stop being that way in this community going forward."]

One of the poll options currently tied for most votes is "Ban both the bot and the user behind the account from the subreddit." That might seem like a slightly over-the-top response, without a lot of comments to back it up, so I'd like to explain my reason for voting this way.

There are some offenses that can be resolved with a simple exchange of:

"Hey, just so you know, we don't do that around here."

"Oh, my bad. I'll refrain from doing that in the future."

For example, if someone moves into the neighborhood and starts using his leaf blower at 8 AM on a Saturday, I might give him a heads up that hey, leaf blowers are loud and some people like to sleep in, and we all sort of have a collective pact as a community to not run the leaf blowers before 9:30 AM.

However, there are certain kinds of behavior that are /so/ deviant that it makes me think that one simple interaction of "hey, we don't do that here" is going to be enough to correct that decision. For example, if I walk out of my home at 8 AM on a Saturday and see my new neighbor defecating on the sidewalk, I don't expect to get a reaction of, "Oh, my bad, I'll refrain from doing that in the future." /And/, even if my neighbor says, "Oh, my bad, I didn't realize there was a community standard against defecation, it's actually really common where I'm from," it makes me fear that the next time I walk outside, I'll also have to tell him, "By the way, we also prefer that you confine your sexual escapades to the interior of your abode rather than doing it out here on your lawn in full view of the public."

So, if it seems like people are reluctant to engage in a good-faith discussion of /why/ they're willing to cast a "ban this user" vote, it may be because you have a history of behavior that makes them think you wouldn't react well if you tried to engage them in a good-faith discussion of that subject.

Let's start with the least of your offenses: I have a problem with the idea of creating a bot that injects your subjective opinion into discussions unsolicited. This isn't some kind of but that can be summoned electively by some kind of [[syntax]]; you created a bot that made it such that any time I decided to discuss a certain work, an automated response would come to post in the thread to alert everyone that the work is "low quality." Uh, okay. People come to [[/r/rational]] to discuss various works, and if you'd like to participate in that discussion then you're welcome to do so, but I don't really have any interest in arguing a bot, especially when it appears when every time I mention a work. It's like a little kid who follows you around waiting for you to mention your favorite band, just so that he can scream "THAT BAND SUCKS." Frustrating, because I know that the kid is unpersuadable and has infinite energy and it really makes me just not want to talk about anything when he can just trample over anything that I have to say with something that seems designed to end discussion.

That's a "running your leaf blower at 6 AM on a Saturday" kind of offense. But I don't think that's where the strong reaction is coming from, and I don't think this is why people are willing to express (when given the option to cast an anonymous ballot) that they'd like to see you ousted from the community. I think /that/ has much more to do with the political thing, which I could make a long and mired argument about, but which I'll simply summarize using what I think is the most glaring and illustrative example:

When you say to someone that you're [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dvoq4i/meta_are_the_low_quality_tags_too_harsh/f7egitk/?context=3][dismissing everything they have to say because elsewhere in the thread they expressed views that you decided made them deserving of the "Nazi supporter" label]] (and that, as a Nazi supporter, they can be assumed to be acting in bad faith), do you not see the irony? I think it should be self-evident to most people why "I'm going to dismiss you entirely because I have analyzed your arguments and diagnosed you as being part of the Evil outgroup" is a terrible mode of conduct, and if you're one of the people who /don't/ regard this point as self-evident, I'm not sure what could be said to persuade you.

There's another sentiment of yours:

When I move into a neighborhood and see lots of "No murderers welcome here" signs, my thought isn't, "ah, good, people who agree with me on the importance of murder-intolerant norms," my thought is, "what the fuck?" And then when I talk to one of the neighbors about it, he says, "Sure, missy! I agree with you, murders are bad! We hate murderers around here. *glances around*. You know what I mean by 'murderers,' right? Hate them sons of bitches with their murdering ways. Old man Jenkins who lives on block over is a murderer, you know? It's true. He plead guilty, served 30 years for it, that's a matter of public record, you can go right down to the courthouse and see the proof yourself. And he thinks he can just /live in our city?/ Well, he can't get away with it, not in this neighborhood! Morty might tell you otherwise, but can't trust Morty, on account of him being a murder-sympathizer -- just look at how he fraternizes with old man Jenkins on weekends, playing checkers out on the porch despite Mr. Jenkins being a convicted murder. Good thing that thanks to good neighbors like me, everyone knows not to associate with Jenkins -- or Morty either, that murder-sympathizing son-of-a-bitch. Anyway, welcome to the neighborhood, friend! Just as long as you agree that murder is bad and don't sympathize with any murderers, we're going to get along fine!" It's the kind of thing that makes me think, "I think this counter-signaling is suggesting the presence of something really pernicious that might extend beyond just being against murders."

Someone who believes that the only way to avoid Nazis taking over is to proactively suffuse a community with anti-Nazi sentiment seems like a really unpleasant neighbor. I'm a member of many communities where /not once/ has anyone taken the time to say, "Nazis, fuck those guys, right?" and yet those communities have for years been filled with wonderful, compassionate, and charitable people and /an astounding lack of Nazi presence./ I think that if my local meatspace community were confronted with a "literal Nazi," our reaction might be something like, "Huh, this 14-year-old white suburban kid probably became this way because he felt socially alienated and discovered that he was accepted by people on alt-right message boards who managed to successfully indoctrinate him, it seems to me that socially isolated people are most vulnerable to alt-right rhetoric and so maybe ostracizing and socially isolating people like that runs a very high risk of being counter-productive if our goal is to live in a world with fewer literal Nazis. Of course, if you believe that raining down 'anti-that-kid' vitriol and barring him from interacting with us /is/ a way to create fewer literal Nazis then I'm of course willing to entertain that notion as well, and we can see how well it holds up to basic epistemic rigor."

I'll also say this: I am a fanfic writer who has been part of this community for many years. In fact, I am a fanfic writer whose work has been posted in this subreddit on many occasions in this subreddit, and which many users (you included) have commented on (favorably, in fact). I have in the past participated in various discussions on this subreddit (of other people's work more than my own, in fact). I'm reluctant to share more details for fear of identifying myself, because I think this whole thing is so utterly toxic, which is why I'm posting this from an account that is not connected to my usual and much more active happy-go-lucky fanfic loving and fanfic writing account. In fact, I think this whole thing is so toxic that I'm probably going to avoid posting on this subreddit from my main account for awhile until this whole thing dies down, which /sucks/ because a decent amount of my support comes from people who discovered me through this sub and I've enjoyed being a participant but quite frankly I don't a bunch of attention and scrutiny from the kind of people who are really into branding people with scarlet letters for having bad political opinions. (After all, several paragraphs back I suggested that maybe it might be a valid strategy when confronted with a 14-year-old alt-right kid might /not/ be to immediately chase them into the woods and socially isolate them, which I'm sure is enough for certain people to also brand me as a "Nazi sympathizer."

  Edit2: going to sleep. Discussion is good, but please don't set the sub on fire.

This subreddit is astoundingly chill most of the time, one of the few parts of Reddit that is still fun and about weird and geeky people talking about the hobbies things that make them happy (or unhappy, or bored, or "frustrated with the bad prose," or whatever). The only time I've seen real "fire" on [[/r/rational]] has been over the past few days, so it strikes me as more than a tad ironic to see you patronizingly telling us to behave ourselves while you're asleep.
