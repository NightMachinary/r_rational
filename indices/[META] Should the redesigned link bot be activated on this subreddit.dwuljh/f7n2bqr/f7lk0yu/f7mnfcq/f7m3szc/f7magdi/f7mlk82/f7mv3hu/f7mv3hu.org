As a general post-script:

I guess I should clarify my position: I do not wish for the moderators to actually ban you based on the democratic will of those polled. However, I do wish to express, with the strongest vehemence I can muster: /stop it/.

Your mode of conduct is making the community worse, and not just worse, but transforming it from one of my favorite places on the internet into a place that is like my least favorite places on the internet. I think that you (and the subreddit) would be best served if you took a long, hard look at your behavior to consider for a moment, "Wait a minute, am /I/ the problem here?" (A temporary ban would achieve that, but so would a period of voluntary and self-imposed exile, and I hope that you opt for the latter.)

Ordinarily, I would have let the poll results speak for themselves rather than spending the time to express at length why I feel negatively. However, after your first edit:

  I know strawpolls are really easy to manipulate, but can you not? Thanks.

I felt the need to do the closest thing I could to grabbing you by the shoulders and shaking while screaming, "Maybe there isn't a conspiracy of someone running a bot network to try and manipulate the vote totals. Maybe the fact that dozens of people are selecting the poll option for 'get this user out of our community' is /because you have done something that they genuinely felt the need to express extreme disapproval of,/ and maybe if I articulate my own reasons for extreme disapproval it will make you realize that others might have reasons for feeling extreme disapproval as well." To be clear: I don't want you permanently ousted from this community, and if I want a temporary ban it's more out of a desire to give you an opportunity for self-reflection than for anything punitive, but /I really want that vehement disapproval of your actions to register. There are lots of real human beings who really, really, REALLY don't like what you are doing./ We are not the ultimate authorities of your actions, and we do not have the power to silence you, but please consider conducting yourself as though many people were staring at you with an intense glare of disapproval.
