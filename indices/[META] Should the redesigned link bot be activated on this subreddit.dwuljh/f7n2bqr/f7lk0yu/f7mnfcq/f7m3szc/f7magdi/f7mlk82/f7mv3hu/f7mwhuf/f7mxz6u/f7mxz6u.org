  Even your own analogy I think it'd be better not to evict the person and just you know just try and handle seeing things you might not want to see for the sake of being nice.

I agree with you (and was in agreement with you at the time that I wrote the post, but I did a poor job of communicating that). I have edited in a pre-script and added an addendum which I hope communicate this more clearly, which is that my post is not an appeal to moderators asking them to ban [[/u/lightwavers]]; rather, it is an appeal to [[/u/lightwavers]] to take a long hard look in the mirror and consider adjusting their behavior.

To continue the analogy, if I had a neighbor who defecated publicly, my first reaction would not be to immediately evict them from the neighborhood. However, I would probably /not/ engage them with a friendly tap on the shoulder (as one might when responding to an early morning leafblower, or garbage left out on the curb for too long), and I might enlist the help of some other neighbors before confronting them, partly because I think numbers might be necessary to communicate "No, really, that behavior is /really frowned upon/ here," and partly because in my personal experience, street-defecators do not respond well to polite taps on the shoulder. What I'm attempting to do here with my post is one step up from "polite tap on the shoulder" ([[/u/lightwavers]] has already gotten plenty of those across many other threads), but it was not my intent to escalate immediately from "polite tap on the shoulder" to "run them out of town."

  Besides which, this isn't a debate subreddit, people are free to disengage on whoever they want.

Right, and it was not my intent to suggest that [[/u/lightwavers]] be banned for failing to engage with other users. My point was more like, "hey, you seem to be bothered by the lack of good-faith arguments leveled at you, and assume that the lack of good-faith arguments accompanying the vote tally must be evidence of some vote tampering (see [[/u/lightwavers]]' first edit). In light of that, perhaps I should explain to you /why/ people might not be willing to engage you in good faith, given your history on this subreddit."
