  First, just as a general request, when you use quotation marks, can you please actually be quoting what a person said (or, at least, indicate that you're paraphrasing)?
#+end_quote

Good point, I have edited this portion of the post. (I tend to use reddit's >block quotes when quoting something someone directly said in order to respond to it, but I can definitely see how my use of quotation marks could mislead people about the actual content of the post.)

#+begin_quote
  your rationale is (I'm paraphrasing here): "he can't get away with saying 'he can't get away with this, not in this neighborhood,' not in this neighbourhood!"
#+end_quote

I wasn't suggesting that he be ousted from the community; my "neighborhood analogy" was less about identifying neighbors who need to be ousted, and more about identifying neighbors who might not respond positively if you walked up to them and said, "Uh, could you not?" Or more specifically, it was not my way of justifying, "This is why I want you banned," it was more a way of expressing, "Hey, it looks like there's way more people willing to cast a ballot than are willing to explain to you down in the comments why they disapprove. Here's a reason why that might be!" (This was partly spurned on by an edit to the original post that communicated something to the effective of, 'hey looks like there's a lot of votes saying I should be banned, so could you please stop spoofing votes to make this result show up.'

I realize that my remarks may have been unclear, so [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dwuljh/meta_should_the_redesigned_link_bot_be_activated/f7mv3hu/][I have made a follow-up post]] clarifying my position (added as a separate post since it doesn't fit under the character limit of the original post).
