Doesn't seem to warrant a user ban, we're a rational subreddit not a neighbourhood worried about immigrants who don't follow the culture norms.

Even your own analogy I think it'd be better not to evict the person and just you know just try and handle seeing things you might not want to see for the sake of being nice.

If the reason you want to ban him is because he won't engage with people who he thinks are Nazis then you probably have an enormously wide net to cast.

Besides which, this isn't a debate subreddit, people are free to disengage on whoever they want.
