While I mostly agree with everything that you (and most other people here) have said, I also agree with [[/u/Nimelennar]] and [[/u/gryfft]].

I know I was the first person to explicitly say [[/u/Lightwavers]] should probably be banned from this subreddit (technically [[/u/traverseda]] said "maybe... separate the bot from your personal account so we can ban/block one or the other" a few hours earlier, but that isn't explicitly calling for a ban), but I said that with the intention of trying to scare some sense into him/her/them. The reaction I hoped for was something like "oh, there's a rule implying that bots get banned from this subreddit, whoops, I probably shouldn't've turned my account into a bot, maybe I made a mistake." I was not impressed with their reacting with the sentiment that /obviously/ they were /entitled/ to create the bot and that the bot was the new default, and I still don't like Lightwavers as a person, but I really don't think they should actually be banned.

But seriously, [[/u/Lightwavers]]. "Unless you're obviously a bot, spammer, or troll we will start by talking, not removing posts or handing out bans." That rule implies that bots get banned. And you turned your account into a bot. You dingbat.

[[/u/PeridexisErrant]], [[/u/alexanderwales]], [[/u/eliezeryudkowsky]], if [[/u/Lightwavers]] asks you to ban them, please just tell them to not be an idiot in the future and don't actually ban them.
