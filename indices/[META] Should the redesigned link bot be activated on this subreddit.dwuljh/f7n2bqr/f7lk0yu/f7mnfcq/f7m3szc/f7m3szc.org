/A/ link bot could be activated on this subreddit, provided that:

- the bot should have a separate account of its own

  - this account should have nothing on it except a comment history of PSA story links --- /maybe/ also some announcement comments on update logs and techsupport communication. It should not have moderator positions on any subreddits, should not be factually advertising through its profile page any user's reddit activity, their subreddits, their opinions, their culture warfare activity, etc.
  - this subreddit's wiki should have an added rule for story pages (if it doesn't already) that forbids adding anything that is not a neutrally written description of the story. If story tagging on the wiki is allowed, for the tags themselves there should be some mechanism to vote out / petition to remove non-neutral or politically / culturally / morally biased tags. It's better to not have any information at all, than to risk getting hijacked / overwhelmed by any kind of agenda / culture warfare down the line.

- the bot comments should optionally include only the following and nothing more: the stories' hosting pages, backup mirrors and text files, link to an infopage about the bot itself, scrapped synopsis info from the hosting website. No wiki page links (at least for the time being), no extra reviews, no ratings, no tags (except maybe technical ones, like "Completed", "WiP", etc). One rather good example for this is [[https://github.com/tusing/reddit-ffn-bot/wiki/Usage][/u/FanfictionBot]].

Subreddit-scale automated addition of subjective qualifiers, over and over, would encourage groupthink; while the same addition of links to the same review comments would encourage stagnation and opinion calcification.
