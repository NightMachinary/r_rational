Great, except you used dandwiki. Friends don't let friends use dandwiki, home of badly labeled houserules with no clear warning and no quality control. Use d20srd instead. [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/message.htm]] [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/sending.htm]]

Message is a little low range though. However, there are some great long distance communications options, and ways to make cell phones in 3.5e D&D. My favorite is the spell Whispering Sand in the book Sandstorm. I especially like using it on Shapesand, also in Sandstorm, to make an Omnitool.
