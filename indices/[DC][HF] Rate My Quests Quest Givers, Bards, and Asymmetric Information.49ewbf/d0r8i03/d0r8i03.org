*tl;dr:*\\
- /Premise:/ Most adventurers get quests from questgivers, because questgivers are guaranteed to provide good rewards, while killing random monsters in the countryside is not.\\
- /Problem:/ Not all questgivers are honest with adventurers who approach them. Some questgivers are being paid by third parties to send adventurers to their dooms.\\
- /Solution:/ Set up a Bard College to gather ratings for questgivers, via surveys. An adventuring bard can use [[http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Sending][a quick Sending spell]] to request the ratings of a questgiver, and use those ratings to decide whether or not his party should accept a quest from that person.
