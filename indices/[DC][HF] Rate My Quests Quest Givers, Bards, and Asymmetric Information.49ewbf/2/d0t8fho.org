A small problem with this: /Sending/ is a 4th level /spell/ for Clerics and 5th for arcane casters, meaning you actually have to be PC level 7 or 9 to be able to do those Spells--which counts as mid-level. Additionally, /Sending/ cannot be learned by Bards.

Otherwise, seems like a great idea. One might even homebrew Sending to be a lower-level Bard spell to support it.
