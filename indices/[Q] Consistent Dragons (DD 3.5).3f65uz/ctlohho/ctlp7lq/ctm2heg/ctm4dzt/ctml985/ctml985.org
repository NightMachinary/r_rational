Yep you're right. Nice thing about SI is that all results are also in SI so that's 723MJ or 19.5 *kg* of fat. From a pure energy approach it's certainly possible. You may have more issues with the structural strength but they could have biological Carbon fibre bones/wing membranes or be reinforced with magic.

Keep in mind that 7.6m/s is kinda slow for a dragon. 75ft base speed. Multiply everything by 2.67 for 200ft speed and 5.33 if they're "running". (Assuming DnD is close enough to Pathfinder that my calcs make sense.) So after a fight they're going to be quite hungry.

They'll also burn a lot climbing for example E=mgh or 27MJ for 1000ft (low for a light plane, below most clouds). We can approcimate and say about 1kg of fat per 1000ft climbed.
