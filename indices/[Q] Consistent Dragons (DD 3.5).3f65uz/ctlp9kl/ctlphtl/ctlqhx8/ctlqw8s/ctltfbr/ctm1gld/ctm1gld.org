The way it works is that one liter of displaced air can lift 1.28 grams by buoyancy. That's with complete vacuum, hydrogen is slightly less efficient due to the weight of the gas. For example, the Goodyear blimp weighs right around 12k pounds. It needs 200k cubic feet of envelope to have lifting ability.
