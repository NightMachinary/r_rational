If you want to estimate the power required for flight, consider that most planes have a glide ratio of about 10:1 (gliders can go much higher, 50:1 or more). So with no power our dragon will descend 1m for every 10m forward. Power is P=Fv and the force of gravity is F=mg, so the power required to fly level is P=mgv/10 where m is mass, g is gravity (10m/s/s at ground level on Earth) and v is the maximum level flight speed of the dragon. (This is all ignoring magic)

Once you have your power, you can work out how much the dragon needs to eat by multiplying the Power by the seconds spent flying per day and dividing by the energy density of their food.

Of course if dragons are mostly gliders this changes, now, so long as the air rises at or above 1/10 the minimum flight speed of our dragon it will fly. (100ft/min is usually available during the day up to 500 or 1000ft/min depending on weather. On Earth) You can make the number smaller to match bird or man-made gliders (1/20-1/50) but that limits you to a glider-type shape, long thin wings, very aerodynamic body. BTW minimum flight speed is roughly related to wing loading (weight/wing area)
