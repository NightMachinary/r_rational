Thanks for the math. I wouldn't know where to find that information.

Useful calculation. So since g is 9.8m/s/s (round to 10), the flight speed is 7.6 m/s (sustained level flight), and the mass is supposed to be 9000 kg. (That last number might be changing.) That gives a power of 67 032. Assuming that an adult dragon flies for about 3 hours per day, that is 723 945 600. I am not sure of the units this has? Is it Joules? If so, then the dragon needs to eat 19.5 meters square of fat per day. (Thankfully, the dragon does not need to eat food for energy.)
