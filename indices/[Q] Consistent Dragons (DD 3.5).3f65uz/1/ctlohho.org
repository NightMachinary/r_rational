Not a biologist, but ...

The largest flying animals were the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterosaur_size][pterosaurs]]. At 500 lbs, that puts them at roughly the size of juvenile to young, depending on species. Given that pterosaurs definitely could fly, we're in the range of plausibility for Medium-sized dragons. The problems start to arise when we increase their size; the square-cube law says that as we double the size of a dragon, we square the area of it and cube the weight.

Here's a simplified chart (taken from the page for black dragons):

| Size       | Wingspan | Weight      |
|------------+----------+-------------|
| Tiny       | 8 ft.    | 5 lb.       |
| Small      | 16 ft.   | 40 lb.      |
| Medium     | 24 ft.   | 320 lb.     |
| Large      | 36 ft.   | 2,500 lb.   |
| Huge       | 60 ft.   | 20,000 lb.  |
| Gargantuan | 80 ft.   | 160,000 lb. |

Note the problem here? Weight is increasing /really, really fast/, as we'd expect from the square-cube law. Each size category is effectively doubling size, quadrupling area, and octopuling weight. The problem here is that the surface area of the wing is being outstripped by the weight in a major way; we would not expect a scaled up dragon (pun not intended) to be able to support its own weight with its wings. We /really/ shouldn't expect them to get more maneuverable or faster. Going from Huge to Gargantuan increases the wing area by ~70% (assuming invariant wing shape), but weight increases by ~800%.

You can fudge some of the numbers with non-magical materials that are equivalent to the best that humans could ever make, but you /really/ need to work on the weight problem; dragons should be as light as possible. Their fuel source obviously can't be meat either, though that's already canon.

(It should be possible to work backward to work out how much power a gargantuan dragon needs to put into its wings in order to take flight.)
