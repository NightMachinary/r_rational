We've discovered a species called /Argentavis magnificens/, which, when alive, had a wingspan of 7m and weighed about 72kg (estimated). The reconstructions I've seen suggest it's got a total wing area of 3.5 square meters. Naively scaling that up, our dragon has a wing surface area closer to 350 square meters. In that case, our dragon can weigh nearly 8,000kg and still soar -- that's almost where we need to be. If we use extant birds, we can get somewhat lower weights, probably around 5,000kg, and that gives us a known cruising speed -- around 10m/s.

Not quite the numbers you want, but within spitting distance, and things that fly tend to be lighter than you might expect.
