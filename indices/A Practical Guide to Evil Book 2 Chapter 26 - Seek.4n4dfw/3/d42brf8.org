Ok, it's definitely just because the "Seeking Mr. Eaten's Name" content in Fallen London recently returned, but SEEK is freaking me out and exciting me at the same time. ALL WILL BE WELL.

Also, I think I'm getting overly paranoid because I've convinced myself that Kilian is going to get firefly'ed and end up dying horribly. No reason to think that way, but just a feeling.
