(Reading through the chapters now, one by one. Just having finished Book 1 Chapter 12, I smiled a lot at that [[#s][]]. This can give me better perspective on seemingly-irrational villain behaviour in other fictions, including sympathising with perspectives I would have disagreed with, making up reasons for why a bad decision could make sense with background context, or in my own writing.)

...Hmm, a certain perspective in one of the F.E.A.R. games now feels a lot less reprehensible to me. 'Bet everything on a single sliver of hope, even if the world burns if failing'... well, it still requires incredible self-centredness.
