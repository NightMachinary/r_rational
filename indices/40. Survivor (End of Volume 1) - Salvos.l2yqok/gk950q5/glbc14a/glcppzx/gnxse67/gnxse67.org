  But if talent is just purely the physical advantages you're born with, why is Floyd Mayweather considered one of the best boxers of all time with glass hands and no special physical advantage over other boxers? Why is Michael Jordan, who is far shorter than Shaq and most other basketballers, considered the best ever?

Whatever the specific reasons for those people's superiority might be, you have to take into account that there are probably more non-visible physical traits going on than there are visible ones. Red blood cell count, for example, varies between people and is heritable (like height).
