Fashion might change more slowly in a more rational world. Following the latest trends isn't a good way to express your personal sense of style and people would be less likely to make that mistake. And jewelry is probably a more efficient way to show off wealth if that's your goal.

(But if people express themselves by going through all of styles instead of the latest ones, you'd expect fashion to be more varied and well.)
