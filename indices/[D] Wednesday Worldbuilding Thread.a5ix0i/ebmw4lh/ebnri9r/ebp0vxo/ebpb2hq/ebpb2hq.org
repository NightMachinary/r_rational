Improved fitness would contribute to less incentive to missize clothing but it won't on its own hit the core of the issue IMO.

​

In my experience the people who's purchasing decisions are impacted most by the size label are relatively fit (or anorexic), juts not the super-stimulus-magazine-model level of skinny that media conditions us to think is the optimal body shape. Someone who's a size 12 probably isn't fishing for the odd garment here or there that's a size 12 but is labeled a size 10, somone who's between a size 4 and a size 6 and was legitimately a size 4 in high school might spend a lot of effort finding clothing that should be a size 6 but is labeled size 4 to maintain that self image as "I wear a size 4" (and in extreme cases conclude that since the "size 4" clothes are a little big, maybe they should be looking for a size 2). That minority is small but buys enough clothing and has enough brand loyalty based on the oddball size chart that marketing teams have made an effort to target them specifically from time to time.

​

In a more rational world I'd expect that whole ball of crazy to fall appart in multiple directions. And the benefits of standardized accurate measurements (easier online ordering, easier gift buying, etc.) to be far more reaching.
