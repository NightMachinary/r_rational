Some ideas for magic items:

- The Ring of Invisibility. Made as a test of an invisibility spell; on saying the command word, this ring turns invisible. (Note, the person wearing the ring remains visible - only the ring turns invisible).

- The weather predictor: Measures the air currents, humidity, and other such factors, and then gives an extremely accurate weather prediction describing the weather that will be observed at a particular Elven city over the next three days. It would be more helpful if you /which/ Elven city or where it had been.

- The Universal Remote - A long stick covered in a variety of rings and buttons. In theory, by pointing it at another artifact and twiddling the right rings/pressing the right buttons, that artifact can be started/stopped/rewound/reset/adjusted etc. However, all the writing has worn off the buttons and rings, there is no manual, and you can't seem to figure out how to get it to display the Help page. Can on occasion be made to display some text in an obscure and ancient dialect which presumably says something about the artifact it's pointed at.

- Ring of Seawater. One of a pair of teleportation gates, fortunately turned off when discovered. The function is simple - anything that enters one gate exits the other, and vice versa. Unfortunately, in this case, the 'other' is at the bottom of the ocean; activating the gate causes high-pressure streams of seawater to explode from the device in both directions, doing significant damage to anything in the vicinity until it is turned off again. If the other gate can somehow be retrieved, this could be a lot more useful (but that's a lot of ocean to search).

- Temporal Skipper - anything shot by this rifle instantly vanishes, only to reappear in the exact same spot two rounds later, having skipped forwards through time. The rifle takes five rounds to recharge. Can be used to bypass most locked doors, as long as you're quick about going through it.
