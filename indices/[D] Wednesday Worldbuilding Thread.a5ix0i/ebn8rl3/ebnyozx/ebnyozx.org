Sounds like a really cool campaign! I suppose a number of artifacts may be based off being factories for things that normally can't be produced like that. Then they malfunction... and stuff gets weird. A few examples:

- A hollowed out cuboid with runes imprinted artistically along the inside. When enough matter is shoved inside, and the cuboid sealed, the runes activate. The output is an extremely loyal pseudo-golem animated by magic into the rough shape of the input materials. Malformed examples are in constant pain, but are none-the-less loyal to the first person they sense. They follow orders like a well-trained guard dog might, and treat their owners like a friendly dog. Depending on the state of disrepair, a number of functions of the factory or the product may be affected, such as language recognition or loyalty.

- A small pen with several buttons on it, with pictograms depicting little stick figures performing actions on each one. When a button is pressed, the pen will grow legs and ink a runic pattern on the nearest inorganic surface. If the completed rune is worn as jewelry or subdermally, it will impart the skill depicted in the pictogram to its wearer. This could be as specific as cooking a certain meal, or as broad as swordfighting. However, damaged, ill-made, or weathered runes do not simply stop working, but instead just damage the skill they impart. A 'running' rune could make you have the muscle memory to make you twist your right ankle whenever it activates. The pen has only limited ink, and the ink is of a special make (and finding more could be a nice reward).

- A small dog-like creature made of ceramic meant to act as a personal fabricator. In the absence of a cloud of designs to choose from, each only has a few designs programmed in. They have the temperament of a subdued house-cat, but will follow those they imprint on until death (as no-one knows the phrase the elves used to tell them to stop). When instructed by whoever they have imprinted on, and if they have the appropriate materials and blueprints, they will fashion a desired creation, be it a statuette, a tool, or ammunition (subject to previous clauses, of course). They are excellent at following instructions to the letter, and will stop working if told, but otherwise hold no issue with dismantling a sleeping body piece by piece to make a pair of dice.
