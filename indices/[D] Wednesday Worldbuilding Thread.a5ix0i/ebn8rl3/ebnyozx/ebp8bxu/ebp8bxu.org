Thanks, cool ideas! Can you elaborate on the FabriCat, specifically "dismantling a sleeping body"? I imagine it would need roughly the material you're trying to craft with, right? Give it a stack of cordwood, get a ladder in 20 minutes, give it some chunks of granite, get a stone bowl or a tiny iron toothpick.
