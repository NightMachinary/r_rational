I don't know that fashion and rationality are at all linked. In DoubleRat world women's clothing probably has more pockets and all clothing is probably designed to last longer, but beyond that I don't see why the ridiculous stuff you see on haute couture runways wouldn't be around--rational people still have aesthetic preferences, and fashion design is a form of art. I don't think people would do less art if they were more rational.
