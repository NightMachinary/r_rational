It really depends on how much of human fashions actually depend on people being actively irrational. The reason that women's clothing doesn't have pockets is that pockets tend to alter the lines of the clothing, which in turn makes them less attractive, and it might be that a rational actor, faced with a choice between looking pretty and having pockets, will just settle on a purse, especially if one is socially acceptable.

You can model fashion as a large number of agents engaged in minmaxing. In that context, what's the stupidest fashion that currently exists? How are we defining "stupid"? Things whose primary function is social/aesthetic rather than based on utility?
