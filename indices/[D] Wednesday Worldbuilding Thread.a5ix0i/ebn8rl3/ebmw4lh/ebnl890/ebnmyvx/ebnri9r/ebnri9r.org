I think the primary impact would be that there'd be less distinction between men's and women's fashion (in both directions) as most of the traditional differences are completely arbitrary and it'd be pretty irrational to not try to expand your customer base by marketing any given style to both sexes if you thought most people wouldn't just reject the idea because of tradition , and standard sizes would more closely match actual measurements rather than the tendency (particularly in women's fashion) to use smaller numbers to make customers feel better about the size they need to buy for it to fit.
