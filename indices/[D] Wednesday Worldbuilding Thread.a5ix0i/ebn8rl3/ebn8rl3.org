Hi all! I'm running a D&D campaign for some friends that I've been in some stage of planning for nearly a decade now. It's so amazing to get my world out into the, well, world, and I want to make sure my players are as immersed as possible! Thought I'd come to the smart folks of [[/r/rational]] for advice, because a hive mind is better than a singleton.

Doc, Throgg, Imsh: if you see this, read no further.

The campaign takes place ~200 years after a world-shattering cataclysm that broke the planet's megacontinent into five pieces and drained magic from the world. The Elves, who had ruled the other races for millennia, walled themselves inside the scraps of forest left to them, and the other races have been building a new society in the centuries since. At the time of the campaign, the world's magic-producing systems are just coming back online, and some individuals are demonstrating divine or arcane ability, including the party's cleric who has so far had to hide his magic from prying eyes.

The party is going to have to deal with a lot of uncontrolled magical outbursts, as the carefully-constructed ley network built by the elves is no longer maintained and will begin discharging sporadically, turning regular caves and ruins into dangerous dungeons. The other side effect of this is that all the magic items used by the elven empire, many of which are still buried, hidden, or mislaid around the world, are beginning to function again--stronger and stronger as magic builds up in the world's circulatory system, but also ancient and unkept. In the first session the party obtained a mysterious crystal that they just now (session 8) discovered is an ancient elven map. They do not yet know that it is a map of the local ley network, and will guide them to concentrations of ley energy where they can find dungeons & monsters & loot. I intend to have several groups competing with the party to find the ley nodes and shut them down/steal the loot from within, including one funded by the magic-obsessed King Ellis and one made up of the employees of a black-market trading operation who just want to make a buck.

Based on this premise, any suggestions for malfunctioning magic items, strange transformations of significant places, or half-formed ancient horrors trying to drag themselves out of the place-between-places are welcome. I also expect the party to eventually try and break into the elves' walled country, so I'd also appreciate ideas about the living conditions of a race that had previously relied on magic for absolutely everything. (Hint: they're not so lovely & noble-looking anymore.)
