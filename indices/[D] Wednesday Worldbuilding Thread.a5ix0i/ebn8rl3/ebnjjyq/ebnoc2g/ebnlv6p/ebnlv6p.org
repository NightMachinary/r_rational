Awesome ideas, thanks. I have an elven manor planned where a clay jar sits high on a kitchen shelf, next to a note reading "Young Master Barbican is not to eat marzipan fairies until he has finished his dinner." Ropey may also make an appearance as a Rope of Climbing that gets smarter and smarter as his life force trickles back to him.
