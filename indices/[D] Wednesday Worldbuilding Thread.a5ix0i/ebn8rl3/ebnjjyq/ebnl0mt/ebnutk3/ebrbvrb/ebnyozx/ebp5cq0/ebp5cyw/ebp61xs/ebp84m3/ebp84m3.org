But do you feel the same way looking at Gimli as you do looking at [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW3_Ft1t0mY][this monstrosity]]? I think the uncanny valley is when something appears superficially human, but doesn't meet our criteria for realism. i.e. there may be some evolutionarily-induced tribalism making you less likely to trust someone of a different species, but I don't think revulsion applies.

However, all of their cosmetic, illusion, and gene magic has failed, so they will look significantly uglier than legend implies.
