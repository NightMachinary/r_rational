The sleeping body thing was essentially saying that, when trying to find the desired materials, the FabriCat doesn't care about sources. So, if you say "FabriCat, could you make me a sword?", it will check its blueprints. If there is a blueprint for a sword, it will make it from the closest/easiest to acquire materials. If the closest suitable material source is a sleeping body, then it will happily start dismantling the sleeper's rib cage to begin construction. If there is no blueprint or available materials, it will give some sort of adorable 'no, I can't do that right now :(' reaction. Of course, it's up to the owner to find out what blueprints their specific FabriCat had downloaded.
