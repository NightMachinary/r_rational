  Mori's original hypothesis states that as the appearance of a robot is made more human, some observers' emotional response to the robot becomes increasingly positive and empathetic, until it reaches a point beyond which the response quickly becomes *strong revulsion*. However, as the robot's appearance continues to become less distinguishable from a human being, the emotional response becomes positive once again and approaches human-to-human empathy levels.

From what I've read it's our evolutionary mechanism to protect our ancestors from getting close to sick people and corpses.

It also means we feel strong revulsion to things that are almost human but not quite, i.e different human species.. Therefore it's safe to assume humans, elves, dwarves and the like are unlikely to coexist peacefully.
