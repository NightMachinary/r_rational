Also, there is the magic that still works exactly as the immortal designers intended, because when you live forever, sometimes you just want to build a lasting solution.

The High Path. This was the main long range transportation system between cities. A series of indestructible parallel obelisks, with the destination written on them, and when you walk down the path so marked, you find yourself on a forested path. Walk the path, and 2d6 hours later, you arrive at your destination, hundreds of miles away. (leave the path, never be seen again. That is how it always worked) Of course, the city which just became your next door neighbour is no longer part of a world spanning empire, but is currently held by the Naga. Fairly /civilized/ Naga, but that just means that they wont murder everyone out of hand when they march their army through. Just the army and the current rulers.

The local government would like you to try and bribe, charm or dazzle the snake ladies out of this plan.

The Exarch Golems of Justice. The city of Exarch was /the/ center for inter-racial, inter planar, and intercontinental trade. This worked in large part because of the Code of Exarch, and the Awakened Golems that enforced it. It is still a city of trade, but over the centuries, the Code of Exarch has been very creatively translated, amended, and selectively enforced. The golems are back, and they are enforcing the original Code of Exarch with great vigor. All the slavers messily died on the first day, and the golems are yeeting people over the city wall and into the river at a brisk pace, which is merciful.. for those who can swim.

The city council would really, really like you to find an accurate, unedited, well translated version of the code of Exarch. Today, if possible, but definitely before tax season. The penalties for incorrectly assessing or cheating on taxes are the stuff of legend.

The Bonds Of Consensual Body Swapping were crafted by an Arch mage with a transgender daughter. They also saw a lot of recreational use, since they recharge 3 times a day. When they started working again, there were an entire pilgrimage of people who wished to swap out of the body they were born in, and a bureacracy sprang up to match people, and take care of the paperwork, and ensure nobody uses this to escape their crimes ect, ect.

Only, now someone has stolen them from the temple. This, is obviously really, really bad, because consensual in this context accepts "Someone is holding a crossbow to my head". Find them. Try to find out who they have been used on.
