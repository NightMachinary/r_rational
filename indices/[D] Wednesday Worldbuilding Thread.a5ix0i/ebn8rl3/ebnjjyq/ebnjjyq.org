Interesting concept. Some quick ideas, a few of them pilfered from old campaigns:

- There was once a city that made extensive use of extradimensional spaces and corridors in order to make everything sit closer to everything else, as well as to put a buffer of space around it. After the End of Magic, the city lay in ruins, but it was too close to important waterways/resources to lay empty for long, so it was rebuilt. Now, as the magic is coming back, the old extradimensional anchors are becoming active once more, creating expanded spaces where there were none before and smearing the city out over the fourth spatial dimension.
- A huge, terrifying, and immortal creature was once placed in chains by the elves, who perpetually harvested it for its blood, bones, skin, and meat. When the End of Magic came, the creature finally, unceremoniously died, and the town that had thrived off its products was abandoned. Now, the magic is back, and the creature lives once more, with only two of the eight chains that held it in place still functional. If it gets loose, there's no one that can stop it.
- One of the elven nobility had constructed a floating isle, used as an elaborate palace that hosted a continuous, Bacchanalian party. When the End of Magic came, it went crashing to the ground, where it was throughly looted for everything of value (and the magic items were left behind). Now that the magic is back, the isle has risen once more, unsteered and unsteady, drifting its way toward a major population center, and if it fails when a half mile overhead, thousands will die.
- In order to create a mine for some rare and precious metal, someone created a powerful magic item that would repel water out to a mile away, a spherical globe where no water could pass unless it was inside a person. The item was used to anchor a mine that would otherwise have been under one of the continent's thicker rivers, which flowed around the sphere of influence once the magic item was in place. After the End of Magic, the water came rushing back in, drowning the mine and everyone who worked there. Now, the item is working once more, uncovering the mine. Unfortunately, it's also diverted the course of the river, and if that's still the case when the rainy season comes, it's liable to cause severe flooding in a nearby city.
