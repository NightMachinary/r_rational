(I find myself wondering (taking into account the mana-pool-growth through slaughter) "How did she grow her mana pool that big in the first place? Why weren't there lots of others with mana pools bigger than hers, competing with or trying to suppress her, with their own necromantic armies or countermeasures? Especially with that secret method of increasing mana regeneration, why was she the first person to regenerate enough mana to remake the world..?"

(Reading comments below, this can be supplemented with "Was she the only person to try killing lots and lots of sea creatures to raise her power? When people first noticed what she was doing, why didn't those with greater backing (and especially if they knew the regeneration trick) copy her and/or suppress her?".)
