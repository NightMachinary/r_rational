They didn't know if there was an afterlife. Many people believed there was one, and that their souls would go to it after leaving. Roshia stopped caring either way, she wasn't going to let something like depriving people of an eternal afterlife get in her way of keeping her promise.

One thing I didn't make clear in the story is that all living creatures have souls, generally in proportion to their nervous system. Reaching her level as a necromancer was really difficult. She spent a lot of time killing giant ocean creatures rather than fighting on land against much more deadly opponents.
