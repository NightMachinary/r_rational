I understand completely. This is my first time actually submitting something for these weekly writing challenges. I've tried two other times, but I always ended up writing too much and taking too long. This story didn't have as much as I wanted to write about the topic, but my editor(wife) told me to just stop where I was since it was a complete story.

I've always wanted to do a fantasy take on megastructures, because physics is a pretty strict and difficult ruleset to follow. I did a lot of handwavey shit with magic in this story, but I feel more comfortable doing handwavey shit with magic then I do with futuristic materials.

Did you have any thoughts or questions about the megastructure I described?
