I'm glad your thinking deeply about this, honestly I wanted to add in quite a few paragraphs of exposition to explain why she was the first, but it also didn't feel like it was adding much to the story. I wasn't sure anyone would read it deeply enough to make it pay off.

The backstory I was going to add was that there were many different types of mages and magic. Who you were as a person effected how far you could advance in a school of magic. To advance really far in multiple disciplines meant changing who you are as a person. Necromancers came from people who stopped believing in the value of life, which is what happened to the protagonist after her daughter was killed.

But necromancy wasn't her first magical discipline. Her first was a kind of deep ocean magic. Deep ocean magic came from a mixed desire to explore, an inability to be satisfied with what you have, and generally only manifested in long lived species with long time horizons like elves.

She had been part of the group that found the new island by using deep ocean magic. She was tracking ocean currents to find discrepancies.

So she was a unique mix of two different types of magic. Necromancy wasn't too rare to begin with, but they would never get further than one island, because they didn't have any way of travelling across oceans other than by boat, and zombies don't make great sailors. She could use zombie giant fish to just pull boats along.

Catching the fish that powered her necromancy wasn't easy, but it's basically all she did for a millennia. None of the islands would have noticed her, since the planet they were on was 95% ocean and she had plenty of space to operate without attracting attention.

No one else had her options, so no one had a mana pool anywhere close to hers. And when she did start capturing islands she was doing it with a purpose in mind and wasn't trying to let everyone know her methods.

Does that make more sense?
