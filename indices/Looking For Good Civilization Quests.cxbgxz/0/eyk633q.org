[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/paths-of-civilization.36410/][Paths of Civilization]] is a rather long quest that may fit what you're looking for. At the start of the quest you are in control of a small tribe, but every few chapters the story time-skips to the next generation. The players get to choose the major actions of the civilization like which monuments to build, which tribes to attack/make alliances with, which technologies to focus on researching, etc.

That said, it hasn't reached the tech level needed to leave the planet yet, and the author may or may not have dropped it entirely.
