Honestly, the story isn't very engaging. It's full of tropes and cliches, from the protagonist's origin story (destroyed home village), motivation (revenge), the magic school etc. All of the characters are rather 2 dimensional, and don't have any defining traits. The magic isn't well defined, so it feels like powers and effects are being pulled out of nowhere, and the power progression for the the protag seems out of wack.
