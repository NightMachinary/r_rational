Is realism necessary for rationalism? I kinda agree after reading the blurb, but I don't see how a story couldn't be both rational and over the top a little, as long as it's 'over the top'ness is internally-consistent and rationally explained.

Edit: Upon reading some of the story (up to chapter 7) I can say that the series is rational to about the level of ordinary fantasy, it doesn't go as far as most Xianxia into irrationality, but it doesn't especially try to be rational either. I didn't read past chapter 7 mostly because it slots into that 5.5/10 zone that makes me sleepy to read, I don't find it offensive or anything just painfully generic.
