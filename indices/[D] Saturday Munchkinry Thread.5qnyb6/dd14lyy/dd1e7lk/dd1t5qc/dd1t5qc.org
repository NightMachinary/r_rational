  Would a non-sentient civilisation maintaining one sentient AI to deal with outside context problems be possible?
#+end_quote

I think there are limitations that look roughly like the following:

- You need some relatively low capability : sentience ratio. To a purely automated factory a broken conveyor belt may be an outside context problem. ("relatively low" here is obviously still much much higher than 21st century earth)
- You need a relatively large industrial civilization to be able to maintain AI long-term.

So you could last quite some time this way but it would eventually start to break down because all of the bits you couldn't maintain yourself.

  Presumably the trade fleet, since it trades in programs, only travels between stars when too many round trip times between expert and client are needed to make radio communication feasible.

The trade fleet are more or less constantly travelling. They're more like a nomadic culture who support themselves with trade than a merchant culture that trades out of a home port.

What they really trade in is /expertise/ - the trade fleet are more or less uplift merchants. It just happens software is a big part of that.

They also sell cultural artifacts - books, TV, etc. for which the greater bandwidth of a star ship is actually quite useful.
