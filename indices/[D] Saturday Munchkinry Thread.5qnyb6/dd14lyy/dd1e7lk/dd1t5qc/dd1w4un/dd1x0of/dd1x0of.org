  So the postulated civilisation would eventually break down due to maintenance troubles... but the trade fleet is more than capable of the required maintenance

It's an interesting thought, but I don't think it works if the bottleneck is essentially ratio of problems : people.

They could help, but the trade fleet are very reliant on finding or creating local expertise. They're experts mostly in running starships and bootstrapping civilizations - they can't fill in every speciality themselves and are very dependent on regular stops in high tech star systems. They could come in and offer training courses to the local AI, but their ability to actually fix things is not at the level required to properly sustain a civilization.

Also the trade fleet don't like AI so probably wouldn't be up for the deal.
