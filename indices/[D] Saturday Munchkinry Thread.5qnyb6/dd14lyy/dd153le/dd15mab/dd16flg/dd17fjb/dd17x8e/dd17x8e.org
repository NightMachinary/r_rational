The expertise for maintaining an AI may be complicated, but it's not too complicated, and attaching a future SSD solves that.

Basically, even if human level int is the optimal level, it's still more optimal to build a lot of human-level AIs. There is little a human can do better that a human-level AI can't if the AI has access to an interaction bot, the internet, and processing power.

Basically, the problem is still processing speed. Human brains work at chemical impulse speed, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_conduction_velocity][120 m/sec]], computers work at electron speed, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_factor][~275,000,000 m/sec]], basically lightspeed. Humans learn at reading speed at best, AIs learn at bandwidth speed. The problem with nerfing these is that they are fairly fundamental, these numbers are underlying physics. The options would be get rid of AIs altogether and max out at VIs, or encourage use of cyborgs.

*Edit-it has been pointed out to me that my factors given are oversimplifications, thought doesn't work quite like that, however, the speed is still important
