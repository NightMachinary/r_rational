  that code is more easily shared than human to human
#+end_quote

Nope. Any sufficiently sentient intelligence in this setting is a black box which you can't easily cut and paste bits between.

  Programs for any "simple" task work the same for every AI, do no need to teach the entire class about stellar interference patterns (etc) and how to detect them, the analysis program is already available.
#+end_quote

This is true, but largely only to the degree that humans can also benefit from the same - if you can automate it with a simple program then a human can just use that program.

  For "mundane" cyborgs, fast HUD and refined versions of replacement organs that exist today are still improvements, don't count them out entirely.
#+end_quote

I'm not only not counting them out they're a major part of the story. :-)

  The trade fleet (or someone else) actively sabotaging efforts?
#+end_quote

I mean, in a sense this is already part of the plot. The trade fleet are /the/ major organ of continuity of civilization - planetary civilizations tend to collapse, restart at some lower level, then at some point the trade fleet comes along and helps give them a leg up.

I've updated my notes on AI (which I forgot I had). In particular the section [[https://github.com/DRMacIver/programmer-at-large-notes/blob/master/ai.md#why-havent-ai-taken-over-the-galaxy][Why haven't AI taken over the galaxy?]] is new. Thanks for the help refining my thoughts on this.
