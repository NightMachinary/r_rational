Constant factors only get you so far really.

  Humans learn at reading speed at best, AIs learn at bandwidth speed
#+end_quote

This is basically not true for any useful notion of learning, and falls afoul of the rules set out for intelligence at the beginning. An AI can't learn by just dumping intelligence into its brain, because intelligence is hard. It can certainly /read/ a hell of a lot faster than a human, but that doesn't mean its ability to encode that into useful knowledge is faster by the same degree.

  The options would be get rid of AIs altogeather
#+end_quote

I'm thinking of it. AIs are already rare in setting because they tend to accelerate the cycle of collapse and the trade fleet (who are the main propagators of technical knowledge) are extremely wary of them and don't pass on any knowledge about how they work. It might be easier to just drop that and avoid them altogether, but this seems significantly less plausible to me than they just don't work that well.

  and max out at VIs, or encourage use of cyborgs.
#+end_quote

Cyborgs are definitely not available in setting. No neural interfacing.
