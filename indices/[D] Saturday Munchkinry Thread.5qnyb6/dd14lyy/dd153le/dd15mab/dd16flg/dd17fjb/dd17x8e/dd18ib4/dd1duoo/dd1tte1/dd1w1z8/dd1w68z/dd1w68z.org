I like this and may end up using it, thanks.

One note...

#+begin_quote
  while the programmer goes back over his notes and tries to figure out where he went wrong...

AIs are generally grown more than directly programmed. There's a lot of directly programmed software that goes into it, but the starting template is not fully sentient in its own right and has to grow into it. Attempts to push the starting point closer to sentience tend to result in the AI destabilising.

(Hand waving justification: The required architecture for general intelligence is highly parallel and ends up being very sensitive to small details in timing. Trying to load an intelligence that has been grown or designed for one set of timings into a new one tends to result in the AI equivalent of a stroke)
