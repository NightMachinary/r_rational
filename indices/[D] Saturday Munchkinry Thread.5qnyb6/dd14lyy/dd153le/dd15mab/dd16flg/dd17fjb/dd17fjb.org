The AI advantage is not nearly as great as you're positing in this setting, and if it were then I would come up with rules to nerf it. You're welcome to suggest additional rules.

The current rules mean that an AI is a physical object that is not substantially smaller than a human brain and requires a significantly greater industrial base to maintain - an AI doesn't require "a solar panel and a nuclear reactor", it requires machinery, parts and expertise to repair it when it goes wrong.

Additionally it may be supersmart, but it's not /especially/ fast at anything that resembles general intelligence. Nor is it particularly easy to create new ones.

Essentially, AI can be approximated as humans with slightly different constraints and slightly different capabilities.
