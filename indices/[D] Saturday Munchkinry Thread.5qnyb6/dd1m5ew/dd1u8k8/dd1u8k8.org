I have so many questions...

Most important question: To what degree can I interrogate the genie about its capabilities?

Assuming that is large...

What are the rules on use of connectives? Is there any reason I can't just say "I wish for you to destroy all bedbugs and (whatever other wish maximizes my gain)?". What if the two are logically connected? (Destroy all bedbugs and grant me one extra wish per bedbug you destroy).

What are the limitations on the genie's predictive capabilities? Can the genie simulate a copy of me? Can I wish to kill all creatures in the solar system that after receiving answers to any set of questions about them I wanted to ask I would choose to end the life of?

What is the timescale on which the wish operates? If I wished for omnipotence but precommitted to destroying all bedbugs as soon as I acquired it, would that satisfy the conditions of the wish? What if I baked that precommitment into the wish?
