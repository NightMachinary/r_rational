  That said, I probably would have phrased the wish such that it specified informing people what the likely consequences of eliminating each species would be (as some that may be harmful to humanity may play an important role in their ecosystems, indirectly being very useful to us), projected out to 5, 50, and 500 years (or even longer, but it might become hard for people to relate to the world >500 years in the future).

This is an improvement, but it still leaves open the possibility that destroying harmful species A is fairly harmless on its own, destroying harmful species B is fairly harmless on its own, but destroying both A and B together leads to some sort of ecological disaster. (To avoid this, I'd suggest deciding on each species after eliminating or retaining the previous species; so first species A is eliminated and then the consequences for eliminating species B are considered and the ecological disaster therefore predicted).
