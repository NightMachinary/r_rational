  Ones where destroying A or B individually is harmful but A and B is beneficial would never be asked (though I don't know whether they would even exist)

...I don't know if such situations exist, but I can imagine a narrative for one.

Imagine species A, B and C where A and B are harmful, C is beneficial mainly because it eats A and B, but C requires nutrients from both A and B to be healthy.

Removing harmful species A results in C suffering some sort of nutritional deficiency and dying out. This results in population explosion of B, and ecological disaster.

Similarly, removing B results in C dying out and thus population explosion of A.

Removing C alone is right out (population explosion of A /and/ B). Yet removing all three means that neither A nor B experiences that dangerous population explosion.

And yes, this method is going to give you a local optimum, not a global optimum; but I'm happy with a slight improvement and a strong prevention of disaster, myself.
