"I wish for the effects written down on this piece of paper." (Where the piece of paper includes a list of effects including both destroying bedbugs and making you rich).

Alternately, "I wish for the following two things to come true: the destruction of all bedbugs, and X" (where X is basically a standard wish for good stuff for yourself). You should word the wish to specify "the following two things" so the genie can't decide that the sentence ends after the part about the bedbugs.

Note that it is very difficult to just change the scenario to "you can only make a wish that doesn't ask for two separate things," since "things" isn't a concept that divides reality at the seams.
