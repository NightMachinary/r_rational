I'm assuming you're referring to the classic "Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide" thing.

The wish as stated required the advantages to be detailed as well as the disadvantages. Given how vital it is, it would be very hard to downplay the advantages of water without intentionally omitting or falsifying the information, though it may be less clear cut for some species.

If the genie is able to violate the wish to make people think water (or humanity) is a net negative, then literally no possible wish is safe. The correct answer to "How do you phrase your wish?" would be "By launching the genie's lamp into an escape trajectory from the solar system."

That said, I probably would have phrased the wish such that it specified informing people what the likely consequences of eliminating each species would be (as some that may be harmful to humanity may play an important role in their ecosystems, indirectly being very useful to us), projected out to 5, 50, and 500 years (or even longer, but it might become hard for people to relate to the world >500 years in the future).
