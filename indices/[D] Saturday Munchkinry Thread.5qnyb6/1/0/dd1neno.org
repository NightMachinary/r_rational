How about "exterminate all species that the majority of humanity would agree to want to exterminate if asked after receiving information on how much that species helps and harms humanity". That would get rid of bed bugs, mosquitoes, malaria, west nile, dengue, yellow fever, zika, human-infecting parasites in general, species that infect our domesticated animals and crops, weeds, pathogenic bacteria and viruses in general, and unwanted species in general.
