Based on Heroes Save the World, one of my current favorite ratfics:

You have the ability to make coins disappear by touching them. You're not sure where they go, but they're irretrievable. Doing so does not release a coin's worth of energy (at least anywhere you know of). It also doesn't burn any more calories than touching any other object.

There's no canonical basis for this, but let's assume that you can vanish a coin by touching it with any exposed skin, not just your fingertips.

What do you do?

EDIT: You have to consciously will the coin to vanish while you touch it.
