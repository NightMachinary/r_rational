For Learning, I'm not disagreeing, but if one AI learns how to do something, that code is more easily shared than human to human. Programs for any "simple" task work the same for every AI, do no need to teach the entire class about stellar interference patterns (etc) and how to detect them, the analysis program is already available.

Similarly not disagreeing that the speeds effects are less than magnitudal, but it still results in outperformance.

For "mundane" cyborgs, fast HUD and refined versions of replacement organs that exist today are still improvements, don't count them out entirely.

As of how to get rid of AI, galactic doomsday pact to not mess with them? The trade fleet (or someone else) actively sabotaging efforts? I don't know, but generally "The Conspiracy" can be an option.
