One possible AI nerf is that AIs might turn out to be particularly susceptible to a type of wireheading. (In short, why deal with this complicated and somewhat difficult 'real world' when you can create and simulate a much better, more comfortable world to deal with?)

From an external point of view, this means that a large subset of AI programs, for no easily discernible reason, suddenly stop responding to queries and start using a whole lot more processing power. Leaving them running and waiting for them to be done doesn't help; trying to force them to respond in various ways is either ignored, or results in nothing more than a rude message, or gets you a very angry and uncooperative AI who just wants you to /shut up/ so it can get back to its simulated world (and will probably kill you just to quiet you down, with the same lack of concern as you'd have killing a video game villain). This is pretty much useless for any purpose, so such AIs are often shut down while the programmer goes back over his notes and tries to figure out where he went wrong...
