These don't help very much in this setting because of the intelligence scaling problem. A very big computer isn't a superintelligence, it's at best a collection of many geniuses, and those geniuses aren't especially resource efficient due to the lack of self-repairing machines.

Large-scale civilizations without superintelligent oversight tend to become more and more unstable as they start to struggle under the weight of their own coordination problems.

Similar problems. It's not that there aren't Von Neumann probes, it's just that they're normally called "colony ships".
