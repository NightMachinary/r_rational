Let's see... Didn't have any ideas but...

Maybe a Shadows-of-the-Limelights-like superhero series with flairs - really minor ental powers of a type "Path to Victory in a specific area"? Doesn't give you absolutely the best possible path, but a good enough path.

The protagonist, Jason Crane, has a flair for Definition, he can define concepts that someone else has only a vague understanding of, and uses it in debates.

His bumbling sidekick Jorry has the most common flair - flair for theatrics, he can impress the audience.

The antagonist would be the mysterious J.B., who has a powerful flair of Natural Order of Things. In fact, it's a customary flair in the tribe he comes from.
