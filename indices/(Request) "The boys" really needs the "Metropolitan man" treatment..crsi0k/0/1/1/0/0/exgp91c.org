Oh, you're right, that started off with Butcher hitting him with the car. Yeah, they could have run for it at that point. Before or after, no -- Translucent was always between at least one of them and the door, if not both of them. If they did try to run (as opposed to drive), he's a full-time superhero so I'm going to assume he's got better cardio than either of them and could easily run them down in a foot chase. But yeah, there was a segment of time where they could have piled in the car and booked it.
