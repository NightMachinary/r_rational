What mistakes in particular? The only one I can think of offhand was not doing a better job disposing of Translucent's skin. Aside from that, everything seemed pretty believable. Sure, doing an audit of all the newly-installed RF shielding after someone fires a bullet would be a good plan, but I personally would not have thought of it and the characters were under a lot more stress than I was.
