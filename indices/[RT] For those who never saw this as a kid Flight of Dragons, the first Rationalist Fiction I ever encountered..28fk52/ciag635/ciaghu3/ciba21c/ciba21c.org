  The whole movie is pretty great, if you're okay with occasional cheesiness.

Cheesiness. /Cheesiness./ I just witnessed a bespectacled guy in a tunic vaporize the living embodiment of an entire world's superstition and evil by /reciting highschool-level physics and the names of scientific fields./

Across the vast gulfs of space and probability, you will find an unassuming little yellow-white planet called Dairia. There, among the swaying fields of string-cheese reeds and flowing runny camembert rivers, you will come across Mount Curd, the tallest peak on all of Dairia. Deep within its blue-cheese-veined bowels, past the deadly pools of molten gouda, past the hideous Casu Marzu Beast made by the necromancer Brie in the ancient First Age of Curdling, you will find the Dread and Terrible Wax Throne of The Dark Lord Cheddar.

Sometimes, late at night, he will whisper /fearfully/ of the cheesiness in the scene you just showed me, and he will shed a single tear of pure lactose.

/I. Love. It./
