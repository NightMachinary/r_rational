Someone needs to write "Rules for Actual Despots" to get some best-practices going. Most of these only really make sense if you know you're an Evil Overlord in a specific genre.

For example, there are plenty of reasons to torture someone in my inner sanctum instead of an anonymous hotel room miles outside my borders. My inner sanctum is logically the most well-defended place in my kingdom, while an anonymous hotel room is merely security through obscurity.

And yeah, most of the time there probably /is/ just one thing I want to know before I kill someone. The words don't have any mystical powers, unless I'm within a piece of genre fiction. If I knew I was in a piece of genre fiction, I probably wouldn't be an Evil Overlord, given their mortality rates.
