I'm, like, of six minds about this whole thing.

I like the idea of Earth being under the protection of some Demon Corporation, that is one of many Demon Corporations that farms Earths. I also kind of like the idea that Earth was created, /in the first place/, as a farm, and the Underworld is "the original world", and a place where their magic/tech is so powerful that creating an /entire universe/ so they can farm one life form on one planet is kind of intriguing. (Plus, they could be using Earth not just for human meat - I'm sure Demons want to eat bear, tiger, etc and visit beautiful tourist sites). So Earth is probably a "clone" of some planet they particularly liked, maybe? I don't know.

I really like the idea of Earth being somewhere that Demons go to, perhaps as refugees, or perhaps because they want to live a simple life "off the grid".

But I can't reconcile these two together, but I also don't really /need/ either of them to be true.

Perhaps Earth was created by a bunch of "doomsday preppers" to provide somewhere "off the grid" they could live, with a bunch of precautions to stop "bad demons" coming in the event they need to go into their "bunker planet". So the sun is enchanted against vampires, the portals are too small for a sphynx to get through, pollen is poisonous to harpies, etc. There's a few species that can live fine, but they're generally either peaceful or were part of the doomsday prepper collective. It also doubles as a place to go "camping".

So if you want to go to Earth, you need to pay the Preppers some amount of money (easy), pass a basic screening test (to make sure you're not a danger to their Bunker), and go through their checkpoints that they maintain. Then, of course, all the Earth portals come out at one of their "airports" - and maybe they have only half a dozen.

That's a pretty good way to conceptualise it, maybe.
