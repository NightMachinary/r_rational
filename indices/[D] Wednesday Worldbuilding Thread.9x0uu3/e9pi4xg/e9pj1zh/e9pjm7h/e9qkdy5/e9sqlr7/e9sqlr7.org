That's a good thought, though my conception of them was that they were created long ago before the secrets of powerful magic were lost. Other posts have made me consider that perhaps there's a government /in the Underworld/ that severely limits use of the portals, meaning that Earth has significantly reduced "exposure" to the Underworld.

Of course, why an Underworld government would stop people visiting Earth, I don't know. I have some ideas of vaguely lovecraftian-scope horrors who live in the Underworld, and they'd make the rules and I can't imagine they'd care about low-level Demons visiting Earth the same way you wouldn't care about grasshoppers visiting a particular anthill. Especially when I just want access to be limited/regulated in such a way that Earth is /mostly/ unscarred from the exchange, rather than completely cut off.

I mean the best I can come up with is that there's some sort of benevolent diety who wants Earth to be kept as a nature reserve or something, and that's kinda lame...
