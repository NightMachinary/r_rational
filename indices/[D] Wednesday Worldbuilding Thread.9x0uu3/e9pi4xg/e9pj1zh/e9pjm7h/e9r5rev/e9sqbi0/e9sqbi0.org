Oh man, I wish I had time to devote to this project full time because I /want/ to do an arc set in ~2030 when the masquerade finally falls once and for all and the Shadow is used to expedite package deliveries!

I can see it now: half the portals are in the same "terminal" in the Shadow and go to different stations on Earth, and the other half are in one "terminal" on Earth that go to different stations in the Shadow. It'd make travel so convenient!
