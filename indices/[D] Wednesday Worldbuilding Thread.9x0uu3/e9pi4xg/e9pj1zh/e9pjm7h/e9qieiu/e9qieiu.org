Why would there be a shadow government organization? That doesn't seem at all likely to me. What you have here are self-checkpointing international borders.

More likely, there will be an Interplanar Travel Authority that checks passports, collects tariffs, helps demons get work visas, and determines which of the portals should be used for domestic travel and which ones should have internet trunks and oil pipelines run through them. This would be done in cooperation with the nations and sapient beings on the other side, with whom we can trade and make treaties openly and legitimately.

If demons don't have a reason to visit Earth, perhaps we can entice them with electronics, education, and chocolate. It sounds like they have a monster problem; Maybe we could interest them in high caliber hunting rifles? I'm sure they can offer something in return. Forget moving /people./ Biological materials alone would be more than worth the trouble! What are kraken beaks made of, and do they have the same smooth hardness gradient as our squids? How much steak can you get out of a minotaur? What's the amazing smell on that man-eating flower and can we make a perfume out of it? And if they've still got some of that magic... Hey, Mr. Stopheles, I represent a marketing firm and if you sign on with us, the only question left is: How rich do you want to be?
