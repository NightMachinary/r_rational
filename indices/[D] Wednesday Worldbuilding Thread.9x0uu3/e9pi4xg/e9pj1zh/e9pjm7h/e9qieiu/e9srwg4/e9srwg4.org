All this talk about open use of the portals makes me want to write a story set In The Future of when the story I want to write is happening, just to explore all these social things. You did make me realise the Underworld could have "airports" around the portals on /their/ side, though, which might be interesting.

/That's/ an interesting thought. I had a plot bunny a while ago that vinegar was worth a lot of money in the Underworld as it was very expensive to make there, but obviously very cheap on Earth. Maybe I should work out something more logical to have that rareness gradient (Aluminium being an obvious choice, though why Demons won't have the technology to produce it /en masse/ is another question - but perhaps their planet does not have aluminium rich whatever-it-is-we-get-aluminium-from like Earth does...).
