We mine (mostly) bauxite, which gets turned into alumina via the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_process][Bayer Process]], then turned into aluminum through the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall%E2%80%93H%C3%A9roult_process][Hall--HÃ©roult process]]. I mostly know this because aluminum went from being rarer than platinum to a bulk metal in the space of two decades, which makes it great fodder for something a time traveler or portal-goer might invent.
