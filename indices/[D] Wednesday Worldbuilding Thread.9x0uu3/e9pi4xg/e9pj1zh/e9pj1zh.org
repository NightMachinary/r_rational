I think it's pretty likely that control of the portals ends up in the hands of a monopoly, and that this monopoly is probably some kind of government entity.

On of the big things I would think about is that fact that the portals circumvent national borders. There are (roughly) 700 of them, which means that there are probably useful endpoints with regards to immigration, smuggling, insertion of foreign agents, terrorism, or state-sponsored attacks.

The U.S. government has a lot of incentives to A) find every portal within the U.S. and B) establish firm border control with regards to all of them, as one example. If set during the Cold War, the powers-that-be would probably be concerned with the potential for nuclear attack through the portals.

If you wanted to do political commentary, you could follow immigrants taking the "shadow paths" to cross the border and circumvent border control, but that would require the powers-that-be not to have border control with respect to the shadow world.
