interesting concept, and it makes me wonder what a D&D Monk would get in term of a 'chunk' with his Ki abilities. at 7th they get still mind, which removes outside influences of charm and fear from the mind. perhaps the monk is one of the rational paths?

when you have elves that are better at magic somehow, does this mean elven minds are better at interfacing with or adapting to chunks? or are the chunks themselves perhaps fragments of dead elves? parts that survive death maybe?
