I've started building a world where magic can interchange stats between people. Any objectively measurable characteristic, whether it be height, amount of liquid assets or even spare hours on Thursdays, can be given or taken. It requires informed consent from both parties involved and a rather complicated ritual to work. I'm trying to think what pitfalls does this system have and how can a character break it for their own benefit, but constantly get distracted by ideas of changes in the society that would bring, especially considering the setting has other gimmicks aside from this one. I'll gladly hear any thoughts.
