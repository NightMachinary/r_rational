The rich get richer.

Now, the /how/ of that probably depends on what we mean by 'objectively measurable' (e.g. does IQ count? resting heart rate?), but the rich /definitely/ get richer, because they have more resources that they can offer in the exchange, and capital begets capital. Given that the 'extras' aren't part of the ritual itself, you would probably have money (or whatever else) held by a third party, but that's not terribly unusual in the real world, just another inconvenience/expense on top of whatever the ritual imposes.

If the ritual can trade /time/, as implied, then most people will end up selling their hours rather than actually working at minimum wage; if a software engineer gets paid $75/hour, their time is worth x10 what someone on minimum wage makes. I suppose you would have work out the supply and demand here, but time is /really/ valuable for some people, and practically worthless for others.
