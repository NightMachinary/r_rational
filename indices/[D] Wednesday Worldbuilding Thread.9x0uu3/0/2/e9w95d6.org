If there are no rules, and no system, then you can just do whatever the hell you like.

You bring up mind-readers. Okay, if powers are being distributed randomly (read: however you, the writer, feel they should be distributed), then you can have as many or as few mind-readers as you like. You don't have to explain that there's only a 0.001% chance of someone having mind powers. You can just have very, very few mind-readers, and let the audience draw their own conclusions.

A single mind-reader is powerful, sure. A whole cadre of mind-readers is especially powerful, and will distort any community they're dropped into. But if these powers really do manifest randomly, then that mind-reader group's influence is only going to extend as far as they can reach in a single lifetime. Once they're dead, there's no-one to replace them, and no-one needs to worry about them.

At that point it comes down to what kind of story you want to tell, and/or what kind of characters you want to explore. Because there's nothing stopping you from just... y'know... /not including mind-readers./
