Thanks for that - I didn't think of the potential for bad actors on Earth to use them to do regular Earth bad things. Even if you handwave and say the Shadow planet is the size of Jupiter and humans are regularly hunted for food by powerful, ineffable creatures, so there's no way to reliably travel between portals in the Shadow, that still doesn't help as the Government doesn't know that, and some Demons look pretty humanoid so could even be bribed by Russia or ISIS or whoever (or, at least, the Government would be worried about it).

Then again, as the story I'm thinking of writing isn't set in the US, it could be quite possible for the portals in the US, Russia, and wherever else to be owned by shadow government organisations, which only makes the portals that aren't controlled more valuable. Then /again/, my story's set in Australia, and if the US has a shadow government organisation keeping track of portals, then Australia most certainly does also.

Then /again/, the plot hook I had in mind was a low-level Demon moving a portal from Europe to Australia, so perhaps that's why it's a good business decision to do so: perhaps there are no other "free" portals in Australia and he wants to make $$$, and the plot could involve the shadow government organisation breathing down the Demon's neck.

Then /again/, I don't like the "shadow government" trope, but it's also kind of impossible to imagine a world where the Masquerade was successful enough over a long enough term for there /not/ to be one.

Thank you!~ You gave me a lot to think about.
