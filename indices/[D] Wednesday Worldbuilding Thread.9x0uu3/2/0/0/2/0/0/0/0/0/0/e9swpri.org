Maybe the farmer has been kind of distracted for the last couple of thousand years by a /really/ good book. (When your lifetime is measured in millions of years, you can write some doorstoppers so big they could double as skyscrapers...)

He's not too worried about the farm, because meh, the humans can keep themselves alive no problem. He either hasn't heard about bullets yet, or he doesn't believe the stories. After all, the last he saw the humans, they hadn't yet figured out what fire could be used for...

  More and more, I think the attitude I /want/ is for Demons to "leave Earth for Earthlings", somehow being very respectful of human territory even though humans are a food that are just /begging/ to be harvested from Earth.

Harvesting humans - in any sort of quantity - would be effectively stealing from Farmer. Maybe they really, really, /really/ don't want to annoy Farmer.

Which, if the humans find out about Farmer, is also a reason for a certain amount of worry on Earth... what happens when Farmer gets to the end of his book and comes to see whether his harvest is ready yet?

  Alternatively, I can see Earth being much like the Earth from the MIB movies, being used as a place for demon refugees to hide. Perhaps it just smells really, really bad so nobody wants to go there. Or maybe it's more like Australia in the 1700s: there's little infrastructure, why would you /want/ to go there.

I also kind of like the "no infrastructure" idea. Presumably their cellphones are not compatible with humans' cellphone towers - not that human cellphone towers can sustain what they consider a half-decent data transfer rate in any case.
