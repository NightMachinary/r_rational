There's two parallel worlds: the one we live on, and a "shadow" earth (really just another planet in a non-specified location, be that in another solar system/galaxy or literally in another universe) with all sorts of demons and mythological creatures living on it.

There are a series of "portals" that were created long ago by strong magics the kind that are no longer seen, and they are relatively small in size so only things roughly human size can pass between (so the e.g. krakens are stuck). There are relatively few of them: maybe one per 10 million humans.

They mostly remain in the possession of 'demons' who use them for personal use, though some are probably in deep cult chambers.

What are some consequences of these portals existing, and how do we stop Earth being overrun (the demons don't really have any reason to visit Earth, so...). Is there an economy where portal owners sell tickets to move between the veil? Is it inevitable that a governing body will buy up / steal all the portals and control access somehow? Is there an obvious munchkinry opportunity? Is there an obvious consequence of this system that would result in undesireable consequences?
