  Does IQ count?
#+end_quote

I'm not sure. That's one thing that I wanted to discuss. I know that some IQ tests take into the account possible cultural differences and other things that can influence the score, but at the end of the day, the results of the test are an /estimate/. So I have my doubts that the magical system would consider IQ measures to be objective.

  Does resting heart rate count?

It counts as measurable in my eyes, but I'm not well-versed in medicine.

  If the ritual can trade time, as implied, then most people will end up selling their hours rather than actually working at minimum wage.
#+end_quote

Yes, the world is currently written with this in mind. This makes me wonder what would happen with the low-wage jobs.

Thank you for the answer!
