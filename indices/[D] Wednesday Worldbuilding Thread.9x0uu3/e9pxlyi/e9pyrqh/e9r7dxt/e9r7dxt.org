Aside from the obvious definition of 'rich', it raises questions concerning the value of things like 'height'. Do people start trading 'fat', or 'workout habits' or 'determination'?

Well, if people are willing to sell things on their death bed/etc., then...

Barring the complexity of the ritual being too high, someone could try to give someone /everything good/ before they died. (So people seeking revenge for the dead, may carry their strength.) Imagine a line of kings, each more charismatic, handsome, clever, strong, wise, and intelligent, than the last. Even if a craftsman can't transfer the knowledge and skill magically, they can use the ritual to pass on abilities that are useful in their work - dexterity, and speed. And magic users - in addition to the drawing ability (straighter lines, drawn faster), may prize intelligence, speed of thought, or ways of thinking, not to mention abilities anti-correlated with their skillset - strength so they're not glass canons, and social skills, so they're not easily manipulated.

[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/09/ars-longa-vita-brevis/][This story]] spins how things normally are (pessimistically), and perhaps illuminates some of the power enabled by such transfers.

For obvious munchkinry that you probably won't allow - if there is a way to convert (useful) temporary effects into permanent ones just by transferring them, people will do so.

And, in addition to passing on 'positive traits for money', people might also 'receive negative traits in exchange for positive ones'. Groups of specialists can also get together, and become generalists.
