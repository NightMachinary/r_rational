Magic systems can typically be divided into "cost" and "effect", with both having quite a bit of weight in terms of how that magic system is used within the world it's embedded in. (Here, "cost" should be considered a catch-all for "what does it take to make magic", which might include things like bloodlines, pacts, genetics, etc.)

There's a particular variety of "magic" where each practitioner is bound by their own magic system, sometimes with overlap into a cohesive system, sometimes free-floating without connections to each other. Some examples ("magic" here is obviously loosely defined):

- Powers in /Worm/
- Superhero settings in general
- Magical girl specialties
- Quirks in /My Hero Academia/
- Semblances in /RWBY/
- Entads in /Worth the Candle/

... and a bunch of others.

From a writing perspective, it's pretty clear why this is done; powers/magic can then have a tighter thematic link to a person, allowing their power to be a reflection of them or say something relevant about their character. Beyond that, if you have X people with different powers, then you can have X * X-1 different match-ups between them, each of which will be unique in its own way.

Unfortunately, these types of systems have some real problems when it comes to worldbuilding, if you have enough people with their own magic. Instead of the traditional magic/worldbuilding problem of defining "what can magic do", you have the more complex problem of "what can magic do, at what rates, and within what limits".

You need to know whether there are mind-readers, how common they are, and what kinds of drawbacks they typically have, because even a small handful of them can have a pretty significant impact on all aspects of society. Basically, you need to create a possibility space for all the magics that people can possibly do, then create probabilities within those possibilities, and you have to explore the outer limits as well, because the people/magic at those outer limits is probably vitally important to defining who the movers, shakers, and linchpins are in the world.

Worse, you have to then somehow communicate that to the reader in a concise way.

I'm not really sure that there's a one-size-fits-all solution to this problem, insofar as it /is/ a problem, but I'd be interested in hearing how people deal with it.
