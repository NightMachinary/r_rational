In a fantasy/medieval setting, people sometimes acquire intangible chunks capable of computation and magic. It is possible with practice to expand one's thought process into the chunk of computation, primarily to intuitively use it to control the magic it comes with. The downside is that the more one leans on the chunk the more one's thought patterns follow those of the chunk (e.g. evil, good, greed, travel, fire, etc.). The magic being relatively normal fantasy stuff, a limit of power per time-span with some sort of cap, fireballs, regeneration, control of plants, sacrificing people for more power, etc. Almost all chunks provide a basic improvement to the owners body in strength, speed, perception, and endurance etc.

Explanation: It's sort of a strong AI computational medium of fixed speed (like say 10 times more computational power than a brain, maybe more, and often very large unused memory) attached to human brains, with a lot of the "computer" architecture kinds of tropes. For example: with like "user" permissions, being able to copy minds around, magic is a sort of "port" or "device" (albeit a very complex one often tied to many "virtual" neurons, which are then plugged into default "drivers" that cause the magic to actually do specific things). However by default any thinking done on the chunk is subject to learning with the chunk's innate goal function, while it can simulate the human brain's biological structure (so as to be attached to humans), it does so in such a way as to be reinforcing the goal function. The point is that for most people, they use the computational power to make the magic work (the magic already being attached to pre weighted chunks of brain (the last person's...), so it feels like a limb) and when using the magic are often influenced to carry out the goal (people who use the magic constantly, slowly seek to follow only the goal).

Also I am toying with the idea of there often being embedded within the chunks personalities with experiences and knowledge from previous people, that are subject to goal function manipulation (as they run on the chunk) but are separate beings - a special user/watchdog that can't be removed (but can be suppressed) with about the computational capacity of a person - but with no control of the magic or the person's body or thoughts (outside of limited communication). Basically demons that try to convince one to use the power and achieve the goal.

The story would focus on a character who acquires one of these chunks and approaches it rationally (rather than just a tool to exercise power). What consequences might there be in a medieval world that would be different than the normal rational fantasy and rational super-exponential AI tropes? (what might I be missing in my world building - interesting intersections would be awesome to hear - for example: magic involving creating semi-intelligent agents, like necromancery, involves, even without a rational viewpoint, bits about security around the authentication of who can give orders to them, necromancers will often look for security flaws when fighting each other)
