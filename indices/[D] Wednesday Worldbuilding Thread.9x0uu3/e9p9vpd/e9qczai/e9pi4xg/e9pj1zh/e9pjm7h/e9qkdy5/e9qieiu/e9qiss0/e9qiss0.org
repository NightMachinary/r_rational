  a low-level Demon moving a portal

If the portals can be /moved/ then there's the option of using them as shortcuts. Consider - assume that there are two portals in two different, distant major cities on DemonWorld (think along the lines of New York and London on Earth). Now, take the Earth ends of these portals and bring them together, in the same room. Suddenly, you have a route between two distant major cities (for purposes of trade or tourism or whatever) that takes less than ten minutes to walk along.

Similarly, if the American government can arrange to have the portals moved on DemonWorld (by a military operation, or bribing the Demons, or whatever) they can have their spies strolling out of the Stalingrad portal within seconds of leaving headquarters. (Alright, if the Russians know about that particular portal, then those American spies are going to really regret their life choices in fairly short order...)
