If Portal A and Portal B are placed face-to-face and basically right on top of each other in Demon World, then an American spy can leap into the portal in Washington, and land on the ground in Stalingrad, without having spent even as long as a full second in DemonWorld. Sure, it's dangerous - a predator could just move Portal B and then sit and wait in front of Portal A with its mouth open - but it's the sort of dangerous that one could imagine a government risking, given the benefits.

  I mean the best I can come up with is that there's some sort of benevolent diety who wants Earth to be kept as a nature reserve or something, and that's kinda lame...

Maybe it's not benevolent. If humans are a food item, then perhaps Earth is a free-range human farm - with a farmer who comes by every now and then to harvest a few to eat.

And perhaps Earth isn't the /only/ free-range human farm.
