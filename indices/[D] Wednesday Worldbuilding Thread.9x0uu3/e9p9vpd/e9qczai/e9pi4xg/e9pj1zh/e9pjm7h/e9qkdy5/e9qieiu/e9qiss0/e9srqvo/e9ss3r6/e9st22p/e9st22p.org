Oh, that's actually pretty perfect! A free-range human farm is something I was considering a lot anyway. It'd be very bad for the farmer if humans became well aware of the portals, as they'd be able to cause problems to anyone who enters (since bullets/etc mostly work on Demons).

I'm also imagining a scene where a Demon takes his human boyfriend through the portal, and his boyfriend has a "passport" stamped.

Boyfriend: The writing on this is funky! What's it say?

Demon: Well, mine says I'm a 300 year old mixed breed and that I'm visiting for religious reasons.

Boyfriend: Cool! What's mine say?

Demon: .... um, "livestock" ?
