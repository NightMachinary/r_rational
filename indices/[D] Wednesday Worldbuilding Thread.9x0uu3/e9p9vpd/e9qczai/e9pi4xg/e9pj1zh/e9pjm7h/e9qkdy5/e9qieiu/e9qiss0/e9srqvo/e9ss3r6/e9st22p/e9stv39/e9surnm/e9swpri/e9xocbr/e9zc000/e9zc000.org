  Perhaps Earth was created by a bunch of "doomsday preppers" to provide somewhere "off the grid" they could live, with a bunch of precautions to stop "bad demons" coming in the event they need to go into their "bunker planet". So the sun is enchanted against vampires, the portals are too small for a sphynx to get through, pollen is poisonous to harpies, etc. There's a few species that can live fine, but they're generally either peaceful or were part of the doomsday prepper collective. It also doubles as a place to go "camping".

I actually quite like this idea. As a bonus, it allows you to make DemonWorld even deadlier - with (say) carnivorous flying fairies, who are more or less airborne piranha but can't survive on Earth for whatever reason. Or a group of harpies, having heard of the place and wanting to visit, pool together and hire a demon 'consultant' to go to Earth and cause the extinction of the plant that makes the pollen that's poisonous to them. (Maybe that's what 'really' happened to the Passenger Pigeon...)
