or, (c), the harvester doesn't find any of our stuff threatening - but then the reason for secrecy (Farmer doesn't want to fight humanity) goes away. Maybe it's a farm turned nature preserve, then? Ugh. Complicated!

  Would that demon be considered - by the other demons - to be guilty of bestiality?

Bestiality is a funny concept to demons because it's well-accepted for different species of demons to bone. It's more a low status thing - but like, frighteningly low status: imagine it's 1500 and the King of England has declared that he's in love with a (male) slave from some other country, that's probably the sort of level of "why on earth would you do that when you could have done LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE" that people would think.

While at the same time, there's tons of demons who have relationships with humans (sometimes reluctant ones kidnapped from Earth and saved from being dinner; sometimes people who lived in Earth for a while).

More and more, I think the attitude I /want/ is for Demons to "leave Earth for Earthlings", somehow being very respectful of human territory even though humans are a food that are just /begging/ to be harvested from Earth.

Perhaps it's a farm originally owned by Standard Evil Farmer, but then it was inherited by her more kind-hearted son, who was an abolitionist of sorts and declared Earth a nature preserve.

Alternatively, I can see Earth being much like the Earth from the MIB movies, being used as a place for demon refugees to hide. Perhaps it just smells really, really bad so nobody wants to go there. Or maybe it's more like Australia in the 1700s: there's little infrastructure, why would you /want/ to go there.
