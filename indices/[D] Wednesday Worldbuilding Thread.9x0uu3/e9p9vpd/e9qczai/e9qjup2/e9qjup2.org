Also, consider that it doesn't need to be a mechanical AI. We're talking fantasy, so there could be an explanation such as 'a soul bound to the item', or even an amalgamation of souls (maybe past users?).

The computer architecture tropes can be replaced with equivalents that match your magic system. If you have a limited set of instructions that you can give with magic, then you can imagine what kind of structure a mage could/would put into it to assist the user. Maybe this can result in unique and interesting user-item interactions (I'm thinking orange-blue morality).
