For as far as showing the reader the different levels of power, I think that what's really important is how you show the culture of the world and the types of societies that exist. I think by changing the cultural customs to accomodate different types of powers, you can signal to the reader that the levels of rarity that each type of power has. For example, if mind readers are very uncommon, then only high-profile and paranoid people would like have systems in place for them. If they were fairly common, then it's more likely that the average person has some sort of system in place to protect themselves.

In my own story, that kind of strides the line between superpowers and xanxia-styled magic, and I'm not sure this is the best way to do it, I use large distances and powers that don't have huge areas of effect. This lets me work on each area as if it were a self-contained bubble, which means that there's a lot less pieces for me to keep track of.
