Old stories had this kind of one-off magic. Some guy drinks dragon's blood. Now he can talk to birds.

Consider old customs as a possible solution to the kinds of problems you're describing.

* Bring political power in alignment with magical power

Take mind control. The social problem is that a mage could take over someone else's community. The solution is to just give the mage a title. Now that he's Lord Mage they're his peasants, so the act isn't illegal or a threat to society in general .

* Enforce Ettiquite

I'm obliged to announce myself when coming into your territory . I know your schtick because you openly rule kingdom. The meeting gives you a chance to size me up and feel out my trick .

And maybe I can pull one over on your court. But, that's going to get me a reputation in short order .

Sneaking magic users should be assumed to be hostile .

* Heroic Responsibility

The evil king isn't breaking any laws or treaties. He's just cruel. But Conan doesn't feel a need to get a grand jury indictment before going after someone. He doesn't need external validation for his moral decisions .

I'd suggest letting the world break, and have fixes evolve from there. The first person to get a power to control a town now owns a town.

What happens when he wants to trade? Maybe he can capture the first few travelers who come into his area. But people stop coming unless they have protection from a bigger fish.
