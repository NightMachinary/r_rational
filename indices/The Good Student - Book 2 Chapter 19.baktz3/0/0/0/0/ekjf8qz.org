Yeah, that's basically exactly what I felt was coming when I dropped it, I felt it settle into that pattern towards the end of volume 1 and as I saw it start up in volume 2 I just didn't care anymore, if the author is just going to keep ass pulling the plot then literally nothing can progress, the characters will progress only for it to be fake and the plot will progress only for there to be a deeper plot, that /can/ be done effectively, but it is a very fine tightrope to walk, and while I have seen that the author can do characters and world building (sort of), he has proven bad at progression of any kind.
