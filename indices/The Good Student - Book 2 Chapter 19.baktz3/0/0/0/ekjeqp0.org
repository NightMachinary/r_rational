It's basically in line with what you said. It's a constant bait and switch. Even in the current chapter here Nic is probably walking into a trap, and he has been told as much. But did he himself know this? Is this part of his plan? You can already see the same trope is being used again. MC thinks he does something on his own, but it ends up being a trap, it's just what they wanted! Or is it? Seems like he actually maybe fucked up someone's plan? Was it his intention all along? Is he actually capable? But were they separate agents from the true baddies? Who's lying and who is telling the truth?

Combined with the ever present "He is the one"(C) trope it's just a big mess. When everything is up in doubt nothing matters - he can write any number of bizarre scenarios and play it off like it was what was meant to happen all along, because that's now the norm.

Character interactions are still great but Dizzy is still an insufferable bitch and Simole has kind of been waylaid into some sort of comedic role. We don't see much of the other housemates, frankly.

EDIT: that said i'm sure other readers will disagree. One of the chief problems with this novel is that some of the interactions are so convoluted that you can never really tell what's going on, which is part of the meme.
