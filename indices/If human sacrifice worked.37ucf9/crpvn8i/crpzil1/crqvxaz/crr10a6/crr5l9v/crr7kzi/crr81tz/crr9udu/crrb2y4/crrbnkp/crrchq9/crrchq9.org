It's a fairly easily attainable skill. You take a scenario, work out the likely pros and likely cons, google the studies and plug in some basic numbers or ask experts and plug in their recommendations.

You probably do it elsewhere in your life, if you write essays, build things, or play games with stats. It's good to do it with moral questions too.
