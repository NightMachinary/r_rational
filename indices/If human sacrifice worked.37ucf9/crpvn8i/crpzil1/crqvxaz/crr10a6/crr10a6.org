It's easily quantifiable in the context of a very large data set with easily tracked results. Even those numbers won't tell the whole story - domestic abuse is hugely underreported, and far the most likely violent crime.

But what you are talking about quantifies /one effect/ of a single policy decision (and probably the most numerically observable), not all of them. It would take massive resources to characterize the effects of a single major decision with very little accuracy; the idea of trying to do that kind of research for even the top 20 dilemmas individuals are likely to encounter is ludicrous.

edit: Not to imply that such study wouldn't be worthwhile! Understanding the true effects of policy decisions is useful under any reasonable philosophical framework.
