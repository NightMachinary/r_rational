We can express this more simply; most people don't want to live in a society where x happens, therefore x carries negative utility. Killing all handicapped people saves money for other social projects, but most people don't like the prospect of anyone who gets injured getting executed, so the shadow of that possibility would weigh over them and lower their happiness. The choice to not kill handicapped people therefore saves a lot of negative utility even among the healthy population. The problem of Utilitarianism isn't that it always only looks one step ahead, but that people imagine it does.
