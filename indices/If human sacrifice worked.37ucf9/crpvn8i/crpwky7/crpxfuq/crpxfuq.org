  Utiitarianism = consequentialism + the valuable consequences are hedons

No, that's wrong. That's hedonististic utilitarianism you are describing, but there's also e.g. preference utilitarianism where utility is the satisfaction of preferences, not the maximization of hedons. There's also 'negative utilitarianism' where utility = negative suffering.
