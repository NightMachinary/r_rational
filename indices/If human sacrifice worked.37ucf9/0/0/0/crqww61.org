I suppose I was trying to portray rationalists who are not necessarily Consequentialist Utilitarians. I'm a little more inclined in that direction than most, and from your comment you seem to be so too. But someone who /sincerely/ believes in a god given moral system where certain actions are bad regardless of their outcome can still be a rationalist or Utilitarian within those confines. Another extreme position would be more Voldemorty: I don't have cancer, and sacrificing people will make me look callous, which would be bad PR. My good reputation is more valuable than the lives I could save. Therefore, no sacrifices.

Also, there's a real utilitarian argument to be made against killing people whenever it's convenient: People don't like the idea of anyone they know being sacrificed, and the looming risk, however small, would decrease their happiness. Say you could save a few hundred people, but the cost is that the US population becomes slightly less happy because they all worry the evil guberment might break into their home and sacrifice their family members to Shub Niggurath. You could optimize in various ways, like keeping the truth secret, and mainly sacrificing people 'no one will miss', but even among people who agree that the sacrifices could be justified, there are real discussions to be had about the details that don't have obvious answers.
