  Being a rationalist doesn't tell you what ends to value, it just demands that you go after those ends in ways that make sense.

It does a bit of both, lots of ends are valued because of irrational thinking.

  You can hold the opinion [Every human life is so valuable murder is always wrong] or you can hold the opinion [I matter the most, followed by my family, followed by the filthy crowd]. These two people would react very differently to finding out that the gods could be bribed with sacrifices.
#+end_quote

For example, here, suppose 1 sacrifice can save 2 lives. If you don't sacrifice someone then, according to you valuing human life, you probably value 2 lives you are not personally ending more than 1 life you personally are ending.

This maths kills lots of people. There are people opposed to robot cars because they could kill people, and not opposed to cars which kill more people.

  Not so many of us would use prisoners for medical research, even though that would definitely save lives in the long run.

What about sacrificing normal civilians for medical research? I have no objection to killing some number of them for medical research. Suppose it took five deaths on average to bring a cancer drug to market. Suppose Chalchiuhtotolin promised that for just one sacrifice he'd reduce the impact of the disease by a comparable amount to the drug. I'd like those odds.
