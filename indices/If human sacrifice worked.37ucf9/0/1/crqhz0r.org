  Not so many of us would use prisoners for medical research, even though that would definitely save lives in the long run.

I disagree with the second point, actually - establishing a norm that prisoners can be used for medical research /may well/ end up doing more harm than the difference to the best prisoner-free research option.

Strong commitments to human rights are actually a utilitarian position, even when this seems counterproductive, if humans are as bad at moral tradeoffs as we actually are.
