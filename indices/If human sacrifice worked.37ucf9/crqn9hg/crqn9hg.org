In The Fall of the Sorcerors, Lawrence Watt-Evans writes about political revolt against the magic-wielding aristocratic class's human sacrifice of criminals to prevent widespread famine etc. The world-building is good and at least semi-rational, although the actual narrative compares poorly to Watt-Evans' other books.
