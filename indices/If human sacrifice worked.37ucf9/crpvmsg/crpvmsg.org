Being a rationalist doesn't tell you what ends to value, it just demands that you go after those ends in ways that make sense. You can hold the opinion [Every human life is so valuable murder is always wrong] or you can hold the opinion [I matter the most, followed by my family, followed by the filthy crowd]. These two people would react very differently to finding out that the gods could be bribed with sacrifices. If you're on a scale between the two extremes, you'll decide to go for the sacrifice at different points of necessity/convenience. Most people would sacrifice the innocent child to save the world. Most rationalists would sacrifice the innocent child to find a (magically) perfect vaccine against some horrible disease. Not so many of us would use prisoners for medical research,, even though that would definitely save lives in the long run. With sacrifices to the gods, I similarly expect most of us would not sacrifice people whenever it seemed convenient, but would wait until the utility function looked /very/ clear.
