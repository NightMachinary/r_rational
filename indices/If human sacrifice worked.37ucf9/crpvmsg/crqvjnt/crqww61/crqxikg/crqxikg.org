  But someone who sincerely believes in a god given moral system where certain actions are bad regardless of their outcome can still be a rationalist or Utilitarian within those confines.

Maybe you can have these moralities but then, if you're being truthful, you can't really say every life is valuable in certain ways. You're not willing to kill one person to stop, say, a dozen other people being raped and murdered. As such, your morality and god's will is more valuable than the dozen people who were raped and murdered. Sure, maybe that's a rational or utilitarian decision to make under certain priors, but then if you claim that every life is precious to you I'm not going to believe you. You only have one king to sacrifice on your board, and clearly human life is not that piece.

  Another extreme position would be more Voldemorty: I don't have cancer, and sacrificing people will make me look callous, which would be bad PR. My good reputation is more valuable than the lives I could save. Therefore, no sacrifices.

Unlikely. More likely he's going to say "Annoyingly, the public gets pissed at me when I make necessary sacrifices for their own good. To what degree can I bypass that with proxies and secrecy, and what risk is there of me being found out?" And then only do it when it fulfils his values, such as a valuable ally having cancer.

  People don't like the idea of anyone they know being sacrificed, and the looming risk, however small, would decrease their happiness.

We already do this to black males. It takes a lot of random killings to have a major effect though. The US is certainly trying their best.

And if you kill the right people the effect is reversed- lots of people are very happy about the US's policy to kill lots of muslims, or shoot black males.

Since the issue is already rather complicated and swamped killing a couple hundred people is likely to have little effect on net happiness.
