Yes, but why would it stop anyone? If possible health concerns of cannibalism was enough to stop people, then it would have been enough to stop entire cultures who have thousands of years of history of cannibalism. Also, while I can't find the article I read stating this, I remember reading somewhere that people descended from multiple generations of cannibals had a lower risk of getting prion diseases due to evolution of genes to counteract prion diseases.
