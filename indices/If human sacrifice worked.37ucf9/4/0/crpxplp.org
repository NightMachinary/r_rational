This poorly written story was meant to show how if human sacrifice was the only option for magical power, then all of human history is drastically changed.

First we would have far less empathy for strangers and racism would be an acceptable part of everyday life. Note that I delibrately avoided any mention of the slave's gender because to K'iche' the slaves don't even qualify as a person.

Secondly, cultures which lead to today's modern understanding of ethics and morality wouldn't have been able to develop as their less-empathic neighbors were more successful. I don't have a very god knowledge of the history behind the development of ethics and philosophy, but I think the modern understanding was mainly developed during the Renaissance in Europe.

Without the cultures mentioned above, this leads to the possibility of cannibalism since in ancient culture and some today, cannibalism was considered an important part of society and even sacred. This it would likely flourish along aside human sacrifice.

This leads to all sorts of casual tortures and sacrifices accomplished by hurting the 'inferiors' in hourly worship of the Great Ones (imagined or real gods, all powerful God-Kings, or shadowy tyrants) for the most mundane usage such as not walking the distance to school.

All of the above is just within the first five minutes of considering the consequences of a world with working human sacrifice. It's a Crapsack World for anyone not on the winning side of the sacrificers.

K'iche' was meant as a reference to a Mayan civilization, but it might be a bad one to make, because I doubt that particular civilization had anything similar to the world I made up.
