Pretty sure that utilitarianism is the philosophy that "/If/ the ends justify the means then they're fine to use, no matter the cost." (although obviously, a /rational/ utilitarian would look for the least costly means).

Just a blanket "The ends justify the means." would lead to some /very/ disturbing thought processes, and I'm not sure that such a person could even function.
