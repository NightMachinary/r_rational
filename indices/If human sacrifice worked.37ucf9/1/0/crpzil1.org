  Utilitarianism is a specific moral philosophy that the ends justify the means.

I hear this description a lot. It's correct, but there's an unstated point in there - the means affect the ends. People like to illustrate 'the ends justify the means' by allowing horrible things to be done in the name of good outcomes, but the truth is that doing horrible things causes the people doing them to change - this change /must/ be counted among the outcomes being evaluated in any kind of /rational/ utilitarian calculations.

I personally think that utilitarianism is useless as a personal philosophy exactly because of the cumulative effects of these mechanism-focused internal changes - you don't just need to consider the effects of the means on the actors, but the effect on the society's moral fabric and norms, the effect on the rule of law, the effect on all witnesses, the effects of the fact that hiding information from those involved can improve utility (knowing that would cause a rational person to be less trusting).. the list goes on basically forever. It's like trying to solve the N-body problem when your forces are all unquantifiable and cannot be directly calculated or observed.
