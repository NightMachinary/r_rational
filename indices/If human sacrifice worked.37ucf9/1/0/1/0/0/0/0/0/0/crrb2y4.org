Are you saying that if the death rate of a course of action is known then that counts as a ridiculously contrived scenario?

Because that's true of a lot of personal utilitarian scenarios. We know the death rate of lots of things, there are corpses lying around when people die, corpses are easy to count.

  The point was that a zealot can argue from maximum utility for genocide, a husband can argue from maximum utility that he shouldn't be punished for his abuse, and a priest can argue from maximum utility that his pedophilia should not be prosecuted.

Can they argue well, with reasonable statistics? Or are they arguing from different priors, e.g. that jews don't count as humans, or that pedophilia is beneficial to children?

Both points can just be solved with a simple rule. "Trust mainstream science, not made up BS."

  But if such a situation happened in real life, you would not get "truthfully", and you would have only the priest's word that such a sacrifice was useful or necessary.

It's a bit like antibiotics. You can easily get evidence that in the past when whatever happened people's diseases cleared up and when it didn't they died or were sick for a long time.

You could also check whether people knew any other way to do the same thing. You can do basic research 101.
