I apologize. I'll write in an exception for ridiculously contrived situations in which the outcomes and trustworthiness of all actors are known.

The point was that a zealot can argue from maximum utility for genocide, a husband can argue from maximum utility that he shouldn't be punished for his abuse, and a priest can argue from maximum utility that his pedophilia should not be prosecuted. The fact that a situation could /be constructed/ in which it was not ambiguous is obvious - you could have brought in an existential threat if you wanted to be more clear.

I wasn't trying to say that anyone can convince themselves of the rightness of any action /in every possible situation/. If you are ever given such a magically clear situation, it might be appropriate to use net utility! But if such a situation happened in real life, you would not get "truthfully", and you would have only the priest's word that such a sacrifice was useful or necessary.
