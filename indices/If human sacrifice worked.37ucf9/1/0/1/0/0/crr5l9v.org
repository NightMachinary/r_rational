We have data on domestic abuse, and it is indeed higher.

What I am doing established a probable boundary on what will happen.

"I personally think that posting on reddit is useless as a personal action exactly because of the cumulative effects of these mechanism-focused internal changes - you don't just need to consider the effects of the means on the actors, but the effect on the society's moral fabric and norms, the effect on the rule of law, the effect on all witnesses, the effects of the fact that hiding information from those involved can improve utility (knowing that would cause a rational person to be less trusting).. the list goes on basically forever. "

You can say vague things about the potential bad consequences of an action about anything. Despite my above rewording of your post you'll still probably post reddit posts, and people will continue to sacrifice people to various causes.

Practically, people are going to die, our actions and choices and dilemmas are going to cause people to die. If we don't make good estimates about how many people die from our actions more people are likely to die.

So practically we should make estimates from limited data about how bad the consequences of our actions are. Theoretically, sacrificing someone to cthulhu is going to have some absurdly complicated negative effect, but practically, we have extensive experience with killing people for causes, we can guess and estimate how positive or negative it will be. Based on past experience, what boundary do I have on how bad it's likely to be?
