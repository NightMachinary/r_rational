[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%27iche%27_people][K'iche']] was woken up by the alarm clock blaring by his head. He groaned as he got up.

He tossed his blankets off and walked into the bathroom where his lowly slaves cleaned and dressed him. In this manner, the slave effectively and efficiently cleaned him. The slave followed him as K'iche' walked to the kitchens for his breakfast. The slave held up his history textbook while K'iche' ate.

K'iche' focused on memorizing the dates for the fall of the European Cultures and the obvious reasoning behind why their preaching that all sentient beings are equal was clearly false. After all the Great Ones clearly protected everyone important by favoring those who gave them blood sacrifice regularly. Hm....the liver particularly tasted stringy today.

That reminded him, he needed to get to school soon. K'iche' dismissed his personal slave and walked to the back of the house. Outside was a large barn. Inside were stables with humans inside. These were humans collected from all over the country as prisoners of war, children of slaves, and other inferiors.

K'iche' took down one of the daggers hanging on the walls and expertly and quickly prepped the standard ritual to slice out the tendons on one slave's leg. K'iche' noted down on a nearby notebook the condition of the slave and what further rituals the slave was still eligible for.

As the magic blazed up around him, K'iche' tore out the slave's tendons and teleported a mile to his school.
