Bearing in mind that rationality doesn't /determine/ your goals - a paperclipper or psychopath would obviously have no problem sacrificing tons of people, which is a bit of a problem when it means they'll be vastly more powerful than everyone else - but assuming human goals:

From an economic perspective, people seem to "value" their lives at about $5 million, IIRC. So something that prevented $5 of inconvenience to a city of a million people would be "worth" the bargain from the market's perspective. (Look at cars, for example.) That's debateably rational or ethical, though.

In our world, [[https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/research/charities-area/malaria][Giving What We Can]] tells me it costs around $3500 to save a life from malaria. Someone /donating all the proceeds to charity/ could definitely argue that a human sacrifice for something the can sell for more than that is worth it. (Maybe even less, in a setting where you can save lives for less - which is probably true in most low-fantasy medievalesque settings.)

Preventing some large disaster, like a volcano erupting in a populated area, seems like an obvious one. Appeasing the gods to prevent them chucking asteroids or plagues at you seems pretty ethical, although it raises the question of whether you could kill them instead.

Droughts and famines can have pretty large death tolls, but that's seperate from the question of when it's /more efficient/ to sacrifice people than use conventional irrigation. Which ... God, I don't know. You could fiddle around with QALYs, or use the $5M rule if you're just worldbuilding a reasonably ethical civilization, but that would take work.

The US sees a few hundred people die from storms and heatwaves and the like, even now. [[http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/hazstats.shtml][Like this chart]]. So fixing the weather for a large empire would pretty clearly be worth it, even with modern technology. (Again, this goes up the lower the tech level of your setting.)

You could also look into the economic effects of slavery in the US, which I'd imagine would have an analogue at least /somewhere/ in this world. And from a military perspective, sacrificing enemy soldiers for a tactical benefit is a lot like torturing your captives (i.e. probably common when the two enemies can't see eye-to-eye, since it costs your side nothing, but with a lot of treaties banning it in "civilized" cultures.)

EDIT: Oh! Some people have also suggested that some sort of immortality ritual would be worth it, if the target lived significantly longer than they + the sacrifice would combined.
