They must have changed it, then. I remember an author a few years ago saying they set it to 60% or so, the maximum.

Yeah, they [[https://forums.createspace.com/en/community/thread/37415][changed]] it. Bummer.

Actually, I was able to navigate to [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=amb_link_373770582_2?ie=UTF8&docId=1001119751&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-5&pf_rd_r=1EF7JH6D3MX7PNV4MC7J&pf_rd_t=1401&pf_rd_p=1524214362&pf_rd_i=1001119751#limits][it]] even now. Did they lie to you or is the information misleading?
