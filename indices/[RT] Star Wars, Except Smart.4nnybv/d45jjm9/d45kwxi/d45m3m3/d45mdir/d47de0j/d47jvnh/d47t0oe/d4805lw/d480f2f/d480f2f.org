Seems like a pointless complication, tbh. If it's an original story, Wildbow's project is not a bad one (he will publish Worm after heavy editing), assuming he leaves the unedited copy online for everyone to read.

And, regardless, rational fiction in general is such a niche subculture that actually getting a good amount of money from selling this kind of product is probably quite difficult. Though as far as I know [[/u/eaglejarl]] has tried both paths, so perhaps he can provide a more informed opinion on the matter.
