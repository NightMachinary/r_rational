I hope the opposite, as I refuse to pay before trying. The current free + Patreon model works for me because if I enjoy the content I gladly throw some money to the author via Patreon. If I don't, I either keep reading to participate in the community, or I stop reading and move on.

That's why I will never buy the sequel to Forging the Sword. I did read the first book with KU, I didn't like it and in the meantime I cut the subscription to KU. So to find out whether I'd like the second book I'd have to pay, one way or another. And if I don't like it, it's wasted money.
