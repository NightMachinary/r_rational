It's not "pay-only." It's a web-serial you can get in more sophisticated formats if you support the author monthly, and in html if you don't. He just mixed his links up - [[https://www.patreon.com/davidstorrs?ty=h][here's]] the Star Wars bit.

This may be slightly unrelated, but I think it needs to be said. If the genre is to become more widely adopted then shaming authors for seeking remuneration for their works is counterproductive in the extreme. While I understand it would be rude to regularly promote a web-serial only available to paid subscribers, this is not that, nor do I believe such a web-serial exists anywhere online (except perhaps in SF&F magazines or the /New Yorker/).
