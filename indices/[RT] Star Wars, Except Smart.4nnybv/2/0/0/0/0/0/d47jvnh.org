I agree. I like going into a bookstore and read-skimming a few books that only have a few but worthwhile insights or I'm unsure are quality fiction. What about books sold on Amazon with a "Look Inside!" that extends to three or so chapters, however many the author thinks you need in order to make an informed purchase?
