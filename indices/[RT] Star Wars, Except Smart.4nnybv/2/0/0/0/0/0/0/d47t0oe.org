  What about books sold on Amazon with a "Look Inside!" that extends to three or so chapters, however many the author thinks you need in order to make an informed purchase?

Too easy to game, since the story could start very well and then go to shit and you wouldn't know until way beyond that. Obviously on amazon you also have the advantage of reviews, but that doesn't apply that much to rational fiction since so few people read it and thus so few people review it.
