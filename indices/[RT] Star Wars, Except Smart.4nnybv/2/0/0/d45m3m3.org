Hmm. Thanks for clarifying, and I'm glad it's available (and quite good)!

My beef was with someone who I assumed made semi-frequent posts linking to a patreon account on a sub full of works that are generally assumed to be readily available to everyone. Now that I see that OP was definitely /not/ such a person, I'll take it back.

It does seem that I'm not alone in this confusion, given the current voting on the post.
