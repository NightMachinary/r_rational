Good to know it's not just me.

I tried using the [[http://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/][Snowflake Method]] this time, and that's where I hit the ugh. I'll leave Tinker's Daughter fallow for a while, maybe come back to it later. In the meantime I've got plenty of other things to write.
