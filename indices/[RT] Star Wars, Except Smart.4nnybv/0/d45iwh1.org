I'm very familiar with the ugh field. It's not writer's block, since you know what comes next and are perfectly capable of putting words in front of each other, it's just a lack of enthusiasm that slows the flow of words to a trickle. I usually step back and try to work out what it is that I'm not enjoying, but you can't really do that when writing serially since it's so important to stick to a regular schedule. (I write by the seat of my pants by nature, but think it's not a great way to produce quality work unless you're also committed to editing, which I generally am not. I use a variant on Dan Harmon's story circles method and drill down to at least the scene level in order to keep myself structured.)
