There's definitely a middle ground. If I outline the flow, then I get stuck if something emerges and it messes with the outline. If I outline the general bullet points of the piece's trajectory, I get stuck if I run out of bullet points or don't know how to transition from one to the other.

I found a semi-solution I've had difficulty implementing but has definitely assisted in approaching that middle ground: I ask why something happens. Here's a story outline - ignore the spoiler tags for now.

- Marcie goes to supermarket [[#s][]]
- Marcie hears a robbery taking place[[#s][]]
- Marcie attacks [[#s][]]
- Leader hears minion's complaint - says she must back off or die [[#s][]]
- Marcie doesn't hear [[#s][]]
- Leader says to get money and go [[#s][]]
- Leader passes Marcie's corpse on way out [[#s][]]
- Leader collapses - Marcie is little sister [[#s][]]

Tons of flaws there and I'd stop writing because I couldn't make any sense of it. A supermarket so vast as to need to communicate via radio or shouting is robbed by a gang with an organized hierarchy? How much money is there? What sort of supermarket is this? Why does Marcie attack - is she the lone attacker? Is she the only one shot? Why doesn't she hear - or does she, and back off? Why is the leader willing to kill? How could Marcie's brother be the leader? Why does he collapse and not keep it together after just ordering a murder?

Now check the spoiler tags.

I think it's a bit stupid he never told his sister his plan, but I think it's consistent he'd feel shame for planning a tragedy in order to create a rallying point for the villages to fight against the gang.

While this would be a very short story, expand the scale of the events, and you still have the reasons behind the main characters' actions. You understand their thinking, their emotions, their values. If events effect a change in those three things, you can keep asking why; unfortunately it may change your outline as a result.

Major caveat: I haven't attempted applying this to anything longer than book-length. I imagine in that long of a work you'll need to plan growth of character in the outline, or you'll be surprised when suddenly your character's values or ideas change and now you have to replan everything.

This is related to writing a short, unpublished character piece for each major character, as I believe GRRM does. I think once you know how everyone thinks, you know what will happen if someone has an idea you didn't think up when outlining. If you don't allow for spontaneity like that, then your characters are pretty boring people and you'd probably rather hang out with more interesting folk.
