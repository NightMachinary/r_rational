Interesting. I like how you built out the frame and then expanded on it. And yes, you're right -- getting the characters' thought patterns down is a key element.

Two things I've noticed I need to take care with:

1) Put the camera inside the characters' heads. I visualize my scenes as I go and write that, but the result is that I end up writing what happens but not how it affects the characters. Now I try to write in 3PL POV, but still imagine the scene as though I were behind the eyes of the POV character. When I remember to do it, it produces much better work.

2) Do character sketches on each character before that character's first scene. Otherwise they tend to end up sounding much the same.
