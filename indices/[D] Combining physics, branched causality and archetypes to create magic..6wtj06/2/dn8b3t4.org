If you have real laws of physics, they always hold and they completely describe reality. There is no room for anything extra that breaks or avoids the rules. Any concepts such as "person" are approximations, not the stuff of reality its self. You seem to misunderstand the many worlds theory, it is a mathematical theory that does not give any significance to ambiguous, human centered descriptions such as "birth", "death" or "person".
