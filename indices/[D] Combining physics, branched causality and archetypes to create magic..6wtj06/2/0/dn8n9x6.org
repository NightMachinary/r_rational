I understand the broad swaths, and I realize that focusing on personal perception is one of those armchair refutations people tried to do with Schrodinger's experiment. The fiction is that the armchair critics were right. Just as time becomes effectively 'personal' with the bending of gravity, probability is 'personal' as it follows an atom through time.
