You describe the Fae as Subliminal archetypes without Materium or Etherium. Are there also Materials without archetype or Etherium (something like indescribable pure mechanical matter No-Things acting and reacting autonomously without choice) and Ethereals without archetype and Material (something along the lines of genie-like beings that have no form or substance that can affect causality)?

Combine any two: M + E = puppeting things/people E + S = predicting things based on primal patterns and probabilities S + M = changing the form or properties of things
