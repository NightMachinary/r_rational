I would say that stealing from potential futures to limit your possible futures could get overpowered unless it's an unwieldy process. If you could prevent futures in which you act lazy, you've not only gained resources but also ensured you're going to use them according to your attempts at optimization.

Perhaps when you remove from a given future it becomes "thinner" and spreads outwards, causing multiple futures to interfere with each other? The resulting actualized future would have a higher rate of coincidences, especially if you're anywhere near the future you stole from. I'd also suggest that whatever is stolen from a given future both cannot be something already stolen from the future, and its original will disappear at the same time it was stolen, to prevent item replication.
