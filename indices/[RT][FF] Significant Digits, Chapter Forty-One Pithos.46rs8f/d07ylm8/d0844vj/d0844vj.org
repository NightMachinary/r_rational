[[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/2015/07/significant-digits-chapter-fourteen.html][Chapter 14, Azkaban]], contains very mild spoilers. But if you read it and like it, you'll probably like /SD/. If you read it and don't like it, then I suggest just moving on. Read /Worm/ yet if you haven't, that's pretty fantastic. Or Tad Williams' /Otherland/ series.
