Heh, just finished this on the forum... the update rate at the time was phenomenal. 2 chapters a day and ending with a 4 chapter whammy. Anyhoo, here are some of my thoughts.

The premise was very interesting, especially since it somehow managed to take a typical OP Mary Sue origin and turn it into something that doesn't break much SoD / have terrible writing. Almost all the standard badly-written-naruto-fanfic-tropes (Uchiha-born, 'prodigy', reincarnated SI... etc) were used, but it somehow didn't diminish much from the story at all.

The ending was jarring... but I think purposely so. It meshed well with the particular neurosis of the protag' at that point in time. The way it leaves you feeling very unsettled at both the 'happy' and sad endings somehow matches the unsettling tone of the chaos that was present of the very first arc... especially since you almost feel like things are improving in the middle...

I do, however, feel that the ending itself - while great in concept - was not really well executed and came across as rushed. Then again, the author did state that they /did/, in fact, rush the ending since they didn't want to leave it unfinished, but was already exhausted with the story itself. For that, I am grateful. (reading a work of fiction only to find it is incomplete or abandoned kills me on the inside)
