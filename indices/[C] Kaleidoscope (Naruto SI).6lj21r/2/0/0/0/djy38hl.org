If the orders /seems/ immoral that mean either you don't have full information, or their are not legitimate orders. If what /seems/ an order is really immoral or criminal it's not a real order but fake issued by traitor. Traitors should be eliminated.

If Hokage seems immoral either you don't have full information or they are not /real/ Hokage. If they are not /real/ Hokage they are triator. Traitor posing as Hokage should be eliminated.
