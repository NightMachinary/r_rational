It's a story about an SI born into the doomed Uchiha clan and an attempt to leverage his knowledge into strength at any cost. From the story:

I must be strong.

If I am not strong, I will die.

Strength opens doors.

These doors will let me escape.

No pit is too deep to sink to.

No mountain is too high to climb.

Anything that I can do, I must do.

Strength is the reward for my effort.

With strength, I can be free from fear.

I must be strong. â€‹
