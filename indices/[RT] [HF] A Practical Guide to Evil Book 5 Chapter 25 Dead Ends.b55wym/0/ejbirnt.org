So...Masego's trying to repair the weapon? And he's testing in Arcadia? Or maybe the Dead King's taking a leaf from Cat's book and is dropping a huge chunk of Arcadia onto Iserre. Just obliterate the entire principate to get rid of basically every enemy army.

I wonder how Masego would be powering the weapon though. Diverting power from the Observatory, which is what caused it to fail? Plus sapping Fae, maybe.
