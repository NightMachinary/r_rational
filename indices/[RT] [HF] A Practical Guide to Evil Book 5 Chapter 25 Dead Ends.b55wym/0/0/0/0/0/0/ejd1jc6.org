i read it just to check, and no, they don't say either or.

basically fae are made out of power and if it's used up completely it theoretically could kill the fae, according to Aqua, and since we don't know if squeezing it out completly is like trying to get 100% of all the juice in a lemon (semi-impossible) or if it's easier then that we don't know.

the fae say however that they can't be killed like that by mere mortals, if this is just their usual arrogance or actual truth we don't know.

so yes it might kill the fay, might not it's inconclusive.
