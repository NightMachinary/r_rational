It's about a world where meta-story reasons are real (plot armor is basically actually a thing) and some people, heroes and villains, receive Names that give them great power. Names like "Black Knight" and "White Knight", along with many others. Good and Evil are more than intangible concepts, they're sides in a massive game played between the Gods Above and the Gods Below, using Named and whole nations as pieces.

The main character is a young (teenaged) orphan from the recently conquered Good kingdom of Callow. She takes on an Evil name as the Squire to the Black Knight, hoping to change the system from the inside to help her homeland.

Lots of stuff happens.

Yes there are tons of really awesome fight scenes. Yes the main character (Cathetine) grows in power throughout the story in a very satisfying way. Her main strength, however, is genre awareness - she is acutely aware of stories and how they impact the narrative of the world.

Read it. It's one of the best YA web serials for sure.
