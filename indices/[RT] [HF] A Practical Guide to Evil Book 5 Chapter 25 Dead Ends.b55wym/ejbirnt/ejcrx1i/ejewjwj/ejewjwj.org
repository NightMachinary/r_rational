If it's not this I'll be disappointed. Masego is easily arrogant enough and desperate enough to think this is a viable option.

Going to be a real heart wrencher when he fails. He haz yet to really run up against a true limit, but I'd bet this is one he can't overcome with any miracle. He's going to have to deal with his first major magical failure ON TOP OF losing both of his parents forever. Going to be very hard for Cat to convince him not to attempt TDK's apotheosis trap (which I'd bet dollars to donuts Masego is already well aware is totes a trap).
