Hmmm. In real life, the great advantage of early firearms was not that they were more effective in combat, but that they made peasant armies possible. A peasant with six months of training with traditional weapons was almost worthless in battle against a professional soldier, but a peasant with six months of firearm training could be almost as good - and there were a lot more peasants than professional soldiers around. (Napoleon was the first leader to push this strategy to its logical extreme; he implemented nationwide conscription and ended up with an army so much bigger than the standing armies of France's neighbors that he could have been a much worse general than he actually was and still won battle after battle until his enemies became more afraid of him than of giving their own peasants the means to overthrow them.)

Also, historically, most war casualties in the age of guns were caused by cannons and explosive artillery, not bullets - even during World War 1. (Cannonballs didn't just kill the soldiers they hit, they threw up debris when they hit the ground that killed soldiers in a blast radius.)
