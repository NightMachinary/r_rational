Discounting disease, it depends on how far back you go. Prior to 1650 or so(and possibly as late as 1700 or so), guns are going to beat cannon as a cause of death(early cannon were very bad outside of sieges), prior to the mid 1500s or so, it isn't going to any firearm at all as the leading killer.
