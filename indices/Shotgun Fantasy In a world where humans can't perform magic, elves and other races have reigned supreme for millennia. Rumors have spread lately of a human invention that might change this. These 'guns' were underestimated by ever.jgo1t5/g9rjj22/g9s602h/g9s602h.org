You need to go back even earlier than Napoleon. The reason that firearms replaced bows is that bows took a lifetime of training and conditioning, and a 16th century arquebusier was considered trained to an acceptable level in as little as two weeks. A man at arms took a similar amount of training vs a pikeman. This also happened at the same time that Europe was recovering and then surpassing the population hole that the black death had created in the mid 14th century. There were way more people, but the supply of trained bowmen and men at arms remained constant.

On top of this, you finally had hardened steel full-plate armor showing up, which was effectively immune to arrows. Only early firearms, and at very close range, could penetrate that.

All of this was happening circa 1500 or so(1450 to around 1580), 300 years before Napoleon.

You're also wrong about World War 1. World War 1 was the first war that artillery was the main cause of fatalities. Prior to that, it was always disease that was the biggest killer in war, not guns or cannon.
