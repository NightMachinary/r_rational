Adding on to what the others have said (speed of arrows aloft v reloading and tech evolution) Most guns that had any sort of mechanism were either wholly designed or had parts designed by people with experience making watches because of all the small moving parts that had to move within tolerance (which means there needs to be a history of that) each time or else the gun would fail in some way. So without that industry (I havent read your work yet, just found and excited) then there is a bit of a hurdle to overcome. Beyond that, for the weapons to in any way match the numbers needed for a war of attrition to be a viablke tactic would require at least some level of mass manufacturing which means a history of standardization. This can be mitigated in a similar manner to what the Russians did circa-ww2, multiple people for one gun and when the one with the gun dies, someone else picks it up.
