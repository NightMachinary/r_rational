Mostly I'm wondering where the evolution in firearms is here: Early firearms were primitive and took a long time to load, and arrows actually /can/ be fired pretty rapidly.

Also, if guns can be enchanted, why not armor? Not that you'd need enchantments---layered cotton armor was often sufficient protection for a few centuries.

The only way this works is if the humans went from "no guns" to "near-modern guns." Otherwise, the elves are only in a pickle for the short term.
