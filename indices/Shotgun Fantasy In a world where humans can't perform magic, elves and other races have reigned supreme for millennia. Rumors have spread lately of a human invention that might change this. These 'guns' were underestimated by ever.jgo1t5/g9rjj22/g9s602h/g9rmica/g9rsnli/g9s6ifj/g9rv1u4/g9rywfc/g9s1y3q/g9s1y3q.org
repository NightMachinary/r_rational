Time and enchanters, perhaps? Properly enchanted armor might be able to shrug off early bullets, but full armor enchantment might take quite some time, and tie up an enchanter for that period. And enchanters capable of the work might take decades, if not centuries, to train to that level. Bullet-proofing imbuements are presumably not the first page of spellcrafting 101.
