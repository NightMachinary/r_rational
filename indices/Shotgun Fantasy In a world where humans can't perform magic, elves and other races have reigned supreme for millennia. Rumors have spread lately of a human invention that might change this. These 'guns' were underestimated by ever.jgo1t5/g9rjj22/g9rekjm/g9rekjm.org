I've been working on this story all year, but I've been hesitant to post it here because I didn't know if it was "rational enough", whatever that really means. I guess it's more of a fear that my world building doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Still, I think there's enough rational elements in it that people here might enjoy it regardless. Either way, I'm curious to know if it fits the criteria. Have a good day!
