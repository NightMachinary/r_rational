From what I understand, technological evolution is very similar to natural evolution in that's it's all about selective pressure. It's hard to draw historical comparisons here but I would argue that humans were forced to develop guns quicker in this world due to a bunch of factors so their progress is different from ours. The lastest development at the start of the story is the revolver, which would put it in mid 18th century. Culturally and technologically, though, every other field is still in late 17th. That could feel anachronistic for some, but that was the logic behind it.
