It certainly sounds like the humans and elves haven't had a war in the last couple hundred years. According to the prologue:

#+begin_quote
  Even after some human nations gained sovereignty, the economics of magic were too much of a hurdle for them to overcome. After all, one competent wizard could produce more than a town's entire workforce. Unfair trade agreements ensured that their governments were still reliant on the elvish empire for most of their industries, keeping them subservient even after earning their freedom.

Subservient human empires which rely on the elves to supply them with basic commodities will probably not attempt to start a war with them, and in fact would probably come down pretty harshly on anyone they catch who threatens their relations with the elves. That doesn't entirely preclude outlaws, but I imagine most of the elves are using magical gear, plus many of them are spellcasters, and they're long-lived so they usually have enough experience to not make foolish mistakes. As such, they'd be hard targets and I imagine human outlaws would be reluctant to carry out some high-profile attack against them instead of easier victims that few would care about.

For the plot to make sense, the humans must have developed revolvers for use in their conflicts against each other, or as part of government-funded initiative to develop weapons capable of defeating the elves. Either way, once revolvers come into play, it makes it possible for a band of human outlaws to conceivably attack an elven merchant convoy. You're no longer limited to one shot followed by nearly 30 seconds of reloading while the elven spellcasters turn everything around you into a glassy crater. It's still high-profile and risky, but at least it's not suicidal at that point.
