The logistics of getting enough arrows is important, but the cost of production is more important. A smith specializing in recreating medieval weapons created a version of it with medieval technology and claimed that it was harder to make than a crossbow (which were very expensive at that time, and to my knowledge were only used in special situations or by special units in armies).

So he believed, (and joergSprave agrees in the comments) that the the magazine bows (referred to as SIL) would be a specialist weapon because it would be prohibitively expensive to field entire armies with it. They also have shorter range than normal bows so it becomes a trade off between range, speed, and cost of production.
