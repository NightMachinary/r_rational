Yup. Longbows were better than the firearms of the time, but longbow-/users/ were far less available. And the longbow had been around for a while - I'm going to guess that improvements on it were starting to be incremental and far between, compared to the relatively new science of firearms, which still had plenty of low-hanging fruit to grab.
