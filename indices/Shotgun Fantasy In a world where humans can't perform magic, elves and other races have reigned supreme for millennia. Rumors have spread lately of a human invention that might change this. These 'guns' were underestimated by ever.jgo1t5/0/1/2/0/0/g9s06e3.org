It's selective pressure from all sides.

Guns were used because they offered some slight advantage, but then there were responses to that development, and this back-and-forth fueled the development of guns and armor for centuries, without a single wielder of the fire-lance or cannon ever imagining the revolver or the submachine gun.

If there's no back-and-forth like this, then guns might still develop along certain lines in order to improve hunting (I'm actually a bit doubtful there, because the use of guns for hunting took a few generations of improvement, but if you've got dragons or something then IDK, that could work), but nobody's going to invent e.g. a revolver because the specific pressures which led to the revolver don't exist.

And if there /is/ a back-and-forth then the elves should already be acquainted with these weapons in a (less advanced) form. "Humans just invented the Gatling gun" is more plausible here than "humans very quickly through half a millennium of firearms development and the elves noticed none of it."
