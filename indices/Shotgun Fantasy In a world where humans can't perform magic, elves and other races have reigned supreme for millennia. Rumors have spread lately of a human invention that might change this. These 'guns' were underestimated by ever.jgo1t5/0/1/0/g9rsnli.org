Not meant as criticism, just some relevant trivia. I didn't read the story yet! :)

A longbow wielded by a professional archer did have a higher rate of fire than early firearms and I think they would probably have been competitive even during Napoleon's time. You'd probably have to get as advanced as the breech-loading rifles used in the American Civil War to definitively outclass them - but they still drastically lose the numbers game, though! Crossbows were like a worse version of guns; easy to learn to use and effective, but the reload time was sufficiently bad that they never displaced longbows.
