You're flat out wrong regarding the fear of aristocrats regarding "peasant armies".

Guns predated Napoleon, as did mass armies. The sizes of armies during the Revolutionary Wars / Napoleon wars were simply an extension of the increasing size of armies since the 15th century. Look at the size of armies in the Seven Years War, the largest continental war immediately preceding the Revolutionary/Napoleonic era. Multiple corps and armies of five figures moving during campaigns, and clashing multiple times in a year.

The vast majority of the soldiers on all sides were peasants(often conscripted levies), including France, Austria, Prussia, (all of whom were despotic absolute monarchies, and according to you, should have been afraid to do this). You can follow this trend backwards to the war of Austrian succession, thirty years war, Dutch Wars of Independence, etc.

These are not new things, and this is not a change from the preceeding several centuries. The real change came centuries earlier, when armies ceased to consist of nobles and their highly trained(nearly since they could walk) retinues, and began instead to be made up of professional non-nobles, who took up soldiering as a profession, instead of as a class. This trend toward professionalization can be traced all the way back to the english Balliol-Beaumont army and the Battle of Duplin-Moor, and was something that hadn't been seen in widespread use since the roman empire. It is also the underlying reason for the dominance of the English in the first part of the Hundred Years War.

The trend toward professionalization happened in parallel(and actually predates) the mass adoption of gunpowder. This is rooted in economic trends from the Agricultural revolution. Increasing crop yields per acre and per farmer created both a increasing population, and an larger amount of surplus labour to devote to things other than subsistence farming, like war(and commerce, and science, etc).
