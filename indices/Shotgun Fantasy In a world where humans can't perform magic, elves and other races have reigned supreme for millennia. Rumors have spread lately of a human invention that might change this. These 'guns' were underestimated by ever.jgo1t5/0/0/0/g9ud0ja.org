The weapons technology certainly existed before Napoleon, but the social technology to mobilize an entire population the size of France didn't. Pre-Revolution France and its neighbors were ruled by aristocrats who quite rationally feared that if they raised a peasant army, it would end up turning against them - and who also lacked the ability to collect taxes on a scale needed to pay and equip an army the size of Napoleon's (because most of the wealth was held by other aristocrats who could credibly threaten to rebel if their taxes were raised).

(The social technology to mobilize the entire population may also have existed in England, but England was an island and projected power with its navy instead.)
