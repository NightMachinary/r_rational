I never thought about it that way but it makes sense, since canon Gohan is quiet, introverted, smart, and fundamentally pacifistic - though he does learn in time that he can't always avoid fighting. Recently I've watched ATLA for the first time and I think Aang has also affected me a bit (though he's more extroverted and upbeat than OWP!Goku).
