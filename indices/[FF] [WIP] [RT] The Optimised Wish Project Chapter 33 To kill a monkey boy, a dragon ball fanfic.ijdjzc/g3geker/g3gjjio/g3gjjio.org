Thanks a lot! I really care a lot about the Goku vs. Tao fight, so I hope to do it justice and will only be happy if people enjoy it (well, happi-er than the average).

About the other fanfic, a word of warning - it's not precisely "rational", or rather, it makes things a lot easier for the protagonists and it seems just focussed on making them OP. It's definitely a good read though if "Bulma being a badass" is your jam (as you might deduce from my story, it's definitely mine).
