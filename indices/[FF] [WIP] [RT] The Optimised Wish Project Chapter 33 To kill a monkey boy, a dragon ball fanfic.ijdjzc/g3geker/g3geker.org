I wish I was as good a writer as you were, so that I could find the right words to compliment this chapter. I'll just list the things I liked the most:

Goku being on the receiving end of Tao Pai Pai's killing intent.

Differing effectiveness of HEP II chips.

Yamcha's problem solving.

I also see you recommended another fanfiction in the review notes, and I'll definitely be reading that.

Thanks for the update!
