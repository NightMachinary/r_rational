I'm working on a setting that mixes vampires and werwolves with lovecraftian abominations. And I need ideas and in particular a magic system for it.

If you know of any horror magic system could you link it?

Or if you have ideas? My own ideas so far include: All monsters originated from human experimenting rituals on lovecraftian abominations. One of the Lovecraftian gods is made of Sound. He covers the whole planet and chanting can interact with him and do magic.

Of course it is heavily inspired by Bloodborne but I wanted something with no parallel worlds and for it to make sense.

For example how I plan to introduce the CHurch. Most of monsters need to kill/eat/torture humans to survive. They can't hnt indiscriminately or humans will go extint. They are also unwilling to reduce human to cattle as different monsters group have different opinions on how to do it, and a lot of them have friends among humans. So the solution is the Church. It is an organization that regulates human hunting. If a person wears a cross (can be only given by Church roughly 10% of population has one) he is off limits as food. Rogue monsters are dealt by church hunters (usually monsters). Disputes between monsters are also often settled with Church help.

Any idea/cotribuition/critique/extrapolation is incredibly welcome.
