Yeah, I have played V:tM and V:tR. Read the new werewolf but not the old one. Currently thinking of having 3 main breeds of monters: vampires with mostly social ablities, werewolves with mostly physical ones and Kin with mostly mental ones. Kin will be some more lovecraftian/cosmic monsters. They will prey on minds of people, eating memories, sanity and sometimes everything. Not sure which powers to give them.

What else should I check on W:tA besides Black Spiral Dancers?
