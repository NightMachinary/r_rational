That's a useful list! Thanks. I've just skimmed it, but I'll give it a closer look. I have a few more impossibilities, but there may be room for more if I find some I like.

Filters not working on tiny salt particles makes sense to me, but I've asked a few friends with zero interest or aptitude for chemistry, and they didn't know that. They just accepted it in a Star Treky way where you just accept that Data says sciencey things and the plot moves on. So I think that works. And hey, if readers catch on to one or two of the impossibilities, that's fine. As long as they don't think the book is Bad Science and put it down, which is what I'm concerned about.
