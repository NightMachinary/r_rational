Not helpful for surviving, but very helpful for /staying/ in the city. He manipulates MC into wanting to stick around and look for treasure, which makes MC work hard to manipulate everyone else to stick around for a variety of other reasons. Then, whenever he wants to steer people in some particular direction, he feeds MC a motive to want people to behave that way. MC starts out with simple, self serving motives, which makes him pretty easy to manipulate for Steve. Steve never really pushes what he wants openly, he just happens to mention little things that points MC's greed in a new direction.

In short, Steve doesn't want to have to spend all his time dealing with people, so he picks MC to do it for him.
