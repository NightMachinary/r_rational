Here's one potential problem: your main character has to eventually realize these are scientific inaccuracies, which will require significant knowledge up-front, which means they will probably realize these should be impossible immediately. Will it ruin the story if they keep pointing out that Steve is breaking the universe?

Some things could potentially slip by the radar. For example sucking poison out of a wound is not recommended since poisons typically absorb very quickly and putting your mouth on the wound can be counterproductive since it can introduce bacteria into the wound. Even so, that's not to say it could absolutely never work for any type of venomous bite. And even if that's the case, not all snake/spider bites are venomous, and not all bites from venomous animals result in delivery of significant amounts of venom (if they recently bit something else, for example). So, call it a 99.9% chance that Steve is an idiot and that bite wasn't venomous to begin with, and an 0.1% chance that Steve actually saved that guy.

Another potential problem is motive. Why would Steve teleport all of these random people to Bumfuck, Sahara? It seems like he has very little to gain from the exercise.
