In a story I'm writing, there's a group of non-magicians trying to survive in adverse condition. They mysteriously find themselves in a ruin city in the middle of Bumfuck, Sahara. It gradually starts to look like they weren't just picked at random or ended up there accidentally, so people start getting paranoid and trying to figure out if there are any 'traitors' or conspirators among them who might know more than they say.

One of the things I am planting the seeds for as I write is that one of them (the 'baddie') is a magic user. The way the main character figures out who it is that they find exactly one person who is able to make things work that should not work. For example, they find brackish water in a cave system. You can't just filter salt out of water, the particles are too small. Yet one character just happens to find filters that can filter out salt. One of the characters is bit by a snake and injected with venom that later kills another character. Except, the first victim doesn't die because the mage manages to 'suck the venom' out of the wound fast enough. In reality, this is not something that can be done. The venom spreads through the blood far too quickly for that.

So my question for you people: You like it when things are factually accurate/science is used right. But... if you're reading a story and the characters start racking up half a dozen /undeniably/ false claims and the other characters/the plot doesn't seem to care for a hundred pages, does that annoy you, or are you comfortable with factoids being allowed to sit until they collide with science much later in the story? I wonder if, from the reader's perspective, it looks like I'm just writing bullshit while trying to sound smart. There are clues smattered throughout, like the chemistry student (from an earlier century) being frustrated that /he/ can't replicate the filtering mechanism, but they are probably easy to miss. So my question is, how subtle is too subtle, and are you comfortable reading a story where for a while it looks like the writer is propagating Bad Science?
