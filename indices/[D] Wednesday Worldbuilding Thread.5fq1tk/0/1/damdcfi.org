One of the ideas lovecraftian horror has explored is that modern religions are descended from the original cults that worshipped eldrich abominations, so this could tie in pretty well to that theme. It sounds like you're going for a bit of a gothic horror vibe, so I'd recommend having a magic system with some element of sacrificing humanity.

Gothic horror is at its best with villains who choose to to do bad things when they don't need to and the heroes want to do bad things when they know they shouldn't. The fundamental fear it explores is temptation, so it's always easier to make the evil choice. I personally prefer when the temptation is personal rather than practical.
