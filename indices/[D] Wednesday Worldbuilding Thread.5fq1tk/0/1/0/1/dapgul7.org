  What should people lose when they turn?
#+end_quote

Values and emotions.

Sacrifice empathy, become immortal. Sacrifice ability to appreciate art, turn into a shapeshifter. Lose an ability to feel your emotion of choice, get a (somehow) corresponding non-qualitative intelligence upgrade.

More general and permanent sacrifices allow more general and permanent 'augmentations'. Experienced practitioners could sacrifice a narrowly-defined value/emotion to get desired narrowly-defined power (lose [[http://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/23536922667/sonder][sonder]] to get clairvoyance for social situations, sacrifice your fondness for your favorite type of stories to get perfect memory for textual information), while unexperienced ones sacrifice broadly-defined pieces of themselves to get 'full packages' of inhumanity, such as 'kindness' for vampirism or 'civilizedness' for lycanthropy.

Less general values and attachments, such as one's love for a certain human or affection to a place, could be sacrificed to power one-time sorceries and rituals.

Lastly, you could sacrifice all your values and all your emotions to become omnipotent. Very ironic.
