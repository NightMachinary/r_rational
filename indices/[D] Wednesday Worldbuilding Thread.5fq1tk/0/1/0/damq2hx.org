  sacrificing humanity.

This is a really intresting point. If turning in a monster would have been a straight upgrade why not all humans turned into monsters? Humanity is a little bit vague. What should people lose when they turn? What will they lose as they continue turning more and more mosntrous? Ability to reproduce? Sanity (but then you can't have powerful intelligent monsters)? Empaty towards others (this way big monsters society destroy themselves as everyone is selfish)?
