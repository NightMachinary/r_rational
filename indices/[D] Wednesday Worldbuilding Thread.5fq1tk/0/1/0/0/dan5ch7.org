I left humanity vague specifically because it tends to vary in stories and I think it should depend on the characters. It shouldn't be so straightforward that rationalists can view it as a simple sacrifice for the greater good, it needs to have a punch to it. The tv show Penny Dreadful is not rational by any means, but at least the first season is a good example of gothic horror since nearly every character has a disturbing capacity for evil. They /want/ to make the wrong choice even though they know it's immoral or even against their interests. The true antagonists of the series are the inner demons that they constantly struggle with.

To more directly answer your question, I think sanity would be the best choice. Insane characters need not be stupid, they just have irrational goals. They can have their own patterns and train of thought, and may even be aware of their faulty reasoning, but what makes them monsters is how they embrace that aspect of themselves instead of fighting it. If the monsters are generally more powerful than humans, then their insanity may be one of their few weaknesses since it keeps them from taking the most effective course of action and leaves them vulnerable to fulfilling their arbitrary goals.

The problem with tying sacrifice into anything else is that it becomes a cost-benefit analysis. The question of whether or not to use magic ends up being based on whether the sacrifice is worth it, but when it's a person's sanity you can't be sure what will happen or to what degree. I've always felt that horror stories have to defy rationality simply because fear defies rationality. The supernatural should defy reality as we understand it so it can scare us. Lovecraftian horror is especially good at this since the basic idea is that our understanding of reality is just a lie we tell ourselves to stay sane.
