I'd suggest imposing a rule that all magic will corrupt people, even if it doesn't physically hurt them.

The reason for this is that we're used to stories about people facing physical danger. Dragons are big and scary. But ultimately, they have stat-blocks. So do massive evil armies or dark wizards.

To get the Lovecraftian sense of personal-insignificance and inevitable doom, I think you'd want to go beyond that and introduce dangers that can't really be fought.

For instance, the Church's magic might be "good". But, to use it, people have to really become aware of [[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-35-the-voices-of-children-in-his-tents/][human suffering and the costs of inaction]].

So, monster hunters would be useful. But they'd measure normal human experiences (like travel, or family dinners) in [[https://web.archive.org/web/20161019091419/http://raikoth.net/deadchild.html][dead child currency]].

The strain from this means that 'good' magic users are eternally pushing themselves to the point of sickness and injury. And being around them forces mundane mortals to face the fact that they don't care /that/ much about doing the right thing.

I'd do something similar with the monsters. Vampirism / lycanthropy should have major costs beyond injury, pain or an obnoxious diet. Otherwise, we can imagine ourselves in the monster's position and white-knuckling our way through the downsides.
