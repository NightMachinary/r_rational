What's the setting for, because that changes which answers are appropriate.

For example, it would be pretty flavor appropriate to have werewolves become possessed by an eldritch creature from beyond when the stars are right, thus changing their forms to become more bestial and instilling them with a perverse bloodlust ... but that's not really appropriate to a roleplaying game, because you're taking away player agency.

Also, what kind of horror magic system do you want? One which is explicitly about horror, or one which evokes horror, or one which has horrific consequences?
