Casting involves self-mutilation, flaying away pieces of yourself until the dark gods say you can stop. Their price is not always the same; they can smell desperation and will urge you to a fever pitch of tension, like a haggling salesman who pushes every customer just to the edge of walking away in unhappiness.

Casting is degrading. The dark gods want blasphemies from you, not just against what your society says is right, but against your own beliefs and values. They will ask you to call yourself names; they'll find your weak spots, those aspects of yourself you most hate, and force you to attack those aspects relentlessly for their pleasure. They will make obscene demands of you, because they feed off your displeasure. When you are finished with a spell, you will have to wash off the words you wrote on your skin, you will vomit up those things you were made to eat, you will likely be sore and bruised ... but the memories will remain, and though you might shrug them off as nothing, the dark gods are good at leaving a scar on the psyche. (Imagine the dark gods as being something like 4chan /b/.)
