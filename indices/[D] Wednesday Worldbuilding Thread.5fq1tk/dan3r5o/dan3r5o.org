I will be spending some brain cycles letting [[https://mindlevelup.wordpress.com/2016/11/23/equations-in-meditation/][Equations in Meditation]] (my entry for the short story prompt on magic) percolate into something larger. It feels like I went through lots of plot points very quickly, many of which could be covered in more detail.

Also, I'm by no means well-versed in the twisty depths of mathematics, so if you all have any suggestions for interesting "mathemagic" hacks, or weird ways of realizing math in the corporeal world, I'm all ears!

Once I sketch out some scenes and have an actual plot direction, I'll probably put the chapters up here. I'm unsure of my writing speed, and I'm pretty new to all this, so general suggestions are great too.
