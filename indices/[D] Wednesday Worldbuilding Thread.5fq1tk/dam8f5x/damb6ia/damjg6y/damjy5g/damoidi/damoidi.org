I actually was imagining that the military would probably use these people for surveillance and supervision (though I underestimated how useful supervision was).\\
However i'm working on a story where somebody with these powers is fighting against the government and they aren't really part of a rebellion large enough to warrant just using them exclusively as a supervisor.\\
Also while people with powers do tend to skew towards being genius's, and thus having lots of subjective time would let them invent things faster, these people are really not any smarter or more creative than they were pre-power.
