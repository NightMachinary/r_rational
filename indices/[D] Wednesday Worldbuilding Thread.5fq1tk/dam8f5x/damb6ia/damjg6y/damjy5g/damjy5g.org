  Like what specifically can you think of?

Using them to keep track of the logistical needs of a military-industrial complex is my first thought - make sure your factories are always getting raw materials shipped in and finished products shipped out on time, the staff of your NSA-equivalent and your soldiers on alert in case the enemy launches a surprise assault are kept on a psychologically healthy rotation schedule, double-check budget numbers to make sure nobody is skimming off the top, watch and analyse incoming intel and global trends to identify enemy strategies and weaknesses, come up with new and more efficient transportation technologies / routes, better weapons, better surveillance tech. Crack enemy encryption. Invent better encryption for your own communication. Put a bunch of super-geniuses together on making better superhumans. Coordinating tactical situations by keeping more factors in mind simultaneously.

I dunno, man, it just seems like if you have a person who can do many times as much thinking as anyone else, 'give them two guns and send them to the front line' maybe has some propaganda value, but only do it long enough to get some cool videos to show the citizens and then bring your golden goose home and keep them safe.
