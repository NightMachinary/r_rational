I haven't heard of this idea being used before. If, for at least part of it, the characters are reacting to this with some level of incredulity (like the chem student), I'd roll with it.

Also, the payoff sounds pretty awesome. (Though I'm a little confused as to why an antagonist would keep up a charade for so long, but I'm sure that's plot-relevant).
