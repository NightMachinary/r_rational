There is some level of incredulity, but not at first from the main character. He is scientifically illiterate. All he has is a gift for convincing people. So the one or two characters who know you can't do X express surprise or disbelief, but everyone else basically goes "Oh well, I guess the expert doesn't know everything", and the main character doesn't think it's odd at all. It's only when he learns his lesson about [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/kg/expecting_short_inferential_distances/][inferential distances]] that he can take a step back and consider the possibility that there is something else going on.

The antagonist has a fairly straight forward motive and isn't a very bad person. The ruins are filled with Ancient Lost Knowledge, but no food or water, and it's in the middle of a desert. So his plan is for the rest of the group to work hard for their survival while he browses the local libraries for the rest of his life. He sabotages all the ways they can think of to escape the place, but he doesn't kill anyone. There are other complications, like one of the characters deciding to become a robber baron, but the bookworm is the one who stranded them all there.
