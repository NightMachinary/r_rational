I'm very glad that potential problems were raised, and even happier that I can answer them, at least to my own satisfaction. Hopefully they satisfy you as well.

MC has virtually zero scientific knowledge. His one skill is the ability to talk people into things. The objections are raised by people who /do/ have understanding of their own specialities, most of whom only witness a single impossibility. When they object, they are just ignored; people think they must not know everything, or perhaps there is some random factor in play they don't know about. In the case of the snake bite, they find out later that the venom is lethal indeed, since the same kind of snake kills someone else when Steve isn't around. Now, the first snake could have simply exhausted its supply, or perhaps sucking on the wound did work, etc etc, and these possibilities are raised. On its own, it is not strong evidence of mage-in-disguise. But as the MC starts absorbing Ancient Lost Knowledge (mostly early 20th century-equivalent science), he learns a lesson in inferential distances (while the book is not meant to be rationalist, I am taking this one thing almost straight from Yudkowsky's sequences), and as there are multiple cases of experts saying this one thing shouldn't happen, he starts to consider the possibility that instead of all of them being wrong, maybe all of them are right.

Steve's motive for bringing people to Bumfuck Sahara is something that makes sense in the book, I hope. In short, there is an incredibly strong taboo surrounding the long dead civilisation that used to live here and their superior magic and technology. In the end they kind of all got killed off by magical WMDs that left the city standing. Steve thinks this taboo is bullshit. He can't recruit other mages to go with him there or they will burn him at the stake, nor can he go alone or he won't survive for very long (and frequent supply runs to civilization risks discovery). So he spends a few years hand picking slaves that have specialised knowledge and skills useful for survival in the city but no knowledge of history. He arranges for all of them to be transported across the desert, then hides among them when they stop for the night. When the slaves wake up the next morning, they are just sitting in the middle of a salt desert, with only the ruin city in view. They find this suspicious, but they also really like the idea of not being slaves anymore, so they set their confusion aside for a while.

Steve sabotages all attempts at actually leaving the city (as some people want to do), but otherwise just helps out a bit with the whole staying alive thing and spends most of his days just chilling in the libraries of ol' Nazi Hogwarts Moria.
