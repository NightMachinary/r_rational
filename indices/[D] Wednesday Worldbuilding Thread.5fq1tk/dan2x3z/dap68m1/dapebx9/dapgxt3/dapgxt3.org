That seems reasonable. I think that would work just fine as long as the ways in which Steve breaks the universe are not blatantly obvious to a modestly informed reader, but do become blatantly obvious when you think about them. Sucking poison from a wound is a decent possibility. Filtering salt out of water with some random thing/substance found in a desert seems unlikely unless it happens to be a reverse osmosis filter. I think most readers would understand that dissolved sodium chloride molecules are /very/ tiny.

It think you could also make the story fairly educational if you pick things that modestly-informed readers may believe and then debunk them in the course of the story. I feel like these would be more enjoyable because you'd end up learning about a lot of things which you may not have known were bogus. Wikipedia is helpful as always with its [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions][List of common misconceptions]], though I feel like many of them are uncommon, at least among modestly informed readers.

The trick would be to pick some of those that you think a modestly informed reader would believe, which you also believe you'd be able to explain why it obviously and logically cannot be correct.
