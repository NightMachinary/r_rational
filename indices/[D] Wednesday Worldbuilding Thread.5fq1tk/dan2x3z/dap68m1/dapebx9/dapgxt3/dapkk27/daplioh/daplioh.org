  And hey, if readers catch on to one or two of the impossibilities, that's fine. As long as they don't think the book is Bad Science and put it down, which is what I'm concerned about.

To avoid this, you could try describing things in a way which allows for some uncertainty that the impossible effect is even occurring at all. Poison from a wound is easy enough, and all you'd need to do is have someone ask about whether we know whether the wound was poisoned to begin with.

For salt filtration with some random substance/item from the Sahara desert, you could probably get away with it if the salt filter is rather large and sits out in the sun, leaving the possibility that it's actually just a solar-powered water distillery. If you're using a desert plant for the filter, there could be doubt about possibly just leaching relatively pure water out of the plant without any filtration actually occurring.

As long as you have to juggle probabilities of "Magic", "Coincidence", and "No statistically significant effect", you should be able to avoid turning readers off before they reach the big reveal.
