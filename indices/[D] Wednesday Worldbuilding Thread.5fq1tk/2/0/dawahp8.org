If they outnumber human(oids), then whenever you run into a random person on the street, he's more likely to be a god than not. Random strangers might ask each other what they're the god of, and since they're the largest species out there, you'd get a /lot/ of demigods after a generation or two. It might be possible for a god of something to disguise himself as a mortal - and it that's common, then when your adventurers claim to be mortal, other people might not believe them.

Actual mortals might be considered somewhat crippled or disadvantaged by /not/ having divine powers/abilities, and might end up being second- or third-class citizens. A mortal with a loose approach to truthfulness might easily claim to be the god of /something/ (generally something minor) which would be embarrassing if he runs into the real one.

Unless mortals are allowed to worship multiple deities simultaneously, or unless they're allowed to worship each other, there must be some deities with no worshippers at all. (Most fantasy stories seem to imply this is [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly][a bad thing]] for them).
