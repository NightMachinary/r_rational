I'm going to be DMing a D&D campaign soon where the world starts from the prompt "gods outnumber human(oids)". [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fO38qPStcyExou5EBbF5ESdx6of7UHG0Gr2mWqH78_k/edit?usp=sharing][Here's the worldbuilding doc.]] Comments or ideas are much appreciated (with the caveat that the world is built to support maximal adventure and have all the stuff that's in a normal D&D world).
