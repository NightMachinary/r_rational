*No* nerve signal latency? If that applies to signals within the brain as well, that's going to be a fundamentally different kind of processing going on. You might be justified in giving such a character effectively infinite thinking time, for example, as a way of narratively demonstrating what hapens as the whole of their cortex reaches a steady state simultaneously.

If you just mean very very fast nerve signal transmission, then the kinds of combat applications you mention are one way to go, but I'm not sure direct combat is the biggest contribution you could make compared to the logistical and tactical impact that kind of brain would be able to have.
