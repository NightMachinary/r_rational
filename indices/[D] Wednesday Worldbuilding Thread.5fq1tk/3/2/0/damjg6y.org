It's kind of complicated, all the nerves and neurons are directly controlled via the individual's superpowers. The person's mind actually resides in another directly adjacent universe and all the nerves can be controlled from there, the brain isn't even really doing anything anymore.

  I'm not sure direct combat is the biggest contribution you could make compared to the logistical and tactical impact that kind of brain would be able to have.

Ooh I actually want to know more details because it'll help with worldbuilding for a superhero type story i'm working on. Like what specifically can you think of?\\
The world in question in in a sort of complicated semi-cold war that uses superhumans to maintain plausible deniability for their attacks on each other, so military applications are likely to trump most others.\\
Also most of the rare people with these powers are not quite so amazing and can only speed up their perception of time like 10x not basically indefinitely.\\
I mean all I can come up with is some of them as supercomputers since they can run programs in their mind, and using them for surveillance. I guess they might control a bunch of drones at the same time also, but that would mostly fall under surveillance since drone strikes directly on your enemies would stretch deniability too thin, compared to the normal situation where you can claim the superhumans were rogue agents, of which plenty of real ones exist.
