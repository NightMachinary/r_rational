Ah yes I've read that one, though I doubt you could really perform that well as a single individual without the ability to interact with new ideas. In the story they have /lots/ of geniuses able to spur each other's thinking and whatnot.\\
I doubt a single individual in isolation could gain the same level of comparative advantage that they could in that story. Not to mention that if you are willing to spend all your time in a environment you create isolated from the world, then there is an obvious danger of gradual wireheading. A great portion of people with these powers end up interacting with the world only to get what they need to survive, spending all their time blissed out or otherwise not producing productive work.

P.S: If you have any articles written by people other than SSC and EY I'd greatly appreciate. SSC and EY links are good to but I think I've read nearly all of the popular ones.
