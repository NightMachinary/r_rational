Damn that sounds awesome and I really wish I could read it. I think these sorts of computer-like intelligence powers are incredibly interesting and are greatly underrepresented among superpowers.

The best example I can think of is the rational naruto fanfic "lighting up the dark", specifically the one scene (don't worry this isn't really a spoiler) where the fox briefly gets control of his body, but can only expend a limited amount of chakra and use techniques naruto knows. Even with those limits, through absurd efficiency and mental speed it manages to kick the asses of a bunch of full grown ninja until naruto regain control of himself.
