There was a fan fiction for Super Powered called Legacy that had a similar power.

The character controlled his subjective mental time. While playing in a super powered football league he would observe exactly what everyone else was doing and be able to think out the best possible response to it.

Secondly he could do physical actions perfectly as he could observe himself moving and correct or adapt as required. Applied to exercise and training this also made him nearly top human fitness.

It was described very well, such as how during a game he see a speeder coming for him and be adjusting his movements as he moved to block the speeder exactly as much as was needed while also preparing for the next parts of the play. Unfortunately it does not seem to be online anymore.
