So I was wondering how one might maximize the advantages of superhuman reflexes and a body that has no nerve signal latency, but no super strength or the such the main advantages are to the brain and nervous system.\\
The brain is so upgraded that one could at the extreme spend months of subjective time in a virtual environment deliberating with copies of oneself in one's mind mid combat.\\
It already occurred to me this could justify using two automatic weapons at the same time with this; since you could calculate perfectly for recoil and even use it to guide each shot into the next. However even this doesn't quite seem like the fullest optimization of these abilities.\\
It occurs to me you might want to use some sort of spring boots to be constantly doing parkour style stuff to make you hard to hit, since it wouldn't impair your shooting ability with these abilities. Plus it occurs to me that with perfect memory which is also part of the package you could be very well adapted to fight if you suddenly set off a smoke bomb, plus you could likely use something like echolocation some blind people use.

Basically i'm wondering what kinds of combat advantages might come with non-qualitative superintelligence. The kind of fighting you might see from a humanoid robot with a extremely fast human level AI in it. Some extra technological advantages might be appropriate if it wouldn't be impossible for a civilian to get ahold of them.
