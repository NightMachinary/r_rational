It would allow near-infinitely precise control of the body, correct? Then the character should leverage that to maximize the amount of information gathered and actions done in each moment.

The clothing should include tiny reflective surfaces scattered across the limbs and on shoulders, which should allow near-constant 360-degree vision. Tiny cameras would be more preferable, but that depends on the setting.

Small mirrors could be thrown to give a view of an obstructed location; while baseline humans would be unable to throw them with the level of precision necessary to ensure that the mirrors would be oriented to them at the right angle at the right time, and would be unable to perceive the reflection in a split-second it would be seen even if they do, our superhuman is not restricted so.

Perhaps other highly sensetive devices could be included in clothing or implanted in skin, to be activated by precise combinations of muscle contractions. Poisoned needles, communication devices (both transmitters and receivers), remote controls, flashlights, lasers, it depends on the level of technology available.
