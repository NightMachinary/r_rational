That's pretty clever. I'm definitely having these people wear glasses with monitors that display some compressed version of the feed from a 360 camera on their head. They could just run a program in their head that would interpret the warped image into something they can make sense of. Also giving them tiny mirrors to throw, or maybe just mirrored ball bearing, since they can dewarp the visuals from those similar to the 360 camera thing (though I don't know how much). They would throw these in order to see around corners and see things from different vantages.\\
Tech level is modern, but with some extra breakthroughs due to much more space travel. They use a lot of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pulse_propulsion]] rockets.
