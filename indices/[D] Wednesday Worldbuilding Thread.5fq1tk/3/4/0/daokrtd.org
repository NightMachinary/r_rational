Oh yeah that's well within his abilities. He might just spend a few (subjective) days looking at what muscles specifically are contracting and how, then he would run simulations of using the technique within his mind to fine tune it for his abilities.\\
Though honestly martial arts training wouldn't do him much good, he can already just run simulations to just figure out the best possible way to move his body mid-combat so knowing some basic stuff about the body and physics ought to suffice when he's taking his time. Though there might be benefit to trying to hide the fact he's superhuman, by not using his usual crazy hyperefficient acrobatic combat style that no normal human could possibly make work.
