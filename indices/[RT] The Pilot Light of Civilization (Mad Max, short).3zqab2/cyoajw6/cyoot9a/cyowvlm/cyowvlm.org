Yeah Max is this quixotic avenger who, if you take your view, is really a roadblock to future civilization. I was blown away by Fury Road when I saw it-- my favorite movie of the year, maybe my favorite ever. The film is gorgeous, insanely fast-paced, and so exciting.

It also had maybe 3 pages of actual dialogue, so it relied on facial expressions and body language to convey stuff which I liked.
