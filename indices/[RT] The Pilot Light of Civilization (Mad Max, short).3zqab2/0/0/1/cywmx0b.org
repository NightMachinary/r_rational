I disagree that the series as a whole presents society collapsing more and more over time.

For one thing, the films are not meant to be in strict chronological order.

For another thing, even if they were, /Beyond Thunderdome/ portrays a society much more sophisticated than that of /The Road Warrior/. In /The Road Warrior/ we have an outpost of sports gear wearing survivalists scarcely different to Lord Humongous' barbarians. In /Beyond Thunderdome/, we have an actual town with laws and traditions.
