I was doing my due diligence and watching the movies again (fanfic is serious business) and realized that theme of it, which I don't think is unintentional on George Miller's part. Max starts the series as something close to a police officer and just gets more and more feral as the series goes on.

Every movie is basically him killing a bunch of people and then moving on to travel the wasteland, alone and haunted by his past. And with every movie, the world has gotten worse, more degraded, so taken together they're about this slow, agonizing collapse of civilization and a man who's undergoing that same process, mostly because he can't break out of this backwards-looking cycle.

But I like the films anyway, even with that unexpectedly bleak message.
