Love it. I tried to steelman the villains in /Fury Road/ when I saw it with friends. I said the brutality was excessive but possibly necessary, especially the rationing of the water at the beginning of the film that's supposed to show Immortal Joe's cruelty.

This is a fascinating interpretation of Mad Max as rebellion against order.
