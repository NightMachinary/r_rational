Yeah, Origin of Species is honestly excellent and very well polished but if you're looking for something finished or that you could read every few days once you catch up you will be extremely disappointed. Especially considering most of the chapters are pretty short compared to a lot of other popular web series released once/twice a week.

I read the entire thing up until around chapter 85 in a handful of days and then realized what I had just done. Now I plan on checking back in around a year, maybe longer.
