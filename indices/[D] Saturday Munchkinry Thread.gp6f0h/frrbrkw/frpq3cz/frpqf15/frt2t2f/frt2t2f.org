If the function maps each product of two primes to that pair of primes, then if the prediction is garbage, this can be easily verified. Can this therefore factorize numbers without needing to actually do the computation (1), or can you send one bit into the past by choosing whether to complete the computation (2)?

In case 1: For any theorem, we can find a proof, for proof-checking is easy. For any algorithm specification, you can find an implementation if one exists. An easy way to break the setting one way or the other is to find the shortest program that will map each Wikipedia URL and timestamp to the article text (up to the present), then run it on future timestamps.

In case 2: If you can send one bit, you can send many. Send stock prices, research and news.
