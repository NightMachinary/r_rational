I'm envisioning that basic kinesthetics are still working, but for a tower of Legos you'd want to speed run only a few bricks at a time. Still a lot faster in the long run, since we normally operate in this "plan->execute" system, but need to allow back down to calibrate fine motion - I'm calling that final step plannable, even though it's actually a really repetitive problem-solving process that turns into a set of learned approaches over time..

The air effects have already come up - I'm trying to work out a way to let you move at basically normal wind resistance despite hyperspeed, but of course every solution I come up with has tappable boundary effects if you poke hard enough.
