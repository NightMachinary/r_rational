I mean, unless it doesn't. Any super power power is at the end of the day going to work by fiat, the trouble is finding ways to limit the "it's just magic" step (which they have to boil down to at some point) far enough away from the actual behavior that it doesn't intrude unless you go looking for it.

Super speed is a fairly standard trope, I'm adding limitations to see how its usage is affected, not trying to work out a system of physics in which super speed isn't nonsensical (because of course it is). The closest I've seen to the latter is in Doc Future, and I'm not going to do better.
