You have control over a pool which can contain up to 10 times the number of electrons in your body. You can siphon electrons into this pool, and dispense electrons from this pool. Using this pool, you can charge batteries or directly power electrical circuits.

Electrical circuits that you power from your pool (to include battery-powered devices) are under your intuitive control, as long as the electrons flowing through the control circuits are electrons deposited from your pool. You cannot affect macroscale physical switches, but you can affect digital ones. If you have charged a phone via your power, you can control every function of that phone without dwelling on the minutae of that phone's operating system or circuits.

Your control is subject to the speed of light.

Electrons deposited via your powers only remain under your control for the length of time that you have held them within your pool; you have instinctual knowledge of which electrons have been held within your pool for how long.

The intersection of the speed-of-light limit and the within-your-control limit mean that your control radius is limited. Time calculations are performed relative to you, not relative to the electrons that you control. If you hold a batch of electrons for a week, then charge the battery of a device that sets off at 0.9c, you still only have control of the electrons for one week, your time.

How broken is this power?

Edited to add: Someone suggested that this power could be used to bypass encryption and other security features. I don't think that's the case; the power doesn't provide to the device any knowledge not known by that device. The power-user would have to input a decryption passphrase themself.

If it's useful consider this additional constraint: your control over any given electron is relenquished once you've told it to do something. This puts a cap on the number of decisions per charge, and favors newer devices that use smaller amounts of electrons per change.
