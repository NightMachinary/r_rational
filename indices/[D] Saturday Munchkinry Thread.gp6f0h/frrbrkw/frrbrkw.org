Not sure this is munchkinry, but say today at midday UTC over the course of 30 minutes everyone gets a headache that gets progressively worse until they stop doing anything dangerous, so pull over on the road etc. At the end of this headache they have amnesia.

This impacts everyone.

My questions are:

How badly would this destroy the world? Is this civilization ending or recoverable? If civilization survives what are the social and cultural implications of this? Scientists can discover that there was a bacteria lying dormant that got triggered by some specific frequency random chance cosmic wave, or some other handwave nonsense.

How quickly would people figure out who they were, and how closely would they align with what their former self wanted? These days a lot of people have phones but most are password protected.

If this happened to you how could you exploit it to take advantage of the situation? Could you become president from this, etc?

I'm not sure what scenario to stick with so you can imagine if it was just declarative memory or if it's both declarative and procedural that are impacted.
