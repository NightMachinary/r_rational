You are properly careful! I was thinking more along the lines of DC universe, or maybe Worm or Doc Future, basically, as a toned-down approach to the power of the Flash (or Flicker). I started the thought-exercise while watching The Flash on netflix, and getting annoyed at how ineffectively he uses his power (I'm sure the territory has been well-trod in the many decades the comic has run).
