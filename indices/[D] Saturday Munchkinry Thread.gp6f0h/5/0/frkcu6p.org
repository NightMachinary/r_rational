It sounds like this power is great for monotonous repetitive tasks, since you can plot those tasks out in advance and execute them mindlessly. So:

1. Spin a turbine to generate massive amounts of electricity.
2. Would not recommend superheroing, because your power has very dangerous vulnerabilities that will quickly result in your death. Especially since you lack super toughness or super reflexes, meaning you could die real quick to any regular criminal with a gun that gets the jump on you. A simple bullet through the head before you can react is all it takes.
3. Depending on how 'impossibly' fast, fly. Carry around skydiving equipment at all times. Whenever you need to escape, plot a series of swimming actions upwards. Air is a fluid just like water, so if you can move fast enough you can definitely swim through air just like water. So this course of action would send you flying straight upwards, where you can then open up a parachute and slowly fall to a safe location.\\
   Naturally this doesn't work if you are indoors or underground, in which case you are pretty screwed if you need to escape.
