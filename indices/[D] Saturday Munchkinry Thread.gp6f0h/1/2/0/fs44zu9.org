This is already heavily employed in setting, most people use thin clients and a part of their taxes go to keeping up massive retro causal compute complexes that actually pay the compute debt. As for the locked up retro causal computer waste, it's one of the in universe factors (humans are planet-locked because of the massive Kessler Syndrome caused by frivolous delphic computing in the past) but I'm integrating your idea of simple but high entropy calculations being used to ascertain safety of the location in which the computer is placed (ie. a fighter jet constantly hashing list of known values at different time deltas knows if it has to dodge incoming fire presciently if the hashes start to not match the saved list.) Thanks.
