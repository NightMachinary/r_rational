I'm writing a SF thing, and in this by exploiting some esoteric physics humans get retro-causal computing (Delphic computing in universe), if you pre-commit to compute a function you can retrieve the output (return value) of that function the moment you make the "commitment" (this includes the function itself, the data it has to operate on, and a time delta to indicate when you want to compute aka 10ns if you want to compute in 10ns). If you are unable to satisfy the requirement, your prediction is just garbage data (but not trivially provably so). This is exploited heavily in universe to do heavy computation on portable devices and offload the compute debt to big offsite compute clusters, some other uses include running functions with known results on huge time deltas to predict your ability to carry out computation at a given time (this is used to schedule actually worthwhile calculations etc)

What are some munchkin/smart use-cases you guys can come up with, thank you.
