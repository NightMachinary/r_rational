Are there other superpowered people out there, or is it just you? Can you adjust your speed, or is it set at a constant level when activated?

If you're the only super around, and if you can adjust your speed, you can make a solid chunk of cash by beating all the world records for speed in narrowly-defined tasks by a believable human margin. I think Guinness pays pretty well.

After that, invest your winnings and use your power for nothing but tedious chores to avoid attracting the wrong kind of attention.
