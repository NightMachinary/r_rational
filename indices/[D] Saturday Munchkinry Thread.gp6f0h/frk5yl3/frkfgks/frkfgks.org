When I move super fast, do I consume as much energy as would be needed to accelerate & decelerate this much mass against wind resistance etc., or does my power provide? I might be able to [[https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2011-07-13][tap that energy source]], although it's really lame and boring.

If I were to build a tower of legos, probably I'd fumble a few. If I did it at super speed, would I be equally uncoordinated? Would a dropped lego disrupt the whole rest of my planned sequence, leaving me with half a tower and a mound of scattered bricks? Would it go flying out and smash through a window?

I actually can't think of many things that are worth much more when done fast than slowly AND don't require reaction speed. Extreme shoplifting or art theft perhaps, though that's not exactly economically productive.
