the former in this setting, you're not violating causality (any more than tachyons would if they are proven to exist.), and yes, this can be used to brute force a solution for something but you have to consider this actually ties up those computational resources so not many if any entities (in my setting) posses enough of these devices to make that a viable approach to solving problems. (ie. the garbage calculation cost is still carried out even if we know it's going to be garbage, you can't dispose of it without losing the retro causal computer that is carrying out your program) thanks.
