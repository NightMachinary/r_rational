An obvious and mundane one would be more powerful personal computers, by using the time that the computer would normally be off to process for the time that it's being used one could effectively make personal computers much more powerful without much more resources needed, interestingly people who use their computers less would be able to do more with them. I suspect that this technology would also imply the ability to do the same with lots of things, prescient resource allocation. For major computing projects people would make a relatively small processor, attach it to an RTG or something, get their answer and now people have to deal with a new form of waste that needs to be hidden somewhere and can't just be ground up. Also I assume this comes with a degree of knowing the future? IE running two calculations on two computers, one safe and the other not, if the answers match then the endangered one is probably going to be ok but if they don't then it's probably going to be destroyed.
