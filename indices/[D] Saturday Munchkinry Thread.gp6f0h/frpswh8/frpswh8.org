You have the superpower to make anything you imagine become real with caveats.

1. Imaginary things and any force/energy they produce cannot interact with anything biological or biological-adjacent. Not the water or iron in blood, nor metal piercings or drinks being drunk. Basically a very strict manton effect.
2. Imaginary things only interact electromagnetically (& gravitationally), no nuclear forces or anything exotic. So imaginary exit signs won't glow with radioluminescence since imaginary tritium doesn't undergo beta decay, and imaginary smoke alarms don't detect since imaginary Americium doesn't undergo alpha decay.
3. Imaginary things' mass is 0.1% that of their real equivalents. So imaginary lead would be slightly lighter than air, and imaginary mercury would be slightly heavier than air.
4. It's based on your imagination so if you can't imagine it, it won't be created. It will fill in the gaps so that you don't need to have a full anatomical knowledge of a frog, just the ability to imagine a frog hopping around. But it won't produce a kilo of technetium if you can't visualise it.
5. The power is creation only, no destruction (though their tendency towards buoyancy means they don't often stick around).
6. Control is limited to initial parameters. An imaginary baseball will have the initial momentum and trajectory its imagined with, and an imagined frog will be imbued with the intent to hop in the direction its initially imagined to hop. No telekinesis or mind control on imaginary things.
7. Imaginary things will appear where they are imagine to appear once a solid mental image is formed. That can be in your field of view, or even a remote location if accurately imagined (helps to use reference photos or video).

Given these restraints, how broken is the superpower?
