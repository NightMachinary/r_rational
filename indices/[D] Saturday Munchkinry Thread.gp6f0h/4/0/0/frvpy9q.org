I have doubts it's possible for someone to genuinely visualise something on that scale, but if you can fully imagine an entire star right here, then yes. The star would immediately collapse without the internal nuclear reaction to sustain it(even with a 1000x smaller gravitational force pulling it in), but the initial heat energy would be enough to ruin everything before that matters.

There some compensation for internal function, but I don't think there is any internal function that produces a working subservient platinum golem, so you'd probably just end up with a statue of a subservient platinum golem. A subservient partially platinum robot should work since there is theoretically some internal function that allows a subservient partially platinum robot to work.
