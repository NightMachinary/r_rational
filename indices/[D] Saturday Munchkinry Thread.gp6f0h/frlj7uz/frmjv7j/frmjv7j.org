It'd be interesting to see how much of a conversation you could have with smarter animals like apes, monkeys, parrots, and corvids. It doesn't let animals understand you, but it lets you understand their responses to your attempts, which is half the round trip.

To abuse the power... probably move somewhere with monkeys and teach them to rob people. Be a minor supervillain.
