Assuming this is Scribe, why now? Hasenbach was going to sign the Accords, and Black seems to be in favor of them at this point. Scribe's only known character trait is her care for Black, and I cannot imagine someone of her talents not knowing her friend had returned from soul-shearing and communicating with him. Sure, they might get someone more amenable on the throne, but unless this plot is completely guaranteed it runs a risk of pitting Procer against the Accords from the beginning.

It could be for revenge, I suppose, but though Scribe is known to vindictiveness I cannot imagine her misdirecting it. Hasenbach had basically nothing to do with Black's fall, so if vengeance was the motive it wouldn't have been against her. It could be the general principle of destroying your enemies, but right now Hasenbach isn't really an enemy of Black's. It could be something yet unknown to us, but this far into the tale I expect this to be a puzzle which, while not necessarily solvable, has all the pieces in view.

My best guess is this has something to do with the Thing in the Lake. We still don't know for sure what it is, but if it is another dead angel, Scribe could be taking out the architect of that impending disaster as a matter of course. Hasenbach's escape from the coup is evidence of this, even, as it provides a dramatic midpoint for the story of the Horror Unleashed. We've seen very little of the way Scribe operates, but we haven't seen her be particularly good at breaking stories. That has always been Cat's wheelhouse, so Scribe could be the pawn here.
