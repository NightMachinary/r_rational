I think it's to strengthen Cordelia's hold on Procer by the most classical Praes formula. Start a rebellion that was doomed to fail.

The Church will be seen as unreliable, which in turn strengthens Cat's position as an actual diplomatic entity to Cordelia, as she'd probably /not/ listen to the people who just tried to kill her.

On the other hand, if the coup succeeds, well... Cat's just going to be negotiating with Scribe's puppet. Win-win.
