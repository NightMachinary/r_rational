I think it was also mentioned in one of the calamity interludes earlier that Augur had two important limits, she couldn't intercept things that were not planned (Attacks of opportunity, etc), and she couldn't see indefinitely into the future, she only got warnings once a plan became basically 'fixed'. Still good enough to see troop movements and assassination attempts weeks in advance, but nowhere near infallible if someone is planning around those limits. If Scribe is behind this, it would seem likely that much of the plan was specifically built around preventing Augur from intervening.
