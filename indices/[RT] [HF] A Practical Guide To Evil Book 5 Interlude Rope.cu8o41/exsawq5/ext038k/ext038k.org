Makes me think - we've carefully deconstructed the myth of untouchable Malicia, and shown that Black can make mistakes, but even with the Black Knight as a close relation I don't think we've ever seen Scribe fail.

In fact I think it's been implied that she's limited more by ambition than by ability - she was always acting for Black before.
