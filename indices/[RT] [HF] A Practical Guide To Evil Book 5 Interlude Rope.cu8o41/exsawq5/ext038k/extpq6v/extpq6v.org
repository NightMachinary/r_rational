I think more it's also just a case of the calamities being forced to engage directly with more dangerous foes than before. Black lost because he was going basically solo against two of the continents most dangerous heroes while leading a crumbling army on a deathmarch through a foreign land. The whole plan was a tactical loss in exchange for a strategic victory. Malicia is simply beset on all sides, a large part of her previous untouchablility simply came from having enough resources to properly address all of her problems, now she's actively fighting two major powers while feuding with another and trying to put down unrest from two major internal factions, with either one or zero named under her (Assassin?), now that Warlock's dead. Scribe is still operating under the old model though, she's been placed in her ideal environment, only has a single opposing named to work around, and has had months to prepare. I'd argue that her success and Black's failure ultimately were both just causes of the relative difficulties of the goals Black chose for each of them.
