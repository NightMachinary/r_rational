I'm not acquainted enough with the /Conversion Bureau/ canon to have an opinion on it (none of the stories looked interesting enough for me to read), but I bothered to give a favorite/follow to this short-story collection in particular because it has several stories based on /Friendship Is Optimal/ as well as several set in the /Conversion Bureau/ universe.
