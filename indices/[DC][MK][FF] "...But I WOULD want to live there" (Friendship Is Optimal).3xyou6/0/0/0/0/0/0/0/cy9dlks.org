IIRC, the author is a person who considers ponies to be innately superior to humans (naturally peaceful vs. naturally violent), and is generally a little nonstandard in thinking. Some years ago, she endured a fair amount of harassment from some members of the /Friendship Is Magic/ fandom due to her controversial /Conversion Bureau/ stories, which many people viewed as twisting the concept of ponies and Celestia into a disgusting misanthropism--notice the very large numbers of dislikes on most of her stories.
