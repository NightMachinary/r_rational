/tl;dr:/

The setting is the /Twilight Zone/ episode /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Nice_Place_to_Visit][A Nice Place to Visit]]/: the (self-insert) protagonist is in a personal Hell where she wins at everything she sets her mind to, with no possibility of a challenge, and only empty, manufactured shadows (plus a single genius demon assistant) are available for the alleviation of her boredom.

The protagonist forces the demon assistant to study all her writings and all existing books referring to the Singularity, works out a loophole allowing manufactured shadows to be used to transfer information between isolated souls, creates a slightly-modified CelestAI with AI-shadows as a base, and transforms the entirety of Hell into Equestria, populated with both human souls and self-aware shadows.
