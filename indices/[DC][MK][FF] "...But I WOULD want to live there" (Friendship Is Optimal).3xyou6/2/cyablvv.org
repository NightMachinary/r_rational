The shadow-communication strains the sense of disbelief somewhat: allowing something from one prison into another (whether a letter, a symbolic gift, a shadow with a recorded message, or absolutely anything at all) seems at odds with the complete-isolation setting, so I would have imagined that would be accomplished by somehow subverting Pip's special access instead.

I did like the idea of getting person-level complexity (and more) within the prison by building it from first principles (rather than top-down simulacrums), and I especially liked the portrayal of someone taking those resources and thoroughly enjoying them instead of feeling isolated and depressed.
