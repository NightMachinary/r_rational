A standard blood donation is 500 ml every 56 days, which is 10ml/day, or 20 man-hours of labor per person per day. You have just more than doubled the productivity of the population. That's /huge/ in a pre-industrial society.

How are the thematic qualities determined? Are they a fact of the world, or are they affected by the beliefs of one or more people? If the qualities are determined by peoples' beliefs, then society would try to anthropomorphize things so that they have very strong, positive qualities. (eg. a dog familiar is perceptive in general (instead of just scent and hearing), a willow familiar is indestructible instead of merely flexible, a falcon familiar is fast in general (instead of only when diving) etc.)
