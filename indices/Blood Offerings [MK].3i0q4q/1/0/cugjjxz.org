Addressing these point by point:

It does seem likely that a society that takes advantage of the rituals will prosper, in comparison to one that does not, and so would grow to be more numerous and dominant in their (quickly growing) area of influence.

Two notes. The first, wouldn't it be possible for the elders to pass their knowledge on to the first vampires? That seems like it would happen much sooner, since it fits neatly into the paradigm of oral history. The second, babies are smaller than adults, and have smaller blood volume per body, which does increase the number babies that are needed.

I'm not certain I understand how halving the girl population helps stabilize the birth rate, besides eliminating the risk of death in childbirth, and having more years of life to have children with. Maybe that's enough? And, if they're spending all day inside preserving their imbuement, it sounds like they've got plenty of time to learn from the elders.

Out of curiosity, if all of the young girls are already vampires, why would they need to turn men? I admit the girls may be untrained or pregnant, but superhuman strength, speed, and durability seem like they might account for that. Speaking of battle and war, though, captives from nearby italic tribes could be another good source of offerings.

Using familiars to aid in the caring of livestock and crops is an idea that I hadn't thought of, but it seems like it could work.

Most of this seems quite reasonable, though a note: if the elderly are treated by red one blood, there'll be a wait time of around 3 months before they're safe to use in a ritual, as the red on erythrocytes die and are replaced with native cells.

Blood trading definitely seems likely. As it gets farther from Etruria, I cam even see the idea that it is blood being taken as metaphorical, after the words are translated and retranslated.

And, the status of emeritus does seem likely. Even if they can't have children, they still have value as a superhuman.
