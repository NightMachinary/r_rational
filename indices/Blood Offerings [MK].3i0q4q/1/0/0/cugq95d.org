I'll do the same.

Your first note does make sense, yes. I imagine the culture would still value reverence of elders, though, so it would take two to three generations before the initial vampires took over that role - by which point, the role of elder may not be necessary. The fortress would have been completed, and the vampires could spend their days teaching the young, meaning some or most of the adult population of that third generation would be well educated.

The second is indeed true.

In this scenario, I find it likely the female vampires would be pregnant for 10-11 months out of the year, every year. The birth rate would either improve or stay constant. With hardier mothers, the babies might survive better, and if not, then the tribe would sacrifice those that look like they will die anyway, and keep those that look strong. If a baby they decided to let live is about to die, they can sacrifice it for an imbuement without any cost (from what I understand of the system).

The men would mainly be insurance and redundancy. The females would be nigh always pregnant, and as you pointed out, would carry on the tribe's legacy of knowledge. The females would be at risk of death in battle, meaning if they die, the tribe wouldd need to both vampirize a new pair, have one of them become x months pregnant, and learn x amount to make up the loss. If a man dies, they're only down one imbuement. The men could also fight during the day to defend against an attack, and would not have the added complication of pregnancy when being recharged. The females would also spend much or some of the evening fornicating, as that would become culture, meaning they could not stand vigil.

While they would be capable of both performing their duty and standing watch at night, I don't think it likely their society would shift three very important roles onto any one segment of the society. It'd be too risky.

Battle would indeed be a source of sacrifice, but I don't think they would seek out battle until after the fortress and steady food sources were secured. The risk of creating a blood feud the tribe wouldn't want to deal with would be too high to be worthwhile, and pre-historic societies generally didn't war unless they wanted things from another tribe or were too proximate to other societies and couldn't just move.

I saw your comment on the 3 month recovery. The elders would be cleaned out of blood and not immediately essential organs, meaning kidneys, liver, appendix, heart, maybe some skin, and intestines; as much as they could take without the elder dying within minutes. They'd then survive off the blood of the red ones for a couple of weeks or however long until fully healed, then wait out their three month blood fast doing whatever.

I view the emeritus status more as having served the tribe (or full-fledged civilization by that time) to the point where they could serve no more. They would have no obligations, as might be expected if their status came from superhumanity. I'm sure there'd be a sizable segment of the population that would be superhuman, as it's likely the society would raid for sacrifices when short of ready-to-die elders and needing specialized imbuements.
