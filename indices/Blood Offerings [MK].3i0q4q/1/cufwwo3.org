What immediately comes to mind is that a cooperative society in which regular sacrifice is considered culture would thrive. I will describe one such scenario below, assuming we begin in pre-history:

First - who would be sacrificied? My initial thought was the elderly, /ala/ Bostrom's "The Fable of the Dragon Tyrant", before their health starts to fail; their bodies may have accumulated wear, but physiologically the elderly would have been healthy, because otherwise they'd shortly become dead. However, this wouldn't work until writing came about, as the elders would have all the knowledge. Babies would.

To keep the birth rate constant, girls would be turned into vampires young - probably from 12-17. They would be turned in pairs, each becoming a vampire as a result of another's sacrifice; they could be further tied to the village by keeping secret whose child was used for each vampirization. The culture would be heavily promiscuous, basically allowing the vampire girls to copulate as they will, sneaking into men and boys' tents at night. During the day, they'd sleep and do tasks in sun-tight huts.

Protection from other tribes would of course be paramount, and for this some men would also be turned into vampires. They'd watch over the tribe at night, and do things in sun-tight huts during the day, when not sleeping.

The rest of the babies would be used for sacrifice. The first ones would be for building a safe fortress. The next wave would probably be allowed to live to build up the population. Some would be imbued in tools or animals for the purpose of securing a stable food supply, and maybe move berry trees or roots producing tubers within the fortress compound.

Once they invent writing, the elderly can be used as sources for specialized imbuements, since they have a mind that can specify, or as blood banks. By this point, red ones will have been born. They will become the martial force by day, further reducing or potentially eliminating the need for recharging the vampires. The red ones will also be the healers of those not imbued. The elderly, if not healthy, can first undergo a treatment of red ones' blood. When finished, they will be healthy, and can be eviscerated and bloodlet for labor hours, then rejuvenated with the blood of red ones.

The blood of red ones could also be used as a valuable trading commodity, or means of spreading the Etruscans' reputation as formidable healers. This would allow them to form ties of friendship with societies without, alleviating the burden of attacks from pillaging peoples.

At some point the women will run out of eggs. According to [[http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/answered-questions/women-and-their-eggs-how-many-and-how-long][this]], it would be after about 325 years, assuming each female vampire is impregnated immediately after giving birth. After such long service, I presume they will become emeritus: still just as promiscuous, but revered and allowed to do as they wish. I suspect they'd turn their focus to whatever hobby or hobbies occupied their daytime hours in the latter period of the last 325 years; after that amount of time, their society would have advanced enough for hobbies to become possible.

Just a rough brainstorming.
