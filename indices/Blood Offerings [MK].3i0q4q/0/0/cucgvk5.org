Heightened productivity is expected, though it's important to note that non-lethal blood donation is only effective for recharging. There is no 'null' task for a labor cloud to do that doesn't require additional organs to distinguish it, and of course imbuements will consume the entire body of the offering.

Servitors, familiars, and vampires all 'consume' their imbuement whenever they are active (when the servitor is performing its task, and virtually all the time for familiars and vampires, excluding a non-instinctive but learnable meditative state. It's just that even if they're completely inactive, if they're in strong sunlight, they will continue to degrade.

Just like how the suitable tasks for a servitor are determined by the beliefs of the offering, so to are the thematic abilities of a familiar. You're point still stands though, and it seems likely that those who are given to be an offering for a familiar are going to trained to attribute as many positive attributes to what they are going to offered for.
