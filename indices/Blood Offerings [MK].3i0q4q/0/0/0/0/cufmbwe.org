That's all true, for labor clouds at least. It seems like it'd take some sort of aspiring tyrant who is okay with human sacrifice using blood offerings to conquer Etruria in order for it to be used, since from what I understand of their religion, mistreatment of the bodies of the deceased was forbidden.

Beyond labor clouds, though, servitors, familiars, and vampires can all run on non-lethal blood recharges, and all of them potentially provide work that the offered and the imbued couldn't do beforehand.

Out of curiosity, any idea how red ones could play into things, economically speaking?
