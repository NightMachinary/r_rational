The average human has about 5 liters of blood in their body. Assuming you can't "store" someone's blood for a later sacrifice, you have 10,000 man-hours of work. For an eight hour work day, that's 125 days of work, or less than half a year. Given that a dead person can't work, you'll need to pay for years of missed work to make it "worth it" for anyone you might want to hire to do this (Someone on the poverty line who wants to leave a nest egg for the family, or something), not counting the cost of death.

So generally, free market usage, even in a society comfortable with human sacrifice for material goods, is out. Any society that uses this will probably be somewhat tyrannical AND want something done fast. Large building of structures could be a use- Things that would take over a century now take a year, and things that took millenia now only take decades. You could build yourself a new great lake with daily sacrifice and be buried in *that*. (Suck it, pyramids!)
