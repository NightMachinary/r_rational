Hector seems a little less bothered by the confirmation that Polarity is a CIA seed asset than I think, or at least hope, I would be. He seems to be suffering from a pretty heavy normalcy bias:

"Oh, wow, that's weird. A super has suddenly showed up on my block without any public announcement that she's been assigned to a local super team. *Eh, she's probably here just to recuperate from that traumatic incident a few months back.*"

"Oh, damn, that super who showed up on my block is a CIA seed asset. *Eh, she's probably not here for me, and even if she is, it could be months or years before she makes a move.*"

I'm over exaggerating, but confirming that the CIA has planted an undercover asset /on your block/ would seem to be the opportune time to trigger whatever evade or cover plan Hector has developed for such a situation, if any.
