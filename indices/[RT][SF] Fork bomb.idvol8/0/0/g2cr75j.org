Great points. I considered your criticism and changed the switch to a trigger. So the simulation could emerge any moment, but the trigger starts the process immediately.

Your second point is actually very interesting and worthy of another story. Perhaps the world is a simulation, where the conservation laws are hardcoded, but the corner case of conservation laws in nested simulations is overlooked, and it could be exploited to crash the whole system from within.

I think you basically summarized the idea of my story with your paperclip maximiser analogy: what happens if you have infinitely nested simulations. Except I didn't consider the simulations being ideal simulation engines as well, which actually makes the idea more interesting
