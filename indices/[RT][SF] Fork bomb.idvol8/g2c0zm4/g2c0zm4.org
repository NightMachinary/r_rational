Nice, but IMO the premises don't really work. First, it's even explicitly pointed out: "We don't need to program a simulation in this world for it to happen. It could just emerge." - in the middle of a discussion involving a programmatical switch which makes a simulated scientist start a nested simulation. If a nested simulation could just emerge (which is quite plausible), then the switch is useless. And second, a simulated world with a finite amount of resources could exhaust host's computational resources only if the simulation can expand its amount of simulated matter somehow (by exploiting a bug which allows violation of conservation laws, or by not having those laws in the first place). Otherwise, the worst that could happen is a paperclip maximizer which turns the whole simulated world into a perfect engine for a nested simulation.
