  If you take the bold argument and substitute the tribal descriptions you could easily make the same cogent argument for the progressives, the antifa, the white Bolsheviks, the jews, whoever you have convinced yourself is the evil. . .

No, I don't think that argument works for non-fascists. Jews, progressives, and even Bolsheviks simply don't consider truth and morality to be /defined by/ tribal membership. That's a fairly unique feature of fascism.

Anarchists can be /very/ tribal and violent on all the wrong occasions, too, but I've never heard them say that anarchists and non-anarchists simply have "different truths".

There's a specific feature being targeted here, and it's the willingness to engage in one-sided moral and epistemic relativism, where someone uses the threat of violence or overt violence to simply kill away any evidence that their desired worldview is incorrect. That is a violent way to think, and the rest of us have to defend ourselves against it.

  they really have designated their out-group as a legitimate target for initiation of violence

This is a strange thing to say. The overwhelming supermajority of my outgroup are not totalitarians or fascists at all.
