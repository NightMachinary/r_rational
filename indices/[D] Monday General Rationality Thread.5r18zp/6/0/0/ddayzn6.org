Thank you, I appreciate the freedom to return and you seem to have the right vision for the community, but I will simply be absenting myself from participation in [[/r/rational]]. I like it here but I'm walking away from social media in general for a while and here in specific; time to do something constructive that doesn't upset me.

[[/u/eaturbrainz]] had some things to say when we first engaged on this last week and he lowered his ranking as a mod.

  *Then there's the place I draw the line for preemptive violence. That's open, knowing, self-aware* [label]. Not being deceived. Not voting one way when you could have gone the other out of misguided fear, or hope. *That's the line: when you consider epistemic and moral truth to be determined by membership in your tribe,* thus setting up life in general as a war for supremacy between those tribes, then you are [label], and you should get bashed.

If you take the bold argument and substitute the tribal descriptions you could easily make the same cogent argument for the progressives, the antifa, the white Bolsheviks, the jews, whoever you have convinced yourself is /the evil/. . .

If you can't step back enough to see that well I hope the death toll for antifascists shot in self defense doesn't get too high. One is too high.

I'm not going to debate [[/u/eaturbainz]]. They have abandoned civil debate and the marketplace of ideas, thier flair is a little thing their flair, but they stepped down as a mod rather than change it, so they /really/ have designated their out-group as a legitimate target for initiation of violence. It doesn't matter who you decide to silence or who you want up against the wall when the revolution comes.

I will give full credit to [[/u/eaturbainz]] 's rhetorical skill trying to set up the argument where I have to defend hate speech the and all the other ills in society that would end, if we just silenced [viewpoint] or started beating the shit out of [tribe] whenever they spoke up.

I want to say I'm sorry I made my accusation while angry and intoxicated. I won't. I am sorry I reduced it's credibility by being intoxicated though. I am aware of the irony of in-civilly demanding someone censor their own speech and that is part of why I'm taking a break, but you have to have a line, a schilling fence, or something. I won't participate in the discussions in a community where we try to raise the sanity waterline and moderators argue to abandon civilization. [[/u/eaturbraiz]] should not be censured, he has his beliefs and I spent a long time in the "I will kill or die for your freedom to say that" tribe and profession and it's an attitude I still hold.
