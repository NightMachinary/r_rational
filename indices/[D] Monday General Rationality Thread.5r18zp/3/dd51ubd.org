Hyporhetically speaking, would there be any way to get someone here to write an story based on my world building and ideas?

I ask because I am a bit lazy and don't have plenty of free time. I do have lots of ideas and general direction the story should go, since every spare time i get my mind pops something out, and I do have some research to back the ideas and plans.

Not sure how the communication would go between writer and me though.
