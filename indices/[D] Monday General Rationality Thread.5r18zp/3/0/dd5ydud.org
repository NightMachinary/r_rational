I think in general people prefer world-building to writing, which is why there's a limit on the amount of brainstorming posts you're allowed to make unless you are regularly writing. So I think it's going to be hard to find someone who wants to essentially do all the /hard parts/ of writing a story (characters, plot, making the words flow, proofreading, etc), would be good at it, and doesn't already have an idea they want to pursue. As we've seen on the worldbuilding wednesday threads, people love to come up with ideas for worlds, but much fewer of them actually post chapters, because daydreaming about how magic would work is /fun/, but sitting down and figuring out how to describe the taste of coffee when you don't drink the stuff (what I did last night: turns out there's like coffee taste wheels so it isn't that hard), or trying to work out logistically how civillians could travel between cities during WW2, or any number of "chores" that comes with /actual writing/, is not fun in the same way.

Basically, you'd need to be a popular person (e.g. webcomic artist) who could give people /actual Exposure//who people would be happy just getting attention from because you're a celebrity, or your setting would have to be /astronomically good/ so actual accomplished writers would be intrigued by it, and probably you'd need to only want a short story rather than a full novel since novels take /forever/.

Not sure what your setting's like, or how famous you are, or what exactly you want in terms of length and style. But to be honest I think your best hope would be to commission it from a ghostwriter, but I'm sure that wouldn't be cheap. Alternatively, if you have some other skill, you might be able to trade that for writing (e.g. I might trade time writing for time someone else spends doing art of my characters).
