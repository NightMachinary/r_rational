"Everything is estimates" is the problem. Pretending to be an omnipotent supercomputer will not actually get you any closer to being an omnipotent supercomputer. You are physically incapable of actually using Bayes theorem on real systems in your head with even a single digit of accuracy, for example, and it is unhelpful and delusional to think that you can - even if you knew all the information.

Obviously if we were all gods, we'd just do whatever ends best. But we're not. So systems of morality, in the context of human behaviors, are largely about /how you estimate that./ What approximations are acceptable, what heuristics do you use, how do you account for chaotic indirect ripple effects? How would you /actually use/ this alleged system of morality?
