*/Towards a Pragmatic System of Morality/*

 

I decided some time ago, to forego conventional morality. I realised it was limiting, an view it as an unnecessary hindrance. I needed a new system of morality, and thought about developing one. I subscribe to a whole lot of philosophical systems, and dislike a few. I dislike idealism. I strongly loathe egalitarianism. I'm neutral on communism/socialism and marxism(read don't know enough to come to a more objective conclusion). I subscribe to consequentialism, naturalism, realism, utilitarianism, rationalism, pragmatism and hedonism. For my system of morality, I decided to choose one which would not serve as a goal limiter, but rather a goal enabler. Something which will empower me to achieve my goals. For my system of morality, I decided to make it simple, and came up with these few statements:

"Right" is any decision which has a positive payoff. I.e the consequences of that decision were positive. As opposed to: "right is any decision which is rational" Thus buying a lottery ticket and winning is a right decision. "Wrong" is any decision which has a negative payoff. I.e the consequences of that decision were negative. As opposed to: "wrong is any decision which is irrational" Thus buying a lottery ticket and losing is a wrong decision. "Do insomuch as you do not regret".

Point "3" is merely a bit of personal wisdom. If one lives like that it allows them to maximise their happiness(which is a form of utility), and allows them to die with pride. I think it will let one live a "good" life. The morality of an action can only be evaluated in hindsight; an inherent limitation, but I still think it serves me best. We do not worship rationality, and what is rational is not always "right". I believe strongly in results. Results take precedence, if irrationality produces the best results, then sticking stubbornly to our own rationality is 'sunk cost bias' or worse simply unscientific. Science after all holds empiricism as king. And I am nothing, if not a scientist. It is quite possible(not probable, merely possible) that there is an individual of such exceeding luck that conventional probability theory does not apply to them, and thus the methods of rationality are not the best decision making tools for them. If they produce results, they're decisions are "right". Fortunately or unfortunately, I do not consider myself such an individual, and am not sure I entirely wish to(for such a scenario, seems to be bound to the whims of fate, making one a slave to another and not a master themselves). I do not believe in predestination or determinism, and believe that at T-1, there are a vast array of possible futures for T. Giving such a situation, it is merely natural that I try to maximise my probability of making a right decision. As such, bayesian decision making seems suited to me. I think my proposed system of morality, is a sensible one; Letting the results speak for themselves, as opposed to stubbornly sticking to a way of thought. I think it is a scientific system of morality. Indeed, I think it is a rational moral system. Discuss other systems of morality, propose changes to mine, point out faults with mine, etc.
