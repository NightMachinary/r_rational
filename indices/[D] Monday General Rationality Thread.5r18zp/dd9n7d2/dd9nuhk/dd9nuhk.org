Which guy? Oh, you mean Milo? My answer is to [[http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/07/milo-yiannopoulos-and-the-gay-fascist-sophisticate.html][point over here]] and say... /kinda/. Not sure if he's /fully/ fascist.

But also, /he didn't get punched/. Instead, the town of Berkeley got half its downtown and the UC Berkeley campus set on fire. Since all that accomplished was to send Milo driving somewhere else while troll-tweeting, "oh horror horror look at these dreadful leftists" (a rhetorical trick you've totally fallen for, by the way), I'd actually say it was a waste of good rioting effort. On consequentialist grounds, it didn't accomplish much and so wasn't really all that justified.

Of course, the other side of the matter is that they riot for /everything/ in the East Bay. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_riots][They rioted several times over for the Super Bowl in Oakland.]] /What the East Bay riots about/ is not actually a very good judge of political militancy at all, since /those guys just like rioting/.

Ok, so you mean the rioting and fire-setting in Berkeley?

  if you remain a mod here and espouse this violence against dissenters is justified then, please just ban me I want nothing to do with an organization where you retain leadership.

I'm not actually the head mod anymore, because [[/u/traversada]] requested I not be while retaining this flair. I am not going to ban you so you can make a symbolic statement about me. You've done nothing wrong.
