  Is hateful speech a legitimate rationalization to violence?
#+end_quote

I again implore you to operate in a consequentialist mode rather than a deontological one.

/Is/ hateful speech a legitimate reason for violence? Well, let's break the question down into separate questions. We'll have beliefs about those questions, and beliefs can be tested or discussed:

- Does hateful speech /cause/ violence /against its targets/, rather than merely against the speaker?

- Does violence against hate-speakers actually make them stop, or at least counteract the tendency of what they say to cause hate-violence?

- Is such violence larger or smaller than the amount of violence unleashed by the hate-speakers themselves?

- In the background, how strong, and how fair, do we think the basic social fabric is?

- Do we think we can call the lawful authorities to protect people who are threatened with violence, no matter what sort of opinions they hold, who they are, or who threatens them?

I have some beliefs about all of these questions, but I think to resolve the conversation, it's more useful to explore /your/ beliefs about these questions.
