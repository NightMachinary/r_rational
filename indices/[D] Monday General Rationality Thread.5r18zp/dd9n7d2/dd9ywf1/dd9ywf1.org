OK, looks like it falls to me to be a neutral party.

[[/u/Empiricist_or_not]], you will not be banned simply because you don't want to be involved here. In lieu of a position to resign, you are obviously free to simply stop posting on and reading this forum.

[[/u/eaturbrainz]], please consider changing your flair and avoiding abrasive political comments. They are not the going to win hearts and minds against fascism in this forum, and are certainly not the most effective way to do so. Detailed commentary on political violence will be welcome /if and only if it is delivered as rational fiction./

While we have no formal rules about incitement to violence - and I do not think that line has yet been crossed - it is not welcome and I will not allow it. For the record I do not intend to have a rule against any specific kind of inappropriate content or interaction, but will deal with such issues in whatever way I think best serves [[/r/rational]] as they arise.

My priority in this capacity is the ongoing health of [[/r/rational]], so I would prefer to see this resolved by mutual agreement and see no reason we cannot.
