You forgot another model that is in some ways scarier. Trump refused to accept reality and then pressured everyone under him to push his alternate reality. Trump's narcissistic tendency to lie to himself and then communicate his false belief as absolute fact enabled him to succeed at building his brand despite setbacks and failures, and it even got him elected, but it makes him a serious liability in terms of ability to actually make rational decisions.

So in the case of crowd size, Trump refused to accept that Obama did better than him, to the point of positing a conspiracy by the media and making everyone underneath him agree with him.
