I think, in the case of politicians, it is okay to speculate about complex stuff going on in the background. Taking the outside view even, Trump did manage to get elected. However, a lot of the complex speculation falls apart when looking at the details of Trump's actions... 3am tweets attacking a Gold Star Family or a beauty pageant winner seem pointless by even the standard of raising media attention.

So yeah, I agree with you, although much, much, earlier (like during the primaries) I was considering the 5D chess type hypotheses.
