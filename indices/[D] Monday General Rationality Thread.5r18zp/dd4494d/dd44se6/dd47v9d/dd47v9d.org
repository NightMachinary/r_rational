I dunno. That one seems to posit a level of mental impairment or personality disorder that seems unlikely. I don't know what specific disorders could cause such behavior or what their incidence is among the general population, but I would guess that it's small enough to require strong and specific evidence to make that a competing or reasonably likely theory. Trump has certainly shown a bullying, egotistical, narcissistic personality in the past but /actual/ internal denial of reality in the face of this level of evidence I would think would indicate sever paranoia at the least in the case that he thinks everyone is saying all these things just to sabotage him, or else outright schizoaffective disorder if there's some other rationalization at work.

IIRC, there's some metadata associated with Trump's tweets showing the angrier, more negative, more personal tweets are actually coming from him, and with apparently little filter through his staff. If he were actually suffering from some paranoid delusions, I'd have expected some specific element of those delusions to have made it out through that avenue if no where else.

It might be that his focus on China as a global bully attacking the US, Mexicans as a horde of rapists and thieves flooding across the border, and Muslims as nightmare boogeymen out to kill us all /are/ indicative of paranoid delusion, but if so they're curiously well timed and politically salient for a guy who was running for office, and I lack the psychological expertise to judge if they actually hint at disorder.
