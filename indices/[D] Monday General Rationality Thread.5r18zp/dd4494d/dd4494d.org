Without wading too deep into the political waters of what Donald Trump *should or should not* be doing, I'd like to get people's take on what he actually *is* doing and what level people think he's operating on. Specifically, or as an example, the Sean Spicer/Inauguration Crowd incident.

I've heard at least three different theories as to how/why it happened. From most to least cunning, I'll call them 5D Chess, Dead Cat, and PR Dominance.

--------------

*5D Chess:*

This theory posits, as basically they all do that Donald Trump directly ordered Sean Spicer to lie about the inauguration crowds, and did so with a deliberate intention of having it be recognized as a lie in at attempt to signal different things to different groups.

To all executive branch staff, it signals that they'll be expected to lie on behalf of the administration, and that such orders can and will come down from the very top.

To the press it makes it clear that the administration will be presenting its own set of facts regarding /everything/ and that access/information, etc. will depend on reporting of those facts either as accurate or at least as credible alternatives to other sources.

To Trump supporters it puts them in the bind of either having to either internalize and go along with the administration's narrative, recognize it as a lie but defend it to opponents, or else remove themselves from the political discourse.

To Trump opponents, it signals that the administration is completely willing to disregard facts, and so disarms much of their plans to lobby and conduct PR campaigns based on evidence, knowing they'll get no concessions, and forcing them to play Trump's game of emotional populist appeal which he prefers.

To those in the middle or disinterested in politics, it just makes everyone look like they're arguing about nothing, and pushes them further away from the "negotiating table".

*Dead Cat:*

"If you don't like the conversation, throw a dead cat on the table, and suddenly the conversation becomes about a dead cat."

This theory is that the order was given with the intention of it being recognized as a lie, but rather than for signalling purposes, it was merely with the intent of distracting the media from reporting something else. Specifically /what/ it's supposed to distract from people differ on, from simply minimizing reporting and scrutiny on cabinet appointments and executive orders, to the more conspiratorial theory that Russia's sale of ~20% of one of the state owned oil companies to a mix of disclosed and undisclosed buyers was a payoff to Trump or one of his inner circle, and which Reuters published a story about around the same time.

*PR Dominance*

This theory is similar to 5D Chess, but lacking any intention to signal to the press, Trump's opponents, or the in-betweeners, just Trump's supporters and staff.

This theory is that the statement was ordered as part of a continuing populist PR campaign by Trump, expecting that his supporters would take the statements and use them as ammunition to gainsay or "refute" negative press about the event, even if only to themselves.

To his staff it again signals that he can and will issue direct orders requires lying or compromising their positions and relationships, and that these are expected to be followed.

--------------

Of the 3, PR Dominance reflects the lowest level of savvy on Trump's part, and I think is mostly put forth as an attempt to portray him as vain and desperate for a measure of popular support and respect, even if only from a dedicated cohort, and liken him to the kind of bad boss that most people have or think they have experience with at work.

I'll note, however, that a desire to pursue and maintain that kind of populist support is about the only thing that seems to explain the nature of his inauguration speech, and maintaining his own narrative of "facts" was a significant part of his campaign strategy.

Dead Cat to me feels most likely in terms of savvy, and I get the impression that while much of Trump's own campaign speeches and rhetoric were based on creating a narrative of "facts", he's proved time and time again that he'll reach for some kind of big, headline grabbing outburst to drive media coverage whenever his opponents were beginning to gain traction.

My objection to this theory is that while it probably has done some to muddy the waters, the fact that is was so easily disprovable has raised a lot of suspicion and caused a lot of scrutiny, so if it was meant to distract from some of the recent executive orders, it may have backfired.

5D Chess was based on a discussion I heard on NPR last week with a Poli. Sci. professor IIRC, but frankly it seems like an overreach to me. Every press outlet in the WHPC jumped on how easily disprovable the administration's numbers were, so they seem to have had the exact opposite reaction intended if there was an intention. Conway's "alternative facts" line gave Trump's opponents all the ammo they needed to discredit the administration's narrative rather than having to pivot towards emotional appeals, and Trump's supporters haven't been pushing the view that the administration's narrative was actually correct AFAIK (though I don't get nearly as much exposure to his supporters, so that may be a sampling or availability bias issue)

*tl;dr:* Is Trump a populist still trying to drum up support and a CEO trying to get his employees in line, a media manipulator deflecting attention and scrutiny, or a signalling mastermind who overplayed his hand? Something else?
