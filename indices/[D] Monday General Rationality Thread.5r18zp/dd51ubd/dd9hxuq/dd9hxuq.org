If you want to do world building with minimal writing... have you considered [[/r/makeyourchoice]] ? People post CYOAs with pictures and text that describe options that players can take, using a variety of systems, sometimes there are point build systems with bonus points for disadvantages and point costs for perks, others are just a single choice, some with mystery box choices, etc. Many CYOAs are just a single choice with little setup, but sometimes quite a bit of world building goes into just the choices alone. A few like Crossworld or Jumpchain, may have a sprawling loosely connected narrative. I've been experimenting with doing CYOAs all set in a single setting with a more tightly connected narrative, (only about halfway through with the main story, a fourth if I count all the side stories I want to do, I'll let you know how it worked out as a world building exercise when I finish)

So anyway, if you wrote your world as a CYOA, you would get some players that just treated it as a min-maxing exercise, some that try to build a character with a specific flavor, and some that just make the choices that fit them. Some will write the bare minimum of just picking their choices, others will write short justifications, and other will write full narratives. Some CYOAs will bribe players with extra points or choices if they write up narratives to go with their choices.

Anyway a few good examples of CYOA with heavy worldbuilding:

You may notice a few short snippets I posted with some CYOAs, I am using them as an easy practice for writing were I am guaranteed one or two comments in response and I have a fun fictional prompt.

For reference of best case scenario of how CYOAs can inspire stories: [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/][Which Pill Do I Choose?]]

Don't be intimidated by the high quality image editing of Overlord and Stardust, I've gotten a decent player response just using Microsoft Publisher and images I found with Bing and Google Image searches. For reference, and because I think I've earned the chance to shill a little with this post length, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/search?q=return+of+magic&sort=new&restrict_sr=on][my CYOAs so far]]
