Anyone know of any open source ocean models that work well on a 8x10 grid scale (or around there) that I can try to incorporate into a procedural world generator? I've already found a weather model (GCMII, Hansen et al 1983), and I believe that I can find a reasonable plate tectonics model (especially now that I know to search for "numerical model of plate tectonics" instead of "plate tectonics simulation"). I just don't have the google-fu to find one. Preferably, I would be able to make my own heightmap and then form the ocean around it.
