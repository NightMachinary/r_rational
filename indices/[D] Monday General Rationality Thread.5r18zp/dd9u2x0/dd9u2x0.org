*/Altruism is Rational?/*

 

This is a discussion prompt.

You may argue whatever side you please. I personally, believe that selfishness is rational, and altruism is irrational(There are certain scenarios in which altruism is rational, for example when assisting someone costs you nothing or a negligible cost, and there is a possibility to gain a significant favour from the person assisted. The Bayesian decision in that scenario, will be to help).
