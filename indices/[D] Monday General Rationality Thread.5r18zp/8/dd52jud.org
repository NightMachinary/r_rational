Is it rational to be opportunistic.

Jumping at an opportunity, comes with many unknown and unaccounted dangers.

For people who like to make plans and strategise, isn't it needless risk.

Due to my experiences, I've decided to completely forego opportunistic crime. The risk is just too much for my taste.

If I planned to assassinate someone, I won't take an opportunity, that came up, but proceed as planned. I might miss a valid chance, but the risk is much less than my plan. The opportunity might be a hoax, I might be unlucky etc.

Being opportunistic, seems way too reliant on luck for my tastes.

I like movements that don't rely on luck, and reduce accompanied risk.

For endeavours with less risk, I think I might consider being opportunistic, worse case I lose invested resources.

I'll reduce my investment appropriately for such situations.
