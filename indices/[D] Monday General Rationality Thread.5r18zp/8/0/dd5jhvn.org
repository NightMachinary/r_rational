For any action which has a result determined by chance, the value of taking that action is just the expected value: the average of the values of possible results weighted by their probability of occurring.

So you have to weigh how likely every risk is with how much gain or loss will occur if it does happen. The rationality of a choice doesn't depend on its actual outcome, but on how good of a choice it is when you make it. This is why playing the lottery is bad choice, and even people who have won the lottery still made a bad choice when they chose to play.

The difficulty is you don't actually know the exact probabilities so you have to guess. If your guesses are more accurate you'll make better choices more often. But choosing not to take an unexpected opportunity is still a choice, and might be good or bad depending on how good the opportunity was.

So ultimately, it depends on the situation. Some opportunities are good to take, some are bad, and you should judge it on a case by case basis.

In the two examples you bring up it's almost always correct to not take it. Crime has disproportionately high costs if you get caught (deliberately so in order to disincentive doing it) and opportunistic crimes will usually have very low gain. Additionally, if you are not a psychopath you will have a nonzero altruism and thus lose value due to the victim's loss. And having a reputation as someone who never commits crimes can be valuable socially.

For the assassination (assuming you're already in a situation where you value their death even with all the costs involved) it's mostly just an issue of probabilities. Most possibilities involve them not dying, and your plan is an attempt to funnel all of those worlds into a small section where you kill them. Any introduction of randomness favors the more likely future of them not being assassinated, and makes it more likely for you to get caught. Nevertheless there are some hypothetical opportunities that it would be wise to take. What is rational depends on a case by case basis.
