I'm a consequentialist; I believe that the morality(rightness or wrongness) of any decision comes from its consequences.

I pay principalk importance on the consequences and results.

If the consequence is a positive payoff, then it's a right decision, if the consequence is a negative payoff then it's a wrong decision.

We can't decide the rightness or wrongness without hindsight, but we can decide how advisable it is. I generally consider decisions with the highest expected value, decisions for the most probable scenarios(should be significantly higher than 0.5 to even be considered) or decisions that are best under worst case scenarios, to have varying degrees of advisability(from most to least). The more advisable a decision is, the "wiser" it is.
