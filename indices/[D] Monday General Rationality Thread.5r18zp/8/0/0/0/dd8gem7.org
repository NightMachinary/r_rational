Isn't that an inconsistent way to evaluate decisions? You're saying that two people can make the same decision in the same circumstance and purely by chance you evaluate that one of them made a right decision and the other made a wrong decision.

The guy who won the lottery isn't rich as a direct result of his decision to play the lottery. Since loads of people played the lottery and aren't rich, we can evaluate that 0.00001% of the credit for his richness comes from his decision, and 99.99999% of the credit goes to luck.

Maybe we're just disagreeing on the definition of the "right" or "wrong" decisions. Because you seem to agree that playing the lottery isn't a "wise" decision to make, and I don't see the difference between "wise" and "right"
