Narcissism is actually all that's needed, really. Narcissists aren't pretending to think they're better than everyone, or pretending to be upset when others are getting more attention than them, or pretending to be insulted when they aren't considered better than others. They just are. That's how they feel. Paranoia kind of just goes along for the ride at that point, because a narcissist has to explain the contradictions in reality and their worldview somehow.

I try not to diagnose people I've never met as a matter of professionalism, but he really does fit the diagnosis to a T. If he was always a politician I would be more likely to think he just does it as a cover, but he was like this as a private citizen for decades.

I usually appreciate discussions that try to make people seem more 3 dimensional and nuanced, but it takes a huge amount of benefit-of-the-doubt to think that Trump is not exactly what he presents as, especially when so many people have come forward and said "This is who Trump is, in private and in public."
