  Taking the outside view even, Trump did manage to get elected.

I think we can add to this model. Taking the outside view, /Steve Bannon/ got someone with a narcissistic personality disorder elected, based on the candidate's own previous fame and media savvy.

The new president himself doesn't necessarily /care/ about the details of public policy, but Bannon cares very deeply. This explains many of their moves: make some big noise in the media sphere, while Bannon quietly gets into seats of greater and greater actual power in the background.

Even then, I think Bannon has to be either totalitarian-level evil (my top pick right now) or a complete idiot to start throwing experienced intelligence and security officials /off/ the National Security Council. Like, how the /fuck/ are you supposed to implement a successful fascist dictatorship if you don't have your own paramilitary, the security state doesn't want to cooperate with you (largely because you've called an enemy in view of the public), and you start /throwing away expertise/ in how to /run/ the security state yourself?

If we want to go full 5D Space Chess on it, Bannon is trying to /disable/ the security state so that Russians or terrorists or /someone/ can attack the USA, which he thinks will be his Reichstag Fire. Then he and his team get dictatorial emergency powers, and he can move on to what he really wants.

Mind, I haven't read any news yet today (Tuesday), so let's go see how well these predictions have been born out.
