  rump has certainly shown a bullying, egotistical, narcissistic personality in the past but actual internal denial of reality in the face of this level of evidence I would think would indicate sever paranoia at the least in the case that he thinks everyone is saying all these things just to sabotage him, or else outright schizoaffective disorder if there's some other rationalization at work.

There are people that use Breitbart for their news and believe it seriously. There are the slightly prejudiced, but not bad enough for you to call out over Christmas dinner, grandpas that that hold view along the lines of Trump. A lot of those grandpas, and probably plenty of edgy teenagers, have ideas for government policy that would be unworkable to implement and would really suck if they were actually implemented. There are plenty of people with inflated egos. If Trump really is delusional, it isn't that unusual, what is unusual is that he got elected in spite of, or perhaps because of, his delusions.

  I'd have expected some specific element of those delusions to have made it out through that avenue if no where else.

The Media has already been accused of crying wolf and/or being unfair to Trump just for reporting real, verified stuff that he actually did. He has done enough verifiable stuff that can be easily reported on to make speculation about mental illness like dementia not worth reporting.

  if so they're curiously well timed and politically salient for a guy who was running for office

And now I have started to get irritated that I have to explain this... the media has reported on the fact that he has hard these crazy views for a while now... He tweeted in 2012 that Global Warming was a Chinese hoax. He was one of the driving voices involved in the Birtherism Movement in 2012, where he also tried to get elected. A few of Donald Trump's "views" are obvious fabrications, yes, his Christianity for example. But a lot of his vies are just racist old man stuff that happened to gain traction because a decent portion of the population is actually way more tolerant of racism (yes I will use the r word and defend its usage as valid in this case) and rudeness than politicians previously suspected.

Donald Trump has tried to run in both 2000 and 2012, he just got lucky this time around with getting the snowball going on a never ending cycle of publicity and controversy to take down a divided Republican field. Its not that he chose his views, circumstances lined up for his views to get him attention, and then he tweaked a few views he didn't care about (Christianity, abortion, etc.).

#+begin_quote
  I lack the psychological expertise to judge if they actually hint at disorder.

The media has occasionally published speculation about him having some type of narcissistic disorder. The metadata about his tweets you mentioned, for example. Tweeting at 3am in the morning to strike back at a beauty pageant winner is probably not indicative of healthy sleep patterns at least.
