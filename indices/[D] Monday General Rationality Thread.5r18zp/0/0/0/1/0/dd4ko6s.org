Huh. You're right. I forgot the climate change is a Chinese hoax and the Alicia Machado incident. The birtherism I chalked up to riding a wave of controvery to front page news. Shame on me for a short memory and not updating my evaluations continuously, only evaluating each incident individually against more conventional theories.

That's definitely moved the needle on the "mental disorder" theory.
