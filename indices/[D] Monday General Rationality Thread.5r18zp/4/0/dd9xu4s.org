Rationality (at least as the word is [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality][used on LessWrong]] and thus here) does not tell you what goals to pursue. It tells you how to hold true beliefs about the world (epistemic rationality) and how to achieve whatever goals you happen to have (instrumental rationality). Doesn't matter if the goal is to save the planet or get rich or sort pebble into prime-numbered heaps.

(Arguably, part of epistemic rationality is figuring out one's own goals, because the human motivation system is so hopelessly tangled up that they may not be obvious even to oneself. But that still puts all goals identified in this way on an equal footing.)

You're probably using the word in a different way, but I don't know what it is.
