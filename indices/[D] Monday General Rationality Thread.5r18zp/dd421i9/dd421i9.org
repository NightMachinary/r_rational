Weekly Monday Post

--------------

Nothing super special to report.

My !Pokemon fic is coming along nicely. I need to plan out the story in more detail and whatnot, but I have been plugging away on a few scenes which interested me as the author.

I'm also writing modestly out of order. It lets me understand characters and who they are as they progress in the story, and keep people from being completely static, unchanging cardboards.

--------------

We as a community, I have found, are as prone to irrationality as anyone else. We're /only human/, and so I think that for those who are actively promoting rationality for raising the waterline, should be seeking at applying rational methods in more cases than they currently are.

I have seen a massive amount of unqualified irrationality lately from a community that espouses it, and it makes me sad. That said, I still stand by my original heartless point that I personally don't care about raising the sanity waterline. I'm just here for the fiction, and the people.
