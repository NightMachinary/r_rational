Thank you. I agree with almost everything, just one disagreement; I very *strongly* believe in consequentialism. The rightness or wrongness of a decision is determined by its consequences, it's results. Not whether or not the decision was rational.

So if someone wins the lottery, it was a right decision. But the probability of it being a wrong decision is overwhelmingly higher. So it is unwise to make it.
