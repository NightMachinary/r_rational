Helllll yes Daystar! I gotta say I've beene excited for the first of the split chapters forever. I love Aiko as a character and I love the two battlers together. Not only that but I love the fact that they've lost there two most practical and smart minds and are bound to make mostakes like innthis chapter.

So basically I'm excited for all the character growth that will come from these chapters where they don't have there foils.
