I figured that if there is a baseline degree of, say, "Psychic particles" in everyone, and having more of them (or more control of them) makes you Psychic, then an absence makes you Dark. That means you have no particles to be manipulated by Psychics. An actively Dark entity might draw them in and cancel them out as an offensive technique most effective against Psychics.

But the chi flow from Fighters is drawn in by the same effect, but not being Psychic particles they can't cancel it out, and so suffer the intended effect. So a Fighting attack delivers more power against Dark types. But Psychic attacks can manipulate the chi flow in others as readily as their Psychic potential, which is why Psychic attacks are effective against Fighting types.
