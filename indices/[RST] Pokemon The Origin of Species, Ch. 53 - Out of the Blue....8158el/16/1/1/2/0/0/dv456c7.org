This is pretty close, actually: the way I envision it is more like all pokemon can have some mix of all of their abilities, but most have one that's kinda noticeable or a mix of two at a level that are barely noticeable, while a rare few have a LOT of one, an even rarer few have a lot of two, and an even more super rare few have a noticeable amount of three abilities. Some of this is down to genetics, while others develop over time/age/training depending on the ability.
