The rangers have a pretty signifigant incentive to not really admit there might be something to Absol's bad luck effect.

There jobs is protecting against Pokemon related dangers. If Absol can cause car accidents and stair tumbles, then every time people notice "something must be wrong" because a slightly unlikely but otherwise insignificant number of extra house fires happen in the same week, people will start blaming Absol, draining resources away from fighting "real" threats. So long as it is just superstition, Rangers can ignore it and not become traffic cops and paramedics (even if those incidents are /technically/ pokemon-caused)

That's probably part of the reason why the Rangers are officially unofficially dealing with the problem. Since an Absol actually is there, they know something should be done, but they can't make a whole big deal lest Absol-hunting becomes an undue burden on the Ranger organization.
