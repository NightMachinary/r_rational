One guess based on what we've seen before is that it might be a recording of some other pokemon, a predator the diglett might fear perhaps, the effectiveness of this here is debatable and Blue would know that, but the fact that we've seen them try it before means it's at least worth considering. It could of course be some sort of distress beacon, the ability to transmit a signal even deep underground isn't too far fetched compared to some of the other technology we've seen, indeed in the various games you could use the various map/phone/watch things just fine in caves.\\
There's also the chance it does something completely new, but any feature that could help here feels like something that would have probably been used or mentioned before.
