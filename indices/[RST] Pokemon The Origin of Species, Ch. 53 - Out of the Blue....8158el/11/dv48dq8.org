I'm curious, what Blue was hesitating to push on his pokedex during the diglett battle, some sort of distress beacon? How would that work underground? Same with the trackers on their vest, does the world's poketech have special equipment for underground wireless signalling? If so, then I'd imagine the caves to be littered with such devices, not just for distress calls, but also for things like: communication in mapping the tunnels, tracking large groups of pokemon, organizing groups of tourists. You know, important things.
