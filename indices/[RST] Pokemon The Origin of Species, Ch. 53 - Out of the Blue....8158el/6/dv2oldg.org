Your work is amazing. How you convey the feel of danger. The fearfull creatures that pok√©mon actually would be in the real world. I felt that in the forest. I felt that with the very first rattata. And I feeling it now. The oppressive caves, the chance of been attack at any moment. The dreadfull silence, looking of tremors to the point you don't know if you are hearing things. And the absol's imposing pressence. Like it was just in front of me, with is shining fur and its night dark stare. And the deep sensation of danger, thanks to its pressure ability.

Thank you. Thank you for giving me this experience.
