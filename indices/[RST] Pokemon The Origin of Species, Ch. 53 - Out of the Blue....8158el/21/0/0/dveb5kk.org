Now that I read 'dex entries from the games, yeah.

The "warned" part is not applicable to this fic tho, since, you know, animal-level intelligence. But, from Sapphire game, "Absol has the ability to foretell the coming of natural disasters", which can be quite useful from the evolutionary standpoint, and if this species are scavengers and posess enough toughness and agility to withstand earthquakes (a common disaster in the region), being drawn to them rather than scared away also makes sense.
