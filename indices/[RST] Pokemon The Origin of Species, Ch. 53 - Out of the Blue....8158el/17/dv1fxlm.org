Another great chapter. These are always something wonderful to look forward to every month! (Would even like to look forward to them bi-weekly if that were possible... :P)

Though only a small note in the chapter, I hope Blue or Aiko manage to find and capture a Bronzor, if they survive the mole-stampede, as I would be interested to hear more of Red's thoughts on the artificial Pokemon and how they fit into his Origins quest.

I was wondering how you are treating the move sets of strong wild Pokémon? I know that there aren't really levels, so without the help of a Trainer, how do wild Pokémon learn more esoteric or complicated strategies (for example, an Absol with Future Sight). Maybe just age, or perhaps lesser or unwieldy version of a battle ready move?
