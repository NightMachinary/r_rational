I would guess that to explain Pressure you'd first have to explain what "PP" is, which is a really abstract game mechanic like HP, so what Pressure is will have to be really abstract as well.\\
From what I've gathered from the way the stormbringers are described, I thought it was some sort of literal "air pressure" type thing that just made basic tasks more exhausting, but if what Absol is doing is Pressure, I think there might be something more to it than that.
