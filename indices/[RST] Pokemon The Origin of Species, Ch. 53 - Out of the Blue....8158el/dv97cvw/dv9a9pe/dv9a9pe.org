You can absolutely say that :) It's always interesting getting different perspectives, since a fair amount of comments say the opposite and find the Blue/actiony chapters the most engaging.

It's good to know there's a wide variety of tastes being satisfied, as long as the "winking out" isn't too extreme. Was there any part of the chapter you enjoyed, or in general are you just not a fan of Blue's storyline/character?
