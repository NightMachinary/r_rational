So, my previous prediction that this would go horribly wrong and end up in terrible trauma for everyone involved seems to not have been so far fetched. Fighting a obviously higher level fast sweeper plus a bunch of digletts and maybe some dugtrio while deep inside a maze-like tunnel is bound to be trouble.

The lack of Red and Leaf is showing. The group is obviously underprepared for this expedition. Taking a day to practice cave-delving and fighting digletts would be the correct course here. Ya, maybe you lose the absol, but you also probably won't face death risks. Furthermore, what if there was more than one absol? Blasting mating calls could easily attract both, and fighting two absols would spell disaster to Blue's team.

I also see no reason to use tangela against absol when it is the only ground resist the whole group has. Elaine has a graveler that probably could tank some hits from absol and is pretty much ununsable against digletts. They also didn't diglett-proof this chamber, did they? Seems like an oversight, to not insulate yourself in the place you expect to be weakest in. It might spook the absol, but that would be better than facing this exact situation.

The absol may be weakened, but he also weakened most of the big shots in team. Machoke, Kemuri, Tangela and sandslash are bleeding. Maturin has recovered, but took some damage last fight nonetheless. That leaves the Lax as the big trump card against the digglets, but they cannot coordinate correctly behind the huggable giant until the absol is dealt with. I cannot see them surviving this without casualities.
