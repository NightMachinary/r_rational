Huh, there were a lot of times where someone is "about to say something". Eliane holds her tongue like three times, the girl trainer with Bretta cuts herself off when her teammates leave. It's not like they're getting interrupted either, Blue notices these hesitations and tries to prompt Eliane to speak up. I wanna say that's Absol luck manipulation cutting off useful information and cautions (bad luck for people who wish it ill?), but that seems a little powerful for a pokemon novice-ish trainers could expect to catch. Or maybe this particular Absol is abnormally powerful, who knows.
