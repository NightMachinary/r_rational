This is a good point, if they thought to explicitly buy empty containers for this purpose :) Just putting boxes in their existing boxes would still require unpacking mid-combat, which is less useful: container boxes tend to be big and unweildy, which is why they carry as many items that they'll need for combat outside them as they can.

Still, a good idea for those times they're preparing an area ahead of time!
