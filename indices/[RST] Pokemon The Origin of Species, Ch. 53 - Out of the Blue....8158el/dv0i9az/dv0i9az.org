Hey everyone, welcome back! Nothing exciting to announce, other than that I started reading Worth the Candle in a poorly considered choice of how to spend "some" leisure time this week and ended up spending way more time reading it than I planned to. It's written by my podcast cohost Alexander Wales under recently revealed pseudonym, and like all of his work, it's fantastic.

Oh, also, if you're wondering what a diglett's body looks like... it's a mole. It just has a mole's body. No big mystery: [[https://87freeze.deviantart.com/art/050-Diglett-and-051-Dugtrio-213676753][here's some fan art that fits what's in my head.]]

Hope you enjoy this month's chapter, and as usual all feedback welcome, either in reviews or here!
