The types thing shouldn't be that big of a surprise. Typing is super important in a situation where essentially all else is equal (prowess, strategy, etc) but strikes me as an edge rather than the meat of a fight, especially when fighting wild groups.

Besides that, all fights are a toss up when your opponent only knows to try and gang up and murder you, type advantage or no. In this world, it looks like fighting Earthbending moles in a tunnel of their own make is straight up always going to be difficult, nearly regardless of what you bring to that fight.
