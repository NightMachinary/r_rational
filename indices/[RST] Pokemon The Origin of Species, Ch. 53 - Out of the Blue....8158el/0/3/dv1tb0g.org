I think that is kind of the point. This is the first time Blue has to plan something like this alone since leaving Pallet and he feels first hand the absence of his two buddies. The chapter even shows Blue expecting either Red or Leaf to reply even though they are not there.

I actually called this adventure going bad last month. I was partially kidding when I said that Blue would descend into a spiral of hatred due to everybody here dying, but it was well foreshadowned that it would not go as smoothly as Blue expected.
