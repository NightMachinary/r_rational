I think a mixture of both. We see that only Elaine has experience with tunnels (and then not much), and the ranger thinks only Glen is equipped to deal with the absol. No one person has both skills, and half the team has neither. It's sort of a Chesterton's fence thing, where even though the Rangers' advice isn't binding in this instance, I would expect a strong reason not to follow it, and what we see doesn't qualify for me. I don't think they really address the rangers' concerns about whether or not they qualify to get involved as they would like, and so I expect failure. We see them get started, and I'm primed to see bad decision making. Blue even gets clawed in the very first diglett encounter, which doesn't bode well. We see some ideas for preparation, but it's stuff they didn't prepare to do, like standing on container boxes. But this is all background stuff that just colors how I look at it.

Most importantly is how the chapter ends. With how uncertain Blue seems and how he has to figure out what's going on, it doesn't seem anticipated by the characters, and I don't really anticipate it either. So when it says the diglett are coming, it seems like an epiphany, a revelation, like no one realized the diglett were going to react this way. Which is very dramatic at first, but then it's like what?
