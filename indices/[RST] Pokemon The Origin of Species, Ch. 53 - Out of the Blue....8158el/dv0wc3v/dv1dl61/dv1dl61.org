What I noticed was before they got to Golden Hills, they were actually planning pretty well, considering risk/rewards on taking the shorter route, etc.

I would bet that there really is something to Absol's bad luck field, since their really cocky arrogant moves started once they got near by, even before the party was right up next to it. Absol does have access to Perish Song at high levels, which could be some sort of probability collapsing effect that manifests as "Bad Luck".
