Did the planning in this chapter strike anyone as particularly irrational?

- the ranger tells them they're not ready, and they immediately discount him without any thought

- they don't seem to have any discussion about Absol's abilities and take the first conclusion (superstition) without exploring any alternatives or asking other trainers

- they seem to have an overwhelming type and strength advantage versus the diglett team but it still seems like a fight that was on the edge between going ok and going poorly

- the only decent planning they have is baiting the Absol with the meat, but they immediately rush in and abandon that plan without even waiting for it to work, leaving them to battle the Absol straight up

- no disaster/failure planning at all?

Did these discussions just happen off screen with no hints at them? It seems to go against what the team was just learning about at the gyms. Maybe that info will show up in the next chapter or after the battle.
