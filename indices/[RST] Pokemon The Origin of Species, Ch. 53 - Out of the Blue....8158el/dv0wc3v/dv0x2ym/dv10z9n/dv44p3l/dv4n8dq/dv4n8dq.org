I might have thought so, but then it seems at the end that the digletts' reaction takes them entirely by surprise, and they don't seem to have prepared for this eventuality. It seems like something they shouldn't be so caught off guard by if they did their research. Although I also think I was primed for that interpretation. The conversation with the rangers makes them seem like a group of underprepared glory seekers. They seem more concerned with being the ones to catch the Absol than with being helpful, and the reasons they give why they can do it don't seem nearly as well articulated or substantial as the ranger's reasons why they can't. As much as Blue says it isn't about pride, it reads as though it is, and I wasn't expecting it to go well.
