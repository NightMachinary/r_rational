Got it, thanks! My confusion was mostly centered around the idea that the diglett take them by surprise, since as you said, the chapter ends with Blue recognizing that he hears diglett coming, so there was no moment of actually showing their reaction to the diglett :) I understand from a narrative perspective why it builds up that way, and obviously used that as part of the revelation for the readers.
