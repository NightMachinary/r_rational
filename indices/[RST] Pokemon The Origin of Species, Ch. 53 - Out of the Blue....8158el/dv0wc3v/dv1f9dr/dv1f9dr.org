These are some excellent points, and without spoiling anything I can only say that 2/5 of them actually have hints in the chapter about things that will address them!

Well, 2/3 I should say, after answering these:

#+begin_quote
  they seem to have an overwhelming type and strength advantage versus the diglett team but it still seems like a fight that was on the edge between going ok and going poorly
#+end_quote

Yeah, as [[/u/ketura]] says, type advantage only goes so far in this world, where other factors like how outnumbered you are and the terrain and "invisible levels" can also sway the battles.

#+begin_quote
  the only decent planning they have is baiting the Absol with the meat, but they immediately rush in and abandon that plan without even waiting for it to work, leaving them to battle the Absol straight up
#+end_quote

I may not have made this clear, but they thought when the absol stopped responding that it had eaten the meat and fallen asleep, when in truth it basically stopped eating it as soon as it tasted something off :)
