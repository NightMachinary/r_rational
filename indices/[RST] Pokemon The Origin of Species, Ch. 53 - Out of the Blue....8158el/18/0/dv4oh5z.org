It might be the loud mating calls they played, combine with the fact absol is implied to have been hunting them perhaps they reacted aggressively to it (while not something you often see IRL actively hunting a predator might be fairly effective with how deadly these diglett seem to be).\\
Could also be part of pressure, I think it was mentioned that wild pokemon are more aggressive when the legendary birds are nearby and absol's pressure is the same thing, just weaker.
