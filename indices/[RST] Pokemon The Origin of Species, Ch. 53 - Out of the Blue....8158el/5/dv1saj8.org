Another great chapter, as always!

Alright people, place your bets now on what will happen. Who will die and what Pokémon will fall in this conflict? I can't see Blue dying, or Akko at this point either, but the other two seem pretty expendable as far as moving the plot forward goes. They seem less like major characters than Blue or Akko, so if anyone is going, my money is on them. Then again, Mr. DaystarEld could pull a fast one on us and have Akko die when we thought she'd be a main character. Regardless, I'm confident that Blue won't die.

I'm betting at least 3-4 Pokémon will bite the bullet from the Mole attack.
