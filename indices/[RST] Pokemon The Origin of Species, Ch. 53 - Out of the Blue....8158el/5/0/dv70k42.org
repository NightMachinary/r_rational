Depends on how dark the author want the story to be moving foward, and what are her plans regarding Red's relatioship woth Blue. If they intend to actually have Red taking the Champion mantle from Blue, I can easily see everyone here dying, blue aside.

I think at the very least Maturin and Blue are going to survive. If this story is going into Red x Blue, there has to be a reason for red to want to take hum down, and this is prime time for Blue to start changing. If that's the case, at least one of the red shirts bites the dust here. If the story isn't going there, I cannot see any humans dying unless renegades get involved.

That could just be the large amount of nuzlocke run I've read tho, specially stuff like Apocalypse Johto.
