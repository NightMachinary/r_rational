1. Does poison/sleep powder / stun spore leave a scent? (Guess: yes)
2. Any reason a pokemon couldn't have multiple status effects?

Figured Mean Look rather than Pressure... by the way, which chapter discussed how does the capture mechanism works? IIRC they stored the pokemon as data, but the storage wasn't enough to store people, so people ended up being MissingNo.. but another question is if any ball could benefit from the new storage solution.. granted, market forces might prevent the new storage from improving PokeMart-issue capture technology, even if it's a more efficient one. (Would Silph claim there's a NAND shortage?)
