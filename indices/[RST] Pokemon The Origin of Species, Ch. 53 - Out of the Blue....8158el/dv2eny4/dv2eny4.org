I don't really understand why the digglet are attacking in the first place, is the Absol somehow influencing them or are they aggressively defending their territory?

I do hope Aiko in particular doesn't die here, mostly because the fallout would set the tone waaay darker than I'd prefer (god imagine the section where Blue tells her father the news).
