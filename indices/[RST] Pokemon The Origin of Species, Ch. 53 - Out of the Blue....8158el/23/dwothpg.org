  "I've been trying to premortem this," Aiko says, face sheened with sweat as she sits beside Eevee and catches her breath. "Chingling and bronzor are really rare, but there are some down there. What about attackers that come from above?"

  "Having someone dedicated to watching above us should make sure we're not caught by surprise," Blue says.

  Elaine is about to speak, but Aiko gets there first. "Depending on the terrain, we can stand on container boxes."
