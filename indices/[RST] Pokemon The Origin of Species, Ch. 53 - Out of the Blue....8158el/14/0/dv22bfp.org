I hear you. Snorlax is indeed a big deal, and Blue did note how unusual it is for someone with just 3 badges to have one when he first finds out Glen does :) That said, it is on the younger side, so it's not at the height of its power. Also, Glen is the oldest among the group, at 16.

Glad you're enjoying the story despite that though!
