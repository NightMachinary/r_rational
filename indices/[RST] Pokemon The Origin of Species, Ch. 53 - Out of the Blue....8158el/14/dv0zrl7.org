How's it going? I don't have a fanfic account so I figured I'd try and reach you here.

I love the story so far. Really look forward to it each month. I do have one complaint though.

I can't get passed one of the kids already having a snorlax. It just feels like snorlax should be one of the hardest to train/catch Pok√©mon in the world. Like if someone pulls out a snorlax everyone goes "oh shit" because they're so strong. And the wild ones should be extreme threats if they decide to go on the move. I mean I pretty much picture a two story tall bear. I mean as far as game data goes Snorlax is stronger than any starters and has the same overall stats as Gyarados. That's pretty strong. Just my two cents.
