I think in a world where even the NPCs have access to a (pay-to-win) GTS, it makes sense that a lot of rare, powerful Pokemon are more available than they would be to a game protagonist. Especially with dedicated breeding programs assisted by behavior-modifying technology found in Pok√©balls.

I mean, it's completely possible to go online IRL and play through XY, oRaS, and uSuM with just about any Pokemon you want from the start thanks to online trading features.
