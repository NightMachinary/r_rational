The choice between (1) and (2) is a false dichotomy. Everything influences everything else. We produce stories, which influence how we act, which influences the stories we produce, and so on; the cycle never ends. Evolutionary psychology may be an important factor but it is not determinative, as evidenced by the fact that the values embedded in popular stories have changed over time.

Sigh. Apparently, it isn't possible to comment on the negative effects of popular tropes without being accused of contributing to "book bans and other atrocious things."
