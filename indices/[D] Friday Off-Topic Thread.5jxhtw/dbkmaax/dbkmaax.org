So many of the stories we read or watch are about the battle of good vs evil. This has the unfortunate effect of leading people to pattern-match good and evil when it comes to real life politics. The results are dubious. Evil is easy enough to find thanks to the human capacity of demonizing enemies. Good, on the other hand, is more difficult. I would wager this leads people to embrace the factions that virtue signal the hardest, or otherwise have the strongest claim to moral purity.

I wish stories of *flawed good vs evil* were more common. An example might be Star Wars where the rebel alliance is led by an alcoholic general prone to the occasional sexual harassment; where rebel troops are former smugglers who occasionally revert back to criminal behavior; where the rebel alliance will occasionally blow up a civilian freighter by mistake and, though the rebel leadership always issues the requisite apologies, the problem seems to persist.

All the same, the protagonist of the story has few reservations fighting with the rebels because, goddamn it, the empire blows up planets to terrorize its subjects.

My hunch is that a higher frequency of flawed-good vs evil stories would have good repercussions for the sanity of our politics.
