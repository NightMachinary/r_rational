Moral absolutism has been around for about as long as we have had stories. Values embedded in stories have changed over time, but the struggle against an absolute evil remains enduring. If it's a trope you see in the epic of Gilgamesh, I think it's reasonable to make the assumption that it's been around for a long time.

More recently was the study that made it to the front page, which showed that the brains of certain people start making unusual activity when presented with evidence contrary to political belief. I think that whatever hypothesis we go with, it's going to weigh more strongly on the genetic side than the learned side, simply because I've observed almost everyone react that way in real life.

I /am/ sorry if that seemed like an accusation of you wanting to ban books. I don't think you want to, but "stories cause x behavior" is something that I've seen time and time again, as reasons to keep books out of English classrooms, as reasons to ban books that people dislike. You aren't holding the gun, but rhetoric like that is almost always the ammunition.

There is an easy way to settle this, though - find a primitive tribe that relies entirely on oral tradition, strap somebody into an MRI, and then yell expletives at them. Compare the results with another indigenous tribesman that has read the /Harry Potter/ series.
