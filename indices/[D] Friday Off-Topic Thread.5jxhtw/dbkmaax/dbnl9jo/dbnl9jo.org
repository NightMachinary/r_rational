Okay, really here, this is the kind of thinking that leads to book bans and all sorts of other atrocious things. Which scenario do you think is more likely:

1) Authors and Politicians came up with the good vs evil narrative independently and on their own, and that books provided the majority of the inspiration.

2) Authors and Politicians get their assumptions from the same, obviously flawed source, which says anyone who isn't in your tribe is wrong. The source in this case being evolutionary psychology.

I don't think stories are responsible for the good vs evil narrative (in fact, the most popular stories make it very clear that the whole thing is morally ambiguous - Star Wars not included). More likely, the source of this bias is what authors and politicians and readers all share in common: human ancestry.
