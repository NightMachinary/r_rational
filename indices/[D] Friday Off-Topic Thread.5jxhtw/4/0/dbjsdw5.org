That was a fun read. It's a shame [[#s][]], it would have nicely tied off the arc.

I love this sort of low-magic setting, where being able to float a little off the ground is incredible one-of-a-kind magic. It encourages characters to use their powers in more unconventional and intelligent ways, and means munchkin-y techniques can solve problems without instantly conquering the universe.
