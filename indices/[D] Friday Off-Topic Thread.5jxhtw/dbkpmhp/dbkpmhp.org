Sanity Falls is dead. It's been dead for most of the year. Here's how it was going to go, in broad strokes:

Dipper tries to use Gravity Falls' anomalies to uplift the world, but discovers that nothing paranormal can leave the city limits, putting a damper on his first attempts at munchkinry. Mabel generally accepts surprising results like this, while Dipper becomes increasingly emotionally frustrated by them. One particular adventure to destroy a pro-status-quo conspiracy, the Society Of The Black Swan, fails to remove the inability of weird things to leave Gravity Falls. Dipper's sanity is further strained by the revelation that time travel exists and the infinite quantity of beings who possess it refuse to assist him.

When the real Stan is inadvertently removed from his extratemporal battle with Bill Cipher, he states that "weirdness" is trapped in Gravity Falls by an indestructible magnet-like device, and that this is a good thing as it prevents otherwise-inevitable end-of-the-world scenarios. Dipper misinterprets this as insane Luddism, and Bill Cipher comes to him in his sleep and shows him a ritual to destroy the supposedly indestructible normalcy anchor. Dipper completes the ritual, even though it involves murdering Wendy; he weighs her life against the coming singularity and makes what he sees as an obvious utilitarian decision. The ritual turns Dipper into the literal prophesied "Black Swan", a living portal to the realm Gravity Falls' anomalies come from. Bill Cipher and his friends climb out of the Black Swan and commence Weirdmageddon, the "utility monster mash" wherein the streets are roamed by literal defect bots, trolleys fly everywhere, and people are spontaneously disassembled and reassembled by lightning all the time.

Mabel fixes it all by getting a favor from a time traveler to prevent Dipper from ever existing, retroactively making her an only child. A while later, though, she meets the real Dipper, Soos, and Wendy - as it turns out, the entire story up to this point is a lie, a perfectly realistic false history implanted in Mabel by Bill playing the part of the Cartesian Demon. Dipper isn't even really a colossal douchebag. The story ends here, with Mabel setting off to solve a problem in a real world she can't remember alongside a bunch of real people she only knows fake versions of.
