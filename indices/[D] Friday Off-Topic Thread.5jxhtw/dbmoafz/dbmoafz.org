Random thing I've been wondering that someone here likely knows the answer to.

If something universal in a setting exist that can signal faster than light, is the speed of causality whatever the speed of that thing is rather than light?

Of all things dragonball had me wondering this. People can sense ki over galactic to universal scale distances within seconds. It also allows people to travel massively faster than light.

On the other hand, it's in every living thing. The spirit realm seems to be pretty much made of the stuff as well.

Normally causality is thought to be broken when you travel ftl in fiction, but given there exists a constant in the setting that people can be taught to sense, that machines can be built to messure, I'm wondering if that just means causality is limited to whatever upper limit of information ki can signal data rather than light.

I could be completely off base, though.
