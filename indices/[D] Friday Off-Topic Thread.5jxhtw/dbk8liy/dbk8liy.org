Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, including work on the data creation tool Bill's PC. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing][Handy discussion links and previous threads here]].

Whoops, nearly forgot to post this. Funny how when I'm off work all pretenses of routine go out the window.

Work is slowly but surely coming to a fore on the design documents. I've divided the design up between what the engine should handle and what "mods" should handle, and now it's just a matter of getting all the ducks in a row. Once again, if you've been watching from afar and have ideas, speak now, or forever hold your peace!

I should hopefully have a decent set of documents all set up by the new year. At that point I'll then divide all of the various features into a roadmap, and then start at the top of the list and work down. We're on the brink, here.
