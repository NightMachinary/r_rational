Every so often, I marvel at how much I lost the habit of engaging in toxic debates, and how awesome it is that I've found communities in which "try to understand other people's points instead of treating them like a political opponents" is something I can assume everyone is doing.

I can completely remember my five-years-ago self who was obnoxious to people with a different opinion, thought debates were about making other people look stupid and looking like you're right, and mostly participated in communities where that was the norm. And I'm really, really glad to have both moved past that, and found communities of people which encourage better discourse.
