Starship Troopers. It's a magnitude above the movie and manages to portray the society well without coming across as propaganda /or/ parody. It also gets geeky detailed a few times, and I really like it. It's the only thing I've read/listened to that managed to make power armour sound interesting and realistic.

Also the narrator for the audiobook is /so/ good.
