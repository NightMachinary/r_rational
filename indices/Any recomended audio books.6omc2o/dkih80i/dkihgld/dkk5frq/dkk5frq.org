In no particular order:

Lord of light - roger Zalazny

Sci-fi intertwined with Hinduism.

Dune - Frank Herbert

Definite classic, hard sci-fi.

Nine princess in amber - Roger Zelazny

Fantasy, the audio book are just great, with sound effects and everything.

Enders Game - Orson Scott Card

First place in sci-fi top 100, terrible movie.

The hitchhikers guide to the galaxy - Douglas Adams

Sort of anti-rational sci-fi, very funny.

The quantum thief - Hannu Rajaniemi

Transhumanist sci-fi, unpronounceable author.

And if you've got half a year of your life to throw around, I'd recommend the wheel of time series by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson. It is truly an epic, and one of the best series I've read to date. But with fourteen thick books in the series quite a commitment.
