Have you read/listened to Metropolitan Man? The same person who did HPMOR's podcast did it it too:

[[http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=1705]]

Also, its author Alexander Wales and I have recommended maybe 20 audio books throughout our podcast:

[[http://daystareld.com/podcasts/rationally-writing/]]

If you click on any given episode starting from 10, you'll probably find an audio book recommendation at the bottom of the page, with an explanation of why it's recommended at the end of the episode in like the last 3 minutes (in the later ones I started putting transcripts of the recommendations onto the webpage).

One of my personal favorites is The Dresden Files, an urban fantasy series which is narrated exceptionally well by James Marsters. The story develops some great world building, magic systems, and characters as it goes, each book pretty much always getting better than the last. Storm Front is the first book, if you want to check it out :)
