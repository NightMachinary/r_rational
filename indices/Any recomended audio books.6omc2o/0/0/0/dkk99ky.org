I can also recommend the Dresden files, the first audiobook is pretty cheap on audible. I found it's almost always cheaper to bundle the kindle version with the audio on Amazon for everything past the third book. ($8 vs $28 for a few) As an addition, his voice cuts through the din of vehicle noise better than most.
