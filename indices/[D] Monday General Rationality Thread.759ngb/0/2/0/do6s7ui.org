  These are things you can learn just by reading history books. It's not hard, if you're willing to put a little bit of time into it.

It's a little harder than that, though. You need to figure out how to read history books, learn the common standards of historical evidence, and get enough of an idea what to read that you don't spend all your time reading radicals from one side of the spectrum.

And that's for areas where there's enough evidence to reach a decent conclusion. I haven't looked into US involvement in Latin America, but I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of significant evidence is still classified, so the historical method might not be able to reach the right answer there yet.
