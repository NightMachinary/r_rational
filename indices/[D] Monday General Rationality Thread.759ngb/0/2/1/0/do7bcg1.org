How ignorant can you be? [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus][Just read the wikipedia article.]] It's ridiculous to think that Columbus didn't know of other estimates for the size of the earth. Of course he knew the risks. Or do you think he could petition every monarch he could find and never figure out why they were turning down his proposal?

While it's kind of stupid reason why he misunderstood the size of the earth (unit conversion), it wasn't unreasonable for him to trust the more modern arabic source over the ancient greek one.
