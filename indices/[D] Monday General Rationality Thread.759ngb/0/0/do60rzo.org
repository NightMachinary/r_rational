  Let's say that I read a report or news item that says eating a pound of peanut butter a week will stave off alzheimers or something equally weird and/or significant (keeping my mental health throughout the aging process is pretty significant to me).

  How do I properly understand that this is or is not true?

What level of certainty do you want?

You can trust that the scientist(s) who wrote the paper were competent in their field, and did their honest best to find what was true. (And if you then have any way of knowing better than them under those conditions, then you could have written the paper, given access to experimental results).

You could hire a competent scientist in the field to read the papers for you, and give you an estimate as to how sure you can be in the conclusion. He /will/ know how to analyze that information, and you will know he is not being paid to lie to you (since you are paying him) - so assuming that he is indeed both competent and ethical, you should get a pretty good answer as to whether or not it is true.

This does not, of course, prevent the possibility of the scientists who wrote the paper getting it /wrong/. The only way to check at that level, I think, would be to re-run (or pay someone to re-run) the experiment yourself; also making sure to check experimental method and other details.

But. This is a lot of effort to go to on the basis of a single claim about peanut butter and alzheimers.

How far do you want to go? How much certainty are you looking for?
