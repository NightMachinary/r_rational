Well, ideally, enough to make personal decisions on, so a lot of certainty.

But here's the thing, what you described is a hell of a lot to do for just 1 article that may or may not be very significant. There are literally thousands of articles that may or may not be signficant to me, and it would be a very poor plan to pay scientists to verify that many articles.

Also, how do you determine if the scientist is trustworthy? What other sources do you use to figure out his/her credibility? How do you judge that credibility?

Essentially, if why we believe what we believe is that someone we trust told us; how do we make sure that our trust is correct in a way that isn't so difficult or time consuming or money intensive that it is unreasonable?
