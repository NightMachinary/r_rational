The latter. But my only way of doing that would be to read articles?

Like, say I visit my doctor and he is like, "Lower your cholesterol." And he says some things that make sense: Exercise, eat better, reduce stress, etc.

And then I go looking for further research. And I come across let's say 8 different articles with 8 different takes on what significantly helps lowering cholesterol. They aren't all mutually exclusive or anything, but let's say they all are fairly time intensive.

How do I determine which article to follow? And now multiply that problem (of cholesterol) by everything I want to improve at.

How do I parse that much information, when simply trying to read articles and keep myself (maybe) informed is already a difficulty in terms of balancing with other important life goals.
