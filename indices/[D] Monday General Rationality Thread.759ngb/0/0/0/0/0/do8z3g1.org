You are correct.

However, my problem crops up when you have hundreds maybe thousands of articles you are reading in a year and trying to make sure that you know the viability and trustworthiness of each article, which, theoretically could be by a different person with different sources each time.

Or to add onto what you said: Question the third: How do I now take the above two questions and make them work in a day to day routine where I might be reading two to four articles a day that matter to me?
