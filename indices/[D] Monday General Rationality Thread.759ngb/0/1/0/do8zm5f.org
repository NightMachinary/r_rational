Okay, so let me rephrase because while I totally agree with what you said regarding "ever perspective has a different view of truth" I am not sure that applies here.

In the peanut butter example. I don't think that has a perspective based truth. I think that is an example of like, "Gravity is a real thing" so make decisions assuming gravity is true.

That is what I am concerned about.

To take it back to the Vietnam example, and this is an example so it doesn't actually fully represent the issue; it is just a relatively easy way to talk about this, I was taught, in school, that we won the Vietnam war.

In a very simplistic way. We just won. We were the victors. Now, in your comment you even said, "Unfortunately, this was a poor strategy for winning a war of any kind", with which I agree.

Did we accomplish many missions in regards to Vietnam, like, as you pointed out, killing the enemy until they lost the ability to fight? We might have. But did we stop communism from spreading or win the hearts and minds of Vietnam? No.

So, the idea behind the example, is that it is a lot more nuanced and complex than what I was taught, and to be fair, this was what I was taught in, like, middle school.

But my point still stands. Issues and history is incredibly complicated. So figuring stuff out, stuff like science and food nutrition and acceptable risk and finances, even if we had all the facts lined up is difficult. And it feels nearly impossible when people obfuscates facts on purpose or not.

Does that make sense? I feel like I just did a kinda bad job of explaining.
