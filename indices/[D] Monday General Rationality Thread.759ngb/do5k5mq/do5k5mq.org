To start us off: Someone at work put out some colouring-in equipment on a table next to a sign that reads something like "Research shows 5 minutes of colouring repetitive designs is equivalent to 30 minutes meditation".

I did some quick Googling and did find a paper about colouring-in improving attention: [[https://kar.kent.ac.uk/56833/]]

One paper isn't definitive but I might give it a go this week during morning breaks and see if it affects my productivity at work.
