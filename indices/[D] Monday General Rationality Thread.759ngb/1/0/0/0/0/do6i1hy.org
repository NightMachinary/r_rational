Hmm, OK. Thank you (and [[/u/Evan_Th]]) for answering. It seems the situation is not as bad as it possibly could have been. (I'm not going to say "as bad as I thought" because I didn't actually believe it should be given how people behave. Indeed this was the source of my confusion: what I was hearing, what I experienced and what I inferred from this didn't really match up.) Nevertheless, I remain totally fine with not dreaming in that way at all unless I deliberately try to. Thanks again!
