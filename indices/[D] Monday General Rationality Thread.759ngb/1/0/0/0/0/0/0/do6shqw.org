  I do know that, in a significant fraction of people, watching a horror movie will lead to meeting the monster from that horror movie in their dreams for the next few nights

Curiously, nothing like that's happened for me since I was a kid, even when I've been really perturbed (if not scared) right before going to bed.

My guess is that a lot of people are unsettled /at the base of their mind/ by that - some part of them is actually, at root, afraid of unknown things in the world, and so things like horror movies can play on those subconscious fears. As far as I can tell, I'm not (in large part because of my religion, IMO), so I don't get those nightmares.
