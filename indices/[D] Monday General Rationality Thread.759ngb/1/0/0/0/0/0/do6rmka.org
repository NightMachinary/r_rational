  I'm not going to say "as bad as I thought" because I didn't actually believe it should be given how people behave.

Would "as bad as you feared" be a reasonable description?

For what it's worth, I think that there do exist people who have things as bad as you'd feared. Such cases are both rare and tragic, and might be found (for example) in a war veteran who finds himself back in the trenches every time he falls asleep; I think that severe nightmares can be a symptom of both post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. And, in either case, this is something that requires the aid of a medical professional (to whit, a psychiatrist).

But, for most people - my dreams originate from within my own brain, with all the filters turned off. There's no part of me that's all that interested in scaring myself, and I don't have any particularly unsettling experiences to relive.

I do know that, in a significant fraction of people, watching a horror movie will lead to meeting the monster from that horror movie in their dreams for the next few nights - with vividness depending rather on the person in question. I think that's more a case of the mind trying /not/ to think of pink elephants and thinking of them anyway.
