  In terms of credulousness, for me it's more like willing suspension of disbelief as you do with stories rather than actual confusion or uncertainty. I can go along with weird things that only make sense by dream logic but it's never because I didn't have a choice at the time.

It's not so much that I don't have a choice. It's more like I am not /aware/ that I have a choice at the time. Lucid dreaming, as far as I can tell (and I haven't ever really bothered with it much) would be mostly about realising, while dreaming, that I have a choice.

As if I'd willingly suspended disbelief and then willingly forgot about it.

  So... How often would you say something akin to what you describe happens? I expect not often to the /extent/ of your example, but are your dreams "experiences" like that regularly? How often, if at all, are they "bad"? The thing that blows my mind is that there appears to be this whole category of experience that I've just never had to deal with, yet as far as I can tell appears to be common.

When I dream, it's an experience. (Sometimes it's a disjointed experience; sometimes I am not present, but merely somehow observing events that happen to other characters). Sometimes I only remember parts of the dream, which often don't make any sense in retrospect.

So, I guess the question then is, how often do I dream and remember my dreams on waking?

Not every night. Not even every week, I think. But multiple times a year, certainly. Perhaps once or twice a month? (I don't exactly keep records, so I'm not all that sure). It seems to depend to some degree on my state of mind - if I am anxious, I seem more likely to remember my dreams.

Most of my dreams are good ones - where I go swimming through the air or I can put my car key in a tree, turn it and drive the tree away. It's rare for me to have a bad one. Though I suspect that this changes from person to person as a function of general happiness and mental health.
