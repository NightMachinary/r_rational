I second everything [[/u/ccc_037]]'s said about his dreams: I experience them in pretty much the same way, even down to the average frequency. For me, though, they often come in waves. I'll get a week with two or three of what I call "real dreams" or "interesting dreams," and then a month or two without any.

When I was a kid I sometimes had bad dreams in which I was legitimately frightened, but those almost all vanished... I'm not sure when, but definitely before I was fourteen. Now, I've had maybe one bad dream in the last four years. (I'm not counting the handful of "Oh my I'm back at college and forgot to go to this class all semester"; they're disturbing but not frightening. Curiously, I never had them till after I graduated.)
