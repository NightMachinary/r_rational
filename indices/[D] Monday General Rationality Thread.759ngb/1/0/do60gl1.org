I don't remember my dreams all that often... but when I do, I don't remember being aware of it being a dream at the time.

Part of it is that, in my 'dreaming' state of mind, I am significantly more credulous than normal. It's like all my filters have been turned off, and I see nothing odd about my sudden ability to, for example, swim through the air (i.e. fly by making swimming motions).

As far as telling the difference between dreaming and waking - I have on one memorable occasion, when I was still in school, dreamed my way through an entire day to the point where, when I woke up on the following day, I thought it was the day after. I do see things, and hear things, I do have a body in the dream - I don't /notice/ that anything is missing. (I also don't notice anything odd in the fact that I am, for example, wandering around the university I haven't visited in about a decade looking for an exam in I-don't-know-what subject). But, in retrospect, I don't think that's because nothing is missing - I think, rather, that the moment at which I start looking for something, the dream supplies it, so that I don't notice it wasn't there before.

  But if this is really the way it is, the typical response of "it's just a dream, don't worry, you're safe," seems /incredibly inadequate/.

I think the point behind saying "don't worry, it's only a dream" isn't to try to say it wasn't legitimately terrifying. Rather, I think that the point is to say that it is now /over/. It's done with. It doesn't have any power over your waking life, so now that you are awake and able to hear this, you are /no longer/ in that terrifying situation.
