There's two separate questions here.

Question the first: How do we know that a scientist, presenting new science in an article, is correct in his beliefs?

Question the second: How do we know that a scientist, presenting new science in an article, is not lying to us in some manner (e.g. falsifying results, drawing incorrect conclusions)?

The answer to the first question - we don't. However, we can be sure that a scientist, trained in a field we are not trained in, is more likely than we are to make correct predictions within that field.

The second question is more tricky. We need to consider plausibility, how likely it is that a sponsor paid for a paper to serve his own agenda, and whether the author has any motive to lie.
