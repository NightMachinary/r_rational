Hmmm.

Well, what I'd do is assume basic competence on the part of anyone who gets their article published in a journal.

If the journal or the article is sponsored by any player in the relevant industry, I ignore it. (Joe's Cholesterol Supplement will be able to find some way to get an article written that says that Joe's Cholesterol Supplement works if they really try). Apart from that, I assume that the scientist(s) who wrote the article really tried their best to get the science right, and, being trained in the field, their best is better than my best. So, when choosing which one(s) to follow, the best I can do on my own is to rank them in order of which method offers the most gain for the least trouble (and least side effects).

Of course, I don't have to do this on my own. Depending on how much you are willing to spend, you can hire experts yourself - only, instead of asking them to evaluate this or that individual article, you can ask them directly how to lower cholesterol. Or you could find experts in your social circle and ask them. (Note that nutritionalists are not the only experts on things like cholesterol - high-end or aspiring high-end athletes are also pretty knowledgeable on medical issues, for much the same reason as why formula one drivers know their way around an engine).
