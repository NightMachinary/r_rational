Please forgive me. That was uncalled for. I found the video to be highly offensive, and I meant the remark directed more toward its creator, despite his absence.

  Wikipedia is a pretty good source of information too.

It's not perfect, but it's a reasonable baseline. I've found that while Wikipedia often demonstrates a certain amount of implicit bias, the facts are usually unassailable.

Maybe a better question than "How do I overcome my ignorance?" would be "When should I be skeptical of a particular claim?" I would say be skeptical of everything. Once skepticism sets in, it's usually not too hard to find more information, assuming the topic is even worth studying. On the other hand, recognizing effects that turn off skepticism is harder.
