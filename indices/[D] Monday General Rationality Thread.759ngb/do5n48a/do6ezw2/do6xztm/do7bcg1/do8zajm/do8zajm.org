So, I don't know if you felt attacked, but I know that when you said, "How ignorant you can be?" I did not feel good. I hope that you aren't viewing this as me trying to make you feel wrong or bad, because that is not my intention.

However, you've done a great job kinda exposing the problem I have. I believe that video I posted. I've seen the other videos that guy has done, and they seem well researched.

Wikipedia is a pretty good source of information too. I've read and trusted wikipedia before.

Now, for this specific example, we could both double check sources and come up with an answer. But that is just one thing in a sea of things I want to learn, and you can see how if a person had to do that amount of research and discussion before finding the actual facts it would be very difficult to feel confident in your decisions or understanding of the world.

I would prefer if you could respond without unkind statements like, "How ignorant you can be?" especially when what we are, in fact, discussing is me trying to overcome my ignorance.

Thanks.
