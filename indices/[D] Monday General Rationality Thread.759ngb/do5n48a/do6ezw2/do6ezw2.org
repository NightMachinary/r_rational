  If you are an american, you, like me, were probably taught that we, more or less won the vietnam war or that Christopher Columbus was real neato.

These are not things I was taught. But I do feel the urge to correct you. I can't speak for the character of the man himself, I didn't know him, but what Christopher Columbus did was real /neato/. It took a lot of courage to sail west when all reason said it was suicide.

  So what else is false? How true or horrific was the U.S. involvement in South America during the 60s up until the 80s? Communism sounds nice, in a theoretical way, but has lead to some of the most horrific dictatorships and mass slaughters in the entire world, so has fascism, so has capitalism. How do we parse what we are told and come to anything even approaching facts?

These are things you can learn just by reading history books. It's not hard, if you're willing to put a little bit of time into it.
