I don't know how to properly research things.

Let's say that I read a report or news item that says eating a pound of peanut butter a week will stave off alzheimers or something equally weird and/or significant (keeping my mental health throughout the aging process is pretty significant to me).

How do I properly understand that this is or is not true? I can look at the sources that the article quotes, and I have done that before, but I don't know how to properly analyze the information in a research paper, and I also know, although I don't know how likely it is, that scientists lie, or mess up, or get paid off, or simply draw the wrong conclusions because research is fucking difficult.

Is that just how things are, and I just need to do my best and try to educate myself enough that I can make my way through dense research papers and come out with enough information to be able to say, "Yes, that seems correct"?

I've struggled with this especially regarding history and politics. Although science is there as well.

If you are an american, you, like me, were probably taught that we, more or less won the vietnam war or that Christopher Columbus was real neato.

Those are both false. So what else is false? How true or horrific was the U.S. involvement in South America during the 60s up until the 80s?

Communism sounds nice, in a theoretical way, but has lead to some of the most horrific dictatorships and mass slaughters in the entire world, so has fascism, so has capitalism. How do we parse what we are told and come to anything even approaching facts?

I don't actually expect a magic bullet here, but I am curious as to what other people think, in part because I think a lot of the people here are a lot smarter than me and can do things I can't. And I kinda feel like I am asking this, for me, certainly, but also as part of the group of people, I suspect, don't know how to read research papers, and don't have a group of friends who are hardcore about their specialized fields, and this is something I struggle with.

That ended up being a lot. But I would appreciate any feedback, and I am not sorry, but I do understand that this is maybe not where this question or post should go? But I don't know a better place?

thanks
