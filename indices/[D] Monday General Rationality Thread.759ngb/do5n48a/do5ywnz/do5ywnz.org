To non-answer the smallest part of your question, we did generally accomplish our objectives in Vietnam, given that our objective was to kill as many VC as possible. Unfortunately, this was a poor strategy for winning a war of any kind, and we certainly lost the war on the optics front.

Our goal was to keep killing until the enemy lost the ability or willingness to fight, and we aren't really sure how close we got.

The issue is that every perspective has a different view of truth, and that there is no universal truth. Two people can believe different things that are conflicting and both true from their perspective. The solution to me is that we need to destigmatize rational thought, invest in education, and foster belief systems that take evidence into account.
