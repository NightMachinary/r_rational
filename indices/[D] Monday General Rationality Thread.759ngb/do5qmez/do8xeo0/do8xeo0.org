I rarely dream, but often when I do dream it's awesome, multi-viewpoint-character epics. I have multiple senses, with vivid, consistent scenes taking place one after another, with consistent narrative structure linking them together. They often don't make sense, but I often times see recurring setting or images happening in my dreams.

I don't really get nightmares. Sure, scary things can happen in my dreams, but dreams are very very far away from my waking life. I'd say that the experience is closest to watching a scary movie. Sure, it can be freaky in the moment, but the brain quickly moves on to other things. Even though it gets a first person perspective on the action, it just doesn't hold any relevance to my waking life. Saying "It's just a dream" is the same thing as "It's just a movie"
