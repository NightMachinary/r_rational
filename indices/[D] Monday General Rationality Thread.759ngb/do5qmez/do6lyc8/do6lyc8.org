I dream fairly vividly and usually remember a few dreams a night, which I credit to dream journaling and making a conscious effort to think about my dreams for a few minutes after waking up.

#+begin_quote
  The thing I mainly want to know is whether dreaming is typically or often "experienced" in a way similar to the experience of "perception," like when you're awake and experiencing the real world, or "imagination," like when you're thinking about stuff.
#+end_quote

Somewhere between both of those for me. It's convincing as an experience while I'm dreaming, but after reflecting on it while I'm awake it has a slightly imaginary quality. If you were to put it on a scale between imagining and experiencing, I'd say it might be about 80% leaning towards experiencing. Though take that with a grain of salt, because I might also have a poorer than average ability to imagine things while awake.

#+begin_quote
  Is the experience vivid, detailed, and involving multiple senses?
#+end_quote

Vivid, but I feel like the mind glosses over a lot of detail and you just don't notice while you're dreaming. Yes to multiple senses, I've experienced the main five in dreams.

#+begin_quote
  Are you embodied, or is it mostly just a series of disjointed sensations?
#+end_quote

Definitely embodied.

#+begin_quote
  I want to know because if people typically or often dream in a way similar to perception, and it can be vividly real, and feel as if "things are happening to you," then that would explain a few things, for example why kids might wake up screaming after a nightmare and run to their parents.
#+end_quote

Yes, the experience of "things happening to me" is definitely, 100% what makes nightmares awful. I very rarely get them, but even as an adult they can be pretty bad and have a lasting effect on me for a few hours after waking depending on what it was exactly. I can still make myself feel mildly panicked by thinking about one in particular.

#+begin_quote
  But if this is really the way it is, the typical response of "it's just a dream, don't worry, you're safe," seems incredibly inadequate.
#+end_quote

It's the exact right thing to put distance between yourself and the experience though.

#+begin_quote
  Because if that were the case, how are you not all terrified of going to sleep?
#+end_quote

For me, nightmares are so incredibly rare that they're not worth worrying about. For people that have reoccurring nightmares, they actually can become terrified of going to sleep though. Here's a blurb from WebMD:

"What Are the Health Effects of Nightmares in Adults?

Nightmares become much more than bad dreams when they have a significant effect on your health and well-being. Among people who experience nightmares, those who are anxious or depressed are more likely to be distressed about the experience and suffer even more psychological ill effects. Although the relationship is not understood, nightmares have been associated with suicide. Because nightmares may have a significant impact on your quality of life, it's important to consult a medical professional if you experience them regularly.

Sleep deprivation, which can be caused by nightmares, can cause a host of medical conditions, including heart disease, depression, and obesity.

If nightmares in adults are a symptom of untreated sleep apnea or post-traumatic stress disorder, the underlying disorders can also have significant negative effects on physical and mental health."

#+begin_quote
  I honestly cannot understand how anyone could possibly be confused about whether they're awake or dreaming
#+end_quote

When I'm awake, I'm 100% sure I'm awake. There's no confusion for me as I type this for example. When I'm dreaming, it's like I'm experiencing things with my critical faculties turned off. It's impossible for me to tell I'm dreaming because it's not the kind of thing that I'd ever think to ask myself while I'm dreaming, if that makes sense. When weird things happen, they don't set off any alarm bells.

#+begin_quote
  People talk about dreams as if they are sequences of things that happen to them; as if they see, hear, or otherwise perceive things in a similar way to what happens when they're awake.
#+end_quote

Would definitely agree here.

#+begin_quote
  So, if I put together these experiences I've had and the things people say, the possibility arises that people actually experience things like this, regularly, without being certain it's not real, without being able to stop it at any time, and scary things can happen. Is this actually the case? Because, holy shit.
#+end_quote

Yep! Every night pretty much night, and it's not as bad as it sounds.
