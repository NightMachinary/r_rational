I /wish/ I remembered a few dreams a night. When I do, at least half the time it's really fun. How do you think dream journaling helps? When I don't remember dreams, usually they're gone within a moment of my opening my eyes, so I wouldn't be able to even begin writing them in a journal; do you think journaling the dreams I do remember would help change that?

  It's impossible for me to tell I'm dreaming because it's not the kind of thing that I'd ever think to ask myself while I'm dreaming, if that makes sense.

That's almost always the case for me - but there've been a few exceptions. Once in a while, I've noticed something weird right before I wake up. And then there was one memorable dream from when I was out camping with my dad when I was seven or eight or so, when I remember going around $Place in my dream asking my dad "How did we get home from our camping trip? I don't remember!"
