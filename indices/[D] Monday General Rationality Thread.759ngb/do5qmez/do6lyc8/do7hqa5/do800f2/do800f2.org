Well first off thanks for your comment, it helped me clarify my thoughts about the whole thing while trying to type up an answer.

I think dream journaling works by forcing you to pay conscious attention to your dreams in a critical period that happens immediately after you wake up. The same effect can be had if you lay there and think about / mentally replay your dream before letting your mind wander anywhere else after you wake up. Right now that's all I do, I don't journal any more but I take a very short moment to think about what I dreamed and that's what causes it to stick. Your memories are there, I think it's a recall issue because if I wake up and get distracted immediately I'll still end up forgetting what I dreamed too. On those occasions, some times I can remember if I try really hard, but it's a bizarre kind of experience to remember one thing about what you dreamed and then suddenly go "Oh right!" and have the rest of a long dream suddenly available to you.
