  Part of it is that, in my 'dreaming' state of mind, I am significantly more credulous than normal. It's like all my filters have been turned off, and I see nothing odd about my sudden ability to, for example, swim through the air (i.e. fly by making swimming motions).

I get this to some extent, and can relate to other things people say like it being difficult to move with any force, or the whole running but never getting anywhere thing. But it's difficult in the exact same way that it's difficult to in detail imagine how you move while not actually moving. In terms of credulousness, for me it's more like willing suspension of disbelief as you do with stories rather than actual confusion or uncertainty. I can go along with weird things that only make sense by dream logic but it's never because I didn't have a choice at the time.

  I think the point behind saying "don't worry, it's only a dream" isn't to try to say it wasn't legitimately terrifying. Rather, I think that the point is to say that it is now over. It's done with. It doesn't have any power over your waking life, so now that you are awake and able to hear this, you are no longer in that terrifying situation.

Sure, and I guess I don't really know what more you can do. It's just a weird thought to me that people, for one, experience anything like that at all, and two, that they may not have much choice about it.

So... How often would you say something akin to what you describe happens? I expect not often to the /extent/ of your example, but are your dreams "experiences" like that regularly? How often, if at all, are they "bad"? The thing that blows my mind is that there appears to be this whole category of experience that I've just never had to deal with, yet as far as I can tell appears to be common.
