In the vein of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6zfyff/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/dmv6384/][eaturbrainz' post]] and [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/17/what-universal-human-experiences-are-you-missing-without-realizing-it/][SSC: What universal human experiences are you missing without realising it?]]...

I want to talk about dreaming. Specifically, exactly what the experience people call "dreaming" actually involves. Because I am genuinely confused by the way people talk about dreams and dreaming.

The TL;DR if you don't want to read the whole thing is that my best guess is that I don't experience dreaming in the same way as most people. The thing I mainly want to know is whether dreaming is typically or often "experienced" in a way similar to the experience of "perception," like when you're awake and experiencing the real world, or "imagination," like when you're thinking about stuff. (Or something else?) Is the experience vivid, detailed, and involving multiple senses? (Typically hearing & vision.) Are you embodied, or is it mostly just a series of disjointed sensations? What is the quality of the experience? (What is it /like/? For me, it's most like being lost in thought, but to a greater degree.) I want to know because if people typically or often dream in a way similar to perception, and it can be vividly real, and feel as if "things are happening to you," then that would explain a few things, for example why kids might wake up screaming after a nightmare and run to their parents. But if this is really the way it is, the typical response of "it's just a dream, don't worry, you're safe," seems /incredibly inadequate/. The experience is /legitimately terrifying/, and it is absolutely mind-boggling for me to consider that the things people say about dreams might be like, literally accurate. Because if that were the case, how are you not all terrified of going to sleep?

So, in more detail:

My interpretation of things people typically say about dreams is that they are experiences people have while not fully conscious (ie "asleep.") There's already several things that don't match my experience just in that short definition. For one, the "experiences" part. People talk about dreams as if they are sequences of things that happen to them; as if they see, hear, or otherwise /perceive/ things in a similar way to what happens when they're awake. That has never been my experience. I can relate to the whole disjointed scenes/images/sounds and so on, and even so far as making a "story" operating by "dream logic," but I don't /perceive/ these things. The /quality/ of the experience is exactly the same as when /imagining/ things while awake; in other words, for me, "dreaming" == daydreaming, but while lying down trying to get to sleep.

The other confusing thing is the "not fully conscious" part. People often talk about not being able to tell they're dreaming, and there's advice for "lucid dreaming," where people offer tips about how to tell whether you're dreaming and "take control" or whatever. Indeed, this unawareness is the whole premise behind /Inception/. But... I honestly cannot understand how anyone could possibly be confused about whether they're awake or dreaming. The experiences are /very obviously different/ for me. It's not a matter of needing "tips" or "realising it" or whatever: if I'm aware /at all/ then I'm not uncertain about what's going on. In that vein, "not being able to wake up" from a dream also doesn't make sense to me. I get that sleep paralysis is a thing, but it's not universal and thankfully doesn't happen to me. My experience is that, if I'm "experiencing" anything at all, then I don't consider myself "asleep." I never have trouble "waking up," if I am aware at all.

In terms of actual /sleep/, what happens is I gradually become less "focused," until (presumably) at some point my consciousness "dissolves" entirely (obviously I don't remember when this happens) and then at some future point, whether 30 minutes or hours later, I become aware again and am "awake." This is why I often tell people I don't dream, because if I do, I'm not actually experiencing it (or at the very least not remembering).

There were two specific occasions where this has been different, and seemingly more in line with what people seem to be talking about. Both times I went from awake, lying in bed to "dreaming" without loss of consciousness or awareness, and was consciously trying to "lucid dream." This is apparently called a "wake-initiated lucid dream."

These times, I was experiencing things more in the way I normally do while awake. It was still disjointed images (at first), but these were consistent and detailed, and I could act /as if/ I was perceiving them, for example reading the number plate of a passing car, or looking at the way the pixels on a (dream) computer screen made up the image, or reading the text in a book. In the last particular case, the text didn't actually make /sense/, but nevertheless it was much more vivid and realistic, and in every way a totally different experience from usual.

The first time, I eventually came to a point where I had a dream body, and was "experiencing/perceiving" things. The dream was nothing special: I was lying in the exact same position in the room that I went to sleep in, although I could look around so on. What eventually happened was that a weird, evil caricature of my grandmother came into the room and started grabbing me by the neck with claw-like hands. This got a bit scary so I had to wake up, even though this was the first time I had successfully "lucid dreamed" and it was entirely new experience. (That was why I was reluctant despite not exactly liking the experience). I remained completely aware the whole time that I was dreaming, and that I could choose to wake up at any time. Nevertheless, it was scary, and I woke up with my heart pounding, and realised that my neck was sore from being badly positioned on my pillow.

The second time the dream was also that I was in the room where I went to sleep, in the same position, but this time I "got up" and walked around a bit. In this state it became harder to tell that I was dreaming; I still knew I was, but I couldn't directly feel it as easily. In the dream, a few people came to the door; one of them eventually went and started cooking something, and for the rest of the dream I heard sounds of cooking (pots & pans, microwave, extractor fan etc) even while other stuff was happening. These were extremely realistic and sounded like they were actually coming from the kitchen, given that I was in my room. But eventually I put a stop to it because it was starting to be hard to tell that I was not actually experiencing these things, and I wanted to check and make sure that I was actually still lying down where I originally was. That's the closest I've been to being unaware that I've been dreaming: still intellectually knowing but being unable to directly /feel/ the difference. But even just that much was a bit scary.

So, if I put together these experiences I've had and the things people say, the possibility arises that people actually experience things like this, /regularly/, /without/ being certain it's not real, /without/ being able to stop it at any time, and /scary things can happen/. Is this actually the case? Because, holy shit.
