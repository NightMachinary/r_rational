Ice Assassins are not temporary. Until they kill their target, they are just as permanent and as real as any other creature. Since Afi is both their target and their creator, he was able to order them to "Never harm or kill me, and always act in my best interest" and they are forced to obey. As such, the Ice Assassins can never complete their mission and so they are completely permanent.

They are separate beings from Afi and, as such, their sacrifices are just as valid as his would be.
