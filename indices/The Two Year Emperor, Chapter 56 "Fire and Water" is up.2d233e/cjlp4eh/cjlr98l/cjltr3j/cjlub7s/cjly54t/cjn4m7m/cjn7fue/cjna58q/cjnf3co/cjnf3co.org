My take on it is that the commands given by the creator are not simply mind control as you would get from a Dominate Person, they become part of the creature'a basic nature. This is why all forms of mind control magic allow saving throws and methods to break free, but an Ice Assassin's loyalty does not.

If that doesn't work for you, choose a justification that does. Point is, it works in Stupidworld.
