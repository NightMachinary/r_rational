I think the "appeal" for Herrun is not just in being let in on the secret, but that the one performing the sacrifice loses the knowledge and can never regain it, thus it becomes secret from them - each sacrifice makes the devotee aware that there's knowledge that's simply, completely beyond them, thus making them more inclined to want to be in the good graces of the goddess of secrets and knowledge so that the things they don't know might be less likely to bite them in the ass. After making the sacrifice, EVERYTHING you don't know might have been a hugely important secret you gave up to Herrun.

Jake's sacrifice of knowledge the Loki is playing both sides of the war leaves him hugely vulnerable to the repercussions of Loki's machinations. Albrecht previously chided Jake for failing to account for unknown unknowns, but now he knows he sacrificed some hugely important knowledge to Herrun. He doesn't know what it is, but Herrun does, and he KNOWS Herrun does, so he's probably gonna want to be her best friend in a way that's even more personal than the "Get a new God-Level Playing Piece on the Board on Our Side" motivation that led them to the idea of resurrecting Herrun.

I would think that if Herrun would be nonplussed about the Ice Assassin sacrifices for any reason it would be that since the Ice Assassins are temporary existences, and when they dissipate Afi is still wandering around knowing everything they knew, there's no one with the sense of knowledge/secret based vulnerability that she could exploit or would make them germane to worshiping her.

In your example, if the clones had been ritually pseudo-lobotomized but still knew how/why they had been - that is, that worshiping Herrun to keep them safe was their best chance, then I imagine she would find such a sacrifice acceptable, to whatever degree she prefers legions of mentally deficient devotees to one mentally deficient one.

I'd hypothesize that in general, Herrun prefers secrets/knowledge that leave the devotee vulnerable but no less capable, so that dead Ice Assassins sacrificing useful combat knowledge and capabilities are not too close to the top of her list, but likely are neither millions of Grofhamrites with no class levels.

And, while I've got your attention, congrats on writing the best Superman story I've ever read!
