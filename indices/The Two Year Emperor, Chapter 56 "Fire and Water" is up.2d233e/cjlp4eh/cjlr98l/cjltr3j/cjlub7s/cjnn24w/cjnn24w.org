  In your example, if the clones had been ritually pseudo-lobotomized but still knew how/why they had been - that is, that worshiping Herrun to keep them safe was their best chance, then I imagine she would find such a sacrifice acceptable

ooo, that gives me a thinky-thing!

When you polymorph something, it gains knowledge of the form, right? PAO up a dragon and it knows how to breathe fire, for example.

Do PAO'd people have knowledge of how to speak Common? I'm p-ret-ty certain that Common is close enough to being a racial feature of humans, no?

What if you Perma-PAO up a bunch of people, and then have them sacrifice their knowledge of how to speak common? Could get a whole horde of /very/ vulnerable people that way. The only thing they'd have to communicate with/through would be the Goddess herself. That'd make them /excellent/ worshippers. Especially since with (presumably) empty-ish minds, they could be shaped to anything she wants!

Hell, even if they /can't/ speak, you could use Tongues and some manner of not-quite-mind-control to convince the PAO-people to give up their knowledge of how hands and legs work, or something. Or you could PAO up some baby dragons and control them into giving up how their breath weapons work.

That'd prolly be a pretty evil solution, but hey.
