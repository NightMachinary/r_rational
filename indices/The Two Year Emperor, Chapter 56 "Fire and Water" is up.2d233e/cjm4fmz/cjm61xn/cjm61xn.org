The next paragraph should clarify that:

"With respect, Your Majesty," Einarr said, in that exact tone that conveys no respect at all. "It doesn't work like that. If you benefit from the knowledge being destroyed, then it isn't a sacrifice. The important part is the sacrifice, the choice to give up personal advantage to aid the Lady."

In other words, Jake was wrong and that doesn't work.
