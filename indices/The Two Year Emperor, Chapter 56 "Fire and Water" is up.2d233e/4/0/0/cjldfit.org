I think I was misinterpreting this line when I thought Loki had to remain neutral

#+begin_quote
  Loki is helping our side, but doing it subtly. He is playing both sides of this war against each other
#+end_quote

I'd thought it meant he couldn't openly favour either side. But given that he has been helping Jake and co quite a lot, albeit as part of deals, him helping Afi would also make sense. But in order for Jake and co to not just be obliterated, if he is helping Afi, he can't be doing it too much, or lending him power.
