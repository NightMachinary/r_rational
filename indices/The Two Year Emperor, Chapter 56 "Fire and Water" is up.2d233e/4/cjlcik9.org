I don't quite get why the altars are being moved. Is this to move the ritual away from Afi? Relocate it to another plane? And why can't the altars just be put on a floating disk without the need for bearers, or teleported?

Also, how many ice assassins does Afi have?! Is there a limit? Or can he just make an army of them and crush all of his enemies? This latest voice seems like it ought to be yet another ice assassin, as I doubt Afi would risk himself. But how does he plan to deal with the anti magic field? He has Loki with him, but I doubt Loki is allowed to help him as that would favor a side. Perhaps Loki is there to run negotiations between them? I can't really see any other plausible explanation, given that Loki must remain neutral.

And why weren't the people of Grofhamr sacrificing multiple secrets in the first place? Would it have taken too long?
