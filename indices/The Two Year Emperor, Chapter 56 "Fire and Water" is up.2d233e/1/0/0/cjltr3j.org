It still seems kind of worthless, since it's the same knowledge sacrificed over and over and over. Like if I made twelve billion clones of myself and lobotomized each one of them, would that count for twelve billions times as much as just lobotomizing myself to Herrun? Intuitively I would think that there would be diminishing returns, but I don't know whether that would hold true in Stupidworld.
