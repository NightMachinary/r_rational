I had cottoned on to the fact that you can fit infinite people in a square as long as they are all helpless, and you are helpless if you are "bound." Bound is a very flexible and undefined-by-D&D word. If you tie someone's hands together, they are "bound" but still able to move freely. So, tie everyone's hands and you can stack the entire population into one square.

I did actually look at the grapple rules, but wasn't certain if it worked or not, because of the line "If you can't move into your target's space, you can't maintain the grapple and must immediately let go of the target." I THINK your trick works, but I wasn't completely certain.

Thanks for pointing it out, though. :)
