The way the mechanics of the ritual were explained in chapter 47 don't really seem consistent with how we've seen it actually work. Did the characters just not understand it?

  If you have a way to recover the secret then it isn't a sacrifice

  And we have to make sure that the secrets aren't recoverable afterwards

I was under the impression that the secret is wiped from your mind and cannot be restored. As Afi knows everything his assassins are sacrificing, they surely have a way to recover their secrets afterwards otherwise. And yet, they appear to be being considered as equal sacrifices

And, in light of that, lines like this make no sense

  If there's anything that we want to be sure the enemy can't find out, we can sacrifice that knowledge. For example, the current location of GrÇ«fhamr; have one mage choose the next location and take it there, then sacrifice the knowledge of where it is. The next time we move, we take care to make sure that the mage doing the move doesn't know where he's teleporting from."

If only you are affected by the sacrifice, what good would sacrificing the knowledge do?
