I mean that Jake's plan doesn't make sense, because a mage not knowing the location won't affect Afi finding it. Whereas Einarr says it wouldn't work because it benefits him, not because the ritual doesn't work like that. And your mention of what I've "been shown so far" makes me extremely suspicious. This seems like it may be leading up to another "everything we have been told is a lie" moment
