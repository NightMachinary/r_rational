"Also, if the ice assassins each sacrifice the same thing, that would just seem wrong."

Yep. That's exactly what they did. I'll save you a little worry however: Afi does not, in fact, have one million Ice Assassins of himself.

"Doesn't the power Herrun gets from a sacrifice equal less if nothing is truly lost or you use it for your gain?(e.g.: Afi: "My phylactery is hidden at x,y,z. Now no one can find it, muahaha.")"

Yes. That might actually be harmful to the ritual. Although, if Afi were to sacrifice that it wouldn't render his phylactery unfindable /by someone else/ -- only by him. And if the phylactery were moved then he could find it at its new location. If he actually /planned/ to do that when he made the sacrifice then it would fall into the "you're cheating and this sacrifice does not help" category, but if he had legitimately never had the idea to do that then it would still count as a sacrifice.

"...then dispel the Assassins."

There's no reason to dispel the assassins. Even if you've ripped all useless knowledge from them and left them as mindless husks, they are still physical duplicates of you and make great decoys. Also, [[http://dndtools.eu/spells/frostburn--68/ice-assassin--1279/][Ice Assassin]] is not actually dispellable -- it has a duration of Instantaneous, meaning that it creates a creature and then is done. The creature is just as real as anything else.

In point of fact, the spell does not specify what happens to an IA after it kills its target. I ruled that it goes away, but that's my interpretation -- effectively a house rule.

[You like the story]

Wow.

I'm...really flattered. Thank you. I don't actually know what to say beyond that.

Out of curiosity, what are those 'less well know' stories that you mentioned?
