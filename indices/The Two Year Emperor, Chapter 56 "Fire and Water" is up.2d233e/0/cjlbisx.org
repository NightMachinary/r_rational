Jake's in a pickle now! Well, he's essentially been in a constant state of pickling since the start of the story, but now especially.

Afi's presence is highly disturbing. He's far too clever to try something that already failed once. The only different thing that I can see is Loki's presence.

Is Loki going to chair the negotiations between Afi and Jake? That would be hilarious.
