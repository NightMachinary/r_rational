They want to put hundreds of people in a small spot? Has Jake had a look at the Grapple rules yet?

Start with one person, let's say Albert. Benjamin, Bart, Bobby, and Betty all grapple him. Then, Cory, Catheryn, and Curtis grapple Benjamin; Carrie, Carland, and Catelyn grapple Bart; Caden, Cecelia, and Caesar grapple Bobby; and Caligula, Cain, and Cal grapple Betty. This can continue on with people like Derek, Ernie, Francis, and Gertrude adding more and more layers to the grapple.

This allows infinite people in one square, if you continue with that pattern. Better, each person can move the /entire group/ 1/2 their movement per round, so it might be able to supplement the commoner railgun as well.
