Um, this has probably been answered before, but I only just now spotted it.

So, an Ice Assassin of Afi can cast 9th-level spells. Can they cast /Ice Assassin/ themselves, and self-replicate? Because that would be absolutely bananas.

/Ice Assassin/ has an XP cost of 5000, and the Assassins can't gain XP or level up, so maybe they can't pay XP costs. That's the only reason I can think of not to go full grey-goo.

Well, either that or Afi tried and the gods warned him that, since his Assassins can also cast /Wish/, his antics fall in the category of "no infinite wish loops".
