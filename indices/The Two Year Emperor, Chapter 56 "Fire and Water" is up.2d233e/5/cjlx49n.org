Holy crap.

Holy crap.

Just. Wow.

I thought Afi would have done a /few/ sacrifices, not /one point two five/ */million!/*

Shit.. I'm going to have to familiarize myself with the rules a lot more to keep up.

Also, if the ice assassins each sacrifice the same thing, that would just seem /wrong/. e.g.:\\
Afi makes a million Ice Assassins.\\
Each one sacrifices knowledge of the same spell(say, magic missile)\\
Repeat for nine more spells, then dispel the Assassins.\\
Afi doesn't lose knowledge of the spells, because his assassins did the sacrificing.\\
Herrun now has ten million sacrifices to her name and is OP.

Doesn't the power Herrun gets from a sacrifice equal less if nothing is truly lost or you use it for your gain?(e.g.: Afi: "/My phylactery is hidden at x,y,z./ Now no one can find it, muahaha.")

I was considering different stories and the amount of enjoyment I got from them and realized that I ranked your story up in the top tier with the likes of HPMoR, Worm, and a few that probably aren't as well known. Here's what contributed to that, in no particular order after the first bit:

The obvious two, mechanics of the English language, and a good story.

Although it's not finished, you update like clockwork, once a week. This allows for time to consider the latest chapter and its implications without forgetting what has happened since last time.

Being able to discuss what's happened in the latest chapter is awesome, other people often have insights into things I wouldn't consider. +Bonus points for the author being part of the community in which we discuss the story.

Your story is now approaching mid-length on my personal scale of how long I like stories(500k~ish words is where I start to consider them 'long'), and is suitable for rereading, providing expected future enjoyment.

All-in-all, this is an excellent work, thank you!
