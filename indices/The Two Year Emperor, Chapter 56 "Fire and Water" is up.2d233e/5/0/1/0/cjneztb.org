An Ice Assassin is an autonomous being. The loss of one of its spell slots is not of much cost to Afi but it is of tremendous cost /to the Ice Assassin who is doing the sacrificing./

The fact that the creatures doing the sacrificing happen to be Ice Assassins is no more important than the fact that the Grofhamrites doing the sacrificing happen to be humans.

I'm not sure why this seems to be a sticking point for so many people.
