  "Also, if the ice assassins each sacrifice the same thing, that would just seem wrong." Yep. That's exactly what they did. I'll save you a little worry however: Afi does not, in fact, have one million Ice Assassins of himself.

Uhmm... that looks as a low cost sacrifice. It appears to me that the "size" of the sacrifice is proportional to the loss you are incurring due to the sacrifice, this is, the benefit of an Ice Assasin sacrificing everything they know is proportional to the cost of losing most of an Ice Assasin.
