The first one that came to mind is actually a ~4.5 million word multi-story saga of My Little Pony thrown through Ragnorok and a whole bunch of other Norse mythology. One Hel of an epic. (99 Worlds Saga by BlackRoseRaven)

Wastelands of Time and its sequel, Heartlands of Time by joe6991. HJP finds Atlantis and a secret magic to send his soul back in time a few years. Repeatedly. Thousands of times. Despite Harry's complete badassery, Voldemort always wins. Heartlands is incomplete and hasn't been updated since October of 2012, but I still go back and reread both of them every 6~8 months.

Prince of the Dark Kingdom by Mizuni-sama. Voldemort doesn't get defeated in 1981, and takes over Magical Britain. 1.2 million words and still going, but long waits between updates. Pretty heavy on international politics.

Of all the top-tier fiction I've read, those are the only ones I remember, that I also don't remember being mentioned on reddit.
