Can anyone recommend a good [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWeird][New Weird]] (Tropes Link) and Rational LitRPG? I know, it's a very specific request.

I'm currently reading [[https://www.parahumans.net][Worm 2]], and I just got to the front of [[https://thegam3.com/][The Gam3]] and [[https://wanderinginn.wordpress.com/][Wandering Inn]]. I'm craving for more.
