Since you are asking for some LitRPGs, I'll post every one that I read/follow. But be warned that I make no promises on the rationality. They are more like candy-stories; very enjoyable, but not healthy/rational.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/threadbare-original-litrpg.43430/][Threadbare]] - is about a teddy bear golem born into an RPG world and the story does an amazing job avoiding the common cliches.

- [[http://royalroadl.com/fiction/8463/the-arcane-emperor][The Arcane Emperor]] - it's as if the writer took the very concept of LitRPG and distilled into a concentrated form. It's focused on increasing the protagonist's power and exploring an interesting new world, but the twist that the author does an amazing job of keeping the danger coming without it getting repetitive or a slog to read. Plus the magic experimentation and rule testing is fun too.

- [[http://royalroadl.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests][Everybody Loves Large Chests]] - Great story with a sociopathic monster as a protagonist. It's not rational in the least, but the comedy is to die for.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]] - If you haven't read this, then you haven't been spending very much time on this subreddit.

- [[http://royalroadl.com/fiction/14396/the-snake-report][The Snake Report]] - it's a ridiculous story about a tiny snake just bumbling his way through life, but it really works with how cute the story is.
