It was called "Self-help with generative adversarial networks." About how to train them to generate your tax forms, your emails, your blackmails, etc. It's a real time-saver, and got me thinking about AGI too. So it turns out that GANs alone aren't enough by themselves to make AGI - to do that, you need to realize that substance dualism is true, and that ghosts really do exist. To make an AGI you basically have to capture a ghost and inject it into the computer. Easiest way is to just make the computer a horcrux. Hope this is useful!
