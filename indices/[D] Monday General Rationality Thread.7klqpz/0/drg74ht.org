So recently I saw a post on [[/r/science]] which really helped me get my shit together. As a result, I've constructed artificial general intelligence, and am now immortal. With all of this free time that I have now, I've been reading nonfiction books and figuring out how to munchkin this D&D campaign I've got going. So yeah, things are going pretty well for me I would say.
