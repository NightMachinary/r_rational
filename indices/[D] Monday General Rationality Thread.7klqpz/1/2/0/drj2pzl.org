Personally, I found this less appealing than the other two comics in the "series" (probably the wrong word, but whatever). I think [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergod][/Supergod/]] was probably the best, with [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackSummer][/Black Summer/]] coming in second.
