Really wanted to give this a try, but already at the beginning of chapter 1 it ends up just way to hard to read... Please get someone to read, correct and edit your texts. Its mostly small things like just exchanging some words, which will make it easier to read, else these small things add up and stop people from reading.

Example:

#+begin_quote
  But then a knock came *+on+/from* the door. As Mai got up, it burst open, and General Varsis walked into the room flanked by two of his soldiers.

  “General!” she cried. “What are you doing here?” She had thought he had left the palace *+when+/like* all the others did, *+when+/while* the mob had allowed all not of House Tachen safe passage out of the city. “Are you here to rescue me?” A glimmer of hope crossed her mind. House Makini could have stayed loyal despite it all.
#+end_quote

I hope this will not discourage you as this is not meant as criticism on your style of writing or story telling. I will try to read further into the story and hope that, like in most web fictions, the prose gets better over time.
