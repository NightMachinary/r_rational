So what are you saying are paths then? Because my interpretation was that with clues 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and evidence that proves the killer A, B, C there would be 9 paths.

1->A->confront killer

2->A->confront killer

3->A->confront killer

4->B->confront killer

5->B->confront killer

6->B->confront killer

7->C->confront killer

8->C->confront killer

9->C->confront killer

But if you're saying that the trail of clues that the players following isn't what determines their "path", then where are you getting these 27 different paths from?
