Rational fiction often has an element of mystery. The same applies, except you have to be more blunt because people might have to trawl through tens of thousands of words to find your clues and it's non-interactive.

Even in serial fiction you can't easily tailor your breadcrumbs to the understanding of every specific reader; some are going to be mistaken, some confused, and some correct.

Consider /Significant Digits/, which is wrapping up soon. It has lots and lots of hints sprinkled throughout the whole text, and nothing significant is ever hinted at just once. Readers were able to predict major plot points (e.g. the true identity of certain characters, their plans) because a thorough reading of the text revealed the well-placed signposts.
