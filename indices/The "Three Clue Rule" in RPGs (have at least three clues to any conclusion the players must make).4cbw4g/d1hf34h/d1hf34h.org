The first The Witcher game had huge investigation quest that required you to find every clue, and not to be misleaded by false paths. Most people I know (me included) - had finished that quest wrongly (blamed one of the innocent people, entered a trap set by the criminals).

It was even assumed that the player won't get it I think, so the unhappy path was still fun and not a total failure state in the bigger context.
