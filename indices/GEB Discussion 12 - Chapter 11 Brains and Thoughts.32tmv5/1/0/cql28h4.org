Hello, I just came from a meeting with several cognitive science graduate students and asked them about their opinion of the textbook. They said that it's a helpful read and it would be good for me to read in advance for my summer research project which is about creating a corpus of words that children from six months to four years are most exposed to.

One of them even had Josh Tenenbaum as his adviser a few years back and told me that they are still adding more stuff to the textbook as time goes by.

Basically the opinion is pretty good about the textbook.
