You can, but only so far before it gets confusing and unusual. It's fine though since I think the main problem is that in text what reads as extreme praise to you reads as mild sarcasm to me. The lack of emotional tone makes it harder to interpret the tone.

Though when I look back with the intent that you meant it as praise, it sounds a lot funnier to me.
