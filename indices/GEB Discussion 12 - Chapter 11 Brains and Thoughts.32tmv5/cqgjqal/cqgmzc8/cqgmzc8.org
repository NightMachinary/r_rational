I feel like you are trying to troll me by asking me questions about this specific [[https://probmods.org/][textbook]], but I'll try my best to answer the question despite having never read the textbook in question.

The textbook is not a cognitive textbook in the sense that cognitive science textbooks are meant to teach about cognitive science. Rather, the textbook appears to be about how to computationally model behaviors researched in cognitive science. It's sort of like saying an engineering textbook teaches you about physics even though it's not a physics textbook. However, it does look like a good textbook to read for computer scientists if they want to learn more about cognitive science and how it can relate to their field.

Now on to the general question of what cognitive scientists think of using computational models is, they are a tool to be used. The impression I get from my cognitive science professors (all four of them) is that computational theories of cognition can be very useful in that they can be easily tested by anyone with a good enough computer and have very strong explanatory power. However, they don't explain everything (or even the majority of questions we have) and therefore should be viewed as only one approach to the difficult problems in the field. As a side note, computer programming abilities are required in the field because it's a core requirement for the major at my school.

As to general opinion on the textbook specifically? I don't know, but I'll try asking my professor when I see him at my research group next Wednesday and post it here.

TL;DR - Computational approaches are one possible path to research the brain and aren't viewed as any better or worse than other options of research.
