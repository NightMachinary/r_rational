Thanks for the post [[/u/xamueljones]] for me it was especially helpful this time. When I read the dialogue I was confused about what the whole thing is supposed to mean, but your theory sounds good :) And I *did* think that the translation of Jabberwock is kind of strange while reading it.

  Unfortunately, this chapter is quite out of date since there has been a tremendous about of research done in the decades since the first publishing of GEB.

I also expected that most of what he said about the cognitive processes is outdated, what a shame.

Having said that I have to admit that I was not very excited about this chapter, maybe because it was too focused on speculations on how our brain may work without really giving the reader anything.

Btw I at least added the overview to the wikia page for the dialogue, in case you want to update the link.
