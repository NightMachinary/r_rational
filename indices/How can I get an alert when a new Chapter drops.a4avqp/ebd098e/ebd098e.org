I have a IFTTT applet that says: if on reddit there's a new post from search: "subreddit: rational title: mother of learning" than send me a notification. Sometimes I get a false positive but it works for me. [[https://i.imgur.com/fOuLbRH.jpg][Example image.]]

I have one of those also for Worth the Candle, Ward, One Punch Man, The Tutorial is Too Hard, etc.
