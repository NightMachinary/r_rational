That's it! The story is done, and with that, the world of Scar's Samsara finally comes to an end. I've had a crazy hard time juggling multiple stories, so in the end I decided I just had to sit down and finish this one first before continuing with the Need to Become Stronger again. Sorry for all of those who I kept waiting! In my defence, I recently lost my job, so real life has been a bit of a kicker. Cliche excuse, I know.

Thanks for reading everyone! Be sure to leave a review or a comment if you like. I always love reading your feedback, even if I don't always respond to it :)
