Now that it's over and the possibility of a spoiler is no longer an issue, I'm reminded of a question I got a /while/ ago. Namely: given that one of the chapters back in Scar's Samsara was titled Tiryagyoni, with the explanation given being that while Scar (and others) have similar mental faculties to humans, they still aren't human and thus are not manuá¹£ya. Does that imply that there are humans somewhere out there, in this version of Africa? If there are, what are their relations like with other animals? What do animals think of their relatively advanced skills?
