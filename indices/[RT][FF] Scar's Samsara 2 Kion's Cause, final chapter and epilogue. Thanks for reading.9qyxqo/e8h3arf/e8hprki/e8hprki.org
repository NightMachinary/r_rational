Huh, you've been holding back that question for a long time then. You must be a patient man. :P

I read the theory once that The Lion King is a post-apocalypse earth where animals have taken over, and I kind of gave a nod to that with Ushari's temple where (if you read between the lines) one of the statues in the corner is that of a human. However, I think it really ruins the mystique to actually answer questions like that in-story. A large aspect of world building I think is to give the impression of a world that exists beyond the scope of the actual story, and a big part of that lies in raising questions that will never get answered. So this is one of those things I like toying with and hinting at without actually having settled on an answer myself. :)
