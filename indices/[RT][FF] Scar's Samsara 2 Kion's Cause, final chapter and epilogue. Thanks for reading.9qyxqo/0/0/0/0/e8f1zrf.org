Oh. Well, that's not even a real pun, that's just a double meaning. Just about every tenth sentence in my stories has something like that, to remind my readers that I'm Very Clever (tm). Like when Kion thinks "for a second there, he had almost forgotten,"it refers both to the fact that he can use his ability that way as well as to how he forgot that he doesn't have to take care of everything himself.

Anyway, I'm glad you liked the story :P
