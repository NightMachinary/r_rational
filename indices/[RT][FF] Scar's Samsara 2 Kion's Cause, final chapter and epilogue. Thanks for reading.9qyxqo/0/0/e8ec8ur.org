Seriously though, it's supposed to be a book close, come full circle type of thing. The story starts with Kion assembling the team and them bickering with each other over their titles, and it ends the same way, showing that despite everything that happened and everything that changed, the most important things remained the same.

In my original draft, Kion actually ended up as more of a villain protagonist/ anti-hero, since people liked that aspect so much about Scar. The opening scene of the first chapter was alluding to that possibility, but in the end, he just has too many friends and good people around him for that to work.

In a way, Kion is actually the inverse of Naruto from NTBS. He is everything Naruto desperately wants to be: Respected, acknowledged for his talents, surrounded by friends and family who he can trust with his life. Naruto is defined by everything he is *not*, and the most heroic part of him is that he still chooses to do (what he thinks is) the right thing to do despite all of that. And that's why Kion could not be a villain, even though he kind of has that arrogant prince side to him: If he went evil despite having everything that Naruto ever wanted, he wouldn't be like Scar, he'd just be a brat.

And that's why the final chapter ends with Ono joking that they'll have to fight him too when it seems like all the power is getting to his head, and why it ends with the team joking around instead.
