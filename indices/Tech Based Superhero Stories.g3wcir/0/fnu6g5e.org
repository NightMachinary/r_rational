Hmm, I have a few examples but wouldn't call them strictly rational ones. I see Worm recommended already so I'll skip that.

--------------

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-fourteen.8938/][With this Ring]] is probably the closest thing I can recall right off the bat. A Young Justice Self insert with a Rational character that uses a combo of an Orange Power Ring, Human Tech, and Magic to achieve results.

An MC who is extremely annoyed by the fact that in the DC universe Freeze Guns, Super Speed, Magic, and the tech that supervillains regularly create to combat heroes is never used to actually help the planet. So he does that. Cleans up the ocean, stops global warming, integrates the hidden societies of Earth, solves some the the Amazon's issues. So this is more an exploration of dropping a person with a brain into the DC universe, and letting them string together all of the crazy things its characters spawn to help humanity. Although it is the secondary focus, it gets plenty of screen time as this is a very long fic.

Makes a good argument about how you can be extremely selfish (as Orange Rings are powered off Greed), but still help people. Develops are a fairly good pace, and has a well executed romance no harem.

A very long one, download the Epubs in the link. It's got some 'alternate' timelines thrown into the story as well at different intervals that get a little too weird for my taste so I usually skip them for the main story line.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592223/1/The-Spider][The Spider]] is one I just finished, Spiderman Self insert into classic Marvel / MCU / Spiderverse(not the movie type).

It was alright throughout, (some NSFW love scenes), better towards the start when Spiderman is still coming into his power. Once he goes off into space, he quickly become OP. Some of the tech he develops is used to help the Baxter foundation, but it's not the central focus.

Follows the Fanfic trope of everyone falling in live with the MC and a Harem developing towards the end. So once again, I give it a mediocre review.

--------------

A few other's that don't specifically focus on the Tech ramifications, but do have superheroes and at least semi-rational non-supers / low tier supers.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][The Metropolitan Man.]] Superman V Lex in the 30's.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Super-Sales-Heroes-William-Arand-ebook/dp/B072HQF1B6][Super Sales on Super Heroes]] read only with Unlimited. Massive Harem fic, slavery, and some rational utilization of tech. Kinda revels in having a 'rational' MC, who in my opinion is a high functioning sociopath caring only for his 'in' group.
