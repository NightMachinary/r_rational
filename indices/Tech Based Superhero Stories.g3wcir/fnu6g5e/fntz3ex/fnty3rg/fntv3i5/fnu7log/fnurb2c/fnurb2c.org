Generally no.

The primary cliche of the superhero setting is that A) you have super powers and B) they're in the current era.

If you let super-tech make actual changes to the setting, then you're no longer in the current era - you've just got scifi with superpowers that stick out like a sore thumb. I think this is because the fundamental thesis of superhero stories is to view modern problems through a magnified and bombastic lens; if you change the setting too much, it won't make sense for them to have modern problems.

That's why every superhero setting needs some excuse for why the super tech isn't publicly available - Worm has tinkertech, Marvel and DC have "it's there but like in the background where nobody but heroes ever sees or interacts with it", and Doc Future very quickly becomes "scifi with superpowers that stick out like a sore thumb" (but since you were along for the ride it's a bit easier to suspend your disbelief).

So, basically, superhero stories have a fundamental difficulty incorporating the storyline you want to see. It's just not something that fits easily in to the genre.

That being said probably the closest I've seen is the (sadly eternally unfinished) story [[https://fanfiction.net/s/10230499/1/Memories-of-Iron][Memories of Iron]], where basically Tony Stark comes by to fix the Worm universe by way of Taylor's brain meats.
