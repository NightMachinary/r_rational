I don't read it as such, it's got themes associated with it. The Justice League for example is deconstructed for what it is, American Centric and a boys club, but the MC has no particular animosity towards governments.

I'll spoil one scene, but he basically links up a (justified) American politician who hates magic with an Atlantian mage so he can learn about it, remove the fear via knowledge.

This kicks off a magi-tech industrial complex of the USA and Atlantis.

Not to mention the MC's biggest goal is the creation of an Orange Lantern Corp, that he does not have to run.

There are certainly political messages in this, and the associated side stories, but realistically. There were no messages so direct that I was offput. Your tastes might be different.
