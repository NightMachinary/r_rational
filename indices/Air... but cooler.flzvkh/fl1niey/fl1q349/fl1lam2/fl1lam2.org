Wouldn't it amount to being able to do anything at all? At least if you don't limit it by saying that your character must explicitly calculate in his mind what and how much does he want to change, accounting for all relevant side effects (i.e. if he thinks "I want to increase my arm's acceleration a hundred times from what it is now", he gets exactly that, but the result quite likely wouldn't be pleasant to him).
