Your power: control of collisions with gaseous molecules.

Air is made up of a bunch of molecules, mostly O2 and N2. These molecules are moving quickly and bouncing off of everything creating air pressure. How fast they are going depends on the temperature. Temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy, but it doesn't manifest as wind because it's disordered - going every which way. Because of this disorder, movement from temperature is not visible except on a very small scale - it's called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion][Brownian motion]].

This superpower redirects any air bouncing off the skin in a single direction. If you wanted to do less math about how fast it would go but violate more laws of physics, you could concentrate the kinetic energy from most of the air hitting you to a small amount of gas that is shot out in a specific direction. The randomness of the universe is decreased as this superpower is used, which breaks some of the laws of physics, but superpowers have to use handwavium somewhere. It would be more complicated but possible to pass the entropy on to whoever or whatever receives the wind as some sort of decay effect.

To make it cooler, it could either take heat away from the air super or the air could be cold when it hits the target. I'm leaning toward the first as it is a better use limiter (can't send too much air or you'll freeze) and makes more sense with the physics.

Factors that influence your powers:

- Skin/power surface exposed to air (more surface area = more wind)
- Ambient temperature (warmer air -> more wind)
- Wind (wind on skin -> increase power but decrease range in any direction except with the wind)
- Air pressure. If the air pressure and wind pressure combined are high enough, you could possibly fly by redirecting the air in the right direction. This would take some math I'm not ready to do right now to find the minimum pressure.

You can use specialized gases as part of your equipment:

- Heavy gases (e.g. radon, CF4) would make a stronger attack
- You are immune to poisonous gases and can send any you're in contact with out as an attack. You can store them inside yourself (lungs, large intestine)
