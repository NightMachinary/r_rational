There's a phrase â€˜the map doesn't equal the territory'.

Everything is relativistic - at what level is physics manipulated? Quantum levels? Subatomic? Newtonian levels of physics understanding? Unless you plan to write a comprehensive physics system then you need to have some form of cut off where you can hand wave questions away - you could for example have the main user have some form of addition organelle which connects to the brain which links to some extra dimensionary physics manipulation device which transcribes the users intentions to real world effects. You can decide what level of intent the system requires and leaves the requirement to explain every in and out of how it actually works. This is how most magic systems set in a real world environment get around the problem - in Harry Potter set phrases and motions result in set effects for example
