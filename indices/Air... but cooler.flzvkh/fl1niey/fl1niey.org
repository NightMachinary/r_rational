While thats a common outside look of how some superpowers work, actually changing physic laws is a bad idea*TM. Depending on how technical you want to get, actually changing the mass of your arm is a terrible idea unless you have some sort of protective effect especially for the user. Its called Manton Effect in superpower setting Worm for example.

Why? Take your mass increase example. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_quantum_chemistry]] Electrons around a heavy atomic nuclus experience relativistic mass increase, gold for example about 20%. This changes the electrons orbits, enough so that gold is gold instead of silvery!

Biochemistry is finicky enough that random mass changes would seriously mess it up.

TLDR: physic law benders can just hurt people by directly changing their opponents bodies. Increase van der waals forces until their blood sticks in their veins. Negate electrostatic force to have them crumble into radioactive dust.
