Thanks. Time travel is one of my favourite and at the same time hated tropes. The idea of it is so fascinating, but the execution in most stories tends to be similar and/or have massive plot holes.

I started with the intention of sending it up, but had to actually come up with a system that made some kind of sense. Not the easiest thing to do when you're improvising the story on the fly. Just glad I got to an ending (eventually).
