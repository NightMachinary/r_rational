  Suppose you have the same ability as above. However, now a random person you know in your circle of friends (~30 people) has the exact same ability. How would you attempt to find out who that person is (preferably without them realizing it)?

Depends a bit on how the ability works.

Consider this plan: For the next 30 days, pick one friend and have a 20 minute private conversation in a private location. Towards the end of the conversation, without any warning, take out a knife and stab your friend. (If you aren't stronger than your friend, train to be stronger before attempting.) Be on guard around the 14 to 19 minute mark of the conversation.

There are a two possible outcomes:

Case 1) You successfully stab and murder your friend.

Spend a few minutes stabbing your friend to death, then revert 5 minutes to back before you stabbed your friend. Since they died without using any time rewind ability, this likely indicates that they do not have the time rewind ability (do this early in the day so they haven't used up their 5 minutes yet). Because if they did have a time rewind ability, why didn't they use it to prevent their death?

Since you rewinded to before your murder attempt, no one notices anything wrong. Proceed to stab your next friend tomorrow.

Case 2) Sometime around the 14 to 19 minute mark, your friend will suddenly react as if they just came back from a future where you stabbed them.

Watch for signs of this, such as sudden shudders, sudden attacks, sudden attempts to flee without any explanation, etc. Now you know your friend has the time rewind ability, but this is the part where things get tricky, depending on the specifics of your time rewind ability.

The problem is, you now have an angry time traveler that is very wary of your future murder attempt. The question is, can you still use your time rewind ability? You haven't used it at this point in time, after all. And you wouldn't use it in the original future either, since your friend used his ability before dying, and you only use your ability after your friend dies, which never happens. So I would think yes, you can. Use your ability to rewind back 5 minutes, and now your friend (who has already used up his 5 minutes) can't follow you back. So you effectively arrive at a past where your friend, the other time traveler, still has no idea you were even attempting anything funny. Now you know your friend has the time rewind ability, with no one knowing you know.
