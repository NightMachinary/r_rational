This will work wonderfully, up until some very serious men in suits turn up asking nasty questions about insider trading.

Sure, they won't actually /find/ any evidence of insider trading to charge you with, and so they're likely to be more inconvenient than anything else, but they're going to be extremely suspicious and send more time trying to figure out /how/ you're doing it than bothering to check whether or not you actually did.
