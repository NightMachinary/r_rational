I hire an agent to find jobs for me. Just because I'm the one with the ability doesn't mean I have to munchkin it myself.

  How would you attempt to find out who that person is (preferably without them realizing it)?

I precommit to shooting my friend in the back if possible and then going back five minutes. He'd most likely go back one minute and save his power, and avoid giving me the opportunity. Then I go back in time the full time and he doesn't remember any of this.

In his sleep.
