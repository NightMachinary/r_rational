I think one amazing facet of this power is undetectable information gathering. You have the ability to perform tests and then make it as if they never happened. You can also asymmetrically communicate with someone in an undetectable way. Here are some example uses I can think of for this power:

- You smash a window / bypass a lock / do whatever you need to get access to sensitive information. You don't need to be careful, just fast enough that you're within your 5 minute time limit. You memorize the information and reset. Now there's no physical evidence, nothing is disturbed, you might as well not have been there so it's impossible to know that you were.

- You want someone to meet you and communicate something to you, but you don't want to reveal yourself. Tell them to meet you at a particular place, get the information from them and reset. Now you can walk past or away from the meeting place, and as far as the person's concerned you just never showed up. You can also tell someone to do a dead drop, get the information from that and then reset. Anyone watching the drop location won't be able to tell that it was accessed, because you made it so that it technically never was

- Test out anything when you're not sure how safe it is. As long as it won't destroy your brain or irrevocably traumatize you, you can get away with a lot of dumb stuff. You have a safety margin so that if anything bad happens, you can reset it and do something else.

- It gives you extra thinking time. If something shockingly bad happens, you have up to 5 minutes to process it, figure out how to fix things or just generally figure out what you would do differently. You'll have a nice buffer against being surprised. If there's a medical emergency, a 5 minute warning can easily be the difference between life and death

- You now have a godly success rate at nearly anything you try, so you can possibly leverage that into fame. Imagine a surgeon that could erase up to 5 mistakes during a day of operations. Imagine an athlete that can shut down up to 5 novel, potentially game changing plays from the opposition. The ability to never be caught off guard gives an unreasonable advantage. On the other side of this, you can make more risky plays and try more dramatic things without worrying about them panning out.

- You can ask and then unask a question, and do a lot of social engineering. This is more unethical use of the power, but you can do something like "Hey what's your name?" /reset/ "Oh hi Bob, of course I remember you". Someone catches you in a lie? Ask what gave you away remorsefully, then reset because you now have the information you needed to lie successfully this time. You can dig for information by striking up conversations with people, and then surprise them when you know things that they don't think they ever told you
