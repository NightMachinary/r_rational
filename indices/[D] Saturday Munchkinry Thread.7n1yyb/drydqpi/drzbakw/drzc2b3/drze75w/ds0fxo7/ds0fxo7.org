You don't need to be quite so secure with this since you know the power can only take back five minutes at a time. OP does specify that they have the exact same power, so we know they have the same limitations. Therefore you don't have to precommit to never giving out your information, even under torture, you just need to precommit to waiting at least five minutes after the perpetrator has revealed himself before giving out information. Store all of your information under some fancy lock or encryption program that, when someone attempts to access, leaves some signal that it has been accessed, waits for five minutes, and only then actually opens. So even if they get your password they won't be able to access your files without leaving a trace.

Similarly, if you have personal knowledge that you might allow people to know, such as your home address, but don't want people knowing without your awareness, you can precommit to only give out that information at least five minutes after deciding to give it out. Then the only people to be suspicious of are people you decide to give it to but end up suddenly leaving without the information before the five minutes are up.
