  OP does specify that they have the exact same power, so we know they have the same limitations.

That is an incredibly good point, but I still think it's best to be as cautious as possible until you discover the nature and origin of the powers. I know if I were ever really put in this situation, the fastest way I'd screw myself over would be to think "only this specific power with this specific limitation exists". I mean, how arbitrary is 5 minutes when you really think about it? Why /that/ specifically? I know the Doylist answer is "because the question's OP said so", but I think these munchkinry threads are more fun if you take them seriously and really put yourself in those shoes
