It depends on the context. These posts generally imply some sort of background knowledge where you have been told exactly the contents of the post ahead of time by a reliable source, or have acquired this information in some way. Otherwise, how would you know you even had this power and how to use it? When is the last time you mentally attempted to go back in time exactly one minute? When is the last time you attempted to read the mind of someone while you were touching them? You might jokingly try some powers every once in a while, but we have very strong evidence for living in a world where these powers don't exist, so you don't try every permutation of possible triggers for powers in order to discover which ones actually work. So if you did happen to spontaneously acquire one of these powers, you wouldn't even realize it unless something informed you.

So I think we can assume for the sake of munchkinry that the post is 100% accurate and that this is common knowledge, but in practice I would be cautious, and probably suspicious of everyone ever in case they also had similar powers.
