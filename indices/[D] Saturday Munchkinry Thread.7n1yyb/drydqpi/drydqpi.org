*Pint-sized time travel*

You discover that you have the ability travel backwards in time. Specifically, you're able to, at will, instantly send your consciousness back exactly one minute into the past, upon where it will overwrite the mind of your past self (I.e. mental time travel). You also realise that you can use this ability up to 5 times every 24 hour period, with no immediate cooldown (so you can, at most, travel back 5 minutes per day by chaining your uses).

You could obviously use it to win at gambling, but what bigger picture uses for this ability are there? How would you exploit this ability to its maximum?

*Scenario Two:*

Suppose you have the same ability as above. However, now a random person you know in your circle of friends (~30 people) has the exact same ability. How would you attempt to find out who that person is (preferably without them realizing it)? If necessary, how would you attempt to apprehend that person?
