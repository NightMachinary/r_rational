In scenario two, where I have a friend with the same ability, we can work together to send information a lot further than five minutes into the past.

To take an example, let us say that there is a lottery in which ticket sales close two hours before the results are made public. I observe the results, then I go back in time five minutes and tell my friend.

He hears me give him the results five minutes early, then goes back in time to tell me.

I hear the results from him nine minutes early (it took a bit of time for him to hear the results). Since I have not yet used my five minutes today, I go back in time five minutes and tell him the results.

He hears the results from me thirteen minutes early, and goes back in time...

--------------

About two hours before the numbers are drawn, just before ticket sales close, we each purchase a ticket with the right numbers and share a large prize.

So, basically, as long as the two of us work together (and can trust each other), we can send small bits of data back through time an arbitrary amount (at the risk of one of us mishearing at some point and getting the data wrong).
