  How would you attempt to find out who that person is (preferably without them realizing it)?

Watch the suspected people for obvious usage of the power. Gambling and such should be a good tell. You could also attempt to give them a reason to use said power. In other words manufacture a situation where their power could be used to save someone or something.

Apprehending the person would be easy. Just drug them in their sleep. edit: Really any type of drug that took longer than 6 minutes to act would do.
