You don't even need to do that. 5 minutes of time rewind is actually pretty useless for combat purposes, especially since they can only time rewind 5 times per day. It might give them some early warning to flee, or 5 retries to escape/win the fight, but that's nothing in the face of overwhelming force. Any standard police force would have no problem arresting such a time traveler, and once they are in a prison cell, their time rewind abilities wouldn't do a thing to help them escape.

The only time this time rewind ability would be useful in combat is if you were evenly matched. But then, you shouldn't be trying to apprehend someone while you are evenly matched anyway. Always attack from ambush with superior firepower.
