  what opsec countermeasures could you apply to negate this?

If you want information to be confidential, you have to /never/ give it out. Not under torture, not if you have a gun pulled on you, not if someone walks over and says they're going to shoot your whole family if you don't tell them what they need to know. A person with this ability can still only know what you're willing to tell them. If you pre-commit to keeping your important information a secret even in dramatic situations, it'll be much more work to exploit you if it's possible at all.

As for physical security... in a theoretical sense, you want to make sure your information is encrypted so that it's useless to try memorizing it. In a real world sense, I'm positive someone with this ability could break into anywhere they please with enough preparation. The problem is that /someone/ has to be able to access the information and unless it's only you and you're willing to take your password to the grave, it's vulnerable to the same kind of real world problems that cause security to fail. Even worse actually, because it can be impossible to detect when someone has carefully used this ability to fish for information until they know everything they need. Someone with this ability would also be unreasonably good at breaking into places to steal physical things, it just wouldn't be undetectable. Honestly I think it's pretty broken in that regard, and that the only way to secure things would be making them genuinely impossible to access (which isn't practical to do). You also can't assume someone else has your same 5 minute time limit, which complicates things even further.

So my verdict is that you can keep mental secrets as long as you strongly pre-commit to keeping them, but if you have something written down or otherwise stored then you're up a creek without a paddle. Someone can methodically fish until they have a path to get your information, and you'd never be able to tell when they did.
