An excellent and well thought response.

How would you handle scenario 2? Knowing that your adversary has the ability to gather information from YOU and your environment possibly without you knowing, what opsec countermeasures could you apply to negate this?

Or what I'd want to know is: how to resist investigation/interrogation from a person with mental time travel. Could you lie? How would you ensure cross scenario consistency? Any way to prevent your moves from being predicted?
