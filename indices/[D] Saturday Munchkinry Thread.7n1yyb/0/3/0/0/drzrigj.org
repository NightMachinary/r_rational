  While the stock market can have a really dramatic shift in five minutes, that's not the usual way it works.

The plan here is that you're going to be deliberately looking for very rapid stock changes throughout the day. This will probably involve having an AI that automatically notifies you of such changes. Ultimately I think this will work because on most days I imagine there will be some very rapid changes in stock in some publicly traded company /somewhere/. Though of course going to casinos would be a very good way of getting a few million starting capital, however people won't let you go to their casinos if you consistently win millions of dollars, so you can't scale up that income.
