I don't necessarily think other people copying my investments would actually be that bad, if anything it would increase profit. If I buy stock and other people jump on that then the stock increase will end up higher than it would have been otherwise, with a similar situation for shorting.

Ultimately enough other people will copy my trades that they drive each other down to zero profit, whereas my profit is higher than ever, because I always get in first before the market compensates for my actions.
