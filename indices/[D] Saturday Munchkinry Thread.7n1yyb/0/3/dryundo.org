I mean in the first scenario it strikes me that the obvious use would be in stocks, since any ability to consistently outcompete the market is going to potentially make you the richest person alive.\\
Once you've done that it's rather difficult to imagine many likely scenarios where you can make a massive difference by going up to five minutes into the past, so mainly you're going to affect the world by being absurdly wealthy. You could also potentially make your abilities known which would make you famous and come with wealth that way, but this would come with many drawbacks and likely being barred from manipulating stocks the same way.
