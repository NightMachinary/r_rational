The premise is sneer bait, I don't think I can deny that.

But in all seriousness, if I were to continue this, unfortunately I would probably stick to the HPMOR tradition of characters taking a charitable stance, and thus not realizing the true agenda of other characters, and thus follow the stations of 'canon', so the snapping wouldn't happen until the graveyard battle, so I would have enough material to work with. Though I'd be obligated to make it more impactful. I might, perhaps, turn the Ender's Game homage parts into a Bonzo and Stilson homage.
