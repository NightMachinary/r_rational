  There are mechanisms needed to 'hold' us flat which I don't have a good sense of the best way to accomplish that yet.

Presumably, a pair of 4D forces that push matter into our hyperplane. Like if Flatlanders were just crawling along the ground in our 3D world, held down by gravity and held up by the normal force, but co-existing quite happily with 3D birds that can fly above and worms that can dig below.

The analogy with gravity suggests that 3D technology may be able to make small movements in the vim/vout direction, like a human can jump in the air and briefly defy gravity. But we can't phase through walls any more than a man can leap over a skyscraper.

4D creatures may be completely immune to these forces, or they may simply be able to fight them.

  For purposes of shorthand I will be using the 4th spatial dimension jargon of vim and vout.

You may be interested in knowing that the book which popularised the Fourth Dimension called them /ana/ and /kata/.
