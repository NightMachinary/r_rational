  There are mechanisms needed to 'hold' us flat which I don't have a good sense of the best way to accomplish that yet.

I'm not sure that something preventing most movement in the 4th dimension would lend itself well to animated 4D structures such as animals. You could get away with 3D animals which could 'jump' up and down the hyperplanes, and sessile configurations similar to trees, but unless the animals themselves had some innate ability to annul the flattening effect of hyperphysics within their own skin, basic 4D maneuvers (such as rotating a joint anywhere except strictly within a 3D hyperplane, or pumping fluids through 4D networks) are going to be difficult to pull off.

Greg Egan's /Quarantine/ speculates a little on creatures which extend beyond 3D space into fuzzy probability, and to whom the quantum-collapsing act of human observation is deadly; it essentially reduces them to a single 'slice', generally with lethal consequences. A 4D animal in a held-flat universe might well have a similar problem; it'd be equivalent to a human being sliced into ten thousand cross-sectional slides and then nothing being able to pass from one section to another (including nerve impulses, blood, parts of muscles or bones, neural signals...).

Effectively, you're going to need native (or artificial) 4D matter, which is not affected by the flattening, and 3D matter which is (perhaps all 3D matter has something like a vibrational frequency which attracts it to the matching hyperplane and holds it there, whereas 4D matter has no such frequency and therefore cannot get 'stuck' on individual planes). Add in something like quantum energy levels similar to electron shell levels, so that 3D matter can't be easily bumped from its vibrational plane. And maybe even throw in that it's the vim/vout uncertainty causing issues like the fixed speed of light. Hmm... increased energy of a particle in a hyperplane distributes more and more of that energy to vim/vout movement, causing the particle to have an effective top speed of /c/ because the rest of the energy is going towards an uncontrolled orthogonal vibration, which shows up in the hyperplane as a heterodyning resonance effect called /mass/ or /gravity/ depending on how it's measured... too much mass in one place causes a particle to quantum-smear into the higher dimensions and show up as a black hole in the original plane?
