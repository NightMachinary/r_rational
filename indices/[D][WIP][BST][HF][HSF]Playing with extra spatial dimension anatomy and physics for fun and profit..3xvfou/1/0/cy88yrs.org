already read diaspora a while ago, and flat land, and several other topics beside. The desire to VISUALLY illustrate a 4d in 3d critter is why I'm bothering to do the leg work for this.

Although I'm on reflection going towards all standard physics is 3D emission sheets that tend to normalize their angle/orientation on interaction with one another so the universe resembles a whole lot of sheets of 3D floating in 4D rarely interacting.

Gravity may or may not be less tightly constrained to any given sheet depending on if I care to get heavily into explaining dark matter or not.

Presumably the universe contained a lot less continuity in its total 3D plane in the past. Thus discontinuities of planes being threaded together oddly was a thing and is the original environment that our 4D animals evolved in the first place.
