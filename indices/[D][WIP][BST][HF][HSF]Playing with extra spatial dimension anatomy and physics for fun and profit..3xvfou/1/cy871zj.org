  Electromagnetism and the strong force DO function across vim/vout or they are flat but 'spinning' in a manner that crosses vim/vout and other such.

Photons are the carriers of electromagnetic force.

Also, [[/u/alexanderwales]] comment on the effect on radiation. THis is actually a plot point n Greg Egan's novel /Diaspora/, which I encourage everyone in this group to read.

Really, what you need is a force that doesn't interact with normal matter at all. There's no reason this can't exist. You can throw in dark matter in as well, though 4th dimensional matter wouldn't simply be "dark Matter" since dark matter interacts gravitationally.

And, again, I recommend you read /Diaspora/ before you go much further.
