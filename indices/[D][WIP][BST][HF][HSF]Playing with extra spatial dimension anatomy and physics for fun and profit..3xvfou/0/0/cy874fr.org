Ya that's why I surmised that essentially gravity and light at least are three dimensional emitters not 4 dimensional emitters.

In other words they are flattened in one of the four dimensions.

Electromagnetism and strong force seem to already be fairly limited in their range per power effect so I was considering there might be wiggle room at an earlier era of technology.

But it looks like the problem ultimately is that they ALSO need to be a 3-dimensional emitter as well.

Which is interesting but problematic.
