Possibly a problem with conversation of energy? If energy is leaving our hyperplane through emissions vin/vout, why are we not seeing that?

I'm also curious if you have read [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/274052.Spaceland][Spaceland: A Novel of the Fourth Dimension]], which is a take on the idea of us living in a secretly 4d world with 4d creatures (I wouldn't call that book a rational fic, though).
