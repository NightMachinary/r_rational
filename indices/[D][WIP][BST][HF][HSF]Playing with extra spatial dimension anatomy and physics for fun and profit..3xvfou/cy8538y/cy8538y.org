Emissions from a source follow the inverse-square law in three dimensions and the inverse-cube law in four dimensions.

If you were a two-dimensional creature with a two-dimensional emitter, you could use an emission detector to see that emissions followed the law of proportions; double the distance, receive half the power.

However, if you were a *two*-dimensional creature with a *three*-dimensional emitter, you could use an emission detector to see that emissions followed the inverse-square law; double the distance, receive one fourth the power.

If you were a *two*-dimensional creature with a *four*-dimensional emitter, you could use an emissions detector to see that emissions followed the inverse-cube law; double the distance, receive one eighth the power. And in fact, *the same is true if you were a three-dimensional creature with a four-dimensional emitter.*

So if gravity travels in vim/vout, then gravity follows the inverse-cube law. If electromagentism travels in vim/vout then we should see magnetic fields follow the inverse-cube law. If there were a higher spatial dimension that these forces acted on, we would know.

This doesn't really help you at all, just clarifying some of the difficulty involved.
