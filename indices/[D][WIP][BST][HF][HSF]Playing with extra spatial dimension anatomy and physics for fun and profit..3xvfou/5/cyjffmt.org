Maybe [[https://xkcd.com/1621/][this]] will help you work on the subatomic physics you'd need to tackle for this to be actually believable.

But seriously, as has been pointed out, you'd need to expand the standard model by adding new 4D forces and their corresponding force-carriers. Changing literally anything about how the existing four forces act would make your universe irrecognizably different from our own. My suggestion would be to try to incorporate dark matter, but I can name multiple issues off the top of my head (such as "GRAVITY Y U NO INVERSE CUBE").
