Yes. It's grief not tinged wishfulness. It's what happens when you have a chronic mental or physical illness that shapes your life in such a way that you feel that you have lost much potential and missed out on opportunities and aspects like love, education, jobs, stability, and travel. You are in a sense mourning lost time and agency.
