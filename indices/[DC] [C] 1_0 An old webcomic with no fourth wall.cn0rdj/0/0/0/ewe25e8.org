Huh. Maaaaaybe. Strip 669 has Ghanny describe Terra's situation as having a personality that causes her to abandon what is natural for her species, further saying that her heart and mind were in conflict with body, and that her heart was going to win. She seems to accept this description. Taken as is, that would likely indicate a heteroromantic / homosexual nature, yes. However, a direct analogy is drawn between this situation and a lesbian woman Tailsteak once knew, with the implication that all that stuff also applied to her. This makes me think that maybe Tailsteak had a misconception about homosexuality, in which he thought a homosexual person's personality causes them to veer away from their body's naturally heterosexual inclinations. If so, I don't think it was a /malicious/ misunderstanding, and certainly it was one that was cleared up by the time he wrote Leftover Soup.
