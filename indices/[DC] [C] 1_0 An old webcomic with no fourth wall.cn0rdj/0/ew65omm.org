Wow, I think the first time I read this comic was back in middle school. It was a few years old even then.

Some of the stuff I remember liking: The author was allowed to introduce new rules to the story, but once he did, they couldn't be gotten rid of. This meant that once he brought one person back to life as a ghost, everybody would get to do so going forward. Likewise, once one character escaped reality by diving into their own thought bubbles, everyone was capable of doing that. That ended, if I recall correctly, in the characters going on strike until the author agreed to stop putting new rules in. Also, Zadok's continued attempts at economics were fun, as were his attempts to avoid the author's shortcomings by doing things off-panel where Tailsteak couldn't flub it. /Also/ also, the Junior war arc at the end had a lot of tactical thinking about what advantages they had and what threat a telekinetic ghost posed, even if it didn't end up being all that necessary.

It /is/ worth mentioning that the comic is quite frequently, uh, rather impolitic. It's hard building a criticism for the comic on that basis, though, because usually it's either a character having a bad opinion (and subsequently getting called out by the author), or the author having a bad opinion (and subsequently getting called out by one of his characters). The thing where Terra converts from lesbian to straight, sorta, is still an eyebrow raiser, though.

Definitely an /interesting/ read, one way or another. The author is not afraid of playing with big ideas. And I did enjoy it, ultimately.
