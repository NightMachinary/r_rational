  I hope to make the story rational as it goes on
#+end_quote

You'd be surprised to know how many stories posted here with that promise never end up becoming rational. Rational stories almost always have a rational /setting/, and as we can tell that from the first chapter, it isn't. I guess it could still be, but it looks like game's setting combined with the anime's for now. Rational doesn't mean serious, or edgy, or more realistic than the source material (though that's usually a part of it).

Speaking about the fic itself, my suggestion is that you wait until you have 20k words or so before posting again, so we can tell what the story is actually about.
