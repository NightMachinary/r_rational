This has more than two problems.

Irrespective of whether or not it's a "rational" story and thus appropriate for this sub (check out the sidebar for the definition), which is hard to tell from one chapter, I feel you're in sore need of an editor. There are basic errors of capitalization and punctuation, especially when dialogue gets involved. There are typos of the kind spellcheck should be able to find ("letetr"), which says unfortunate things. Many of your sentences are just kind of... clunky and rife with clich√© ("A bellow that shook the earth itself filled the air"). Your paragraph breaks don't make sense ("Tyranitar let out another blow, as if he was testing the mountain itself. / In return another mountain of snow started descending.") and are in general far too frequent. The narration contradicts itself (in one paragraph, Pikachu is explicitly not trying to intimidate Gold, and in the next it is). These are all technical problems which a good editor should be able to help you clean up. It's hard to judge your story, themes, and characters from a single chapter. I will say that "Gold goes to Red on Mount Silver and learns his story" is an idea with potential, but you still have to do a lot of work to realize that potential.

I see from your ffn profile that you have read and enjoyed Origin of Species. Game of Champions is linked on the front page of this sub at the moment - you should read that as well. It does a fine (though by no means perfect) job of communicating the tone you seem to be going for in your characterization, and is very good at describing Pokemon and making them feel like characters in their own right.

EDIT: Also, "but when the indigo league needed him most he vanished" sounds like it came right out of Avatar: the Last Airbender's opening narration and really should be reworded.
