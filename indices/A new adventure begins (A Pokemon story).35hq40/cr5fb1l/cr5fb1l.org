I'm not sure if your edit has gone through successfully, as I literally found a couple of dozen errors, not counting repeated ones. (Typhlosion is written as Typlosion repeatedly, but I only counted it once) This included "letetr", which Aretii specifically mentioned.

I have to agree with all of Aretii's points. The story asks some good questions, but currently doesn't look interesting enough to make me want to know the answers, and shows no particular sign of rationality. I'm guessing that Red's rationality is the key to his extraordinary success, but there is literally no hint of this anywhere in the text as of yet. If this hadn't been submitted here and I'd instead stumbled across it by browsing new ff.net stories, I would have no indication whatsoever that the story was supposed to be about this.

If you can write some more chapters (I suggest before submitting anything), enough to show the reader the point of the story and that it's both worth reading and worth submitting to the subreddit, I'd be willing to serve as an editor. I'm not a fantastic writer, but I can help you iron out the technical problems such as poor grammar.

If my guess about Red's success is correct, I'd also advise scrapping the first chapter entirely, and rewriting it. Including some references as to how Red got his success from the POV of a skilled trainer who has witnessed it would make the rationality of the story more obvious, and intrigue the reader. I imagine someone who has cut through the league in this fashion would have done so in a rather confusing way that makes others very interested in how it occurred, which is presumably why Gold has climbed this mountain and wants to hear the story. After all, I'm sure that regular news sources would have told the low-hanging fruit already, considering you could look up, say, Michael Jordan's entire life history right now. But if you're an aspiring NBA player, you might want to hear from Jordan himself, if you seek to be like him.
