Thank you for writing out this reply. You were right, it did not update, though now it should be fixed.

I actually thought about your advice, and have decided to rewrite the whole story from scratch. I will repost the story here when it is is sufficiently long, (probably 10,000 words I think).

Thank you for suggestions!
