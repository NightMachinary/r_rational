First of all I would like to thank you reading my story and writing out this reply. I will go through it again and check for these obvious grammar mistakes and I hope they did not take away from the main idea of the story.

I hope to make the story rational as it goes on but I wanted this chapter to set up the story, so I did not want to do anything to plot heavy. Once again I will try to iron out this mistakes and hope you would be willing to read chapter two!

PS:No idea why I made that homage to Avatar but I will rewrite it.
