People say this is a "humanity fuck yeah" story - I think that's just what happens when you put realistic humanity into the setting of an unrealistic space opera.

[edit] I think a possible valuable RL good-idea takeaway from this story is "make first contact with astronauts; they're most plausibly sympathetic."
