I, once again, am having worm flashbacks reading this (tough to be fair there is ample cases of this in the guide itself). Everyone that sees Cat/Taylor underestimates her and underestimating the MCs is at the very top of things not to do in fiction. Thankfuly the Pilgrim is not marching to war with his spear so far up his ass that is ticking his ubula.

We met the Saint and she is scaring the princes into line. is that good or bad? I mean if they follow the terms of engagement it might mean that they will be more competent that previously thought. By the way the Saint's ass also doubles as a scabard for her blades, since she is following the moral leanings her last name, Montfort, inspires. Simon of Montfort was one of the leaders in the crusade to quash the catar heresy in the middle ages. he was famous for saying "kill everyone God will choose his own." anyway that she curses the princes into shape is amusing.
