I like how the Grey Pilgrim is completely taking for granted that Black will lose the coming battle. I guess he doesn't have the benefit of knowing Black, so he doesn't know how surgical and thorough the guy can be.

It's funny, in a way, it looks like since he met Catherine, he respects her more than he respects Black, who he only has secondhand accounts of.

Black is the implacable man who specializes in anticipating people who specialize in blindsiding implacable men. The Vales is a super defensible position, and the Heroes are going in with what appears to be very limited intel. I don't know if Black is going to hold the city, but whether or not he does, I expect his enemies to get /wrecked/.
