Eh, Pak are paperclip maximizers at best. They appear to be driven by two major goals - to aggressively provide resources and protection to their bloodline, and deny resources to others. This is not the same as improving their bloodline's prosperity.

There were two Pak I can think of that might have been far more rational than most.

Teela Brown ended up engineering her own death as she realized she was going to start making decisions she couldn't accept based on her remaining humanity. Before that, she worked to preserve the Ringworld.

The ghoul protector that appears in the third ringworld book appears to be more rational.

Pak in general, seem to be more rational if they come from more intelligent breeder stock. Vampires were unintelligent as compared to ghouls. (Bram was from vampire stock - I do not remember the name of the ghoul Pak, and it's not quickly findable on Wiki.) It's quite likely that the ghouls are on par with or more intelligent than Earth humans.
