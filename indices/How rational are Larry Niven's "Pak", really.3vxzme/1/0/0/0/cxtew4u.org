Within the Sol System, yes, but other worlds had their own governments. The Institute of Knowledge on Jinx produce Boosterspice, for example, and I'm pretty sure the ARM would have frowned on that, and Gregory Pelton's grandmother was able to invent the Transfer Booth (Flatlander).

Basically, during the Man-Kzin war period (The Warriors through The Soft Weapon), there's 300 years (approximately 2300 to the early 2600s) where the ARM were put on the back burner.

Beowulf Schaffer's stories start in the mid 2600s. The ARM have some influence outside Sol (Neutron Star, Borderlands of Sol, Procrustes) but the other worlds are still sovereign nations and the Belters are still thumbing their nose at Earth (Borderlands of Sol).

Things are clearly very different by the time of Ringworld, 200 years later. Even on Canyon Louis Wu has to go into deep hiding to stay clear of the ARM, and technology was basically the same as it had been in his father's day.
