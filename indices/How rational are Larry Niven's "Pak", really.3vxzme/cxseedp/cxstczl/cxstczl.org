  I haven't read it but they're apparently generating fleets.

That was already known in /Protector/ - Niven hadn't introduced the core explosion back then (that shows up at the end of the Man-Kzin war period when they send Bey Schaeffer in as a publicity stunt), but Brennan does speculate that something might have happened in the core.

Anyway, the fleets are assumed to have been created by the Librarians, after they had basically disrupted the whole Pak culture to send Psstphok out to rescue the colony on Earth. The Librarians were basically a cult of childless Protectors who had effectively adopted the whole Pak species as their descendants. Normal Protectors, with living breeders to protect, don't seem capable of cooperation.
