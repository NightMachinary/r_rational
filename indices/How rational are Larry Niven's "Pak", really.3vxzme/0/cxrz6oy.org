Pak are pretty good at instrumental rationality, achieving their values. Those can be summed about like this:(ordered by priority):

1) Keep own breeders alive 2) Keep self alive (already subgoal of 1!) 3) Kill everyone else (subgoal of 1!)

Want to escape a prison cell on an alien spaceship made of virtuially indestructible material? Done. Need to gather enough riiessources to escape a big global catastrophe? Done. One caveat though:

Unfortunately they have a serious problem with epistemic rationality... */Their built-in extremely strong xenophobic reflex hinders them massively at seeing and reaping the benefits of pressing C in the universal galactiv prisoners dilemma./* There is a sentence in the brennan books, from memory:

"nobody in the entire existence of pakhome had ever thought to make a picture of something that had no practical value, eg. blueprints or maps. So it was that Psshtphok only wondered at the odd depiction of a melting woman on the aliens spacesuit. Had he grasped the concept properly, the jump to preserving the smells of his breeders - and the secret to keep lonely protectors alive, by hacking the strong smell/will-to-live connection- wouldn't have been far."

So this is one giant benefit Pak miss out on, trading. This eg. also rules out trading with the outsiders, ergo FTL. Not very good for achieving their goal 1, eh?

This is also the reason the original Pak are all stuck in a giant cesspool of constant defections against each other, playing a giant zero sum game of breeders with the available planetary area of pakhome.
