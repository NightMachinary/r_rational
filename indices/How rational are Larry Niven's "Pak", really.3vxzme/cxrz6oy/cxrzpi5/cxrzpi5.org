  1) Keep own breeders alive 2) Keep self alive (already subgoal of 1!) 3) Kill everyone else (subgoal of 1!)
#+end_quote

#2 is not an independent goal: if #1 fails, unless the Protector can convince itself to rewrite that goal as "Keep the Pak species alive", it just stops eating.

#3 is probably an independent goal.

Human protectors seem to be a lot more flexible, but are still driven by the primary goal (see the actions of the Brennan-monster and the Protector-phase Teela Brown and Louis Wu).
