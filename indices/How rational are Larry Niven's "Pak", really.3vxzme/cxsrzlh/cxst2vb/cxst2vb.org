That's kind of my view.

Louis Wu managed to find a way to stop being a Protector, without dying. It's a pity Teela wasn't able to get hold of Carlos Wu's autodoc.

The kind of control over technology that the ARM have is pretty scary, by the way: they were able to hide Carlos Wu's autodoc 200 years before Ringworld, and nobody else came up with the same kind of obvious idea in the meantime. Technological development in Known Space must be pretty much stopped.

The other thing that seems a bit iffy is that once you're intelligent enough you can see one correct path and you have to follow it. The "intelligence = lack of free will" thing is a constant theme running through the series.
