Then no, they're not very rational.

A rational group would see external threats like a protector with a large group of breeders and band up with companions to fight such threats making some agreement like "We agree to work together to fight off the big bad and if any of us defect we all agree to kill that individual and all of their breeders." Some would be successful, and kill the bigger and badder enemies and take their territory and breeders. They'd then likely expand their group with the threat of mutual violence holding them together. Over time their groups would interbreed, giving them stronger ties.

Edit. Like the blue eyes did in that story maybe. They could even form a religion to enforce their beliefs.
