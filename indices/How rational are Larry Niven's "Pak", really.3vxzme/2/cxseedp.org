I haven't read it but they're apparently generating fleets. That would indicate their rationality, how well they form armies. The basic mark of an effective species is that they can pool their efforts to create a powerful army that is more than the sum of its individuals. As happened, say, in HPMOR.

They are, in general, not very rational. Constant warfare isn't a good mark of intellect- powerful individuals should be banding together to crush all opposition and teching up so they can support more breeders. Cooperation is just so much more powerful than fighting as an individual that it should be popular.
