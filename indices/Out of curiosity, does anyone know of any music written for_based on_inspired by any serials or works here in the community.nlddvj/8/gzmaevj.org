â€˜Sea of Stars' by Liquid Citrus was inspired by HPMOR, specifically the scene where squirrel and Harry are gazing at the stars

EDIT: very very hard to find because of what they have chosen to name themselves (google liquid citrus it's just soap) so I might have the title wrong but I'm pretty sure that's what it is.
