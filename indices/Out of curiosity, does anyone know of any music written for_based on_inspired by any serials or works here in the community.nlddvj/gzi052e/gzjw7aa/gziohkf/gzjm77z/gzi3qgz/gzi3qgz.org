You would probably appreciate the soundtrack to [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/08/17/fermats-last-stand-soundtrack-and-adventure-log/][Scott Alexander's Dungeons & Discourse campaign]].

The oldest songs on that channel are from so long ago he's credited under his real name- and now he's cycled back to using it, so no harm sharing it.
