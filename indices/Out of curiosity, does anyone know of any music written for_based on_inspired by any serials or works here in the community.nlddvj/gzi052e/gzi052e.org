Other than Annexias the only other music creations I'm aware of is the Hamilton inspired "Wormilton: the Musical" by [[/u/professor_crispy][u/professor_crispy]] (Spoilers for Worm):

3. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/gy7hg3/its_wormilton_3_the_bank_robbery_enjoy/][The Bank Robbery]]

I think there are two Ward songs on their SoundCloud too but I haven't read Ward yet so haven't checked those out.
