I suspect that you can't clarify that without giving more information than you want to divulge at the moment. That said, there are a number of things which you might want to think about (and probably, you already have)

--Future simon hopefully has some kind of plan for how to best equip past simon with the tools necessary to use his power. How is he going to communicate these insights ASAP? I would be sure to have the first several visions communicate this information. Ideally, if possible, I would make the first several visions link directly to each other, so that past Simon knows who to touch to get the next piece of message. This strategy is obviously delicate because one break in the chain and the segmented message is lost thereafter.

--Time travel is difficult to do in a rational manner. Be sure that you're very clear with yourself on what the rules of time travel are. How long do simon's messages last? Do they only happen on someone's death? Do they only happen on certain kinds of death? Can suicide make the messages happen earlier? When does the transmisison of information happen? Is it when future simon dies (and all the messages he chooses to, are sent back in time simultaneously to past-simon), or does time get "reset" with each message sent? How does simon "break out" of this loop, since he will probably be sending messages back in time whenever he has the chance, provided that it gives him benefit. --If I was past-simon, I would pick the nearest obvious place to touch lots of people -- ideally both people who are dying soon, and people who are dying in the distant future. Ideally, the people he meets at this location will die in predictable times/manners, so that they can easily convey messages (perhaps a display near them showing a text message, because reading is faster than writing). Be predictable for future simon, is the plan. A hospital, perhaps? Future simon could equip past simon with the credentials necessary to sneak in more easily, hopefully.

--I don't know if you have a plan for this, but it appears that the 100 heroes have some kind of special information. Hopefully there is a known way by which they acquired that information (you don't have to tell me of course)
