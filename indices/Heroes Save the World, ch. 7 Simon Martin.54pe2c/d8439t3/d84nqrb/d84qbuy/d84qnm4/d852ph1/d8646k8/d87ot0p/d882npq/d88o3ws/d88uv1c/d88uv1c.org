I think that one big challenge you'll see is that the time travel can go so far into the past. One reason HPMOR time travel worked is because of the six hour limit: EU only had to make the travel work for that little story arc, and then he was free. You, on the other hand, need to have a solid grasp of all the events surrounding the time travel right now, in the 7th chapter. Otherwise, simon's motivations won't line up with the evidence provided by the previous messages.

At some point, Simon might consider the universe a write-off, killing many people systematically to send lots of information. For instance, if something really bad happens.

Remember Sanderson's First Law: "An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic." ([[http://coppermind.net/wiki/Sanderson%27s_Laws_of_Magic]])
