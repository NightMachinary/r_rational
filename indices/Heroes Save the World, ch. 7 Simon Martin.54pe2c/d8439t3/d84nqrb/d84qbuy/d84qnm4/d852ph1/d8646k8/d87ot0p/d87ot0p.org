[[/u/CreationBlues]] and [[/u/munkeegutz]] are accurate here. (Speaking of--Simon's power does have a voluntary component, thankfully!).

There's spoiler text below where I've elaborated on the situation. Let me know if you can't see it for some reason.

I don't think that Simon has the information necessary to figure out all of the above just yet, but if there's anything that you think that I can add to this chapter to reasonably clarify things, then I'd love to hear it. At the very least I might make mention of the fact that the situation is confusing for the reasons that you give above.
