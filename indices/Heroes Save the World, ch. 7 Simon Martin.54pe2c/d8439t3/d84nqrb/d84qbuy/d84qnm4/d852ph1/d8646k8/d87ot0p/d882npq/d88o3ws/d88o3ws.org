Thank you!

Yes, time travel is very difficult, especially since this story is going to be on the long end of things, which means that there's so much rope to hang myself with. I'm not sure if I'm going to regret the precognition later on, but I'm feeling optimistic. The most limiting factor for him right now, IMO, is that he's not the sort of person who can justify killing people in one timeline to get information that will save more people in another timeline.

He may or may not change, but it'll be part of a character arc if he does, and not a trait that he gets starting out the gate.
