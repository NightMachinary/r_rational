I took "Visions are fixed" to mean that his power is one use per person, and you get the same vision every time you touch someone.

I think it works like this: let's say that he's helping a police department take down a particularly dangerous subject. He get's a vision of Officer1's death, where he's in the upstairs bathroom alone when he dies. So he tells Officer1 not to wander off by himself.

Simon checks Officer2's death, and in the vision Officer1 is in front of Officer2 in the basement when Officer1 is suddenly killed in front of Officer2 before Officer2 expires.

If Simon were to check Officer1's death again, he would still die in the bathroom alone, instead of in front of Officer2 in the basement, because even though he changed the future, his power will only show him one death per person, and Officer2's chance was used up.

It's kind of depressing, because even if he saves his mother from suicide, he'll always see that vision every time he uses it on her. Let's hope this power has some kind of voluntary component!
