  "stable timeloops"
#+end_quote

"Visions can't be changed" implies stable /something/.

#+begin_quote
  Each time that a ~10 second message is sent (I'm guessing that's how long the message was), Simon must survive in the new future long enough to send the next message. What happens if, while waiting, he gets hit by a bus? Heart attack? Now the loops are terminated and he's dead.
#+end_quote

Why would that terminate the loop? All that'll happen is that you won't get a message from any people who live longer than that. Alternatively, they can just arrange for them to say that Simon died. And yes, /Branches/ is great but it assumes a mutable future. All I'm saying is either the future is mutable or it's not; even if having a vision /forces/ the future to become immutable that still means you don't get to pick your message like this, you just get the first one that's stable because it /makes/ itself stable.
