/Save the cheerleader, save the world./

This isn't an AU Worm fanfic, is it?

[edit] The way that visions work makes no sense though. Either there's information flowing back in time, or there isn't. If there isn't, the visions are genuinely meaningless. If there is, then knowledge about how to do this should be the main payload of the message. (It isn't, so it's likely the former.) For a good treatment of "stable-timeloop" visions, consult Greg Egan's Arrows of Time, which is a "globally causal" world - the configuration of spacetime is determined instantaneously and globally, such that the only universe that can exist is one in which the use of time travel causes no contradictions. This leads to visions being both boring and self-fulfilling - knowing that a certain future is coming, people become fatalistic, allowing it to come to pass. (Which is, indeed, the most probable way in which a time loop can be stable.)

Also: dude. Go find a deterministic set of children, touch them in a deterministic order, receive larger messages from (up to 150 years in (assuming you do it again when you're old)) the future. I wonder how many messages you need to pass through the compressed version of a seed AI?

Unless you're very careful in setting it up, foresight is either broken or useless.
