The story is about a hero being summoned from modern times into a medieval-style fantasy world with monsters and magic. The hero is given a quest to find a legendary sword, and he travels around the continent with a group of lovely ladies who are all specialists in their own fields. Pretty standard fare.

What turns it into something cooler is that /two/ actually heroes got summoned instead of one. The hero mentioned above is actually a side character; the focus instead is on the second hero, Cato. Instead of trying to find a sword and use its magic to somehow fight back the undead hordes, Cato relies on his knowledge of science to kick off an industrial revolution. He uses the scientific method to study magic and revolutionize all parts of society, including literacy, agriculture, preservatives, engineering, and of course, weaponry.

A legendary sword is cool and all, but combining science and magic into portable spell cannons is likely even more effective. Increasing agricultural efficiency allows peasants to no longer starve and lets them move to cities, learn to read, and train in using magic. Now instead of just having knights to fight, you have a literate, magical populace armed with portable magic weapons capable of feats that would take knights years of training to achieve.

Fair warning: I found the beginning of the series very, VERY lackluster. Early on there is a monster that appears called a "Tremor." I rolled my eyes and almost stopped reading at what sounded like a blatant rip-off of the B horror movie by the same name. But it does start picking up once Cato gets to human civilization and gets to working.
