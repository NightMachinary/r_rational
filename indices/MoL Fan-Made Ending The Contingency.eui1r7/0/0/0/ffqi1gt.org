Yeah, this is what I was referring to. Some plausible triggers are:

- A recursively self-improving agent going FOOM
- Using ambient mana in weird ways all over the planet
- Using magic without using a soul at massive scales
- Exponentially growing networks of tiny dimensional passages

These are the things that an unleashed primordial would likely do as well.
