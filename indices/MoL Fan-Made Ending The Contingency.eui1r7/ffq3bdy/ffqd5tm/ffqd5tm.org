there was a mention in the some early chapter that the gods placed triggers in the world to prevent and stop various things from happening, considering the one we know of are the access of primordial into the main reality we can assume most of them are to prevent an extinction threat or otherwise world changing/destroying event, the angel mention that the triggers the gods place most likely had scorched earth policy in that regard, which is dangerous to all of the world.

what the fic imply that Hive!zorian manage to become so powerful and out of the norm that he most likely activated one of the triggers with his mind!link or various experiments.

when the only other known trigger is a primordial summoning, something that hadn't happen yet to the best of our knowledge, we can assume that what zorian did was either very dangerous to require a trigger or the gods deemed it so unwanted it was worth a good portion of reality to get rid of it.

the angel are partly in charge to make sure the triggers won't activate,and might consider it even worse then pantexh escaping.

from chapter 96, the end of the discussion with the angel.
