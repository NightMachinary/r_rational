I've read up to chapter 14 so far, and my opinion is mixed.

On the one hand, characterization/plot/worldbuilding aren't objectionable per se, barring one major exception. It's not the hardest of hard sci-fies, but there are interesting ideas here and there --- I especially appreciated the reason behind the aliens' depopulation of Earth: perverse internal incentives made it economically beneficial for the fleet which discovered the planet --- and it's always nice to read about exponential replicators pwning alien empires.

On the other hand, the aforementioned objection /is/ pretty major: the aliens. They're very clearly just reskinned humans. They have different bodies, different societies, different biology, sure, but they still think like humans, possess human emotional makeup, and even have humanoid bodies. Given that the premise of the story is the righteous crusade of the last surviving human upload against alien exterminators, that's pretty bad for engagement.

And hence, how comes the protagonist doesn't realize it's being the villain much sooner? I get it, it's consumed by revenge and willfully denies reality, but, like, there are /degrees/ of reality-denial. It's one thing to believe that this nation you're waging a war on is made up of exclusively evil people; it's quite another to believe that a civilization of bipedal sentient beings which builds "cities" and forms "republics" is so alien to humanity as to have negative moral worth. It's the difference between looking at a stranger and suspecting they're an asshole, and seeing an inhuman tentacular horror in his place.

If I was rewriting this story as a more-rational one, I would have made the protagonist more self-aware, driven by revenge but not altogether /possessed/ by it --- and, in keeping with the rule of "If you give Frodo a lightsaber, give Sauron a Death Star", I would have made the aliens /actually alien/ --- barely comprehensible starfishes akin to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight_(Watts_novel)][Watts' Scramblers]]. That would have been fun.
