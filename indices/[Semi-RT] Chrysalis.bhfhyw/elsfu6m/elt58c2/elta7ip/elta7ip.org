Not a whole lot of rational fic. Some of it is pretty cliche. But there are some gems if you can find them.

Two of my favorites are:

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/ref/universes/jenkinsverse/chronological_reading_order][The Deathworlders Saga]] - One of the first stories exploring the trope of "Oh what if humans are overpowered compared to all alien life". It inspired several offshoot series set in the same universe, which ended up being canonized and brought back into the central storyline.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/series/creature_88][Memories of Creature 88]] - The protagonist ends up on a space station, and joins the police force due to his consciousness being tied to a chip + cloning machine thing. His consciousness is backed up regularly, and whenever he dies the last copy is put into a new clone. Ends up coming in handy
