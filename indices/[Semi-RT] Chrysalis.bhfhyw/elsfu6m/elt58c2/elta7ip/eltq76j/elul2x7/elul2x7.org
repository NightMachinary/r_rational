The C1764 stories written by Weerdo5255 are decent. I wouldn't call them rational, but they are enjoyable. There was one whose title I can no longer find, but it was a one shot basically about a human space red cross organization. That one was a big enough deal for long enough that if you ask for the title on hfy, someone will provide it for you. I think the +Archangel+ (edit) /Last Angel/ series (which I believe has been posted to this sub before) and which is currently ongoing on the spacebattles site was started on hfy. Again, not exactly rational, but pretty good, and manages to avoid a lot of the "humans are great mostly because every other species is an idiot" stuff. It's VERY long and drags on in some places, but overall pretty interesting and, especially in the more recent stuff, is giving a much more nuanced, balanced view of the "bad" guys.
