I follow one specific author on [[/r/HFY][r/HFY]] because I love pretty much everything that they write. Here's a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/bdwblx/the_oxygen_apocalypse_part_5_of_5/el16cwd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][link]] to all of the stories written by [[/u/crumjd][u/crumjd]]. Nearly all of them are one-shots.
