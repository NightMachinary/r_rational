I mean, it's 99.9% verified that Aerb (and earth) are being simulated, or some magical equivalent. And that's excluding the game mechanics and bugs, as those are artificial knobbins put there by the GM. However, just because they're being simulated, doesn't mean that they're not real.

My theory is that Library magic is running using the same systems that were used to fast forward Aerb between Arthurs death and Jun's entrance, and the same system that lets the GM nudge probability and causality.
