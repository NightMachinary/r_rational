Is the "Loading" from the library re-configuring, or from traveling to another dimension? If it is because of the latter, is the Aerb dimension unloaded? If so I wonder if Amaryllis will notice the world being unloaded.

(Then again the "Loading ..." (and T-posing) could just be flavor to reference video games.)
