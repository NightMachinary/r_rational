"Coactus es?" and "Librarix" are half-assed Latin. The former roughly translates to "Is this coercion?" and the latter to a feminine form of Libraror(?). They come from two different librarians out of contact with one another, so I assume it's the unofficial language of the Library... something secret they can speak if anybody shows up, or can use to develop Library specific jargon.
