I love Bethel's character. I'm curious to see the conversation between Bethel and Ropey. Ropey seems like a very intelligent being, worthy as a companion to a companion... He was definitely underestimated by Juniper. Poor Juniper... It's not easy being a realistically portrayed main character being surrounded by competent people. At least he's honestly trying to do better. I'm hoping some romance does eventually develop between Juniper and Mary :P but I don't think it'll happen.
