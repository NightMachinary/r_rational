I am pretty sure it's at least somewhat obvious, but no one mentioned it- this achievement most likely doesn't talk about Joon, but the library.

#+begin_quote
  I frowned. I had just the barest taste of Library Magic, and I already didn't like it. I could feel more clearly now the way that it was intruding into my head, placing thoughts there as though they were my own.
#+end_quote

Library will deposit lots of thoughts and memories in Joon's head, in a very unsubtle way. It's also quite likely that all the knowledge the library deposits, Joon would lose right after leaving the library.\\
+Other one of cthulhuraejepsen's works- The Library Unpublished, has the very rule encoded into it ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11539230/chapters/27124041][mentioned in]] part 57- the munchkin ending).+

  +It seemed most likely that for whatever reason, people lost whatever they gained inside the library as they left it. At the same time, deeper inside the library, the possibilities might be even more endless.+

[EDIT: It was [[/u/vi_fi]] who made this work and now I wish I could delete this entire post.]

All of this, combined with the fact that Joon needs to discover Spirit Magic (and the impeding level-up, possibly after discovering SM), leads me to believe that this arc will be focusing on identity and self-modification (by himself and /especially/ outside forces).
