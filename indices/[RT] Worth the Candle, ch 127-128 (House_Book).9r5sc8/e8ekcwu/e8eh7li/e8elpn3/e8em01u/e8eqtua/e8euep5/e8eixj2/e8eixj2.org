  I was hoping that within the schema there would be some way to find a book written by a specific author; my guess was that there on the outside, in the future the Library was sketching out, some version of Amaryllis Penndraig had written a book for me.

This seems like playing with fire since they know doing this can cause exclusions. Maybe it's fine as long as they don't try and get too clever? Since they already got a warning about this they DM may not give them a "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" level of rebuke.

That being said hoo boy I want to see what's in that book.
