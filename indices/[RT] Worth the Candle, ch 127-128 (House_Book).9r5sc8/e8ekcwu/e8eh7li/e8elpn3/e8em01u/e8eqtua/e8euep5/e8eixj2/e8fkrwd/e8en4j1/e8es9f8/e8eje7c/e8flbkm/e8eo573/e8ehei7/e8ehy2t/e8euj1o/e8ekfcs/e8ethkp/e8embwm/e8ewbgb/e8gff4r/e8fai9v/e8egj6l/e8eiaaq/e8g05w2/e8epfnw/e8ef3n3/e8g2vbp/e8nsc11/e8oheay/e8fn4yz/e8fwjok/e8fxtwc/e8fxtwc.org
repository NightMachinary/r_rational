Joon (Full name juniper) is a human in Bumblefuck kansas who plays DnD. His best friend died, and he was dealing with suicidal thoughts and various unhealthy coping systems. He wakes up in a world created as an anaglam of his various DnD games, including several where he was just raging about various things. He meets up with: Amy, a human woman descendant to uther. Fen, a half elf thief/archer. Bethal, a sentient house once owned by uther. Grak, a third gender dwarven warder. Val, an almost human with no soul. And a sentient deer that is actually a forest that lives in a jar carried by a little green woman who died and was literally reborn in a time chamber. Joon has access to a game layer, allowing him to do various things and upgrade, finds out that uther from 500 years ago is his friend who may or may not be dead but is missing, learns he is living in a world with thousands of hells and no heaven, and has met the DM of the world. Fen died, there are no dream skewered, and he is meeting with a party lead by people who knew arthur so he can go into an infinite library.

Honestly, summarizing this is quite hard. we might need a minimum of a couple sentences per chapter, and there are 128
