Noticed a couple sorta typos.

in chapter 6:

#+begin_quote
  “We call them antihells. It's a term you'd find in scientific papers but even then is somewhat blasphemous.”
#+end_quote

and chapter 9:

#+begin_quote
  “The only spell I know is the one for sleep, and it's not only unattached to a school, but there's no way for me to safely demonstrate it, or you to safely practice it, at least as we are now. More to the point, it won't help us when we get there.”
#+end_quote
