With this talk of Bethel drawing on the magics of the bottle, I suppose I have to register a prediction I've thought of - the locus will be "freed" by merging with Bethel, by putting the bottle inside her entad-eating cupboard.

It probably wouldn't work on a number of levels, first and foremost Bethel not consenting to anything of the sort, but I believe it's at least technically possible. The resulting being should still be enough locus to count, wouldn't be drastically at odds with itself (Bethel does consider the Loci kindred spirits, and it's easy to see why), and it requires no powers not yet introduced.

I don't consider it particularly likely, but on the off chance it does happen, I'd prefer to have guessed so publicly, and making wild guesses is a low-cost action.
