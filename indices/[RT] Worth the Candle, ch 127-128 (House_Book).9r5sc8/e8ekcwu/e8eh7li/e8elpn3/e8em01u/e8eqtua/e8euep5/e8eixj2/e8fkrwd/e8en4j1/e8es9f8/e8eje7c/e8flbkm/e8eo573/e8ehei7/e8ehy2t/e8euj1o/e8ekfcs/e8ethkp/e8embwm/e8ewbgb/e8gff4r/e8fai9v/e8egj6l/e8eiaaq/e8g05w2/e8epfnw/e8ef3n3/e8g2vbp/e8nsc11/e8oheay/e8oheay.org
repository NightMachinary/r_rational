So, one thing that I feel like has not been brought up for a while is the gods. I believe there were 5 of them. And Amaryllis even met some of them didn't she? Anyways although it has been stated that these beings are nowhere near the power of the DM it can be safe to assume that the are orders higher in power than most beings on Aerb. Yet they haven't ever really been brought up as being significant. Never mentioned to have had any interaction with Uther which is crazy because with how it seems the upper echelons of the mortals realized that Uther might have been bending reality in a way that was causing greater and greater mayhem you'd think the gods would notice. Are they excluded into their own little areas, do people worship them, how strong are they. Anyways yeah it felt like all these crazy other worlds and apocalyptic beings were being mentioned and yet not one mention of these gods so I hope they are at least mentioned somewhat.
