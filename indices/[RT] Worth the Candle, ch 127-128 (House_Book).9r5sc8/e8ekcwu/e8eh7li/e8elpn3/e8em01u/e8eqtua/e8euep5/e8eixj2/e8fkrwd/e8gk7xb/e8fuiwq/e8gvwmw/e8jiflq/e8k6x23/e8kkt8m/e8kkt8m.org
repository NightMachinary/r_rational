Eh, not really a thing. They are not a mitigation unit. They are more like Abaddon with scepter. If someone like Okald tried to use it they would fail because dagger does no damage to his stone body. If someone from Okald's party tried to use it, they would also fail, because no damage either. The dagger can be abused by someone with crazy regeneration/healing, i.e. Joon and his infinite supply of bone magic and fairy reserves.
