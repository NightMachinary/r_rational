"Krin" and "krinrael" are the dwarven terms, see ch 106, though they're first mentioned earlier.

  “It was a mix of cultural baggage, misunderstandings, and differences of our species,” said Grak. “I felt a deep kinship with Ding. To me, he was krin, or at least krinrael.”

  (I don't think I can do those words justice with a translation. ‘Krin' was someone you were physically intimate with, often to the level of sharing a bed naked with them, and ‘krinrael' was that, but much more temporary, not an ongoing arrangement. It didn't imply that you were dating, or that you even talked all that much, but it often was a stepping stone to more intimate or contractual arrangements, like the dwarven version of marriage and/or pair-breeding. You could have more than one krin, but it wasn't particularly common. There was some element of (or at least some suggestion toward) sex, but dwarves didn't place all that much emphasis on sex, and it wasn't what a dwarf would think of when they thought of krin.)
