This just leads me to believe that the T-Posing really is a joke by the DM. Because I find it incredibly hard to believe that he would have designed this game without considering that Joon would raise his stats beyond what is natural. So he just threw these warnings into the game to screw with Joon, but also to let him know that he can continue to raise his stats without risking personality death.
