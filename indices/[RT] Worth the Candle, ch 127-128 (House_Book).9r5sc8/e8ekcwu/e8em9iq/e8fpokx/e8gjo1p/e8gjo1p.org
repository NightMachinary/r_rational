  That's 63, which is suspiciously close to 64, so although we might have included a spare single dimension this feels pretty close to the actual list. "The entirety of hell" might count as another, and Earth might not count at all. </speculation>

I'm pretty sure that Earth doesn't count since if there were any possible way to get back to Earth, then Arthur would have most likely succeeded in reaching it. The hells probably count as a plane, and I think the last plane is wherever Arthur traveled to from Fel Seed's exclusion zone. Although it could possibly be Earth.
