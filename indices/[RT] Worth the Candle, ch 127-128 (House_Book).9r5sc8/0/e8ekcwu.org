Presumably this means there are 64 {planes/dimensions/worlds} including Aerb proper and the Infinite Library. If we include

- Aerb
- The Infinite Library
- Earth (?)
- The not-quite-the-Ethereal plane
- The Plane of Drift
- The 28 elemental planes
- The (at least) four "mathematical" dimensions (m -space, n- space, t- space, and p- space)
- The 26 non-excluded "dangerous" parallel dimensions

That's 63, which is suspiciously close to 64, so although we might have included a spare single dimension this feels pretty close to the actual list. "The entirety of hell" might count as another, and Earth might not count at all. </speculation>
