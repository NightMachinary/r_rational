  Finally - could Bethel's production of books trigger a rapid expansion of the Infinite Library? If Bethel produced 100 million copies of "Missive From Mary of 20 Years In The Future to Juniper" could they flood the library reliably?

Sounds like the kind of thing that would get a bad reaction from the library (i.e. from the DM). E.g. they show up and most of the library is indeed full of that book...but each copy is guarded very inconveniently by some sort of Fel Seed-y horror.
