  “But you're the head librarian, right?” I asked. “You have ultimate authority.”

  “If you've read about Uther, then you know he was big on consent of the governed."

That's not a "yes". That's the sort of thing I'd say if I wanted to give an evasive answer that wasn't a yes and was worried about truth-divining entads.

Now, on the other hand, we do see this:

#+begin_quote
  “Left, left, straight, right, Head Librarix,” said the librarian with a short, casual bow. “Nominal directions, of course.”
#+end_quote

But still, I wonder - is there something going on where she doesn't have unilateral authority? A council/senate/whatever of co-equal rulers all given the title Head Librarian/Librarix/etc, for example?

Finally - could Bethel's production of books trigger a rapid expansion of the Infinite Library? If Bethel produced 100 million copies of "Missive From Mary of 20 Years In The Future to Juniper" could they flood the library reliably?
