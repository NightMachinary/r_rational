  Quest Accepted: As the Spirit Moves You - There are no spirit mages left alive... Once you find the entrance to the Infinite Library, you might be able to find the lost power.

Turning this into a quest could actually be a classic 'dick move' from Dice Guy. Joon's finally given a solution to his Level Up's yet in order to access the solution he needs to complete a quest...which gives him XP...which could very well level him up at Spirit Lvl 1 before he can actually utilise it.

Seems like the sort of thing Dice Guy would do. Of course, also like Dice Guy, there are workarounds as long as Joon realises the danger (or future Amaryllis writes about it).
