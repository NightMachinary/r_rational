He gets an extremely powerful and addictive burst of pleasure that is getting stronger with each level.

Once he gained access to his soul and could identify his "values", he noticed that "level up" was gaining prominence to the point where it was becoming his number one priority.

At present, he uses soul magic to artificially remove that impulse, but it has been returning stronger every time he leveled up, and the last time he did he couldn't bring himself to reduce it again (Amarilis did it for him). The worry is that if it happens with no soul mage at hand, he might become lost in the addiction.
