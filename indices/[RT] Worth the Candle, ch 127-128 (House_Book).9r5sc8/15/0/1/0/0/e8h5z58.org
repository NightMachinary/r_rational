It makes sense and is in-character for them; it just means that whomever Bethel tells it to has a suicidal way to kill Mary. The recording works in part because the person who made the recording and the person who told the recorder are both already dead. If Bethel tells someone and they trigger the Shia Surprise, Shia will kill them, then go back and kill Mary too.
