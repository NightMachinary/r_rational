not afaik, but I do wish this were more of a common practice -- it doesn't seem too hard for authors to give a 150 word chapter summary at the end of every ~3-5k words, and maybe even compile a running summary of all chapters to stick at the very end. There are so many fics that I was enjoying until hitting the current chapter, but didn't follow along for whatever reason -- when it's resurrected (or I return to it) potentially years later, I'm not motivated enough to read through all the material (potentially books' worth!) I'd already consumed, and trying to jump in where I left off leaves me confused. And yet, I very rarely see something like this done. Maybe there's just not much of a demand for it.
