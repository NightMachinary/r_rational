Lampshading confusion about cosmological origins is very neat. Yet another worldbuilding detail which helps with suspension of disbelief. There have been some great ones in the last few chapters.

June is /still/ modelling Grak as thoroughly male. His model of Grak is out of sync with reality in so many ways like that. It'll cost him. I love that the writing can be from June's perspective but still make that clear in not too unsubtle ways.

Similarly, June's almost complete lack of treating Ropey as a being with any personhood is starting to pay off. Beth must be thoroughly unimpressed at how clearly a large portion of the difference between how he treats her and how he treats Ropey is as a result of her ability to show off a cute female avatar for June to give a shit about.
