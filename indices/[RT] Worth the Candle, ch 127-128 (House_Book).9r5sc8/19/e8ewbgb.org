I'm speculating that Bethel eating Ropey might cause her to gain significant amount of Loyalty. If what's shown so far from Ropey to June is some sort of loyalty, and if Bethel merging with Ropey will also merge their individual identity, the end result might be that the loyalty will also be transferred to the merged individual. This might explain Ropey's motive. And this might be beneficial to the the group.
