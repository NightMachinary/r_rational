Jun's already got a capability like that with his HUD telling him the names of foes that he's defeated, but there might be times when defeating someone is a lot more difficult than just stabbing someone. Alternatively, it'd be a foolproof method of ensuring that someone really is who they say they are, if 'stabbing' can include things that don't cause serious harm.
