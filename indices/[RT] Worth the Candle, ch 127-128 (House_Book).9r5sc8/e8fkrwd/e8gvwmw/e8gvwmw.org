Agreed. The first use that occurred to me was killing entire armies. Or any other large group of people, if the holder were inclined to terrorism. And healing might not even be necessary if it turns out it combines with entads that reflect damage or buffer damage to the user or similar. The party already has two items that I can think of that might work, Jun's armor and Valencia's armor.

Maybe actually doing it would get the dagger excluded for being OP, though.
