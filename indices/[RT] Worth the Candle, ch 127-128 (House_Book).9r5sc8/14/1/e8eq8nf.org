My read on Raven's status is that she calls the shots as long as everyone else is more or less okay on what she's doing. She has a lot of leeway, but not enough that she could give any order and have it go unquestioned. Maybe if enough librarians think she shouldn't be in charge anymore they can +backstab her+ call for a no confidence vote.

  Finally - could Bethel's production of books trigger a rapid expansion of the Infinite Library? If Bethel produced 100 million copies of "Missive From Mary of 20 Years In The Future to Juniper" could they flood the library reliably?

I imagine it would work if they can't rely on Joon getting the hang of library magic, but it also gets you to the top of the librarian shit list.
