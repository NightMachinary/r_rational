I would recommend Nick Bolstrom's book: [[http://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/1501227742][Superintellegences: Paths, Dangers Strategies]] . There are some obvious biases where I perceive he crafted his argument from his conclusions, but it's a nice survey that explains why this is perceived as an existential threat. On the free side if you haven't read: /Friendship is optimal/, /A bluer shade of white/ or /That Alien Message/ and you are interested in the subject then you are missing some of the most approachable entries into the topic.
