I probably won't use it, but it's stuck in my brain now. If Penny had been a Corgi instead of a Golden Retriever, I'd be far more likely to use it. Corgi's are absurdly smart, but they aren't listed in the top 10 smart dogs list, because they don't obey commands with enough alacrity. They problem solve, and will use or modify what you train them to do, to try to accomplish other goals.
