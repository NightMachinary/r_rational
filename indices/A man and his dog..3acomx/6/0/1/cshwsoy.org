You used numbers and very limited imagery. Some of us here have cheats memorized to visualize billions, but conceptually (i.e. at the gut/ancestral environment level) most numbers over four don't do much. The difference between million and billion is at some levels only a consonant.

I don't have your skill at narrative, but I might have described the disorientation as Dr.Smith tried figure out where the audio and visual was and why the feeds had static images with immobile mannequins, or the acceleration of the perceptual time differential as he optimized. Also his optimizzation was rather transparent, wouldn't he have taken some time to focus, to decide how timeshare? Two sources you might look at are /The mortal passage/ which has an interesting (and frightening) look at uploaded self optimization, and /The fall of doc future/ which has some good examples of the practical problems of changes in perceived time scale.
