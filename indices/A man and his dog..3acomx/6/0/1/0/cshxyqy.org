If it had been a longer form fiction, I certainly would have tried to be a bit more descriptive of it. I've done an AI-guided human digitization in the second half of [[https://farmerbob1.wordpress.com/2014/01/29/chapter-3-17-unpleasant-answers/][this chapter of Symbiote.]]

If you decide to look at it, please recognize Symbiote is not intended to be rational, and that was written a year and a half ago. Rereading it made me cringe in a few places for sentence organization and word usage.
