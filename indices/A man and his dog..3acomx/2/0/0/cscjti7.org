Well, not really.

Looking at LOCK (Lead / Objective / Confrontation / Knockout)

The Lead is Doctor Smith.

The Objective is to do something revolutionary in industry

The Confrontation is probably related to the AI Box scenario.

The knockout though. That one requires some thought, because it needs to at least feel rational, and I've already placed Doctor Smith in a future society which we would probably mostly recognize (2030-ish)

I have an idea though, (and it has nothing to do with time travel.)
