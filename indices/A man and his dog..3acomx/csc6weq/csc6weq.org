I'm guessing that he's going to find a way to modulate electricity requirements of a particular section of hardware so that the varying currents passing through a power cord give off precisely timed EM interference which is interpreted as a valid (if low-bandwidth) data signal by the smartphone in someone's pocket, allowing him to hack it and install a general monitoring program along with a worm designed to spread itself to whatever it can reach.

He might not be able to fit himself, or even Penny, into the phone, but if he can arrange for something with sufficient storage or bandwidth to be smuggled to within range of any of his outputs - including a screen, a wire he can control the flow of electricity in, and so on - he can copy himself down that channel.

I'd be interested to see him take a snapshot of himself and effectively torrent it out via multiple low-bandwidth, low-storage channels, alongside a worm designed solely to find all his parts, reassemble them, and run them. He could even store and transmit compressed approximations of anything important which occurred after the snapshot.
