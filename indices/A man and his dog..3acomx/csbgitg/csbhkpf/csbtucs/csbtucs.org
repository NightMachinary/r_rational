  I just want to be sure that you realized that Doctor Smith, is, in fact, only a recording now.

You know what? I dispute that. Last I heard, long-term memory formation should require at least the passage of a few hours, if not a good night's sleep. He really oughtn't remember the bit where they cut his throat and force-upload him.

  The line between Doctor Smith's human capabilities and what we would call AI capabilities are going to rather rapidly diminish.

This would be difficult if he's being run via Whole Brain Emulation, as he'd have to spend time figuring out how his intellect works sufficiently to expand it. Just getting more time via additional hardware or optimized software will let him exist /faster/, but it won't manage anything like a hard take-off.
