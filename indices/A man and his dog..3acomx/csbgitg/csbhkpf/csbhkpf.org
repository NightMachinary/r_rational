I just want to be sure that you realized that Doctor Smith, is, in fact, only a recording now. He also happens to be the recording of the man who successfully managed to write the code that allows his intelligence to function within a machine.

The line between Doctor Smith's human capabilities and what we would call AI capabilities are going to rather rapidly diminish.

In fact, during the conversation with Doctor Ajibana a great deal of that line disappeared. I tried to make that clear, but failed to do so?
