Penny would never hurt her master. Penny only hurts bad people now!

Penny's master used to be with her all the time. Then Penny went to a new place and could only talk to her master at a distance and that was not nice. But everything is okay now. Penny's master is like her now! And Penny only hurts bad people.

(ps oh God I just want to pet her. Best +abomination of science+ cyberdog.)
