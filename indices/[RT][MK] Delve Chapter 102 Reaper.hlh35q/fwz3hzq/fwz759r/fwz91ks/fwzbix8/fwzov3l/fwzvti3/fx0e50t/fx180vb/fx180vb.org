And because of the atomised, feudal, might-makes-right societal situation, being a crafter is taking on relatively high risks to yourself. You're forgoing personal power for in return for making yourself an attractive slave, who can be chained to an anvil and pump out gear till you drop dead. So crafters are rare in part because nobody wants to be one.

(Add in that the lone-wolf mentality and lack of efficient parties means it's even harder to raise your cap as a crafter.)
