I doubt it's that bad, because places like the City of Lights exist, and IIRC you can get Guild people to help raise your level with enough money.

I think it's more that crafters are valued above their rank, with a Silver crafter being rare enough that the only ones with a shot of buying their products are goldplates, and Silvers having to buy stuff from Bronze crafters, and Bronzeplates only being able to pick up the scraps.

So Tallheart's gear would be /level-appropriate/ for a Silver, but in the current state of the world are fit for a Gold.
