It's true that you wouldn't be able to be high-DPS with this build, but that's not what Rain was going for. If people coordinate their builds and went for team strats they could be vastly more powerful than any individual, and that's what Rain was trying for.

Plus, his DPS gets /really high/ around level 24 or 25. According to the spreadsheets that one of the patrons cooked up, Rain ends up doing several million damage per second.
