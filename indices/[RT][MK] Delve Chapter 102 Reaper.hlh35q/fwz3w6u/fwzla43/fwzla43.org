Yeah, I'm not sure he's going to survive another night of this - he needs, what, a million mana to repair his armor? Assuming I've got the numbers right, he can self-generate about 18MP/s, which means about 16 hours straight of jamming mana into his armor . . .

. . . which is /possible/, but isn't going to be comfortable, and precludes giving mana to anyone else, and makes it somewhat difficult to sleep, and I feel like bad things might happen if he burns through literally a million mana in a single day.

And it's not like the rest of his team can heal up as fast as he can.

So, yeah, the timer's ticking here.

(Numbers may be wrong.)
