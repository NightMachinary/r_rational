I honestly think you'd be better off dropping the story for a year or so, then coming back so you can read 52+ chapters at once. It's a better read that way, and I think you won't get annoyed; having chapters not come once a week really helps the pacing.

I think the story will get into the deeper mechanistic reasons for why it works in time. But I have to ask what you're getting out of reading this- I think I saw you in last week's thread, too.

I dunno. Whenever I get this annoyed by something, I find it better to drop it, maybe come back in a few months.
