The nobility is probably a) older than the Watch's regime in Fel Sadanis and b) actually just rich families founded by Awakened with a headstart in Accolades that allow them to be rich and lazy at the same time. I never got the feeling that the nobility actually had any special rights in Fel Sadanis. Just that they are powerful and rich enough to look down on newly rich and not get knocked over the head for it.
