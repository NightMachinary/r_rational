It's just so arbitrary.

I get that it's a limiter as why everyone doesn't have powers, but then it just falls flat characterwise.

Like why would the nobles of Fel Sadanis allow the Watch to control the dungeon, while still having the noble class at all?

At some point it ceases to be rational and just becomes number porn.
