I don't mind the idea of having to harvest mana from powerful creatures. It the fact that between 2 creatures of equal difficulty and magical nature (say a low level blue and a high level nonblue) it's completely arbitrary as to which one expands the magical powers.

I was more ok with buying into that concept when that aspect of the world was something to be investigated rather than just a random unexplored fact of the world.

For example why does the Rank Up apply only to monsters? Why aren't people affected?
