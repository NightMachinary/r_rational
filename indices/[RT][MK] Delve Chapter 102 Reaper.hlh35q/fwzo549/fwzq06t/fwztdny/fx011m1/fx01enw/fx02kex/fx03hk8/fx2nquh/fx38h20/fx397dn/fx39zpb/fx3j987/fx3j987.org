Just that I don't think it feels forced at all. Mechanics in stories are just tools to tell a story. It's not like Rain is blatantly ignoring obvious powerups or something. A story doesn:t have to be about leveling up, and personally I like that this has an actual plot instead of being just a numbers go up type of a thing.

Tbh I'd recommend the same author's Potter/Worm fic more. It's also complete. Though this does have more of that power stuff.
