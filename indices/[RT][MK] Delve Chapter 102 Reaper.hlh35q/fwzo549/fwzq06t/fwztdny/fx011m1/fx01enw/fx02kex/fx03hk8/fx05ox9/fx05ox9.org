Sure it seems random but that is mostly because we are no supposed to know it yet. I have read all chapters up to 109 and there are some pretty good explanations about other parts of the system.

Compared to other LitRPGs, Delve is really solid in its worldbuilding and I am pretty sure it will be explained properly in time.

In my opinion the main problem is not the story but the pacing.
