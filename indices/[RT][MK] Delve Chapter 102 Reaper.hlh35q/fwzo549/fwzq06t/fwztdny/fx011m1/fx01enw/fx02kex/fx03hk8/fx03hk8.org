I'm ok with the level cap being linked to something like killing monsters, needing to absorb mana or whatever, is fine. The issue is what makes a blue is entirely random and it just seems like a badly narrative rule for the author to shove in whatever limitations he wants.

They're literally in the middle of Rank Up and monsters are being spun from cloth around them and not one blue has appeared. I don't even want Rain to particularly be the one who finds it, but someone should.
