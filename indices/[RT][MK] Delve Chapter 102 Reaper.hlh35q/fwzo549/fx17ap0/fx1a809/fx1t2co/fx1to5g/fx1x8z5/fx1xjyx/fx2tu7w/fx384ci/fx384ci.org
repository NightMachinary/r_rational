So you've compared me to a schizophrenic and told me that you will not consider any complaints you consider to be abnormal.

Let's not go down the path of human history from the extreme things that were considered normal like slavery or killing people that believed the world was round to more recent things like the dismissal of racism, sexism and the general poor treatment of people with something like aspergers.

Now I'm not saying it's anything like the same scale, nor am I even that particularly bother and wouldn't have continued this except to say that the off hand dismissal of a complaint because you consider it abnormal stems from the same place and that it's a bad process to consider your 'policies' from.

What terrible thing did I ask of you? To consider that your comment may have bordered on invasive. Truely not worth the effort of a fraction of your time.
