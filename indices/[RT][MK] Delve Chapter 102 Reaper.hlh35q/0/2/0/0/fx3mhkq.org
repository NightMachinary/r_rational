I think the 'without his armor' is key, here. He only gets his damage that high by stacking multiplicative effects, and a big one is aura compression. He wouldn't be able to use aura compression the way he did without the armor and the stat ring, without which he'd be dead 2 seconds after coming close enough to use the aura compression the way he did.

Very few people would have gear of this quality at level 18, so for most people, so this sort of min-maxing build just isn't worth it for most prospective awakened, because you'll never be effective enough to acquire the funds to become effective, you see?
