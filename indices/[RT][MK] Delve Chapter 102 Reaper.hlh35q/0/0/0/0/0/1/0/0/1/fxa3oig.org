Seems like a very bad idea to enslave someone like Tallheart. They're making the gear that your life will depend on, so what's to stop them from building in something with a vulnerability -- maybe when they say a command word your armor shrinks to doll size and crushes you.

And that's leaving aside the whole "in a cave with a box of scraps" potential, where they simply make gear for themselves while you aren't looking and murderize their way out.

Definitely a good idea for a Gold to hire a high-level crafter but absolutely vital that they be happy to work for you and not feel taken advantage of, enslaved, or threatened.
