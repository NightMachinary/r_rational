I'm somewhat skeptical that 'slave' is the common outcome to high-level crafters. 'Patron' seems more likely, as in the crafter reaching an agreement with some Goldplate to settle down in their domain and make what they want, in exchange for protection and a comfortable life. After all, a high-level crafter is a goose laying golden eggs, and keeping them happy with their arrangement means they don't cheap out on your gear or try to escape to a rival or something.

Sure, a clueless crafter without a support network who happens across a merciless Gold might just get fully enslaved, but I figure most crafters would angle to either find a patron or join a group like the Guild who'll stick up for them if push comes to shove.
