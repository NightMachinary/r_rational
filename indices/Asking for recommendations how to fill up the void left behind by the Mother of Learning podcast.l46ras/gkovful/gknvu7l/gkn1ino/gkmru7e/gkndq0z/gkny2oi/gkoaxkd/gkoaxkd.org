Can't speak about the quality of the podcast, but I've started the text version of it recently and it's pretty good.

Basically a groundhog's day scenario, in which a young wizard relives a month of magic school over and over again.

Of course there's bigger plot things that happen, and I'm not that far into it yet. But the gist is that it's a rational take on magic with the groundhog's day twist.
