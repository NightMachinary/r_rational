I was on chapter 29 when it got deleted, and have been thinking about this a lot. The good thing is that it will return someday, but it's not certain when.

Personally I'm going back to what I used to do, catching up and reading some manga.

There is nothing like MoL, but if you want to fill the void just a bit, I recomend the manga "Mashle", it's different, but ti me it has a similar vibe and is hillarious.
