Not OP but I used MoonReader's and Librera Reader's TTS at speeds probably comparible to 6x.

I recommend both because iirc the free version of MoonReader (or maybe Librera) doesn't support TTS. Regardless I recommend either of their paid versions.

Edit: Regarding podcast recommendations. Read/Re-read worm via ebook and listen to the We've got Worm podcast. Absolutely fantastic arc-by-arc analysis. I haven't listened to their Worm 2/Ward podcast "We've got Ward" but since it's the same hosts I'm comfortable recommending it too.
