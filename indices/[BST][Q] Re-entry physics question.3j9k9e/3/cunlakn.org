My first thought was obviously that if the android were of sufficient mass (1200 kg or so), you could use the most obvious existing solution to this problem--simply recreate a Mercury capsule, as this is the approximate altitude reached by the sub-orbital Mercury flights (though you will need to fire some sort of propellant to control re-entry angle).

While this seems like the most likely meatsack-with-an-internet-connection solution to the problem, it unfortunately requires the android to be absurdly dense--a humanoid weighing that much would be denser than a solid block of human shaped gold. Just recreating the Mercury capsule heat shield is a little better (272 kg), but insufficient on its own.

Fortunately, someone has indeed already solved this problem; the inflatable re-entry vehicle experiment recently conducted successful tests at this altitude and has the modest flight mass of about 125 kg.
