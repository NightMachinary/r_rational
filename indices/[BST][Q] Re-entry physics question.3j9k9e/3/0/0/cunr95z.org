I used the stated re-entry mass for IRVE-II, which had essentially no payload, rather than the heavier and more recent IRVE-3, for my estimate of 125 kg. I'm fairly certain that mass estimate includes the needed gas and inflation system. That said, there may not be enough nitrogen available at all to follow the schematic exactly even with a nanoassembler; you may be stuck instead using some other gas (probably carbon dioxide) to inflate the heat shield. I don't think this would require any sort of significant design change, however.
