Ah, that makes sense. I forgot about gases in the human body... ._.

Now I'm left wondering whether aerogel or an IRVE would be better. I also need to find out if a 2m-diameter heat shield is safe. They can curl up in the center to manufacture parachutes. 2m would be a lot faster than 3m, and they only have 2.5 minutes to manufacture the heat shield. There is definitely some preparatory calculations and planning being done before they fall.

Since the heat is from compression, that means that everything behind the heat shield remains relatively copascetic, right? Maybe 1.5m is enough.
