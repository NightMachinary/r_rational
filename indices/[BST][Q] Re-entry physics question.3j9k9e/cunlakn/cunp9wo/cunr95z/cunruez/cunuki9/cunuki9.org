The original Mercury heat shield was less than 2m diameter, although I doubt a person could easily hide in the space available behind one only 1.5m in diameter. Maybe a short woman? Remember, curling up on top of it will be essentially impossible due to the large g-forces pushing you flat against it as you decelerate.

Also, the IRVE fabric includes several outer layers of Nextel (tm) fibers, a derivative of aerogel technology--and probably would not be possible without it. Ordinary aerogel, on the other hand, while having high compressive strength and good thermal insulation properties, is too brittle to use as a heat shield for re-entry.
