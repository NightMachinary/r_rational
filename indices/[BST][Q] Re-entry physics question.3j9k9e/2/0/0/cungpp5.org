OK, I see where that was confusing.

I mean if they (the cyborg and the android) can control the angle of entry. Not if the nanoassemblers can.

Though a perpendicular entry is unusual. Did they fall from a skyhook or something? That would actually be easier, since they won't have to shed full orbital velocity. They'd be travelling under 2000 m/s, not almost 8000.

Depending on their capabilities you could use most of the body mass to build the heat shield and parachute and save the nanotech core, the brains, and enough random organic material to keep the blood oxygenated and fed.

Once they're in the water, spin a small-mesh drift net, collect plankton and oxygen. Don't worry about waking up the meatsack... he'd only complain.
