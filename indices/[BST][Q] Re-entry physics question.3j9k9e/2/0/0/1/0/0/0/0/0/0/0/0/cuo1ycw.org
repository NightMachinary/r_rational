Yeah, I'm somewhat familiar with Drexler's work. The issue is that your output materials have to below a certain temperature to retain their desired physical and chemical properties, instead of eg vaporising or decomposing. This is a major rate-limiter on the process.

I guess there are heatshield materials that might have a very high temperature threshold, but if compression heats them to thousands of degrees I can't see that being good for the assemblers.
