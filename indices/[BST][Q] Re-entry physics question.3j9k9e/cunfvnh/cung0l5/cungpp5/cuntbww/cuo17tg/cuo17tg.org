  Drexler makes a claim of a 1kg system producing 1kg in one hour, and he's probably optimistic. Even with more kilograms in the system, I'm pretty sure that means our heroes are fucked.

Assuming this is the speed for fully-general nanowizadry, don't discount the power of making a more-specific device that helps with your specific problem - eg a half-gram fast-flesh-to-carbonnanotubes converter, to provide the structure for your (flesh-to-) carbon/nitrogen aerogel heatshield or drag-increasing parachute streamers.
