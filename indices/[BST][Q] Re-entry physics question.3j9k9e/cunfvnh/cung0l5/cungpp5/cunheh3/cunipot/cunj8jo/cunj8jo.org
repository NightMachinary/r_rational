The meatsack has a lung replaced by a quantum computer and molecular assembler, so they have about a third of capacity until the android is reactivated, which is probably done as soon as possible, no less than 30 seconds. They have at least 145 seconds before they hit the atmosphere.

Do you know Drexler's idealized claim for rate of production? I'm thinking they could have a mode that rips out the "lung" to expand to a maximum surface area, which would speed up both production and material feed.
