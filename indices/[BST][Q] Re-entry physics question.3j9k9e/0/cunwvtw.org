I think xkcd What If covered similar problem, about cooking steak via free fall. The article is [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/28/][here]]. If I understand it correctly, your protagonist can survive slowing in atmosphere without any additional measures. But covering himself in metal capsula can help. He should also (obviously) disable any sensory machinery on his skin. He should also try to manufacture parachute or something to help with landing.
