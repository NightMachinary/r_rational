It is extremely likely that wards, like everything else in Creation, are based in application of narrative. They are boundaries, meant to enforce the will(s) of a caster or collective casting group.

Because of this, I would theorize that far and other such beings are naturally more susceptible to such bounding, being creatures /created of narrative/. Similarly, humans, bring life created by the gods to escape the eternal question, are inherently less susceptible to warding schema.

Now, Cat is something else entirely, a demigod, and the whistle she holds is narratively extremely powerful. On top of that, the Dead King is literally allowing her to do as she pleases. It is entirely possible that the passive actions of the story actually cause his warding scheme to be permeable to any summon that Cat makes, as it is done with his tacit permission. It is also possible, given Cat's travel through Arcadia to Keter, that he has never bothered to ward against fae. Or that he has simply removed fae wards in light of Catherine's presence. It could be any of those things and more besides. We can only speculate.
