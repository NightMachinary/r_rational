At this point, the excursion to Keter was worth it purely to stop Malicia's deal. Even if Cat doesn't cut a deal with Neshamah like she originally intended, she has successfully stopped a significant expansion of the Kingdom of the Dead without any real cost to the Woe other than time. Stopping this deal was a win for Callow.

We also know, though, that the original deal she came to make is a bigger gamble than ever. If Cat ultimately decided to provide Neshamah his invitation, Malicia could very well report it to the Grand Alliance. Regardless of the potential military consequences of that, we have to remember that Cat's primary goal is the signing of the Liesse Accords, and she just won't have the political standing to push any kind of international agreement if she's seen cooperating with the Dead King.

I think her best bet now would be to give up the negotiations in Keter, instead reporting to the Grand Alliance that, "Hey, I just prevented an alliance of Praes and the Dead Kingdom from sweeping down into Procer." Given Procer's long history as beings of pure bitch, they wouldn't credit her, but it definitely couldn't /hurt/. Callow would be proud of Cat, too, which helps with the whole civil unrest thing.

Honestly, though? I expect the deal to go through, and I expect the Pilgrim to use as leverage in his quest to redeem Cat to death.
