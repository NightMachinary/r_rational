I'm not entirely sure how Cat managed to casually convince Malcia's minions to betray her, when Malicia has mind control powers she's happy to use to ensure loyalty with in her minions. Did Malicia forget to Speak to the people around her in this vitally important mission? Is this a bluff and there's another puppet, or even the /real/ Dread Empress, still in Keter?
