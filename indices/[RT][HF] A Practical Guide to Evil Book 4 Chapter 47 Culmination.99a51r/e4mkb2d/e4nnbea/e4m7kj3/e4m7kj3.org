Can someone explain how this worked? Masego has shown time and again that sorcery can beat aspects, and the dead king is as good as it gets with that; notably, he made this good enough to keep out /ranger/, but aomehow a shadow of akuas name, which wasnt even meant for fae, is enough?

I also didnt think that was what call did, either; im pretty sure an akua chapter said what if did, and it was something to do with control?
