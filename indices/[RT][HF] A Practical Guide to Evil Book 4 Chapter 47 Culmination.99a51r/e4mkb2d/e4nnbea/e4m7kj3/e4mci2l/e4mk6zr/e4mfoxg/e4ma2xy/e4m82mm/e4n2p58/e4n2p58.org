Option 1: The wards didn't anticipate portals being created from inside Keter. When Cat made her portal in the Threefold Reflection, the exit emerged in Keter, which means you can enter Keter by Arcadia /sometimes./ It seems like an oversight on Neshamah's part, but he did have a named elf standing guard, and it's possible he assumed it wouldn't really matter how mobile a fae incursion was once it was already in his walls. It might have just been an engineering challenge that wasn't worth the effort at the time; we know he didn't anticipate Cat's apotheosis (at least, very far in advance).

Option 2: The whistle is a summons, and not a normal one. It bypasses the need to actually /travel/ through Arcadia at all. And consider: the Wild Hunt is formidable, but unlikely to topple a major city on its own, provided it's not caught by surprise. Perhaps the most dangerous things that can be summoned are angels and demons, and Neshamah subdued an entire Hell, and has since grown in strength, so I doubt he's worried about the latter. It could be that summons aren't a major concern to him.

Option 3: It happened because Neshamah let it. It's mentioned several times that many of the oversights that permitted their plan to work have been incredibly improbable, and Cat has speculated that Neshamah was politely, indulgently looking the other way. He could have quietly permitted the summons.
