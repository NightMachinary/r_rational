She summoned Fey outside of the ward, entirely bypassing it. Ward was just made to keep her and Winter contained within (plus some obvious additionals, like blocking physical projectiles, I figure), not to keep her from interracting with the world in general. Call wasn't a Winter thing, so it's action could go outside of the ward. If she had Kilian in a pocket that could shoot normal non-Winter fireballs that'd have worked too, I think.

EDIT: oh, you mean that they opened gates within Keter. Yeah, dunno what is up with that.
