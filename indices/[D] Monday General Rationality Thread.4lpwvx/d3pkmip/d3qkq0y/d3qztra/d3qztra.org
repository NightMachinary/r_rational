  The idea I got was that constantly maintaining focus on the intended “magic” (please ignore my possibly inaccurate terminology) was necessary, but not sufficient. So there would be more requirements involved which the authors didn't elaborate on for various reasons (e.g. because world-building would require much more work in that case, like if JKR had to write whole books on magical theory for HP).

Maybe? As you said, it wasn't covered that well, BUT a character said it once that PK is effectively unlimited energy, so...

  Unconscious and conscious types of “magic” could operate principally differently enough for ranges to vary so much between them. For instance, the unconscious effects of multiple individuals could “stack” together if they were directed to affect the same thing, the lack of requirement for focus could somehow factor into it, etc.

You're right, we don't know. I did remember that the power doesn't have Line of Sight limit, though, since there is a woman capable of manipulating her telomeres, which she obviously can't see.

  If you think about the psychological block as of a very powerful instinctual aversion to [killing], then it starts making more sense. It's like how in our world most humans will be avert to kill or torture creatures of the in-group (other citizens of their country, other humans, pets, large animals in general, etc), only much stronger in effect and harder to “double-think” around. Though I feel like this would generate a certain percent of “psychopaths” in their world and much higher in numbers than the handful of canonic gouma and akki.

Thing is, they are not part of the "in-group". The PK users distanced themselves from the "killers" so much that they called them Demons/Fiends, and even the anime itself shows them not as humans but as masses of black swirling energy, or half-haf. It's a classic dehumanization tactic that should have allowed the other PK users to murder them.

  As explained in the anime and quoted in the wiki:

Yes, but wouldn't it have been easier and more humane to just implement the same do-not-kill limitation in all humans instead of splicing naked mole genes into part of them and do-not-kill in the other?

#+begin_quote
  This also supports my counter-point of double-thinking not being something easily achievable for PK-wielders: if it were that easy, they wouldn't have to change a significant chunk of their population on genetic level just to be able to attack them \ defend against them.

What do you mean?

  Also, in case it'll be relevant for anyone, the correct title is Shinsekai Yori (“shin”=“new”, “sekai”=“world”).
#+end_quote

Yeah, pardon, I misspelled it.
