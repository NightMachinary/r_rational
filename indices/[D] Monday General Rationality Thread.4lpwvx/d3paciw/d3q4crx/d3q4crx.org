- In a superhero world, the antagonist has the power that anyone he touches falls in love with him. He's a politician, often attending rallies and shaking hands (every handshake earns him another voter-for-life) whose policies simplify down to enjoying the wealth and power that come with becoming President. But his mind-controlled voters are still otherwise innocent people...

- Aliens have arrived, and they're shape shifters. Some of them have infiltrated human society, with the explicit aim of (kidnapping humans as pets/raising humans for meat/telepathically feeding on the sanity of humanity/other nefarious aims). It's not easy to tell them apart from the general population; while not invulnerable, they are tougher than a normal human and tend to carry advanced weaponry. New ones turn up faster than the protagonists can reliably identify old ones.
