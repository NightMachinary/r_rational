I recently read a Worm fanfic where Scion was going to destroy all the worlds -- about 20 billion people -- but the heroes were getting useful information from Dinah to help fight him off. The only problem was that doing so was causing her intense pain. Is saving 20 billion lives an acceptable reason to torture an innocent 12-year-old girl?

Personally, I consider the answer to be "obviously yes", but other readers disagreed.
