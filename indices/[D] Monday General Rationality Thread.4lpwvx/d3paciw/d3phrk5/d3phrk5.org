Fighting an enemy willing to use prisoners as instruments of biological warfare, or an enemy that can easily blend in to the general population, making mass surveillance and indefinite detainment one of the most effective ways to deal with them. Another fun situation would be a memetic hazard, like a page of the necronomicon, that turns everyone who views it into cultists whose greatest goal is to blend in and then expose as many people as possible to the hazard.
