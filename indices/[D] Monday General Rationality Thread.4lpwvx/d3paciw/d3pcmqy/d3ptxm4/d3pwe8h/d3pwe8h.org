Please don't take it that way! There's nothing naive about having a utilitarian stance! It mostly displays some flaws inherent to the philosophy, but that doesn't mean that it's naive or wrong because of it. Every belief is bound to have some imperfection, otherwise we would've already solved all of mankind's plights.

The main argument that it presents is that in a system where you always maximize happiness (or minimize pain), you're already conceding that someone has to suffer. You're shifting the goal from completely removing suffering towards only minimizing it. The character's naiveness came from the fact that he applied a utilitarian mindset with the objective of removing all suffering, not the fact that he thought in a utilitarian way. He believed that by always choosing the lesser of both evils he would eventually reach a righteous solution. He never saw that if you're always choosing the lesser of two evils, you're still not removing evil from the equation.

It actually reminds me of the other anime I mentioned. In Code Geass, the protagonist straight up says that if the only way to destroy an evil is by committing another act of evil, then you're not destroying evil, you're just changing its form. He solves this problem by [[#s][Huge Final Episode Spoiler]]

Still, from a pragmatic point of view, utilitarianism has some worthwhile ideas on its side. The fact that suffering/evil might be an unchangeable side-effect of living means that we shouldn't focus on completely removing it and put all our efforts towards minimizing it instead. Of course there's a bunch more problems to consider in such a complex matter, so there really isn't /one/ solution. I'd say preference utilitarianism (since it focuses on self-interest instead of pleasure/pain) might be the best we can do for now. We should focus on finding a better alternative, but at this stage of humanity's development there's worse things we could do.

I don't believe I can do this subject much justice since I'm not THAT well read on it. I'm more of the Zen Buddhist mindset in that we should just believe in nothing, but that isn't very practical when taken to the extreme. Honestly, just ignore me. I'm just an idiot on the internet.
