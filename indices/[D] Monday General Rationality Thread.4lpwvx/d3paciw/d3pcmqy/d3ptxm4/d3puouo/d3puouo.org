More like "coming to terms with the gross cost of net positive utility", it's not actually a criticism /on its own terms/ to note that utilitarianism can suggest things which are horrible out of context.

(imo it also falls into the common fallacy of not counting indirect consequences, and argues that utilitarianism is wrong because following it leads to bed outcomes!)
