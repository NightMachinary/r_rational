The two most obvious scenarios are an epidemic, and an evil army made of good people. For the second one, think World War II: the Nazis were definitely bad, and the Allies absolutely needed to stop them. But most of their military was made of regular soldiers who didn't deserve to die any more than French or British soldiers. So you're going to kill a bunch of innocent people if you want fight against the nazis, even if you only kill enemy soldiers.
