I don't know who recommended me Shinsekai Yori here, but I just finished watching the whole 25 episodes and am pretty pissed off at him/her.

The anime is definitely not rationalist, the characters are definitely not competent in any way or form, and I'm seriously starting to doubt there is any rationality at all in it.

The sheer amount of idiot balls held through the whole series is maddening and, while it might be understandable considering that the structure of their society was not exactly conducive to free thought, it's unacceptable in any product that's touted as being RATIONAL.
