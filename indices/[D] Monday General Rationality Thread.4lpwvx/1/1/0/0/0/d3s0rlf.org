  The don't have to be, the in-group part was just an example. IIRC, all that had to happen was for them to define their target as “human” --- and killing the target became instinctively impossible for them. Even thinking of it as human could trigger the death feedback, as was the case with the monk and the snail creature.

Considering how easy is for them to think of anything even remotely human as, well, human, and how much generic engineering was required for the former humans to stop appearing human I'm starting to have the feeling their perceptions have been re-engineered as well...

  Doing that wasn't possible, since that limitation\blocking technique (the death feedback) depended on subconscious Cantus (PK).

Oh crap, you're right. My mistake.

  I meant that the inability for PK-wielders to overcome their killing block and kill human targets --- or ones that closely resembled humans --- was further supported by the way they went out of their way and used ridiculously convoluted solutions like genetic manipulations (for dealing with rat-people) and tainted cats (for dealing with hazardous).

Yeah, that's another weird thing. You might be right.
