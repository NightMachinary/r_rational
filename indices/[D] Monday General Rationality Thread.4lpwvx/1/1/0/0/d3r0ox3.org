  Thing is, they are not part of the "in-group".

The don't have to be, the in-group part was just an example. IIRC, all that had to happen was for them to define their target as “human” --- and killing the target became instinctively impossible for them. Even thinking of it as human could trigger the death feedback, as was the case with the monk and the [[http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/shinsekaiyori/images/d/d9/Minoshiro.jpg][snail creature.]]

  wouldn't it have been easier and more humane to just implement the same do-not-kill limitation in all humans

Doing that wasn't possible, since that limitation\blocking technique (the death feedback) depended on subconscious [[http://shinsekaiyori.wikia.com/wiki/Cantus][Cantus]] (PK).

  What do you mean?

I meant that the inability for PK-wielders to overcome their killing block and kill human targets --- or ones that closely resembled humans --- was further supported by the way they went out of their way and used ridiculously convoluted solutions like genetic manipulations (for dealing with rat-people) and [[http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/shinsekaiyori/images/7/71/Black.png][tainted cats]] (for dealing with hazardous).
