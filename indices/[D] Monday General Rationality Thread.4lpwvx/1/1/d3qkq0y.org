I don't remember the series well enough to argue against all of your points (and some make sense anyway), but here are at least some weak points in your reasoning:

#+begin_quote
  powers themselves don't seem to have a power limit beyond the capacity to maintain the image in your head
#+end_quote

The idea /I/ got was that constantly maintaining focus on the intended “magic” (please ignore my possibly inaccurate terminology) was necessary, but not sufficient. So there would be more requirements involved which the authors didn't elaborate on for various reasons (e.g. because world-building would require much more work in that case, like if JKR had to write whole books on magical theory for HP).

#+begin_quote
  [range limits are] shown to be very inconsistent [..] unconscious planetary-wide power use.
#+end_quote

Unconscious and conscious types of “magic” could operate principally differently enough for ranges to vary so much between them. For instance, the unconscious effects of multiple individuals could “stack” together if they were directed to affect the same thing, the lack of requirement for focus could somehow factor into it, etc.

#+begin_quote
  Fiends [..] it's absolutely nuts that NOBODY attempted to kill the Fiend by simply switching the point of view 'That is a monster, he's not human anymore, he has to die'. [..]
#+end_quote

If you think about the psychological block as of a very powerful instinctual aversion to [killing], then it starts making more sense. It's like how in our world most humans will be avert to kill or torture creatures of the in-group (other citizens of their country, other humans, pets, large animals in general, etc), only much stronger in effect and harder to “double-think” around. Though I feel like this would generate a certain percent of “psychopaths” in their world and much higher in numbers than the handful of canonic gouma and akki.

#+begin_quote
  [Sensory] .. I wonder why it was never used and developed further for this purpose.
#+end_quote

/(Not really a weakness, this one --- just wanted to add an opinion.)/ My doylist understanding was that they just wanted to focus on the societal and psychological aspects \ ramifications of the story they wanted to tell.

#+begin_quote
  [Bakenezumi] .. Why did they have to splice Naked Mole Rats into the human genome when they could have just added the same attack inhibition they already have?
#+end_quote

As explained in the anime and quoted in the [[http://shinsekaiyori.wikia.com/wiki/Queerats#History][wiki:]]

#+begin_quote
  [.] queerats [..] are actually descended from humans without psychokinesis. When humans who were able to use psychokinesis inserted attack inhibition and death feedback into their DNA to prevent acts of violence against each other, humans without psychokinesis became a problem, as death feedback depended on subconscious Cantus to stop liver and thyroid functions. The balance of power would then shift towards the non-Cantus users as they could freely kill without dying in return. To avoid a reversal of the existing power hierarchy, naked mole rat [..] genes were inserted into those humans' DNA until they could not be recognized as humans and thus would not trigger death feedback.
#+end_quote

This also supports my counter-point of double-thinking not being something easily achievable for PK-wielders: if it were that easy, they wouldn't have to change a significant chunk of their population on genetic level just to be able to attack them \ defend against them.

Also, in case it'll be relevant for anyone, the correct title is Shi*n*sekai Yori (“[[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%97%E3%82%93#Japanese][shin]]”=“new”, “[[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%9B%E3%81%8B%E3%81%84#Japanese][sekai]]”=“world”).
