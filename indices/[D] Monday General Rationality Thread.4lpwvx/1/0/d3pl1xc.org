Wasn't a fan of the series either. A friend of mine recommended it to me because he said it was intellectually stimulating but I found it hard to finish.

I understood that their culture had gone through a dark age after fighting the espers and had developed some rather retrograde doctrines which coupled with the loss of knowledge and the passing of generations turned into something more of a tradition with people forgetting why they had to perform those rituals or do culling in the first place.

In the end the elders seemed to be the only ones in the know and the others just followed orders.

By the way I found the idea of the elders of [[#s][elders plot]]. Saki doesn't seem particularly fit for a leading role either so I never understood what they were aiming to achieve with that.

About the rest, I took it as them being under conditioning for so long that some of their creativity and curiosity were dampened in a way reminiscent of how 1984 created humans with a limited intellect to serve as cheap labor, except more subtle.

Not to mention that the safety mechanism against human on human attack was a very evident vulnerability and I'm surprised no one had created countermeasures, especially since they had suffered from it beforehand.

Overall I'll agree in that I also have problems considering it rational.

If at all I'll say the [[https://youtu.be/LV31EHwtayo][Ending Song]] was its most redeemable trait.
