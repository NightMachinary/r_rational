This reminds me of Kiritstugu from Fate/Zero. He's basically a utilitarian magical Batman that always chooses the needs of the many over that of the few. His arc is about him coming to terms with all the horrible shit he's done and accepting how flawed his philosophy is. There's also Code Geass, where the protagonist decides to take on all of humanity's evil by himself in order to create a peaceful world for his sister.

For non-anime examples, try reading about Nietzsche's philosophy. He's the one who said:

  He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster, for when you gaze long into the abyss the abyss also gazes into you
#+end_quote

Edit: I forgot to mention Psychopass! It's kinda the inverse your situation. The protagonist refuses to kill anyone, even if it meant letting the villain get away with horrible crimes. At some point, one has to question the use of a moral code that allows further harm all for the sake of not killing. If not killing leads to more death, is it really that good in the first place?
