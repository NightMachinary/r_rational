Fate/Zero is so good.

I'd also suggest adding Death Note which is a lot like Code Geass although in that case Light is more selfish than Lelouch.

And finally Watchmen! The antagonist's plan and the characters all make very questionable choices and the ending opens up some good debate on who was right.
