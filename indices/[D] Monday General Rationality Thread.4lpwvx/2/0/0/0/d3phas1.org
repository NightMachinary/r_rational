Yes! Totally agree on Watchmen. Everyone has a decent point they could argue for their cause. Death Note is great, but I don't think Light is a good example here. His argument goes out the window as soon as he tries to kill L. It's very hard to take him seriously when he goes about reaching his goals in such a childish way. Lelouch actually believed in what he preached, where Light just cared about how superior he was to everyone. He didn't have any consistent beliefs, he changed them to suit his ego and needs whenever necessary!
