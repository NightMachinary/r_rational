I was thinking about having a story where the good guys, in order to achieve their ends must commit some level of human rights desecration or some other atrocities. It would make it such that while on their quest the antagonists basically do what they wants in the face of the public until they are able to regain favor, but I'm having trouble with getting good scenario.

Do any of you have examples i could look to for inspiration?
