I binge read Mother of Learning last week and I'm enjoying the story a lot. I do wonder about some things though.

- Why doesn't Zorian try to find a way to shield his friend's mind from the cranium rats. He tells the truth to them and a lot of that information pieced together over several iterations could give a good idea of what he's up to, especially to someone with the time and resources of [[#s][Mother of Learning]]. They don't have good protection from mind reading and he has been shown them pieces of the puzzle.

- The mana batteries. While he says that most forms of magical combat rely on making them explode from pressure and they can't be carried across iterations, he knows a lot more about spell formula that it may be possible to protect them from attack. And having more mana to cast more stuff would help him learn faster rather than needing so much rest along with providing reserves for more complicated spells.

I've been thinking of the concept of self replenishing batteries like the well of souls that could then be mounted on golems and use the communication disks as relays to have them act like support. If he was smart with it he could have his own telepathically controlled "mage squad" to go against bigger threats and avoid risks. For example send them against [[#s][Mother of Learning]] while he remains away from harm and focuses on other plots. Heck I wonder if they got AI stuff in their universe given that they possess mind magics. He could given them a bigger degree of autonomy so he could focus on his own things without having to control everyone of their movements. Maybe dissect some cranium rats could give a good idea of how to build a basic rudimentary decentralized AI?

Another interesting idea is learning if its possible to attach other stuff to his soul like shifters do. Maybe there's a way to bring artifacts across restarts without having to craft them from scratch?

I've been thinking of an optimal strategy to get the most out of the cycles and I think spell formula, memory packets and soul magic were vital. Along with shaping but Zorian didn't know it was that useful until recently. I think if I was stuck in the cycle I would approach the problem like this:

1. Learn everything possible about the cycle and try to uncover how time travel is possible.
2. Learn some useful combat spells to stay alive, probably remain as far as possible from the city and monitor the invasion in case I didn't know I could survive being killed.
3. Learn magic formula and focus on crafting enhancement artifacts to increase stats like strength, intelligence and mana.
4. Find a way to create self replenishing mana batteries. I think it would take quite some time but the costs would be offset if I can use them to practice and replenish reserves along with using them to power constructs.
5. Focus on golems and other constructs to scout and scrying/divination for information gathering.
6. Provided I learned of the aranea, start working towards building up mind magic. Also memory packets would be useful by this point given that so much information would be building up.
7. Start checking on soul magic and ways to protect myself from attack given that it seems to be the most dangerous threat after mind magic, offset only by not being as common as mind magic.
8. Learn more advanced combat magic and only then after being sure I can defend myself from most basic-intermediate forms of death plan on the invasion.

I think attacking the time traveler that could have about as much if not more experience than Zach was a mistake. They just didn't have deterrents and Zorian could have focused on more exotic spells that would be harder to counter so that he could surprise the third time traveler. It showed that unconventional strategies work very well against people that are used to seeing the same tactics over and over and aren't prepared for something like being shot with a gun.

Honestly I think I'd be a lot more paranoid if I was stuck in a cycle with a conspiracy at work and potentially more time travelers tagging along. Then again in his shoes I'd probably not venture as far and learn about the aranea even later, if at all. He is a big risk taker I have to say.

What are your thoughts on the fic so far? I've enjoyed it, so much that I couldn't find a good spot to stop reading but I still wonder how rational some of Zorian's actions are. Also ZorianxTaiven FTW :P
