I literary just ran into to the [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeh-pJYRZTBJDXMNZeWSUVA][Artifexian YouTube channel]], but I think you folks might enjoy it. It seems to focus on discussions of the practical considerations of astronomy and geophysics when it comes to world building along with strangely language design considerations. Apologies to everyone who's also subscribed to [[/r/worldbuilding]] and probably saw this there already.
