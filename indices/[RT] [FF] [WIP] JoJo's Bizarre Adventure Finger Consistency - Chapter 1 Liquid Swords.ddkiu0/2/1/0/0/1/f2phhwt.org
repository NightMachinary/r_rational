AFAIK only Stand that can utilize sperm is from Part V and I don't see how Charlotte and him would be connected so it's probably for other reasons.

I don't think she really works for Dio. If she was, why wouldn't she straight up get rid of Sadao who is supporting Holly? unless she has her own agenda. When she mentioned organization, I thought of SPW Foundation. Which would kinda makes sense since she's there for information and I bet SPW Foundation would try to learn as much as they can about Stands.
