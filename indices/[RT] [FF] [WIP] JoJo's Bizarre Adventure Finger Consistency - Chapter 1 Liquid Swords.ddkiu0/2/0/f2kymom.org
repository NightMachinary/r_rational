  ""It was clear that the woman wasn't all there, and it was important that he": this gives a simultaneous impression that she did something to his mind (to stop him from contacting someone?) and that the author accidentally left out the end of the sentence. If the first, writing in momentary disorientation from not being able to remember what he'd been thinking about is clearer, I feel."

No, I just screwed up here. Fixed it, thank you!

Some fanfiction stories are much friendlier than others in respect to how welcoming and understandable they are to people unfamiliar with the source material; this story, and especially this first chapter, assumes the reader knows most of the major beats from certain points in the show/manga. Much of what you've pointed out could be explained by someone who has read up to the end of Stardust Crusaders.
