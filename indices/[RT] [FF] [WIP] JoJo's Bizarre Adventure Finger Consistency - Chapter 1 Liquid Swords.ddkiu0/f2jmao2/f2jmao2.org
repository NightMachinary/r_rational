Hmm. Reactions, as someone who knows only the bare minimum about the JoJo universe:

"It was clear that the woman wasn't all there, and it was important that he": this gives a simultaneous impression that she did something to his mind (to stop him from contacting someone?) and that the author accidentally left out the end of the sentence. If the first, writing in momentary disorientation from not being able to remember what he'd been thinking about is clearer, I feel.

He can make objects move without touching them (apparent real telekinesis), and he tried showing people, but he couldn't get even his friends to to 'listen to him'--I notice I am confused.

That 'Mysterious illness' right after he displayed his power--sounds almost definitely manmade, first make him desperate and then offer him a lifeline. Either that or a consequence of what he does, but then it wouldn't seem to make sense unless it was his fans getting ill from what he took from them. Either way, the timing is incredibly suspect.

<pauses to look up Sadao Kujo information--sees a Jotaro Kujo picture> --Oh my, he looks like a Kongou Banchou character. <reads...> --Ahh, so it was common causation, rather than one causing the other--but rather, this indicates that both Sadao and Holy are decendents of Jonathan, but Joseph doesn't know this (and so hasn't guessed that Sadao got a Stand at the same time as his other family members)? Hm..? <keeps reading the main story>

("The â€˜disease' that has been following your family for so long"--'so long', so longer than months. Rather than just affecting his nuclear family by its presence in the last few months, it's been following 'his/their (shared bloodline) family' on the order of generations. She knows about why his wife is sick, and she's not telling him. She knows why he and his wife both got Stands at the same time, and she's not telling him.)

I'm left curious about what the liquid in the vial is (and whether readers familiar with the Jojo universe recognise it).

Edit: Huh. One of the few things I've known about the Jojo universe is the awesomeness of [[https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/za-warudo-wryyyyy][The World]]. I had no idea until now that the user was an antagonist rather than one of the protagonists.
