Honestly my guess was more like that she was part of some kind of secret Men-in-Black-ish society that's concerned with the control of Stands and extermination of malicious Stand Users... so in this case her thought is going to the death of /Dio/, not of the Crusaders. When she says that the "disease" will be destroyed when "bathed in the light of the stars", she's saying that Dio will be defeated by Jotaro.
