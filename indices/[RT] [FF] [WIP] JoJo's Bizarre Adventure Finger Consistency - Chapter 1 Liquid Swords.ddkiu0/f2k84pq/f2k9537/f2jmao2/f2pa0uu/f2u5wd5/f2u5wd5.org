An ideal reader for this would be caught up to the current point in the manga, but I'm writing it so that anyone completely unfamiliar with JoJo could theoretically read it (with the hopes that no one is that category actually does). Hence my explanation of basic stand mechanics.

Just like any actual JoJo part, you don't "need" to have read any of the rest of it to understand most of the story, but you will be missing a lot of the backstory and broader context. This first chapter is much more referential than I expect the vast majority of the story to be, for example.
