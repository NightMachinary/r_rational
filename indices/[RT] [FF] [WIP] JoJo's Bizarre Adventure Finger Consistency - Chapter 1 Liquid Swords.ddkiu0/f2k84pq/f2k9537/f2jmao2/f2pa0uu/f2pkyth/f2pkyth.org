I've been wanting to read Jojo ratfic for quite some time and I really like what you did with Sadao Kujo. Hope you keep it up!

Also, you might want to specify which parts the story might spoil or require essential knowledge of. I know you put general disclaimer, but people who only read up to Part 3 might get discouraged if the story does not go beyond making references to future parts. While enjoyable to those who know, they usually don't affect the plot. (Rereading my comment it feels kinda harsh, was not my intention. I just don't know how to soften it lol).
