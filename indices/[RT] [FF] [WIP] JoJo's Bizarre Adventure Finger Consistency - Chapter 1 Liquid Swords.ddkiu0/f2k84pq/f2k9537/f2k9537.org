You've quite perfectly recreated the aesthetic of anime subtitles in your dialogue. Personally, I find this incredibly distracting (though of course, YMMV).

When I see things like Japanese honorifics and weird sentence structures in subs, I take it as a flawed but necessary compromise where naturalism is traded for faithfulness to the original dialogue, and being able to sync it to the animation on screen. Here, though, there's no original translation confining you, yet you've chosen to do it anyway. If you don't mind me asking, why?
