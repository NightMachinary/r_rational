90% of the enjoyment in JoJo is aethestics. It has a unique and powerful aesthetic that, while it does play on traditional tropes and motifs, dials many specific aspects of them up to 11. That's what a lot of people love about JoJo. Taking that away and changing the tone and dialog to be more natural would make it... Not JoJo. The world of JoJo is certainly interesting, but the aesthetic is the real draw.
