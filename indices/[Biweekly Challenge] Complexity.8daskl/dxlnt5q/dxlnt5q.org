I've been working on this idea for about a year now starting with this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/536z7p/saturday_munchkinry_thread/d7qqzlx/][prompt]] at very intermittent intervals. However, I've only actually written out the scenes three days ago. So this is a very bare-bones skeleton of the first five chapters where I'm writing about two guys playing around with a weird new device. The final novel is planned to be around 30 chapters. The novel is also not meant to be so dialogue heavy, but that's what I ended up with.

I've allowed commenting functionality on the Google Docs. So please, feel perfectly free to tear this story to shreds. I can't improve as a writer otherwise.
