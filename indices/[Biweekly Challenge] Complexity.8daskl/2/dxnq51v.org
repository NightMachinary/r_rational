I've been thinking a lot about the Type-Moon/Fate universe recently, and wanted to try fleshing out how and why the in-universe magic system works. Type-Moon has a lot of lore that is only explained obliquely and then ignored for rule-of-cool shounen shit, so this is more-so base system worldbuilding. Tried writing it where you don't need any background, hopefully.
