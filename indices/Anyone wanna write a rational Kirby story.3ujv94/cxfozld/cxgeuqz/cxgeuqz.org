Are you real Eaglejarl? Kirby is the pink guy that sucks up things to turn into them? prominent smash brothers character? Arguably at a fame level similar to that of Mario, Samus, or Link?

Aaanyway, Nightmare in Dreamland, goes something like this: King Dedede removes the power source of the Fountain of Dreams, the Star Rod, splits it into pieces, and hides them away. Now nobody can have dreams anymore! Oh noes! You spend the whole game slaughtering your way to the pieces of the Star Rod, reassemble the Star Rod, shove it back into the fountain of dreams to restore peace to dreamland- OOPS.

Looks like King Dedede had divided and hidden away the pieces for a freaking reason! the minute you put it back the real Big Bad "Nightmare" descends and absorbs all its power, forming the final boss.

So I assume OP is relating it to Sword of Good because it has the same sort of "Actually you've kinda been doing the wrong thing all along" theme.

Ahem, but uh yeah, OP probably should have said all that in their post.
