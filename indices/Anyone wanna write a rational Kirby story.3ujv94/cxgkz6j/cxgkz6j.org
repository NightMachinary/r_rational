Kirby, both as a character and a series, seems like an interesting target for creating a rational spin.

Kirby himself is strongly implied, through out all of his media, that he is very young, mentally. Usually this is used to explain his large lack of language and simple demeanor, but given we're allowed to go a bit off the rails with a ration fanfic, it seems valid to me say that he might also have the absorptive (pun intended) tendencies of a child, as well.

I suppose, the way you'd use that framework, would be to try and craft a coming-of-age arc out of his stories. There's already something like that there, with the rise and fall of cooperative characters like the animal friends, Bandana Dee, King Dedede, and Meta Knight.

Necessity seems like it'd be the main drive for Kirby (or any of the characters, really) to develop their rationality. Even with Kirby's inherently huge power level, the enemies he faces in his adventures are very big, and often pretty existential. If you cut out the eleventh hour power boosts (or made them less eleventh hour-y) and subbed in some mental growth, training with his powers (capitalize on the presence of a master swordsman and fellow star warrior, if nothing else) and maybe some enlightenment on his nature as a seemingly cosmic entity (the copy palette, receptivity to the star rod, command of the warp star, literally planet-cracking strength, that sort of thing), and it seems like there's something there.

You could star with a light in-media-res, after Kirby finishes up one of the smaller adventures, like when Dyna Blade ravages the crops to feed her nest. This beginning can serve to introduce how Kirby's character has changed from canon, from a purely innocent puffball who is mostly interested in getting the food back so he can eat, to what we could consider a slightly more mindful child, one who's learned that, beyond being hungry himself (which should definitely remain one of his top priorities throughout), Dyna Blade is also damaging all of Dreamland. The extra awareness will also let the ending of that story impact him more, another example where his more terrestrial foe is innocent, in some ways at least. That's already a theme almost every game.

Progress can happen, I can't think of all the details right now. But an interesting point would whatever equivalent to Return to Dreamland would be. Potentially, it would be one of the first times where not only is a foe actually friend, but where Kirby is honestly, directly, painfully betrayed. This could serve as formation point for Kirby, a jumping off point where if he's matured enough by that time in the story, for him to develop his rationality further. If he hasn't already, maybe he can go to Meta Knight, who seems, if nothing else, less naive, get some training in being a better judge of character as well as a better swordsman and warrior.

Other points to the story could the development of how Kirby interacts with the other people in Dreamland. At first, he might seem like almost another monster, if cuter than average, occasionally pillaging the fields and homes for food. He can grow to into more social behaviors, perhaps learning at first to find food in the wispy woods or the similarly uncultivated places, and then actually attempting to trade with Dreamlanders, and further in the future, maybe even use his considerable power to help them grow food.

If a darker twinge feels necessary, you can also expand on Shiver Star being a snowballed modern Earth. Maybe have some future humans wandering about the galaxy for Kirby to encounter. Maybe this human population is the true origin of Adeleine, if her presence on Pop Star needs to be explained. If she's given sole humanity as a character trait, then reconnecting her to her species could be plot point, as well as an interesting parallel to Kirby and the stark lack of star warriors beyond him and Meta Knight.
