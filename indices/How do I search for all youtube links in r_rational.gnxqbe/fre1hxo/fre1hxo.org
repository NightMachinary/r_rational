There's always [[https://redditsearch.io/][pushshift]]. I believe it's run by the same guy as the google cloud dataset mentioned above, but as it's a web UI more like a classic advanced search page and doesn't require a google account, it might be more approachable for a one-off query with a reasonable output size that you don't care to export for later re-use.
