I quit reading it when a friend told me it lacks the "exploit" part of rationalist entertainment fiction. That is, what we recommend most on this sub isn't really "realistic" fiction, it's fiction where the protagonist can use his or her knowledge and thinking to come up with an exploit - and it actually has to work at least some of the time.

Another keyword is "agency". This is one problem with the Sufficiently Advanced Magic book series - the protagonist hangs around so many arbitrarily powerful beings that he can do very little to affect the course of events, except when they let him.
