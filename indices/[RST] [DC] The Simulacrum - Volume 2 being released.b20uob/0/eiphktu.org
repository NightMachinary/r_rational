The contents page is here ( [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23173/the-simulacrum]] ). It's about a guy who wakes up in an anime world and has to come to terms with his new existence, mostly by poking and prodding wherever he can to see how this new world ticks. Lots of rationalist actions as the MC investigates where he has ended up.

The characters are well written, and manage to acquire a depth and life of their own despite being based on classic anime tropes.

Overall I'd definitely recommend reading it. The prologue are a bit like an outsider interlude thing, and don't read like the main story much at all though, so don't form your opinions just from them.
