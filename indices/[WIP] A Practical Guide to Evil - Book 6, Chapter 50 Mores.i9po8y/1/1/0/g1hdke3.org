Yeah I wasn't trying to imply that. It just seems like from a Doylist perspective the meeting to decide if the Scribe can join should take place before and not after she's already joined. It felt out of place to me.

It isn't necessarily bad and it's hard to judge something that literally just happened in a story without knowing how it will play out. Often something that at the time seems weird or nonsensical will be re-contextualized as the story goes forward.
