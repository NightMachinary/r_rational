This was a weird chapter for me. It felt like the discussion they were having after Cat already said Scribe could join was pointless. I mean sure they could technically kill her if they wanted, but she's already signed onto the Truce & Terms. It doesn't matter how much paperwork Hakram loses, the story of a villain signing on and then being immediately killed will get out somehow. Killing Scribe after the Terms are already under attack would see them pretty much collapse.

Ultimately from a meta-narrative perspective we know she's joining because why else would this chapter be written? Having Scribe show up and then die immediately would be so pointless.
