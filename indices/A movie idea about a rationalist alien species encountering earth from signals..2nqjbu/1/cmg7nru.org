First of all, why do we need humans to be the actors?

Second, how is this a fanfic? Sounds like an original to me.

Third, you've posted the entire story -- why not just have written it instead? It will depend on the surprise ending for its punch, and you've ruined that, at least as far as the readers on this subreddit are concerned. You should change your title to include a [SPOILERS] tag.
