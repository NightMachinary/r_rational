1. Because we can't employ aliens to do it, CGI tends to bankrupt the studio doing the CGI, and we need humans to be able to relate.

2. Because it spins off the HPMOR extinction event, with the hidden backstory being explicitly an all out wizarding war between HJPEV and Quirrell.

3. Yeah, but lots of people write down stuff all the time, and by the time I'm done writing backstory, character profiles and relationships, maps, civilisation profiles, and then write the script, you, and everyone else I've shown this to will have forgotten. I wanted to see reactions to the base plot, the ending, and to see if anyone had any ideas for the civilisation.
