Using undead as a benign source of cheap labor is a semi-common inversion of the 'evil necromancer summoning armies of undead trope'.

Edit: Or at least I thought it was, but I can only come up with Warbreaker and the Death Gate cycle as examples and a quick trip to tvtropes didn't help either, so maybe it's not that common (though it should be).
