[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/777002][/To the Stars/]] is fantastic reasonably-futuristic SF plus slice-of-life plus /Puella Magi/. Not rationalist, but IMO the worldbuilding and characters take it well into rational territory, not to mention some of the themes (because they'd spoil things). ~750K words, not yet finished.
