[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][/Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived/]] (660K words, complete) starts out looking like a familiar story... but instead of magic, this world has /James Bond/-level spy shenanigans (from gadets to supervillains).

May be my favorite portrayal of Hermione; /easily/ my favorite Dumbledore - I'm recommending it for equal parts worldbuilding and characterisation. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/682neu/][This review]] and comments are decent:

  It's a super-spy story where all the Bond-background has been mashed up and subsumed in an ingenious mutation of the Potterverse... Fifth year is admittedly self indulgent, but I couldn't stop laughing. Imagine canon Umbridge trying to control a school of disgruntled teenagers trained in espionage.

Technically fourth in a series, but entirely standalone - this is the backstory for Hermione in a later crossover.
