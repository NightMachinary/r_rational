Anti-rec on With this Ring. The author has made several transphobic comments/"jokes" and those views show through several places in the story.

The pacing is also rather poor. 2/3rds of the story has Paul sweating about this specific enemy. Eventually he confronts the enemy and no-sells them with no preparation or foreshadowing.
