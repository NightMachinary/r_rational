Gender is about self identity, not what's in your pants. For most people the two match up. We call this being cis.

Being trans (this is an over simplification. There are multiple factors to whether an individual is trans. Someone can experience body dysphoria without being trans and vice versa. For example, I experience mild body dysphoria when people are intimidated due to my build, while in my mind I'm everyone's friend.) is when your self identity doesn't match what's in your pants.

In the WtR case, the genderswapped individual identifies as male, so they're a man. The genitalia practically being visible does nothing to change this, it only changes if the character is cis or trans.
