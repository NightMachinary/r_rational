Hmm, you've gone through most of the strictly rational ones (Without Worm on the list) so I'll give you a few long semi-rational ones.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-fourteen.8938/][With this Ring]] - Young Justice Fanfic, how to utilize a ring powered by avarice to save the world. A little meandering at points, and the side stories are a little odd for my taste but rational for a self-insert. NO Harem.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] - Harry Potter, Hermione MC. Not strictly rational, but at least logical in regards to mathematical theory in regards to spellcrafting. A balanced approach, wherein raw arcane power and precise application of limited power are both valid approaches to magic. Very Long, but no instances of an idiot ball as I recall. There are errors on Hermione's part, but understandable ones.

[[https://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/issue-1/page-0/][Strong Female Protagonist]] - An original Webcomic, what happens when a child raised to be a 'super-hero' grows up and faces the reality that beating up bad guys in the streets won't fix the world. Be prepared to be left hanging as the Hiatus has been going on for years.

That's about all I can do off the top of my head for at least semi-rational that I don't see recommended here too often. I've got a collection of at least logical stories as well if you'd like those.
