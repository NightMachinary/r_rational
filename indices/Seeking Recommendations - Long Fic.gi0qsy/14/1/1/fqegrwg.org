  Anti-rec on With this Ring. The author has made several transphobic comments/"jokes" and those views show through several places in the story.
#+end_quote

The part where a man turned into a woman nonconsensually and the protagonist being unsure what to call them? Or the part where he said he's a transhumanist and literally would support someone being an helicopter?

  The pacing is also rather poor. 2/3rds of the story has Paul sweating about this specific enemy. Eventually he confronts the enemy and no-sells them with no preparation or foreshadowing.
#+end_quote

Yes. Obviously if he spent 2/3 of the story building up technology magic and allies to take down one specific opponent who can't meaningfully change or prepare for him it can't go well. That's like, rational or something!
