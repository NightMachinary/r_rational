If you're fine with things that are less than rational, but still self consistent, I've got a bunch.

- Ar'Kendrythist is probably my favorite web serial currently. The premise is that two people from earth are isekai'd into a world with magic and a system. The world is rich and vibrant, and the magic is consistent while still giving leeway for having magical moments. The characters are really well done imo, and face actual character development throughout the series. It's at about 730k words so far.

- Zombie Knight Saga has the protagonist becoming an undead in the beginning, and the world unravels from there. Great worldbuilding and solid characters. The magic system is great and some of the resultant combat is the best I've seen in webfiction. It's at about 800k words right now I think.
