  But, he talked to the person experiencing it and went along with their choice?

No. The Self Insert talked to the person experiencing it, notices that he was in fact *extremely distressed* by the involuntary alteration of his body (using empathic vision, no less), and then proceeds to purposefully misgender him while making comments to the effect of 'if you were a man, you wouldn't need this bra, now would you?' and introducing him as 'Electro Lass' despite his team members protesting that such behavior is uncalled for.

Given that the Self Insert is quite literally and explicitly a insertion of the Author as a character in the story and behaves as the author imagines he would behave under those circumstances, that part of the story suggests very strongly that the author is IRL very dismissive of body dysphoria and very much a biological essentialialist. Which makes sense, given that the author literally said as much in the forum posts that he got banned over. (I mean, he also got in hot water for posting that the forum's rule saying not to misgender people was dumb and he would rather move to a different forum than stop misgendering people. But that's beside the point.)
