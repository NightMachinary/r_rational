Well. Regardless of what one thinks of the object level debate RE misgendering, reading With This Ring means signing up to read a story written by a person who will very definitely update every single day, but who will also very definitely post something that is around this level of controversially culture-war adjacent about twice a year and get banned from his current forum and move his story to a new one about once every three years. If you're on board with that combination of pros and cons, like esoteric references to DC properties and don't mind the colourful text formatting, With This Ring is a fic worth looking into. Otherwise, you might want to pass on it.
