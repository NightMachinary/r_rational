  The helicopter gender is a very common 'joke' people use to de-legitimize body dysphoria.

but... he was being serious?

  Paul himself may not experience body dysphoria, and thats okay, but he then extends that out so that no one actually experiences body dysphoria, which is the not cool part.

But, he talked to the person experiencing it and went along with their choice?

  sst. He put the big bad guy to sleep after sneaking onto the planet with 0 preparation or help from allies he made. He just walked up and put him to sleep with innate powers of the orange light. Against a being thats been steeped in the orange light for millennium. C'mon, that is such an obvious power fantasy I don't know how you can defend it.

Okay now you're just straight up lying. He used the phasing/invisibility tech he got from Kordtech and that villain guy, used his extreme mastery of the orange light to take control of the assimilited things afterwards, and most importantly he was brought there by Hinon who made him a device specifically to put Larfleeze into a state where he couldn't resist, with the Sword Of The Fallen as as a backup.

What more do you want?

He made a thorough plan and prepared for it over the course of a year, and it ended up working. Like a rational plan should!
