This might take some unpacking.

It doesn't matter if Paul was being serious when he says that he'd support someone being a helicopter, because it's a vehicle for the author to say that identifying as a helicopter is exactly as valid as self identifying as a gender you're not born with the genitalia of. It's validating a trope used to invalidate trans people.

As to the body swap thing: the thing that stuck with me was the multiple paragraphs of "he's a she but she's a he REE"

Phasing tech: rational. It's a tech he's used for a bunch of stuff, no reason for larfleeze to magically be immune to it.

Extreme mastery of the orange light: c'mon do I need to say it. Sure he's had setbacks with it but overall he became a super master at orange light after meditating and pondering on a half thought out mishmash of philosophy.

Hinon: she only helped him because he was interesting and possibly useful, read 'extreme mastery of the orange light', so she gave him a doodad which perfectly solves his problem.

Sword: having a contingency plan is good, and most of the plots involving Constantine were actually good. No complaints here.

The story up until this point had larfleeze as an end boss with very slim chances of beating; he put constraints on what Paul could do simply by existing. Then when the author realized Paul needed to confront larfleeze soon, and had no idea how to make the victory satisfying (there's no way Paul would lose when the result of losing is sitting in orange stupor till the end of time) they just had hinon be 1. Willing to trivially solve the problem. 2. Able to trivially solve the problem

The most frustrating thing about WtR is I'm a transhumanist myself. I could wake up tomorrow in a robot, or female, or squid body and be excited at the new possibilities, that doesn't mean everyone is like me. The author is a dense jerk who makes all transhumanists look like dense jerks.
