Unfortunately it's written in a kind of UKAmerica, a quaint vaguely British sort of place, yet where solicitors conduct business by extorting money from the civil service via the courts, and dentists insist on being called Dr, even though they would be rapped over the knuckles by the GMC were they to try to make such claims. So not very British at all.

But quite funny.
