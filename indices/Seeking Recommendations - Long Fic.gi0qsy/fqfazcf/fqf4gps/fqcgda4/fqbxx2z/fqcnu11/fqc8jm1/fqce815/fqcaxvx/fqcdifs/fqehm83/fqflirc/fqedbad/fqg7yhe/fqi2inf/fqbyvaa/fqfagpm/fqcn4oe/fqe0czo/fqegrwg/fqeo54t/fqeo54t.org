Yes lol, in your first point they're obviously still a man. The helicopter gender is a very common 'joke' people use to de-legitimize body dysphoria.

Against a being thats been steeped in the orange light for millennium. C'mon, that is such an obvious power fantasy I don't know how you can defend it.
