I think I can assume you've read HPMoR already even though it wasn't listed. ;)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/936480][A Song For Two Voices]] - Rationalist take on Mercedes Lackey's /The Last Herald-Mage/ trilogy. No knowledge of canon required. I consider it well-written. Protagonist suffers from imperfectly controlled depression and has to cope with and sometimes work around it and its effects on his judgment. Long, updates regularly.
