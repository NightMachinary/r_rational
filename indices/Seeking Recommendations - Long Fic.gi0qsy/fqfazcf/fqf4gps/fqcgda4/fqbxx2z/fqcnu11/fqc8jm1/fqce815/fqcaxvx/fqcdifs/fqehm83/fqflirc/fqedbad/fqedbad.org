There's the author of Deeprise's current projects(BTW do you have a backup of Deeprise? The author doesn't and I never finished it). Hope and Silence in the Hive(not precicely rational but not not rational) and Terror and Peace Among the Stars are good. Terror and Peace especially, it even adds a lot to Hope and silence. Quite philosophical, even though the main character is strictly a kardashev 2 civilization on her own pretty much no meaningful conflict is possible to solve with simple force and even notes how crude what she makes is compared with what a proper stellar engineer would make, can be a bit hard to follow at times but definitely worth it. Touches on a lot of philosophical points found around here but rarely discussed to such a degree like transhumanism, death and free will. Another is Onwards to Providence by the same author.
