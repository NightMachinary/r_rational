You could try The Wandering Inn [[https://wanderinginn.com/]]

It's pretty well written, and the author updates with extreme productivity: ~20k words twice a week typically; it's nuts. The most accurate description of the quality is that at its best, it's good. When it's not, it kind of drags. It's super long, though, so it will keep you busy if you like it.
