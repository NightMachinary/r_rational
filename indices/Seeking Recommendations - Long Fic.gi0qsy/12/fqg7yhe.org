Since I see FiO on your list which means you're not allergic to ponies, I'd recommend The Maretian. The Martian / MLP crossover. Very fun, and looong. I don't see The Martian on your list either but I assume you've heard of it/read it/seen the film: if not get to it straight away because it's excellent.

I don't see Animorphs the Reckoning on the recommendations; do you only want complete stuff?

Metamorphisis of prime intellect: localroger has some other fiction, most notably his passages in the void series. Doubt it meets your length requirements, but still.

Crystal Society, Crystal Mentality and Crystal Eternity are a great trilogy. I personally love all three but many people reckon the first one is the only one that's any good.

Luminosity and Radiance are two stories written as rational versions of twilight. Stop your cringing at the thought of sparkly vampires and creepy stalker bois and mormon undertones; it's a story about transhumanism and munchkinry of cool super powers. People reckon the second book isn't as good, but IMO there's just a different viewpoint character who you don't like as much as Bella in the first book.
