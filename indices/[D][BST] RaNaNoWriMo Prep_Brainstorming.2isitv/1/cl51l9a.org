After lots of helpful advice in the prior thread, I realized that, given my inexperience with writing, I need to focus on writing first, 'writing rational' second.

I'm still going to move forward with my plan to write something that starts out as a standard Fantasy dungeon-crawling type of story and then begins to deconstruct the common tropes (without becoming too GenreSavvy).

My goal has been to use the month of October for planning and outlining so that I have a solid foundation to build upon when I dive into the actual writing on Nov 1.

I meant to start an outline last week, but got sucked into the worldbuilding aspect and probably spent a lot more time than I should have doing things like figuring out the best way to create real-looking tectonic plates so that the ensuing continents and geogolical structures would be reasonable.

The last few worldbuilding-related things I want to take care of before I really dive into my characters and my actual story are Gods, Magic and Races. I want to think carefully about these things and lay a good rational ground work for my world.. Hopefully that will make things easier later.

The main thing I struggled with for a while was trying to decide whether to make my magic and my gods "explainable" or just "rational". That is, there are some stories that would try to explain magic by attributing the effects of magic to some other elementary particles or fields that don't normally interact with matter, etc. The other path to take I guess is the way HPMoR does it where magic works and it has rules but we're never going to find out the rules or the mechanisms by which it works, etc.
