Well, one might argue that the official definition of 'national' doesn't include any requirement for the number of participants, and that there's a fair chance that the geographic distribution of the people posting in this thread and the previous one is roughly national, if not international.

But of course, you're right. According to informal everyday use of the word, we couldn't consider this 'National'. I take your point. RaNoWriMo rolls off the tongue better anyway.

edit: softened up my 'argument' a bit.
