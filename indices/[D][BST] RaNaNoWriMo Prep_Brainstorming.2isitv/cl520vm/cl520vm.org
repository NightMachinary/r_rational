I'm doing the psuedocode verison of my NaNo novel right now. There's a one-sentence description of what happens in each of the 52 chapters, and I'm in the middle of the second pass, where each of those sentences gets expanded into a paragraph, with one sentence descriptions of every scene within that chapter.

The three/four magic systems have been worked out about as much as I think they need to be to serve the plot. The main characters each have their own little descriptions (physical and mental) so that I can keep track of motivations and attributes.

Honestly, I'm probably ready to start writing now. My biggest issue is that I don't want to focus on anything else in the next two weeks to distract from NaNo, but I also don't want to start NaNo ahead of time, which leaves me with nothing to write - and I do think that there's such a thing as overplanning.

Edit: I pretty much take it for granted that no one would want to read any of the prewriting stuff I've been doing, but if I'm wrong about that, here's [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing.html][part 1]] (high-level plotting), [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing_25.html][part 2]] (magic), and [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing_28.html][part 3]] (characterization).
