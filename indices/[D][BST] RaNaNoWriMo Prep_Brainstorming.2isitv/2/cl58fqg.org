I've got what I think is a fun idea. Interestingly, started when I was entertaining some kids at a summer camp. One of them said that creativity is just plagiarism, so we started designing some insanely messy world by lifting characters from other works and slightly changing their names (or combining them, in a few cases).

So there's Harriet Stark (Harry Potter + Iron Man + Iron Throne kinda), her enemy Var Garmellort (with a hi-tech army and no nose), and her weak allies, the Smiffs (Smurfs + Keebler elves) and the Smuffles (Snorks. Exactly Snorks). In other news, I don't know whether to post it on fanfiction or fictionpress, or what to tag it with on either site.

So I took these characters and kinda threw them together into a setting divided into Golden, Silver, Iron, Bronze, and Stone Ages, each with inversely proportional levels of technology and magic (due to a fun definition I worked up). Originally, Var Garmellort was a time traveler trying to conquer each time period, but I'm not quite ready to do much with a full-on time travel story yet (since I'm saving that for my Doctor Who fic-in-stagnation). So they're physical zones. Islands, or something.

It seems like it'll be fun to write, and I actually have a rational-ish ending in mind from the beginning (rare among my projects), so I'm optimistic, to say the least.
