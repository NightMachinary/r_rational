  Any other ideas on intros/prologues? Particularly for "And suddenly an adventure" stories?

That depends on your story. The "action prologue" is fairly popular these days, because it lays down a lot of promises and builds up the central mystery that gets uncovered over the course of the novel, and tends to carry more interest to the reader than just "here is this ordinary guy". There are a few variants on this - one of the big ones is to start the story in the middle (for a chapter) and then flashback to the beginning.

I don't really think you /need/ a prologue, but it really depends on what kind of story you're writing, and what promises you want to make. /Alice in Wonderland/ starts with her being bored and then chasing after a rabbit, and that seemed to work fine.

So long as your intro defines your primary character and shows who they are (and the dissatisfaction in their life). If you show the main character as being bullied at school, that's a promise that he'll stand up for himself at the end. If you show him as being a coward (/Edge of Tomorrow/), he'll turn out be brave. If you show him as a jerk (/Groundhog Day/), he'll gain some empathy. If the intro doesn't make /explicit/ promises, like setting up a Dark Lord that needs defeating, it should set up something within the character that needs to change.
