My favorite method of title generation is quoting the Bible, in part because it allows you to add some gravity without having to work too hard. Just go to biblegateway.com, search for a word vaguely related to humongous mecha, and find something like:

- Underneath the Everlasting Arms
- Each Arrow a Flaming Missile
- If By the Missile They Fall
- The Weapons of Our Warfare
- A Flight in Winter
- Take Flight By Your Wisdom
- Delivered From Prison By An Angel

And then you can start your story with the full epigraph, if it's cool enough.

#+begin_quote
  For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts.
#+end_quote

No idea what that really means, but it sounds cool.
