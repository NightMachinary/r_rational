  The main thing I struggled with for a while was trying to decide whether to make my magic and my gods "explainable" or just "rational". That is, there are some stories that would try to explain magic by attributing the effects of magic to some other elementary particles or fields that don't normally interact with matter, etc. The other path to take I guess is the way HPMoR does it where magic works and it has rules but we're never going to find out the rules or the mechanisms by which it works, etc.

If you haven't already been introduced to Sanderson's Laws, here they are:

- [[http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/][First Law:]] An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic.
- [[http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-second-law/][Second Law:]] Limitations are greater than powers.
- [[http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-third-law-of-magic/][Third Law:]] Expand what you already have before you add something new.

These are all good rules to follow. All those linked articles are good articles to read. I could offer more advice if you'd like, but the most important thing to keep in mind is that you're trying to tell a story, not put out thousands of words about how your magic system works, which is one of the biggest problems that beginning writers fall into. I helped read through the slush pile (unsolicited manuscripts that publishers get sent which are looked through by interns), and that doesn't just go for fantasy, it happens in science fiction and other genres as well. People get caught up in having done their research or world-building, and want to present that to the reader but unfortunately forget that they have to make it compelling (and that most of the time, readers don't tend to care).
