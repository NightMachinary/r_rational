Oh god yes please

Ever since I watched House of Cards and read [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2gtwxo/professor_quirrell_as_played_by_frank_underwood/][this thread]] and devoured [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2hllrn/rtdcharry_potter_and_the_seventh_horcrux_complete/][this fic]] (with [[#s][epilogue spoilers]]), I've badly wanted to see Frank Underwood / Francis Urquhart taking control of magical Britain. Seeing as how the politics is a mess, it just seems like it would be so ... damn ... exploitable ...
