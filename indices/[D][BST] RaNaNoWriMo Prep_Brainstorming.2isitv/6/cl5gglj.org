How is one to make a blatant Hero's Journey plot have an intro that makes appropriate promises to the reader? Harry Potter and Starwars pulled this off with prologues and by sprinkling plot details into the introduction of the protagonist. ... So did the Wheel of Time, now that I think of it. ... Arguably the mysterious paragraph about black robes at the start of HPMoR counts, although HPMoR skips directly to the Hogwarts letter and spares us the daily life shenanigans.

Come to think of it, the story I'm wanting to write is close to unique among my projects in its lack of a prologue. ... Romeo and Juliet even had a prologue! (possibly because the first scene is background information more than anything?)

So I guess I'm going to try and come up with a prologue, even though it feels kinda form-breaking. I'm sure that's just a feeling.

Any other ideas on intros/prologues? Particularly for "And suddenly an adventure" stories?
