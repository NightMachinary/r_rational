Yeah, if I had any criticism of this amazing +fanfic+ rationalist fiction it would be that the tone and speaking style (even down to the slang used) of most characters when they speak is fairly similar. It helps deliver rational dialogue however when people speak plainly, so I appreciate it for that, and maybe it's something unavoidable with rational fictions in general, but it's more noticeable here, at least for me. I still very much enjoy it though!
