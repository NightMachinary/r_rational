From a perspective of whether or not the creatures are sapient, it certainly doesn't matter, but that's hardly the only criteria to judge a world by. A replication is much harder to manipulate than a simulation for instance.

It sounds to me like what your actually claiming is that "The gods didn't leave, they just moved the world", which is kind of identical. From a physics stand point at least, the two are just different perspectives of the same relative movement.
