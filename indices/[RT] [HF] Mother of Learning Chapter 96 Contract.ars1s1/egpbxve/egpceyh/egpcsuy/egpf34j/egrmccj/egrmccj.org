Well, we don't really know how "gone" the gods are exactly, we just know that they haven't been talking to mortals for a while. They could still be around writing contracts.

Although my personal theory is that the "real world" is also a simulation just like the loop was, just slightly larger to contain the angels as well. We don't hear from the gods because the universe is in safe mode. I don't really have enough evidence to back this up, but there have been few if any other theories about where the gods are. If that's the case, there could be interference from whichever god is hosting the simulation, just as we saw in the time loop.
