Seems reasonable.

The angel did imply it could be done, and did let slip both that the angels lack information on what happened inside the time loop, and that the time loop is similar to a black room in that both isolate the contents from the universe (something Z&Z already knew but the angel provided conformation, and if they hadn't known they would now). The missing piece is whether the mechnism that would kill Zack is built into the blessing/contract itself or is something that uses the blessing/contract as a marker and has to search creation for the marker to act on it.

That's enough missing information the angel didn't tell them how to evade the auto-kill, but also provided the black room trick would work, not necessarily a piece of information they need to be sure of in order to try.
