I'd assume the kill mechanism is built-in. It might even make him attempt to commit suicide if he isn't dead after the mechanism activates, just as an extra fail-safe in case he survives it somehow. I can't imagine a black room to be the solution.

​

I think they have to either find a loophole so that the contract is technically fulfilled or make the contract/marker be inactive at the time of the deadline. I'm not sure how they would accomplish either, but just spitballing here: They could just kill Zach near the end and let him be absorbed into the giant soulbattery, then extract his soul and put it into one of Zorian's golem bodies after the deadline. This way he would be "dead" at the deadline anyway, probably voiding the contract. This is probably not an easy thing to do, but it might be possible.

​

But tbh I think the real solution (if there is one) might be simpler than that.
