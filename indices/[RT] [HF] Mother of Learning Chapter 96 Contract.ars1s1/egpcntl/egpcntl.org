Jornak's goals and blackmail are contradictory. On one hand, he says that he wants to prevent another Splinter War. On the other hand, his blackmail is to start a continental war. What's really his motive?

Also, would Jornak know or suspect the scorched earth policy of the "Highest Ones"? If so, I think he should have placated and helped Zach stop the invasion in the time loop, otherwise there wouldn't be much of a world left after the primordial leaves and the scorched earth policies are activated.
