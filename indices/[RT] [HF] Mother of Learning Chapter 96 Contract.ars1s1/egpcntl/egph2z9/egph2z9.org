He is lying through his l teeth, either to our protagonists or to himself, he just wants power, he was wronged and robbed. He thinks the world owes him a favor and if it isn't willing to give it to him, he is willing to take it kicking and screaming.

That is the impression I'm getting at least, and honestly, Zorian isn't at as much a disadvantage as he may think at the moment, he just needs to do the one thing that his time in the loop has perfect prepared him for, /organise the Aranea/, if Zorian can pull this off, he basically just wins, it doesn't matter how many heavy hitters and powerhouses the other guys have, an army computerised of an entire race of mind reading and controlling psychics with skill at predicting the future? It doesn't get much more unbeatable than that.
