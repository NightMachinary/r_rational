  On one hand, he says that he wants to prevent another Splinter War. On the other hand, his blackmail is to start a continental war. What's really his motive?

He doesn't want to prevent another splinter war. After all, the countries are all horrible and corrupt and it's inevitable anyway. If anything driving the countries to war would make it easier for him to start reforms.
