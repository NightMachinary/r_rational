Also remember I'm not just talking Cyoria's Aranea, I'm talking all of them, or at least all of them in Eldemar, and it was heavily foreshadowed that Zorian, Daimen and the Aranea worked out a way through mind blank, so it isn't a perfect defense, and there are consequences to using Mind blank for an extended period, a month likely exceeds that safe period, so at least some of the higher ups will be vulnerable some of the time, not to mention how vulnerable QI is to a surprise attack, from a lot of mind mages, if just one of them gets a hold on him in he hopes out automatically, which would give them the crown, a significant advantage for the final battle.
