I can definitely see that. One thing I do want to find out is why Jornak wants power. I suspect that it is related to the time loop warping his perspective of what he deserves, and is probably why the angels have a "good ethical guidelines" criteria when they selected their candidate.

I don't know if the Aranea will be that effective. They were wiped out by Jornak while the time loop was still in effect. Granted, they were caught by surprise, so they may be effective this time around. I'm sure Jornak has anti-divination wards as well as a mind blank spell that makes him impervious to the Aranea, as well as anybody else he casts it on. I wouldn't be surprised if he enforces a "everybody has to cast Mind Blank on himself" policy. Who knows, maybe he even has a wraith bomb planted near their nest. Wraiths don't have minds, do they?

However, I doubt that the vast majority of the invading army will have great mind protection due to Mind Blank's tendency to cause mental issues. So as long as the Aranea stay alive until the invasion, they will contribute greatly.
