I still don't believe RR is Jornak. I think there is a sleight of hand going on between Zorian and RR.

I want RR to be another Zack, or Zorian. Somehow I don't know how or which.

My main reason for thinking this is that RR could have been given the means to exit the Sovereign Gate as the person whom completed the Angel's task. So, RR is Zack, and Zorian know this from finding a loop hole in the contract.

Pulling a switcheroo between the real Jornak and RR would get RR off the memory wiping hook.

Or possibly if RR is Zack, one of them can survive.
