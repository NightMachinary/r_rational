Of course Red Robe is a shitty mage. Zorian and Zach loop for years on their own, having to fight against all kinds of necromancers and monsters singlehandedly. Meanwhile Red Robe can just drag QI around with him to do the fighting and sit back until the enemy is defeated, just like how he beat up Zach during one of the early time loop parties.

But yeah, not having to train his combat skills would give him plenty of time to research ways to exploit the time loop. Still though, that's a somewhat empty threat. Red Robe only knows how to trigger a war under the controlled conditions of the time loop, and most likely without significant interference from other time loopers. Outside of the time loop with Zach and Zorian causing chaos it's entirely possible to make things go differently.
