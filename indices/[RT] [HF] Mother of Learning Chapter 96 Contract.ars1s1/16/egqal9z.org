So the chapter casually answered my biggest question, that was, *if Red Robe had been looping for years, why was he such a shitty mage?* In other words, why was Zorian able to make it alive past book one?

The likely answer was that RR prioritized something, elsewhere. (We could say he was lazy, but, really, not really)

But what? Well, we know now. While Z&Z honed their personal skills, ignoring politics, albeit, for different reasons, RR did the opposite of that. He somewhat neglected personal growth as a mage to devote more time figuring out continental politics and what strings must be cut to start a new great war.
