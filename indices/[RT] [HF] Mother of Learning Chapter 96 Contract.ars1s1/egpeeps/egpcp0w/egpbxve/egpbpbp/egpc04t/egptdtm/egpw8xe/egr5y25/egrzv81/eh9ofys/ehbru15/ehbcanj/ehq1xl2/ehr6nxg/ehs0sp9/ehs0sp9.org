Setting aside what “most of us” think, sure, yes, I too can imagine worse reveals. Someone completely random would be terrible writing.

The idea that someone else would've been nonsensical and illogical is bizarre, though. For one thing, prior to this chapter, there were lots of perfectly reasonable candidates; the fact that Zach knew nothing about the loop until Zorian helped him figure it out throws a big wrench in that, but it also /makes it way more confusing to figure out how Jornak got into the loop,/ so it's not like this was the more logical result.

I actually still don't know how I was supposed to figure out it was Jornak prior to this chapter, honestly, especially given that everything we thought we knew about how things worked turned out to be wrong. And that's kind of the thing: a result where you can't figure out a mystery ahead of time, based on the same information the characters have, is bad writing even according to the inane rules of “rationalist” fiction!

And changing it wouldn't require making the story worse, what is so hard to understand about this? nobody103 has controlled the /entire story./ He has had the opportunity to foreshadow Jornak since chapter 1, and the right to change the story however he likes to make it work. For example, he easily could've had Zorian discover Veyers' body and Jornak prior to Chapter 26, gone back to talk to Jornak after realizing what had happened with Zach, and then incorporated him into their plans, so that Jornak appeared alongside other characters late in the story.

But he didn't. We met Jornak a single time, discovered that he dislikes Cyoria just about as much as most of the other characters, and was otherwise wholly unremarkable. My problem isn't with the guy himself, my problem is that he wasn't actually set up in a way that makes him a satisfying culprit, and nobody103 had /literal years/ to set it up. Frankly, it's so distasteful, I /still/ hope that it's a fake out.
