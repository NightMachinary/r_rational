  Welp, we come full circle, because now I have no idea what it even means to “make sense” to you.
#+end_quote

Read the last chapter, re-read the story. Maybe 3* isn't enough for you?

#+begin_quote
  Like, when I explain how nobody103 could've easily brought Jornak into the story earlier and made him a more prominent character---why does that not make sense, exactly? It's literally just adding foreshadowing and development to a character we now know to be important to the plot. And that doesn't make sense?
#+end_quote

He was mentioned a long time ago, the link was made.

#+begin_quote
  Seems way more likely you're just being insulting for no reason. For example, I obviously understood Jornak as a distant possibility---I even mention him by name in my own big post on the topic as an anticlimactic choice nobody103 could go with. It's just that given what we knew prior to this chapter, he was /very unlikely/ since the novel had more than implied a) someone had done very sophisticated mind magic on a relatively well-equipped Zach and b) Panaxeth can only talk to people inside the unbarred gate.
#+end_quote

Not being insulting, but you do seem to be struggling with it a lot when it really does make sense.

Idk why you're fixated on "difficult mind magic" - zorian (and Zach) we're both scrubs Pre-loop too. Jornak was an already reasonably experienced adult mage, plus a few months of risky loop growth + Zach helping him out = rapid growth. Him being a lawyer implies he's not an idiot, too.

Plus, what you mean by relatively sophisticated mind magic? Taking a mental sledgehammer to a portion of his memories isn't that sophisticated, it was obvious something was done to him, it wasn't subtle.

#+begin_quote
  The idea that the lawyer friend of a classmate he /actively dislikes/ would get an invite to check out the gate with Zach, and would be so well-trusted that he could do difficult mind magic on an archmage? It's silly.
#+end_quote

Zach doesn't actively dislike Veyers tho? It was quite explicit that Zach befriended him and took him on adventures, you say you've read it 3* but you seem to be missing things like that? How else do you think he also befriended Jornak lol.

#+begin_quote
  Of course, we now just have more questions than answers. If Zach didn't know about the loop, how did Jornak get brought into it? If Zach didn't know about the loop, how did anyone get down to the gate to talk to Panaxeth? These are pretty serious roadblocks to /any/ possible culprit, and we didn't know about any of it until literally a few pages before RR's reveal. So how, exactly, was anyone supposed to figure out what had happened before this chapter? The /only clue/ the book provides is that Jornak doesn't like Cyoria for similar reasons to Zach.
#+end_quote

No, there are no more questions. It's all explained in what we've been given.

Which ass are you pulling Zach not knowing about the loop? It clearly happened after his first loop. Zach isn't mentally handicapped you know? He knew he was looping, hence he, out of boredom, became buds with veyers. He would have worked a lot of stuff out especially with Jornak (being obviously not a dumb guy) helping out too, Jornak seemingly being just as, or more, capable than zorian who even entirely without Zach's help started getting places. So Jornak with Zach acting as a kick starter... Surely that makes sense to you?

Plus given Zach could bring Jornak into the loop, it's clear that pre-zorian and pre-mind sledgehammer, Zach worked out the 5 treasures and either had all or some of them, since he could get Jornak to loop.

He had the crown at least which isn't exactly easy to get since he could place temp markers. So it's not hard to assume he probably had other items too. And significantly more knowledge about the loop than when we first meet him in the story.

Plus it sounds like Zach REALLY liked Jornak, he likely brought things to the looping like some of the other characters where before the crown, they were given a loop primer/their research notes

#+begin_quote
  We never see Zach mention him again, or act friendly toward him, or give any indication of a friendship that was once great enough that he let Jornak get close enough to erase his memory and become his greatest foe?
#+end_quote

Because his memory was sledgehammered?? You seem to be forgetting some fairly major plot points. And there was no further friendship with Jornak because while RR was in the loop Jornak dealt with veyers (and well, was also off doing his own shit being an antagonist), then post-exit, veyers was ejected from the loop so there was no link to become friends with Jornak once veyers was dead.

#+begin_quote
  That's what doesn't make sense to me. But like I said, it's p. clear that we have very different understandings of “sense.”
#+end_quote

Yeah idk, like I keep saying maybe you need to read it all a 4th time?
