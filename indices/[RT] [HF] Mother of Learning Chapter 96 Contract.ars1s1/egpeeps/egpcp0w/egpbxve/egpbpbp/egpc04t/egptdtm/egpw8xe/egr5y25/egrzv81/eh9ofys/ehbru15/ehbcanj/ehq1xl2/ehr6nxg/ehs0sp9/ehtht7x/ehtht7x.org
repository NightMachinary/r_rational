  I actually still don't know how I was supposed to figure out it was Jornak prior to this chapter, honestly, especially given that everything we thought we knew about how things worked turned out to be wrong. And that's kind of the thing:
#+end_quote

I assumed it was Jornak, via the same way zorian reasoned it. It made sense to me a long time ago.

#+begin_quote
  a result where you can't figure out a mystery ahead of time, based on the same information the characters have, is bad writing even according to the inane rules of ‚Äúrationalist‚Äù fiction!
#+end_quote

/You/ can't figure it out. I and lots of others could. It was a pretty popular theory in a lot of past threads.

#+begin_quote
  And changing it wouldn't require making the story worse, what is so hard to understand about this? nobody103 has controlled the /entire story./ He has had the opportunity to foreshadow Jornak since chapter 1, and the right to change the story however he likes to make it work. For example, he easily could've had Zorian discover Veyers' body and Jornak prior to Chapter 26, gone back to talk to Jornak after realizing what had happened with Zach, and then incorporated him into their plans, so that Jornak appeared alongside other characters late in the story.

But that wouldn't have made sense and would have been Terrible writing, so he didn't do it :)

#+begin_quote
  But he didn't. We met Jornak a single time, discovered that he dislikes Cyoria just about as much as most of the other characters, and was otherwise wholly unremarkable. My problem isn't with the guy himself, my problem is that he wasn't actually set up in a way that makes him a satisfying culprit, and nobody103 had /literal years/ to set it up. Frankly, it's so distasteful, I /still/ hope that it's a fake out.

In your opinion ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Fair enough, you don't like it, but it certainly makes sense imo. Definitely satisfying. He's just as unremarkable as Pre-loop Zach+zorian so not sure what you expected. The whole story is relatively normal people becoming not normal through the time loop. It's not a fake out because /that/ doesn't make any sense.
