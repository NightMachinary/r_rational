Depends on the author, and depends on his mood at the time. Up to him to consider it however he wishes, really. In the past, a "ping" like this made him realize a plothole, which he then tried to correct in a later chapter. (Specifically, it was in the first restart that Z&Z interacted with Daimen, before they found the Bakora Gate. Z&Z went in a time dilation chamber, which meant that their simulacrums disappeared, and they theoretically had lost their method of travel to Koth. In a later chapter, after it was brought to his attention, the author decided to include a paragraph about how Zorian had taught Daimen the Gate spell beforehand.)

If Zorian /doesn't/ bring up that tidbit of his conversation with an angel (and I'd be surprised if RR and Quatach's agents didn't already know that they went to a temple to communicate with an angel), then I'd be curious to know why. Whatever the author does with this comment of mine is entirely up to him.
