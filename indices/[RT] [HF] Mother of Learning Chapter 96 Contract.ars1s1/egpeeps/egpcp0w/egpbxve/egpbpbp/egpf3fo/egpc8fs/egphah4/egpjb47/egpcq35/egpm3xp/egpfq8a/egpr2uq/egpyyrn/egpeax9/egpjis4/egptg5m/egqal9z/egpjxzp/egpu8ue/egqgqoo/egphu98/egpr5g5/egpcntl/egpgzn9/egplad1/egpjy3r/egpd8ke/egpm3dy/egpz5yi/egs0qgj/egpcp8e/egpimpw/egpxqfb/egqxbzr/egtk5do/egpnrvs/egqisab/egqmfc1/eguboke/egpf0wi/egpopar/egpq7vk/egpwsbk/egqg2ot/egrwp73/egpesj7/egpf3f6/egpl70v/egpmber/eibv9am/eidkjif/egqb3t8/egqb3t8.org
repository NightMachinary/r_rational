I really hope nobody doesn't go with the rational answer of red robe being jornak. There is still a chance it's fortov and I hope that is the case. It would be really Shakespearean in the final battle where red robe and zorian clash only for zorian to read jornak's memories from his dying body and figure out it was fortov all along.
