It's a mistake I've caught myself making at times, to base an argument on the things that would convince me rather than things that would convince my debate partner. Note that Jornak doesn't open with the corruption of the world's governments, he opens with "the last guy who used the gate shaped the world to his will however he pleased, why can't we do that?".

Jornak wants power. Anything else he says is just an excuse.
