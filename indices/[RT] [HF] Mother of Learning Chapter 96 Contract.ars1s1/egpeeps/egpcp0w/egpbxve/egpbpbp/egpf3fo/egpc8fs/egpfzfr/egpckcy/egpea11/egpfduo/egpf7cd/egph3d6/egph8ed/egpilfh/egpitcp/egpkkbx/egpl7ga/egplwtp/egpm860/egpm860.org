The time loop would probably have the contingencies as whoever made the time loop spent too much time to getting things accurate. But since the time loop resets instead of setting off the contingencies, the reset is the time loop version of the contingency as it would waste less power and would have the same functional result in that the Controller would die either way. Assuming that the same triggers for the reset are the same as the contingencies, any way to prevent them from triggering in the time loop would work in the real world.
