Kinda lame you putting down theories when you didn't even guess this one.

Anyway imo pretty lazy ending to what could've been a potentially interesting plot line. "Oh it was jornak! Ofcourse!"

But I guess it was rational that there was no ultimate reveal because it's much better to be dry and uninteresting. Anyway hopefully not every threads get tied up like this as I'd think it'd be a weak finish overall.
