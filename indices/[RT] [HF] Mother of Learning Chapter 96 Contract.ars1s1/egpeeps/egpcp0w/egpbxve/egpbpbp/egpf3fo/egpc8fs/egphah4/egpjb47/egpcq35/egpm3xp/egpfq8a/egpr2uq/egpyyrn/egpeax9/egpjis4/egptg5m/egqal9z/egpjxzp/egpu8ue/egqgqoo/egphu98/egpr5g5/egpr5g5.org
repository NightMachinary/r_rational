That angel gave them clear hints how to save Zack. -The contract will dissolve at the end of the month. -They will not attack them even if Zack evades the contract. -Zorian confirmed that it all depends Zack' perception, and not how things really are.

So, all the need is that Zorian wipes or changes Zack's memories, or everyone in known will fake their deaths. As long as Zack honestly believes that they are dead/mindwiped, then everything will be solved.
