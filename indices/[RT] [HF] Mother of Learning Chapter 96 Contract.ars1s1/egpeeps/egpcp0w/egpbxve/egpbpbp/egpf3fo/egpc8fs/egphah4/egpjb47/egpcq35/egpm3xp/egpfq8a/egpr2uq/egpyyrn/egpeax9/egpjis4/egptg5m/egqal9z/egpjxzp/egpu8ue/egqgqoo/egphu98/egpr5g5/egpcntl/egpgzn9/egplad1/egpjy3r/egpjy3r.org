From a purely "I want to survive the month" point of view, why would ZZ accept the terms of Jornak, and leave Team RR alone?? Someone else starting a Splinter War does not trigger any of the conditons in the contract with the angels. Also, if Team RR starts a Splinter war, the various countries would start amassing their resources towards the war, and which would make it more difficult for Team RR to work towards releasing Panaxeth, as ZZ can just go to the authorities at that point to reveal the invasion plot.

Also, if RR can start the Splinter Wars without releasing Panaxeth, and in a much easier fashion as it has been implied, QI could just use that path to satisfy his goals. QI wouldn't need to then release Panaxeth - only RR and Silverlake would need to. Starting a Splinter war would fragment Team RR.

Thus, any moves by RR to start a Splinter War will only make his position weaker (as he is less likely to be able to release Panaxeth). The only thing RR is counting on is the reluctance of ZZ to let so many people die. I love how this conversation is even more Do or Die for RR than it is for ZZ - probably why RR requested for it in the first place.

Apologies if I have forgotten any basic facts - it is early morning here :)
