Heh, same. I still don't think it's a bad theory based on the information we knew at the time; a lot of things that invalidated the Zorian!RR theory were literally learned this chapter, like the fact that Zach never knew about the time loop to begin with.

Honestly, Jornak as RR is boring to me. It's a character who wasn't introduced until long after RR left the loop and I'm not sure it was possible to figure out prior to this chapter. At the same time, it's also exactly the first person you'd check after Veyers, so not exactly the sneakiest solution, either.

That's mostly sour grapes though. At least now I can enjoy the rest of the book without distraction.
