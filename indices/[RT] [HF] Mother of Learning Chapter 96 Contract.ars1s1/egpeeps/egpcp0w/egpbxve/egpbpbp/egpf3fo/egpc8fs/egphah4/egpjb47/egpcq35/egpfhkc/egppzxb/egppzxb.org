Not sure what nobody's take on romance in this story is but I saw Raynie as the likely candidate once outside of the time loop. Just the personal connection that both Zorian and her had in regards to their family dynamics. Plus, when Zorian saw that he was becoming close to Raynie he decided he was going to stop doing so with her while he could abuse the time loop and I believe he ended the relationship while thinking that he wished he could help her situation. So I'm half-expecting some developments in regards to that though it would be kind of silly considering the impending doom hanging over their heads.
