Ah, ignore that; it's not a danger to Zach but still sitting behind the wraith bombs in threat level. If it does happen, I wonder how effective it would be to shift the blame onto the Ulquaan Ibasa invaders who are going to blatantly attack Cyoria. There probably wouldn't be as much political paranoia of who perpetrated the murders, but autocracies and oligarchies are notoriously volatile when power changes hands.
