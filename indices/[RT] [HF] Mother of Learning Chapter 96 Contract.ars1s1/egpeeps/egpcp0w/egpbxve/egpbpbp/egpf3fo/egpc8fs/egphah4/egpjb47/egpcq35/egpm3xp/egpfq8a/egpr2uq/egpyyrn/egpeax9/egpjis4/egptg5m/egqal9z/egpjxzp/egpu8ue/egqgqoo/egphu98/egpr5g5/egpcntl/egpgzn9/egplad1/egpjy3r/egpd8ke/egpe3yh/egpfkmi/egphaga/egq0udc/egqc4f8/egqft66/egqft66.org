(Fortov is a Primordial who's managed to deceive the gods by assuming a human persona; Damien is actually one of the gods who tried to track down Primordial-Fortov but then lost his memories in an accident. Chapter 101 will be the showdown between those two godly beings and it will be resolved by the power of familial love, i.e. by Kirielle.)
