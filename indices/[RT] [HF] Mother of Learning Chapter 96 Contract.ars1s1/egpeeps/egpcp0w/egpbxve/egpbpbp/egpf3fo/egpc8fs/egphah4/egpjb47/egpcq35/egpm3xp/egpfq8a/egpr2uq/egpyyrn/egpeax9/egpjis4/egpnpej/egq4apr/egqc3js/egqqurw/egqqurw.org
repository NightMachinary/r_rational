Good point. Zach and Zorian can argue for not one but two drawbacks to Jornak and Silverlake if Pan is released.

One is the altruistic point that the world will be basically destroyed by the countermeasures if Pan is released. This may work better on QI, maybe on Jornak (depends on whether he is lying about wanting to make the world better), probably not much for Silverlake if she thinks she can hide in a bunker and survive by herself.

Second is that the angels will be free to act if Pan is released and will almost certainly kill Jornak, Silverlake, and QI for releasing Pan or for knowing about the time loop. That, of course, puts Jornak and Silverlake in a tough spot, since they have a soul contract to die if Pan is /not/ released. But maybe they can be persuaded that their chances of survival are better if they work with Zach and Zorian to try to find a loophole in their contract.

Either way, I think QI should be the easiest to convince. Maybe the thing to do is for Zach and Zorian to approach QI alone and turn him, and then get QI to try to persuade Jornak and Silverlake.
