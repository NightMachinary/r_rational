Ah, no, I forgot about the discussion around Zach being brought into the loop through a dream contract. Yeah the Zach theory is probably dead.

The reason I was unhappy with giving it up was if RR is just Some Guy, then a lot of what looked like interesting foreshadowing and set-up just becomes...pointless? I wasn't really all that certain I'd be right, but I did expect more then...this. The stuff with Zach's Mind Blank was also resolved recently, then immediately changed from an inescapable fate to another thing on Zorian's list of problems to tick off. Like, the iterative problem solving and slice of life was fun, but seeing how the author pulled the themes together and brought us to an interesting and powerful conclusion was my primary motivation to read for years. The fact it was matching a number of Time Braid's story beats further suggested the villain would be someone relevant. But instead if it's an unknown who's motivation is "the world is rotten to the core and must be purged" and Zach's mystery is "Zorian needs to spend some time analysing a legal contract" then the story probably won't do anything like that. For me, the story has lost something from this reveal instead of gained.

I'll have some hope there's actually a pay-off to all this, because if there isn't I'd have no motivation to read any more and be sad at all the wasted narrative potential.
