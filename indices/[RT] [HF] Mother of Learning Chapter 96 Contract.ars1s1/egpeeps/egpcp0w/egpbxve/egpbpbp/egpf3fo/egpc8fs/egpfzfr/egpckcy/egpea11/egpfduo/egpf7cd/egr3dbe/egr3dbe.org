The angels stated that what happens in Black Rooms etc is invisible to them, which indicates it's likely invisible to the policies as well. If they could place the cage opening inside some sealed space they might be able to open it without breaking the contract. One problem is opening the cage requires the blood sacrifices, which I don't think ZnZ would be cool with facilitating.
