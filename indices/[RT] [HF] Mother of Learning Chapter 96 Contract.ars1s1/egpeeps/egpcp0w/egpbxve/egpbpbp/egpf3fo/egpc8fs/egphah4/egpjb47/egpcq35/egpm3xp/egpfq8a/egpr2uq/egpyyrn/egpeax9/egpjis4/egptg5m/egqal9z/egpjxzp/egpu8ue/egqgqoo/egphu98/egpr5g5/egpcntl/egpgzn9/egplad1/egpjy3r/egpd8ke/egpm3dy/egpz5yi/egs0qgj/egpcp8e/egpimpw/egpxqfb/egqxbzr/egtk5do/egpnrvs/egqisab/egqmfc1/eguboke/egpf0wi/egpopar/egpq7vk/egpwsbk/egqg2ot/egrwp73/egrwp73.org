I hope Z&Z don't give in to their threats, because there's no guarantee or incentive that RR would keep his word. He's either going to use the wraith bombs now, while Z&Z are free to run around and stop them, or in the final battle when they are all tied up in the fight. There's just no reason to not use the wraith bombs now that they are already made. Plus RR already stabbed Zach in the back once, he clearly doesn't place a lot of value on being trustworthy.
