So... QI knows about the time loop. And is aware that he will have to fight against probable-archmages, and won't allow the ground to be prepared ahead of time. Z&Z vs. RR and Silverlake in a more or less straight fight is such a sure thing that I'm not even going to bother placing odds on Z&Z losing, but QI changes things substantially. That angel will probably be necessary against whatever things QI will prepare, especially since Silverlake has up to date information on Z&Z's abilities and normal countermeasures against QI.
