Personally I'm sticking with "Simu!Zach is RR" since Jornak is a "mechanically feasible" but boring result. No pathos, no difference if he'd been unmasked far earlier, and his identity has zero relevance once revealed. He's just "some guy".

Everything that's happened is still consistent with the Zach theory, including his rant about how similar him and Zach are, but Zach refusing to see how they must purge the world.

Still, the Jornak thing ties up loose ends enough I won't feel like the author has dropped the ball if it's true. I'll be satisfied with the story as a whole.

But I do think it's unlikely.

(Also what is with so many people being smug about this?)
