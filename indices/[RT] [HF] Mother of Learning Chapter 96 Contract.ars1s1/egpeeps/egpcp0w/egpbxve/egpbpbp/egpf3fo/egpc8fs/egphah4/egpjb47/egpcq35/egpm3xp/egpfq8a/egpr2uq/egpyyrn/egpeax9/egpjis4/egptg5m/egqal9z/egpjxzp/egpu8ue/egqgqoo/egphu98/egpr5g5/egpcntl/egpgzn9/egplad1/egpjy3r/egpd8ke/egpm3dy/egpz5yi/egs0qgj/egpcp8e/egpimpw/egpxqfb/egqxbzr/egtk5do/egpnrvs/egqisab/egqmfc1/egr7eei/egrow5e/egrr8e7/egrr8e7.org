It's pretty much impossible to make him think they're dead, when there's a very high chance they'll all be fighting together before the end of the month. Not much time for detailed mind editing, whereas it's more feasible to edit out the awareness beforehand so they can still work together. It'd be a major hit to coordination though.

Isn't that really just betting on the author pulling out a let's-kill-everybody-inconvenient deus ex machina so the ending can be tied off in a neat little package? If I were Z or Z, I don't think I'd rely on those astronomically low odds to pull through...
