It seems worth pointing out that Oganj, that dragon mage Zach wasted dozens of restarts to kill way back, was said to have a group. MoL's worldbuilding material noted that dragons are highly solitary creatures, which contributes to the reasons why dragon magic is difficult to pass from dragon to dragon.

If Oganj has a group, that seems to mean one of two things: one, he's an exception who has other dragons at his beck and call, or two, he has some assortment of underlings whether animal, monster or human that serve him. None of the previous chapters alluded to either being the case, I think, but maybe Zach would know more and will explain next chapter.
