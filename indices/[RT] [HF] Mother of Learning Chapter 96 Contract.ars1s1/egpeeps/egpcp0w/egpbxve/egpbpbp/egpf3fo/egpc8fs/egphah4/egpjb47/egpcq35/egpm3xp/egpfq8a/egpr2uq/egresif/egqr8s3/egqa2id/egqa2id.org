Idk, the emotional stakes of the story is gone now though. Every new reveal will just be an asspull. So they'll have to build on what's there and I never cared for Zach to care if he lived or died as he was, at least if there was tension if due to evil zorian/zach then it'd make it interesting. I think the ending will go down with a whimper.
