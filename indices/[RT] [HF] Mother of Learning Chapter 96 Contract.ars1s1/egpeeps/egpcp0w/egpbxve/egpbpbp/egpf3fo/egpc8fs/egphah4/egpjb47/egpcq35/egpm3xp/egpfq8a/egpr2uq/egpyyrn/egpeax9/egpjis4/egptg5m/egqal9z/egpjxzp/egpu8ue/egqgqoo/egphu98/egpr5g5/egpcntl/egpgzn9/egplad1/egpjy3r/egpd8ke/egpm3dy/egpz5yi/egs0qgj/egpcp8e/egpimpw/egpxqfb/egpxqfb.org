I hoped that contract would clear something. It didn't. We still don't know it's full text, but we got some angelic summary that I assume is more or less true. I'm very confused about what is angels goal.

Implied goal is “to stop anybody but Zach to know about time loop”.

Implied method is “Zach will die, if anybody know about time loop at the end of the month”.

So, from angels perspective:

What is stopping Zach from telling everybody about time-loop on the first day of new month ?

Why is Zach self-policing on the pain of death more likely to succeed that just banning Zach from talking about time loop when he is back from it ? Or all the time ? You can argue that this would limit his options, but they don't have problem with banning mind and soul magic, a much bigger obstruction.

So, what angels goal here ? No idea. But it doesn't seem to be stated goal.

​

Additional observation (may or may not be related to above):

Angels can clearly lie (or say things that are not technically true, or be imprecise to the point that they are saying something really misleading), as :

“He cannot let anyone know about existence of the time loop or he'll die at the end of the month. “

Is not like this obligation was described before, this imply that Zach will die if anybody “knows about existence of time loop” regardless of when that occur. So Zach fate would be sealed as soon as he told about time loop to first person in the time loop. And this seems to hold true in any reasonable definition of “knows about existence of time loop” that still would kill Zach if anybody knows about time loop at the end of the month.
