This is still all pretty weak sauce, and requires us to a) guess that the culprit wasn't introduced until /Chapter 75/ and b) Zorian's guess regarding the motives the /first time he investigates the issue/ was correct, as well as c) Zach was lying about his contract and knew nothing about the time loop.

Where's the thematic part here, BTW? I can think of a half-dozen characters who could provide the whole “turns out anyone can become evil” angle better and more surprisingly---who doesn't already assume that lawyers have the capacity for evil, after all, especially one we /know/ to be involved with an evil cult? And that's all you get from Jornak; you don't get the familial struggle you'd have with Fortov, or a more dramatic reveal and interpersonal conflict you'd get with Alanic, Xvim, or Taiven. And none of those really drive home the theme like Zorian as RR would've done.
