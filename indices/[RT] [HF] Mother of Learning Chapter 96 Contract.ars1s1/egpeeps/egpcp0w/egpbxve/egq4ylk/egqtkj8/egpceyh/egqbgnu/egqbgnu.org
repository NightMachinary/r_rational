I actually think they were fairly reasonable. Zach screwed up his agreement and enabled a copy (it was established that the time loop people weren't considered independent people until after more than 1 month) to murder it's original. They are willing to hunt him down if he finds a way to cheat on the deal and are willing to give him some leniency if he does what they want.
