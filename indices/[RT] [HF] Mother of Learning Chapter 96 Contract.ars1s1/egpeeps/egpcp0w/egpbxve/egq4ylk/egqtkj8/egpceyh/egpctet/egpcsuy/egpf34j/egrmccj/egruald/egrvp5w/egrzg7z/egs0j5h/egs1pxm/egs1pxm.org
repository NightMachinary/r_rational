Are you suggesting that before, during the age of the gods, there wasn't just the gods but access to other parts of the universe where the gods lived that now is impossible? Because I don't know of any mention of such a thing existing. And only if access to such a realm beyond for mortals existed is there any differentiation between the two scenarios you mentioned.
