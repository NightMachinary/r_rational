Well, what do you mean by "simulation" exactly? The loop was certainly a reproduction, but it wasn't fake in any way. Every atom in it was real and every creature in it was a full fleshy living thinking creature. Technically every loop ending was a catastrophe of incomparable proportions.

Are you saying the gods still exist in a "real world" and that the world the main characters live in is a reproduction. Or are you saying that the world of the characters is not physically real?
