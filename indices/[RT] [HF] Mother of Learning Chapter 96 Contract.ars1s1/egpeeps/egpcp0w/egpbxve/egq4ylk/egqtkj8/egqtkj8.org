The only other person we know of with an angelic contract is IQ. Hes not exactly alive. I wonder if he became a lich to get out of his contract and keep his mana reserve. Not saying Zach is going to become a lich, but maybe temporarily dead.

Or he just dies in the final battle, but they are able to resuscitate him.
