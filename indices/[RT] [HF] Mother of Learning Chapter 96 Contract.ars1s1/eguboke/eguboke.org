Yes! I guessed Red Robe's identity right!

So the time loop wasn't a divine contingency, it was the Angels' attempt to stop the contingency from triggering.

At least Zach's situation looks slighty better now, since he doesn't have to go against the Angels.

I wonder how the "don't kill the ruler of any nation"/ "don't cause anarchy" rule will come into play.

So what was Zach's goal inside the time loop? Stopping invasion by itself would be poinless, since it is not real. Learning how to stop the invasion would also be impossible, because in the real world it will play out diffirently because of Demons.
