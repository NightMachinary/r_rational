I think it's unfair to Zorian to say he only became a good person because of the soul blending. He risked his life to save Zach's in the very first loop. He was surly sure, and he definitely had the potential to go down a bad path, but he wasn't a bad person. I think the soul bond had very little influence on his personality and it was more Zach's commentary on him that forced himself to reevaluate after he realized how others saw him.
