He's calculative and manipulative person and can kill other people with ease if really want to. QI come from an age where it was quite normal to round up all the mages and combat-capable men in a conquered town and mount their severed heads on pikes just outside the city walls as a warning to all who would dare defy you. and he find modern sentimentality in regards to war casualties insincere, hypocritical and faintly disgusting. He still use that same barbaric thing in Necromantic War & Splinter War, I don't know what it's if not psychopathic tendencies. Most of modern people didn't have that kind of mindset. I just said Zorian can be potentially to be bad person if he doesn't have compassion and morality.
