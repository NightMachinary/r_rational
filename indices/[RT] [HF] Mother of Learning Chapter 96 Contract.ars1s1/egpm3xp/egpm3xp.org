Facts we know:

- Some parts of the contract are enforced by Zach's perceptions. If he doesn't know who is fucking with his memories, he won't go after them.
- Black rooms / time loops prevent the divine from peeking in.
- The contract, whether Zach dies or not, ends at the end of the month.

So here's my guess how Zorian is going to 'cheat' the contract: After they prevent the summoning (fulfilling the bits of the contract the Angels seem to 'care' about), they go down into the Black Room underneath town. Inside, they have a month of free time while a small amount of time (I think it was a day?) passes outside. Crucially, have this day span the end of the contract. Inside, Zorian erases Zach's knowledge of who knows about the time loop, his knowledge of Zorian knowing mind magic, and his memory of being tampered with.

Basically, my thinking is the trigger for the 'kill Zach' clause can only come from two sources: the Angels or Zach himself. If you block both at the same time, then the contract is done with, and once you emerge from the Black Room, Zach is fine. For extra insurance, Zorian lies to Zach and tells him that it was going into the Black Room that solved the problem, so that he doesn't even suspect that any memory altering took place.

Of course, all this depends on them actually preventing the summoning, but they were already planning for that, so the stakes are still the same.

Incidentally, the fact that the contract that Silverlake is under works even if the summoning fails (and thus she's in a different dimension that the contract holder) suggests she's also self-triggering. Maybe you could convince her to switch sides with that knowledge?
