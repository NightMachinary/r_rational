Keep in mind this's just speculation and assumption.

The key to start this discussion is from this senteces.

Ø *"It is a secret,"* the angel responded**. "There were considerable restrictions in regards to candidates. They had to begin the month in Cyoria. They needed to have a certain potential and mentality. They needed to have considerable freedom of movement and association. They needed to satisfy the ethical guidelines. And so much more. I cannot tell you the details." (MoL chapter 96)**

*Ø* *“Heavens no,"* the angel said. *"He (Zorian) fails just about every criteria, especially in regards to mentality. I am surprised he was even willing to risk his life in this manner, based on his previous actions and attitudes."(MoL chapter 96)*

So at the first restart when Zorian still not gain the Marker, he was introduced as whiny, edgy teenager who thought like world owe him big debt for every bad thing that befall upon him, worse parents, worse siblings especialy Daimen, and uncontrol empath ability that make him unstable. Zorian is smart, studious, and person with highly work ethic and spark of talent in some field of disciplines.What if He start as looper with temporary marker and retain his knowledge across restart instead got original marker from Zach ?

Now take those qualities into consoderation and imagine with me, will you ? What could happen to him and what high end feat he could be ?. I mayself imagine he will corrupted by watching people doing wrong and immoral action across restart and knowing how corrupt Nation authorities can be especialy Eldemar, and thinking it's common sense of human nature to do horrible thing just for power.

Once Zorian start wrong doing he will continue do that until he start disregard about human right just to pursue magical knowledge. Looking how Jornak end up as Red Robe and with his experience in Time Loop and set him as exemple I won't suprised if Zorian become far worse than RR as ultra extreme mind mage, full pleged Necromancer, and top blood mage as demon summoner. The reason, Zorian is a kid and kid can be influenced and change personality and prespective much faster than adult. That's end of my assumption about Bad Ending or Dark Zorian could be.

Now we start the reason why a whiny and edgy teenager Zorian end up to be moral and compassion person. I take Soul Bond, Lukav assumtion, and Shifter ritual to boost my assumption in this theory.

Ø Soul bonds were a dangerous and poorly understood branch of magic, capable of causing some pretty horrifying side effects if used recklessly. The main issue was

that one of the participants usually started to mentally and spiritually dominate the other, *making them more like themselves in mind and soul*. (Zorian monologue, page 164 MoL ebook)

Ø Your soul appears to be converting it into just another piece of itself rather than trying to keep it distinct. So there shouldn't be any major personality shifts and you probably won't get any nifty abilities from whomever or whatever it was that donated a part of their soul to you. Though, *I guess it is possible that the fragment had affected your personality to an extent* when you first got it, before your soul had the chance to assimilate it sufficiently, and such influences may linger still.(Luka Assumption, page 468 MoL ebook)

Ø Being a *shifter means you get instincts from the other part of the soul*, and magical creatures always have very strong souls. . . the more magical the creature, the stronger. And they tend to be extremely violent and territorial. With regards to grey hunters, I'm fairly certain they don't tolerate even their own kind, much less anything else.(Kael warning about becoming a shifter, page 591 MoL ebook)

Those theory make assumption that gaining other people/being soul that connected to your soul will inlfluences your personality. Zach is compassion, moral and upright standing person and in this regard the similliar character like Zach is Naruto. Zorian gain a chunk of Zach soul make him inherited that qualities like Zach, that is core reason Zarion personality become good. Time loop further enchance this qualities, in the time loop Zorian start befriend with other people like Zach, Kael, Alanic, Xvim and his other classmates, and that friendship experience make him to be Lawful Good person, with his empath ability in control make him less jerk .
