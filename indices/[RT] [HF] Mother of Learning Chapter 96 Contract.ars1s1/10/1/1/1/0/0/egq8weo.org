  QI come from an age where it was quite normal to round up all the mages and combat-capable men in a conquered town and mount their severed heads on pikes just outside the city walls as a warning to all who would dare defy you.

That's about the age he comes from not about him.

I don't remember this exactly, can you tell me what you are talking about?

  He still use that same barbaric thing in Necromantic War & Splinter War, I don't know what it's if not psychopathic tendencies.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure what exactly you're referring to about what he did? Barbaric != psychopathic.

#+begin_quote
  Most of modern people didn't have that kind of mindset.

  I just said Zorian can be potentially to be bad person if he doesn't have compassion and morality.

A -> B, and C -> B does not mean B -> C. If you find Qi to be bad, and psychopath to be bad then that does not mean Qi is a psychopath. Evidence of Qi being bad is not evidence of him being a psychopath.

Qi may be harsh, may be vicious, may have outdated sentimentalities, but he has shown traits like caring about his people that make psychopath not quite what he is.
