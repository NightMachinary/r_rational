So, new questions about this:

- In what way would the 'scorched earth' method affect the angels that they would intervene without the highest ones permissions?
- It seems that the time loop is kinda an event horizon, no information can ever escape, not even to the spiritual world. Given that, and that the cage was connected to the time loop and the real world, how would the triggers react if Px was released in the time loop? I mean, we could release it there and then destroy it/let it expire and it wouldn't affect the real world.
- If the above is possible without triggering, would other conditions analogous to Px being out of the cage (ie. mana levels dropping drastically, the Cyoria dungeon/hole disappearing) but not on the real world activate?
- "Oganj and his group" does he means other dragons?
- How the heck did Jornak figure out that Zack was under a contract if a) he didn't even know, b) it seems to require a adept divine mage to even try to pry into the contract/blessing thing, much less reading it? (btw, the angel saying the "figured it out" should ring several alarms about the abilities of Jornak)
