Loving how consistently well the characters are written. We finally meet angels and they have an agenda, which they are using reasonable means to try and achieve. No character is evil for no reason, no character has purely altruistic motives. Gotta admit though, that initial method of initiating the contract is sketchy as hell.

Bit of a curiosity, angels are surprisingly bad judges of character. Zorian in a lot of ways is a perfect fit. It is interesting that they seem to only accept an underdog hero as an acceptable archetype.
