Except the deal was given in a semi-lucid scenario, which could get almost anyone to agree. The mind magic being restricted part though is entirely valid, but its also not the reasons the Angel used as a counter argument. In terms of mana reserves, zorian with above average reserves would be scary. Remember the main barrier to him learning new things as he can only try things so many times due to his low reserves. Zach was good, but Zorians rate of learning was nothing if not fantastic give his base reserves.
