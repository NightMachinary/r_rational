The angel's foresight seems limited. It's not really possible to predict that Zorian would go through such a drastic change in personality in the time loop especially considering his strange entry method. Besides from a potential perspective he kind of sucks. Even with a divine blessing he'd have merely above average Mana reserves and still be lower than Zach. On top of that Zach was restricted on the type of mind magic he could learn, if it was Zorian who was the main looper it would be absolutely crippling. Zorian is also extremely paranoid, he would have never agreed to any shadey dream deal. I think the angel's assessment of preloop Zorian is pretty accurate.
