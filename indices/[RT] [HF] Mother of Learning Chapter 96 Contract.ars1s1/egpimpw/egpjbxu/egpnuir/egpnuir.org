Zach killed Oganj after several suicidal restarts. I doubt he relishes fighting him again, help or no help.

Fighting the Violet eyed Disaster (the dragon with the staff) took a lot of effort with their full crew. I'd say it was nearly as much work as fighting Quatach-Ichl.

Fighting Quatach-Ichl and Oganj, with Red Robe (Jornak), & Silverlake as support, seems beyond their abilities without something to tip the balance in their favor.
