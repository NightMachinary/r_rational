Although mind wiping Zach seems like the obvious solution, I don't think it'll Pam out like that. Initially I thought Zorian might leave some memory packets in Zack of all his memories in the time loop (plus anyone that they tell). They wouldn't even have to put them in zach's soul I guess. Then Zach just has to guide him into learning min magic with the Aracnea. Though, this could also have gotten Zorian out of the loop, so this is probably unlikely. Zorian is big b in trying to recreate things that no man can. Like a portable pslace, or a soul cage, and so on. Thus I think he's gonna find a way to copy souls. Then Zach could feasibly have a copied soul without a contract/dI vine soul cage, or Zorian and anyone that knows about the time loop could be 'copied ' souls. They would have to kill their current souls though. Then as soon as the month is iver, just put their soils right back in their bodies.
