Except, I did, to the extent the provided evidence made it possible. There was no clue that indicated it was Jornak specifically, and not, say head of the House Boranova, and guessing blindly is not in the spirit of this subreddit. This is not a place for D+D=T.

We knew RR had to be a cultist (this excluded Zach), he had to be a middling mage (excluded Veyers, Damien), we knew he had to have a soul (excluded simulacra), and we had a very strong suspicion that he had to be connected to Veyers (but it was not certain, soulkill could have been a clever red herring).
