I think they missed a big chance to ask for help with getting around the primordial's contract with Silverlake and RR. If they could offer Silverlake survival without releasing the primordial then she would almost certainly join them. RR would be a question mark (at the time they contacted the angel) but still worth a shot.

Maybe the primordial contract is similar enough to the angel contract that no real help could be given, but maybe not. It was certainly worth asking.
