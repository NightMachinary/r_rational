The more I think about it, I think the Jornak=RR reveal might be more Thematic (TM) and less inelegant than I gave it credit for originally.

  I'm guessing Veyers introduced you to Zach, and you hit it off with each other since you have both been cheated out of your inheritance and empathized with each other because of it

This is the emotional core of it, I think. In Chapter 75, when Jornak was first introduced, we learn his story. He had his inheritance stolen from him and he empathized with Veyers. So, duh, Zach meets Jornak, they "hit it off" as Zorian says, because Jornak empathizes in exactly the same way. We know Zach had been talking to lawyers about what to do with his situation, so it's not unreasonable that he'd come across Jornak.

(It would be really neat to get an interlude where we see them meet, start looping together and eventually turn against each other...)

  Have you two ever tried to look into what our country has been doing these past few years?" Red Robe said, looking at Zorian. "I just wanted to figure out how to ensure justice for me and Zach at first. However, I couldn't stop myself from looking... and the more I looked, the more awful things I found. The prosperity we enjoy right now is all built atop of mountain of lies, theft, unspeakable corruption and even straight up murder. Even if I got justice for myself and Zach, it's all just a drop in the bucket.

At one point, Zorian even suspects Zach as the enemy on account of Zach having reason to hate the Establishment because they stood by and did nothing while Zach was robbed by everything. Jornak is actually Zach's character foil here. Zach didn't fall like Zorian suspected, but Jornak did.
