One of the things about the loop is that it restarted if the primordal ever got. There's no reason for this to be a condition unless activating the contingencies was too expensive in divine power to recreate constantly. As a result, the restart is like a simulation to functionally recreate the results of the contingencies without wasting divine energy. When Z&Z broke open the cage, they placed it in layers of pocket dimensions in order not to trigger the reset. Functionally, those layers could be used to prevent the contingencies from tripping.
