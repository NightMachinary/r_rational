I just thought of a loophole that involves mindwiping.

Zorian asked the angel about what constitutes "knowing about the time loop". He also confirmed that Zach won't kill him if Zach doesn't know that Zorian is a master mind mage.

Maybe Zorian will make Zach forget that Zorian is a mind mage, and Zach will erase Zorian's knowledge of the time loop (according to the contract). Once it's safe, Zorian can remove any memory wipes.
