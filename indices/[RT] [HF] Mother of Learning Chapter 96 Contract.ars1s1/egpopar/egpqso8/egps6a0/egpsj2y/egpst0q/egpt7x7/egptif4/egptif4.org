I think you are underselling angel. Its powerful enough to impress QI so much that he have full confidence in them solving the crisis he is going to create. It was nvr stated what rank of angels QI witness but i doubt a single high ranking angel is on the same level as a archmage. Throughout the whole story gods and angels are described as power on another level from mortals. It will be really disappointing if QI and co. can even harm an angel.
