I think it's interesting to think about the challenges of writing a solid mystery setup-reveal in a rational story of this nature.

Zorian is very intelligent. He always makes the obvious logical leaps. Furthermore, the story is entirely from Zorian's POV. If we (the readers) have the information to deduce who RR is, then Zorian does too, and he'll probably figure it out. In this case, there were several plausible candidates (Veyers, Jornak, Sudomir) but without the full picture it was impossible to guess who, especially without knowing what sort of person Jornak would become when exposed to the time loop.*

What's the solution to this? How does one make a mystery in a rational story than the protagonist doesn't crack open as soon as the readers have everything they need? (As I'm trying to write my own story with smart protagonists and mystery elements, this something I have to think about.)

One solution is to make the solution solvable using Doylist reasoning and Themes. If you think about it, all the plausible solutions fell into two camps. Watsonian-reasonable answers (Veyers, Jornak, Sudomir) and Doylist-reasonable thematic answers (Zach simulacrum, Fortov, Daimen (he was a popular guess before he showed up in-story, I think?)). Zorian had basically no way of guessing any of those latter possibilities, especially since most of them required some apparent rule of the story to be broken (which was definitely possible, since Zorian was learning new things about the nature of the time-loop and recontextualizing things all the time) but they were still possible for the audience to guess.

(I'm sure reasonable people will disagree on the extent to which the latter type of mystery has a place in rational fic.)

Anyway, I think since it went the less-thematic route, it feels less narratively satisfying. To be fair, it /does/ work very well on the logical level. "RR has some relation to Veyers but is not Veyers, and also Veyers interacts with Zach near the beginning and would notice Jornak acting oddly" seems so obvious in retrospect that you almost feel dumb. This is a key ingredient of a great mystery reveal, yet somehow it still lacks a punch. (Although, again, some people might argue that it's rational to feel obvious and anti-climactic.) So it's not obvious what the author should have differently to give it more punch. Presumably, he was planning RR=Jornak from the beginning and he misfired in the setup, either by not anticipating the degree of importance that the fandom would place on the RR mystery, or by not making Jornak stand out enough.

(*) TBH, "The Jornak that Zorian had known was a nervous, risk-averse man [...] This was just one more proof that the time loop was capable of radically changing a person. For better or for worse." is a bit of a cop-out. A /little/ bit of foreshadowing of what sort of man Jornak could have become would be nice.
