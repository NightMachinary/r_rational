[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a7vk5w/mother_of_learning_who_is_red_robe/ec63iru][2 months ago]] I felt it was more and more popular that Jornak was RR. So it's been coming for a while.. You're right that it breaks the classic rules, but plays on that trope that someone we know IS the villain. And as time went on, we learnt about Zach's inheritance, and as we learnt more about the society of Altazia... Jornak's inclusion starts making more sense. Plus, Veyers was set up from the very beginning so it was I think that counts a little!

Well, it first shows the good nature of Zach. Zach's inheritance was stolen too, but he didn't use this opportunity to destroy the city and the government. Jornak just shows you what is possible.

I dunno, I still want to know what Ibery's deal is, lol. And also the headmaster. Plus, Alanic's background. But yeah, the main issue was RR. And as ZnZ became so strong, RR was just not strong enough to matter. He needed Silverlake's information to understand how exactly he's fucked, and QI to back him up. So Jornak hasn't been the issue for a while now. It's the combination of what SL, QI, and RR will do that's the key.
