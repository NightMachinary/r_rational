It's an interesting interpretation. It still seems like such an easy exploit and it's not like the gods didn't know about those kind of chambers when they made it. And that's assuming the contract was even made way back then, which I don't think is the case. I think the contract was made recently by the angels and only made divine by some divine artifact (as some other poster theorised) and I just can't imagine them overlooking something that simple, especially considering how the timeloop works.
