The difference is probably irrelevant physically and definitely irrelevant ethically. Sapience is a pattern, not a material, and that pattern imprinted on "virtual" atoms is still a "real" person. Whether or not they are real atoms (in which case, where did they come from and where did they go? That seems like it would take far more magic than just a simulation, but the fact that Zorian's soul escaped, and considering that a soul is made of magic, means that the whole process was somehow exothaumic and produced real magical energy from somewhere, even if it didn't directly produce matter), either way it all behaved realistically from the perspective of the people inside it.

But I don't see a utility from the gods' perspective in looping across that much time, so I doubt it's a simulation in the sense that they intend to revert it. More like they just shoved the whole universe in a pocket as long-term storage that they can bring it back out of if they want to, to observe whatever progress it's made in the mean time. Still I would expect that they're at least considering the possibility of reverting it if something particularly shitty happens (as the angel described it "scorched Earth" tactics, such as restoring a backup state).
