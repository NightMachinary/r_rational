"Keh-khe-khe, you thought that threat would stifle us?"

Zorian let out a pained laugh hearing what's Jornak had been said. If only he knew how irrelevant that plan was. He then turned his sight toward Quatach Ichl who hasn't let out a sound so far.

"Props to you, Sir Lich, your decision to raze the church turn out to be correct. Not only the angels will involve themselves, they also already had plan to descend. As for your expectation that they just leave after disposing the primordial? That, I found, to be woefully misguided."

If Quatach Ichl was surprised to be suddenly addressed, he did not show it. The fact that he did not readily respond actually helped Zorian prepare a wedge he's about to drive in.

"Tell me, Mr Merenptah, did I need to tell the angels anything about my scheme, your scheme, and these two clowns' schemes to know what they're going to do? Nay! The angle saw through me, Mr Merenptah, right at the moment our eyes met. Not a single word I need to utter before they reached their decision. It would be wise for you to retreat right now rather than later. The moment the Primordial get released, there'll be no war breaking out for you to take advantage of."

Zorian was never a man with flair for acting, but knowing what will happen helped him let lies went through his teeth. True that Zorian had told celestial tree trunks what and what will happen from his perspective, but it didn't help him to his cause. The angels cannot bend their contract after all. However, since he knew what about to go down, that inflexibility should not help their enemies either.
