The most obvious solution to escaping the "knowledge of the time-loop" clause in Zach's contract is cleanly mind wiping Zach's awareness that other people know about the time loop, because Zorian figured it's Zach's /perception/ that matters. However, this doesn't mean that this loophole wouldn't be arbitrated by the angels, since there's also a clause that rulers cannot be killed. Also, it'd be sad to see Zach lose all his memories of interacting with Zorian throughout the time loop.

Jornak's motive reveal was a great twist (insomuch as we can trust that's the truth). The committing evil for what one perceives to be utilitarian good reminded me of Ozymandias in Watchmen. Now that it's brought up, Z&Z have always been working on a relatively small scale, from the pettiest point of personal gains to the larger resolution of the Cyoria crisis. I doubt they're the type to be swayed by optimistic evil, but I'm curious how this conflict of ideals will be settled.

Hope they've already started preparations on new plans because Silverlake is genuinely their biggest weakness. Almost all of their plans and abilities in the time loop were leaked to SL. Now RR's side has an overwhelming advantage in information, and information wins wars (assuming SL is not a triple agent and there is a chance given how inscrutable she's been). Not sure what Alanic's got for counteracting the wraith bombs, but since they knew about that plan already, that seems to be the priority as the biggest threat. Assassination of major people (rulers of nations) might be a serious danger to Zach's life. Oganj might seem like the big bad saved for last, but he's small fry in the grand scheme.
