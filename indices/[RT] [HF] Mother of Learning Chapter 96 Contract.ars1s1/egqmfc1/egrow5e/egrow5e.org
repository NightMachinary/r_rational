Actually no. It would be simpler to alter Zach's memories to think that all those people are dead. Then they can just show up again after the contract is over and there aren't any problems.

Here's my bet. Alanic and Xvim die. Silverlake and Jornak die. Not really sure what they do with QI, but let's say he dies as well. The only person remaining is Zorian. At the very last, something in the contract makes Zach break down and he attacks Zorian rather than just dying. Zorian uses mind magic on him, makes Zach think he won and killed him, then shows up again after the contract ends.
