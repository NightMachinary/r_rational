my reaction after reading this chapter:

I AM DISSAPOINT. At least to me it seems that quite a few details are not fitting that well.

I'll have to re-read the chapter about Jornak, but the impression I had that he was a NoM (not a mage, a regular citizen). Or a substandard mage at all. I think by the time Zorian performed a mind reading on him, he was qualified enough to identify his traits/status for pre-loop.

Anyways, some random conclusions/thoughts after reading the chapter:

given enough resources/time even monkey can become archmage/mindmage/whatever. (Jornak as very bland person prior loop. If he had any decent talent, he would be most likely working as a mage already instead of being lawyer).

The Red Robe stolen from cultists can be explained, however getting crown as newbies from QI for initial temporary mark, getting QI to modify temporary market, getting access to royal vault for dagger - those details are very thin. The knowledge about SG (the artifacts, soul markers) and how they knew that QI had the crown of the king to even include others in looping - it does not seem to be that Jornak was privy of this information and Zach knew pretty much nothing besides the bars. If Zach had visited SG , he could have learned something from controller, but it is still very far fetched. (I think it was Zorian who entered SG by feeling/using soul markers, Zach was oblivious to them). A very catch-22 issue in general. I just can imagine any plausible scenario how this situation where Zach granted a temporary marker to Jornak might have happened reasonably.

There might be an explanation for QI holding his end of the deal all the time. It is part of divine blessing he has. As a whim or not, the god who placed the blessing/contract on him mandated that he never breaks any deals (or there he will die/lose the divine blessing/whatever). There might be some clause about others approaching/offering a deal (it cannot refuse a reasonable deal). E.g., if the undead vampire management asks him to be a general and they promise to take care of his subordinates or what not, he has to accept due to divine blessing (has was offered reasonable deal with reasonable compensation). So Jornak with Zach randomly asked QI to borrow a crown for 5 minutes (and provide a relevant payment - very little for such request) and QI just had to agree due to his divine contract/blessing.

It is also very likely that contract Pan had signed with SL and RR is of different nature than Zach. Zach agreed to it in the sleep and then he was shoved into SG with very little information about SG. Pan is enforcing his contract some other way (not divine magic), but it is complicated enough that SL can untangle it during the month until it expires.
