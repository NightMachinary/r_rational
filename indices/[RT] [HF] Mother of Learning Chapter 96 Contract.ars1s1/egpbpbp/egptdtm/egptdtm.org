Heh. Worth pointing out that RR doesn't reveal his identity until after Zorian says the name, and if he wore one fake face, what would stop him from wearing a second?

And unless RR reveals that Zach had already solved the invasion and knew the way out of the loop when they first interacted in the loop, how did RR get into the loop if Zach literally never knew how the loop worked? How does Zach give him a temporary marker? How does Jornak even have time to learn enough to get to the gate and meet Panaxeth? These things are a problem no matter who RR is, of course.

All that said, Zorian openly doubts it's anyone other than Jornak, and it's not really clear why RR would pretend to be someone else at this point. Maybe Zorian!RR would want to as part of some bizarre contract-avoidance scheme (he plans on occupying the body of whichever Zorian wins), but that's more a little nutty.

I suppose we'll find out when we see how this conversation ends. It would be pretty funny if this was Yet Another Fake Reveal though!
