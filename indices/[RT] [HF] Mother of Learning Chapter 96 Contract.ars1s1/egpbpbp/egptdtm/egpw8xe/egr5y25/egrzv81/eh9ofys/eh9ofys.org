I literally don't understand how this reveal is either “rational” or “logical.” I don't even really know what that means in this context, and I understand it even less as a concept that's somehow diametrically opposed to “cliche and campy (royalty)”?

It's not rational, it's characteristic of “rationalist fiction,” a silly genre created in part by a guy who wanted to let everyone know how smart he was by writing himself as Harry-Potter-But-Really-Smart. Ideally, it involves works where you treat genre fiction or fanfiction as a serious literary exercise, especially w/r/t /telling a coherent story that is grounded in the plot's earliest chapters./

And sorry, but introducing a masked villain and unmasking the villain 80 chapters later, only to show that it was a guy we didn't even know existed until the story's third act? The only thing “rationalist” about it is how Zorian acts like he already figured it out, and personally, I'm still very much hoping he's proven wrong.
