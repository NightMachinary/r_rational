I don't buy Jornak as RR. This:

#+begin_quote
  "I guess you also know who I really am?" he asked, tilting his head to the side with a self-indulgent smile.
#+end_quote

doesn't seem like the reaction of someone whose obsessively kept secret has been found out. In Bayes terms someone who isn't Jornak is certain to let his enemies keep thinking he is, so the likelihood ratio is /at best/ 1:1, so this can't be evidence for Jornak=RR. 'Liar who wants to conceal his identity admits his identity' is just awful evidence.

My prior for J=RR wasn't very high, and this chapter shifts it downwards if anything, I think you need to assign /some/ probability to Jornak not admitting it so casually after all the lengths he has gone so far. All the people acting like this chapter settles the matter, how do you assign a much higher conditional probability to Jornak telling the truth than any other RR candidate lying?
