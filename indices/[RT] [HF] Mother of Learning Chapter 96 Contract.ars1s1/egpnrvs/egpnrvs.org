Thoughts:

- If ZZ accept the offer, the next chapter might timeskip to just before the final battle. Imagine a Zorian + Princess vs RR + Oganj all-out fight.
- The RR reveal doesn't feel very satisfying. RR let Zorian say who he thought he was instead of revealing his identify himself, so could just be lying, and they never verify his identity. I'd still put 10% on RR = Fortov.
- If ZZ accept the offer, couldn't RR and crew could just trigger the release before the summer festival, as the cult did in one of the restarts? I guess ZZ will know this and monitor potential ritual locations closely.
- Not telling Damien seems silly. Tons of people know about the time loop and they need all the help they can get. Either they find a way around the angelic contract that allows Zach and loop-aware-humans to survive or they don't.
- I wonder if there's a future where ZZ + RR + crew team up to beat all their contracts and the final battle is against Panxeth + the angels instead of each other. Zorian reverse engineers the angel summoning cube which is probably divine spell formula (with QI's help) and instead uses it to attack or imprison the angels.
