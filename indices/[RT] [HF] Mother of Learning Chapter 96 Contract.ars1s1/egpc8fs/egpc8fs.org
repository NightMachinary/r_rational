If there's a way out for Zach, that means there might be a way out for Silverlake (RR is just a dick, he wants what he wants, Silverlake's an opportunist). I wonder if they can get her trust that way - however, I'm sure the loophole would involve some sort of soul magic and I highly doubt SL would allow ZnZ easy access to her soul.
