I'm kinda surprised Zorian didn't think about asking the Angels about that. If they can get the bad guys out of their deal with the Primordial, there's a chance they can turn them or at least make them neutral. RR probably would most likely still be an enemy, but Silverlake will probably just fuck off and do her own thing if she got that deal
