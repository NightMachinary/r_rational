  From a purely "I want to survive the month" point of view, why would ZZ accept the terms of Jornak, and leave Team RR alone??
#+end_quote

Zach would die if team RR survives:

#+begin_quote
  "Isn't that just a little unfair? It's obvious the situation has changed from the time I agreed to the contract... and even you admitted the way you got me to agree to it was kind of dodgy and inappropriate."

  "We cannot absolve you of fulfilling your part of the bargain,"the angel stubbornly said. "It simply is not within our power to do so. The only thing I can promise you is that if you find the way to remove or evade the contract in some fashion, we will not seek to punish you for it."
#+end_quote

They can probably avoid the terms of the contract in regards to Zorian in a few ways, but if team RR survives to the end of the month, Zach will die even if the primordial isn't released, because he has no good way of erasing their memories of the time loop like he might have with Zorian.

Actually, they just plain can't kill team RR right now. QI is a Lich, and killing his physical body merely returns his soul to his phylactery. So Zach would all but certainly die even if they managed to completely annihilate team RR before they could trigger their contingencies. Zorian would come out ahead, but it wouldn't be in character. Zach has little reason to not accept since a straight fight is his specialty, and it's the only realistic path he survives through.

RR also has the pseudo nuclear option of placing a description of the time loop in a newspaper if Zach doesn't agree.
