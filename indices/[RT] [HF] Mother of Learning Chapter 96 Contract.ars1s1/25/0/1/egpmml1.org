  Zach would die if Team RR survives

Exactly, which is why they shouldn't accept the terms of Team RR to leave them alone. It is asking for a lot from a final fight, to kill all of Team RR.

I see what you are saying as well. That accepting Jornak's terms is the only way of ensuring there is a final fight. My thought process was that the final fight will happen one way or the other, regardless of whether they hound Team RR through the month or not.

  RR also has the pseudo nuclear option of placing a description of the time loop in a newspaper if Zach doesn't agree.

Wow. That is crazy. What an option! :D
