Zorian just needs to mention that an angel promised to kill him in passing if the primordial is released. Once SL and RR learn that they'll both die anyways if angels become involved simply as a method for them to limit the effects of the time loop on the real world, they might not be so eager to go on with the plan. But somehow I doubt that this is where [[/u/nobody103][u/nobody103]] planned to lead the conversation.
