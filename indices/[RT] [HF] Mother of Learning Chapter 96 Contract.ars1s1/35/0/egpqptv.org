I agree the Red Robe reveal wasn't very satisfying from a literary perspective but from a rational perspective that is kind of how it had to be. RR had to fit a set of pretty strict criteria even before we knew about his Veyers connection. He had to be someone Zach could reasonably meet and grow to trust in the loop. He had to be connected to the Cult of the Dragon Below. He couldn't be someone Zorian would reasonably meet or else it would be obvious Zorian was an extra looper. Later it had to also be someone connected to Veyers. Under those conditions in the story up to this point only Veyers or Jornak could possibly be the answer and Veyers was ruled out by being soul killed.
