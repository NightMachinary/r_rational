Well, I used different metrics to come to my conclusions, like literary and thematic reasoning. The reason I never thought of this being the outcome more than anything else because it's just boring, bland and doesn't even matter.

There is no meaning to jornak being RR that the whole quest to find out his identity was just a red herring. It doesn't change the story in anyway. Its lazy rational writing.

Also you never came to the conclusion jornak was red robe was because you didn't want to risk being wrong rather than risk being right. That stance has about as much meaning as jornak being RR. It'd make you a wicked poker player when you play against newbies though.
