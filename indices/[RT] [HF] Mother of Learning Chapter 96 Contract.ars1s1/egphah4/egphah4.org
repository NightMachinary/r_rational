If the angel said that they would kill anyone who knew about the time loop or made it out during the scorched earth response, assuming that Panaxeth was released, does that mean that they'll kill silverlake, QI, and Jornak as well. The angels sound like they know what they're doing so even if the primordial offers them its protection, which it probably wouldn't want to do anyway, wouldn't they die. This whole situation looks like a loose-loose for those 3. If ZZ stop Panaxeth then they have lost. If Panaxeth gets out then the angels kill them. RR might get a very large portion of the world destroyed but I doubt even he would count that as a win. There's no reason for them to believe ZZ if they tell them what the angel said but that sort of thing sounds to me like a narrative patch job.
