As I understood it Zach never even saw the contract, nor did he have any access to it. So if they never had the contract to begin with, what would there be for Jornak to understand? Nor did I get impression that the contract was somehow imprinted into the marker, and it's not like they could summon an angel to show it to them while inside the loop. So all Zach really had to go on would be the summarised version given to him in the dream, which didn't seem like something that would require a lawyer.
