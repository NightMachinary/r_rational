I don't really see how this is an asspull, or anything else like that. At the very worst, it's inelegant; the story made RR's identity a fairly central unanswered question, but the answer is that he's a tertiary character that only survived the first few days outside the loop because Silverlake warned him. And rather than having a more interesting motive, it's literally what Zorian figures out the first time he researched the whole “hates Cyoria” angle.

But nobody103 has always focused his work on creating an interesting fantasy world with a very complicated set of problems and following a protagonist who doggedly solves said problems. It's what makes it a hit with the “rationalist” crowd and litrpg types. Given how every step of the climax has included major setbacks and big stake-raising surprises, I'm still looking forward to the solution to all this.
