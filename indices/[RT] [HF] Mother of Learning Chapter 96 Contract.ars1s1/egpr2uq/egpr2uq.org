Welp!

I did a lot of RR theory reading when I was developing my own wrong idea; I can say pretty confidently that few people had Jornak as their first guess. I'm at least joined by many other people in being super duper wrong.

For good reason, imo. Van Dine and Knox alike would be aghast at this as the solution to a mystery---the culprit wasn't introduced until well into the second act, breaking what's probably the cardinal rule of mystery writing. MoL isn't a mystery, but those rules exist for a good reason: a story that hides the identity of a character should make that feel consequential.

Jornak just doesn't feel like a big deal. The fact that he's RR doesn't meaningfully change the stakes of the story or have an impact on the protagonists. In fact, if we had known all along that Jornak was RR (say, he didn't bother putting up his hood in Chapter 26, and Zorian recognized him when they investigated Veyers later), it wouldn't have made much of a difference to the plot.

None of which is meant as a damning critique of MoL, I should add. It's just a bit underwhelming after all the debate and consideration, it's the second person Z&Z would've investigated if Silverlake hadn't warned Jornak that they had discovered Veyers in the loop.

But now there are no mysteries, and I'm pretty sure all the outstanding issues have been addressed. All that remains to be seen is how our heroes will be victorious, and on that score, I remain very much invested and excited, especially because all the other twists this chapter (the angel! the dragon!) are so juicy. It's shaping up to be an exciting ending.
