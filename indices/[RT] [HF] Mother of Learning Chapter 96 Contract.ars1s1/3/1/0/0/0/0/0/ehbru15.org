It is rational in the sense that there is no reason why dramatically satisfying answers are more likely to be correct.

You having unresolved issues with a sibling does not logically make them more likely to be the mysterious person scheming to topple societies. This is the sense in which it being Jornak as opposed to Fortov (for example) is "rational". It makes perfect sense given information we have had for a long time.

I'm still hoping he's wrong too, though. It's the best when the dramatic and the logical align. But such solutions are challenging to make surprising.
