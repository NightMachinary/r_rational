It's not complicated. “Rational” is not a word you use to describe a writing choice; when you are the one constructing the entire fictional edifice on which your work is created, you get to set up whatever you want. It's not good writing to make it so that the most logical outcome is for the most boring person to be the culprit behind one of the story's central mysteries, no matter what the genre is.

E: also, I've read the story through probably three times. My problem with it isn't that I don't get it.
