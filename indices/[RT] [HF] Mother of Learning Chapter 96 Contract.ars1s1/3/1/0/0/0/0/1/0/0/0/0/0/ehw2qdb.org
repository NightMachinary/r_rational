Welp, we come full circle, because now I have no idea what it even means to “make sense” to you.

Like, when I explain how nobody103 could've easily brought Jornak into the story earlier and made him a more prominent character---why does that not make sense, exactly? It's literally just adding foreshadowing and development to a character we now know to be important to the plot. And that doesn't make sense?

Seems way more likely you're just being insulting for no reason. For example, I obviously understood Jornak as a distant possibility---I even mention him by name in my own big post on the topic as an anticlimactic choice nobody103 could go with. It's just that given what we knew prior to this chapter, he was /very unlikely/ since the novel had more than implied a) someone had done very sophisticated mind magic on a relatively well-equipped Zach and b) Panaxeth can only talk to people inside the unbarred gate. The idea that the lawyer friend of a classmate he /actively dislikes/ would get an invite to check out the gate with Zach, and would be so well-trusted that he could do difficult mind magic on an archmage? It's silly.

Of course, we now just have more questions than answers. If Zach didn't know about the loop, how did Jornak get brought into it? If Zach didn't know about the loop, how did anyone get down to the gate to talk to Panaxeth? These are pretty serious roadblocks to /any/ possible culprit, and we didn't know about any of it until literally a few pages before RR's reveal. So how, exactly, was anyone supposed to figure out what had happened before this chapter? The /only clue/ the book provides is that Jornak doesn't like Cyoria for similar reasons to Zach. We never see Zach mention him again, or act friendly toward him, or give any indication of a friendship that was once great enough that he let Jornak get close enough to erase his memory and become his greatest foe?

That's what doesn't make sense to me. But like I said, it's p. clear that we have very different understandings of “sense.”
