When you spend over half of a novel treating the villain's real identity as a central mystery to the plot, with thousands of words spent on the investigation, who it is ought to feel relevant.

The fact that things are playing out just as Zorian expected is typical of rationalist fiction, a genre that more or less has its roots in “all according to keikaku.” And, admittedly, what nobody103 does particularly well is setting up difficult problems for Zorian to solve, which is definitely the case here. As I've said elsewhere, the worst you can say about the underwhelming RR identity is that it's inelegant from a mystery standpoint, and even that's a matter of taste.
