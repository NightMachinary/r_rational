The dragon Zach tried to kill on his lonesome all those restarts. Also, that was the news that finally made Zorian tell Kael and Taiven and Kirielle about it, and that allowed Spear of Resolve to find everything out... Honestly, nobody103 does a great job with conservation of characters :D

Yeah, it was pretty obvious it was Jornak once Zach exited the loop and everyone else (Silverlake and Zorian) came out as their pre-loop selves.
