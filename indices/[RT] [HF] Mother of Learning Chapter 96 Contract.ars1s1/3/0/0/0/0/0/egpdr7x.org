My favourite! I mean it can still happen.... But RR certainly spoke from the heart and Fortov has no bone to pick with the academy or anyone really (apart from Daimen and Ibery I guess), he's just too lazy.

I hope the way Daimen!RR stopped after we met Daimen, we can stop the Fortov!RR after we've met RR.
