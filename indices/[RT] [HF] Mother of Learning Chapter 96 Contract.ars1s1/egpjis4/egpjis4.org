I was disappointed that the chapter ended so abruptly. It does not seem like that conversation was over, and yet I suspect the next chapter will not begin with the conversation continuing.

Zach and Zorian still need to bring up a couple points. One is to determine just how insane and/or bloodthirsty Jornak really is. Is he bluffing about triggering the wraith bombs and assassinating people around the world if Zach and Zorian continue fighting before the end of the month? If Jornak really wants to improve the world (rather than just lying to advance his selfish desires), then that much destruction does not seem reasonable. Which would prove Jornak either insane or lying about his goals. Or bluffing if he would not really do it.

Which leads to the additional point that they needed to bring up. QI and Silverlake seem to think that releasing Pan will not be such a terrible thing for the world, and they likely have influenced Jornak's views on that subject. But Zach and Zorian know that releasing Pan would result in some "scorched Earth" countermeasures which are likely to be unacceptable even by QI's standards.

Even if Zach and Zorian cannot convince them of how bad it would be, they could at least persuade them that /they/ believe it would be that bad, in fact worse than what Jornak is threatening. In which case there is little reason for them to accept Jornak's deal (unless they are very confident they can win the final battle, which I do not think they are as things currently stand). Which could at least allow them to negotiate something more in favor of Zach and Zorian.
