If some romance plot line is included, which I think probably won't be, it wouldn't really be Zorian purposely looking for it. Whether it is Raynie, Taiven, or anyone else, if he runs into them he has to treat them in regards to the relationship he wants to have with them.

This is now real life with no loops so if he is interested in someone, he can't just completely spurn any interaction with them or be a dick to them for practicality's sake since he is now playing for keeps. Not to say he will be going up to them carrying flowers but if someone approaches him and asks to meet or anything else, he will have to consider whether he wants to ruin the relationship by rejecting.
