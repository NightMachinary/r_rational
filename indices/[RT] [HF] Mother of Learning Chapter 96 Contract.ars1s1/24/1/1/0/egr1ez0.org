I don't think he would have accepted the deal in a dream because of the way he reacted to the idea in this chapter. He thought it was ludicrous and even his pre loop self would never consider it. It is true that we don't know for sure what pre loop Zorian would do but even the angel agreed it was foolish to accept. You are right that Zorian learns fast but that's not terribly important with effectively infinite time. While Zorian is better at the subtle stuff the angels weren't looking for subtle, they were looking for power and Zach fits the bill.
