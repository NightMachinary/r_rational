The hamster seemed...surprising...to me. We were told originally that the hamster is an Unseen Servant with some illusion over it and a Detct Thoughts to choose the details. Unseen Servant is mindless, so I'm not clear on how it can be doing what it's doing. Unless Milo lied about what it was, or didn't mention some details.

And yes, I'm with you on the "too split up" issue. The whole subplot with Bellatrix always seemed like an unnecessary distraction from the main story; I'm sorry to see Milo back in his own world, instead of munchkining the Harry Potter world. Then again, Sir Poley is a great author and he's been leading up to this for a long time, so I'm sure I'll end up enjoying whatever he does.
