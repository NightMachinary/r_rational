The story splitting up is definitely a problem. I once tried to write a novel how Stephen King purportedly wrote "The Stand", which is to write a viewpoint character, end the chapter/scene on a cliffhanger or revelation of some sort, and then introduce a new character. In the end, there was the soldier who went touring with his prototype robot from the future, the detective who was trying to solve a murder that hadn't happened yet, the writer who was coming back from a colony on Mars, the junkie whose time travel get-rich-quick scheme had fallen through, the teenage girl who'd gone back in time to save her father, the young guy whose plans to travel back to Edo Japan had been dashed, and probably one or two others.

I worry that this story is heading in a similarly unorganized direction, but Sir Poley has done quite a bit to gain my faith, so I'm willing to continue reading.
