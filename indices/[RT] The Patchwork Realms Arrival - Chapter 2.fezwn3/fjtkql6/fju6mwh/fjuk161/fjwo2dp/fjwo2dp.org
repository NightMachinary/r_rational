Anyone want to do guesses on where the doggos power came from? My best guess is that the individual who best represents their species gets upgraded to an ideal of their species, and one of those gets upgraded again. Now, there are probably dogs in the world since there are wolves, but I posit that earth breeds are distinct enough to count for the system.

So our MC is the most rotty-mix pup to ever rotty-mix in the new world, and the system recognizes that. Thoughts?
