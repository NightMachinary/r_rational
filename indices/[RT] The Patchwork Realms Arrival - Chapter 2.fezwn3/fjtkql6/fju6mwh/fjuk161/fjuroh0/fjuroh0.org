There's no translation going on, Athos simply learned a couple of words and now notices them when they're spoken. Don't worry, there will be plenty of pantomime going on.

As to the horse meat...the caravan is in quite a hurry, as evidenced by the fact that they're traveling after sunset. (Recall that Athos arrived to find himself under a very bright full moon.) They're going to deal with their dead but they're not going to spend time doing anything with the horses. OTOH, Athos is hungry and is going to eat a bunch of the dead horseflesh before they move on.
