It is in English...?

Oh, wait, you're talking about the dialogue. Yeah, that's not an actual language, it's just placeholder babble to signify "This is a language that Athos does not understand. Here is roughly how much content is being spoken, and parts of it will start to be in English as he learns more words."

Basically, the leader of the caravan (SpearGuy) says "Are you intelligent and friendly?", Athos doesn't understand him but demonstrates friendliness and a willingness to cooperate, so SG invites him back to the caravan. The people are scared until SG reassures them, one of the women decides to use healing resources on Athos, a different person protests that they shouldn't waste all that on a dog, and she tells him to heck off. Lissi and Faffi hug him for reasons that will be clear later, Marza is freaked out about that.
