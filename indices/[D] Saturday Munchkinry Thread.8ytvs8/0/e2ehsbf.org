In the roleplaying game /In Nomine,/ players may start the game as a Seraph. Seraphim are angels, so they already know a great deal of hidden Truth (mainly that Christian theology is mostly true), but they also have a power that lets them discern truth from lies, called their resonance. Whenever they want, a Seraph can decide that they are activating their resonance, with roughly a 50% chance of success. They know whether they've succeeded, and if they fail it creates a mild discomfort. If they succeed, they know whether or not the next statement they hear from someone else is a deliberate lie. In exchange, Seraphim are forbidden from lying themselves.

The bit that seemed obviously broken to me in the rules was this: whenever they use this power, there is a 1 in 6 chance that in addition to knowing whether the statement was a /deliberate/ lie, they learn whether the statement was actually True. Googling, it seems later editions have tried to nerf this a bit by adding that this only works if the speaker has some connection to the statement, and how much they can learn is limited by the speaker's level of connection. I suspect, however, that this is still broken.

So, if you were a Seraph, perfectly benevolent towards humanity, unable to lie, and with this ability, how would you abuse the hell out of it before the powers that be yanked you back up to Heaven?
