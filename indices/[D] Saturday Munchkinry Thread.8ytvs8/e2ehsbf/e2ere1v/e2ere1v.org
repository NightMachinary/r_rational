/First, let's really break this:/

A high IQ (and/or high Perception) Seraph has a significantly higher than 50% chance of success on the resonance roll, especially in a situation where they are otherwise in tune with the nature of reality. This is good news, because should the resonance fail they cannot try again to the same purpose for up to six (+2, see below) hours. There is also a flat 1/36 chance during any attempt of infernal intervention which could cause any number of inconveniences, and a 1/36 chance of divine intervention which might point the angel in the right direction? Or not? God works in mysterious ways.

If the potential truth teller is entirely cooperative the angel might get up to +2 to their chance at absolute truth, upping their odds from 1/6 to 3/6. Combine this with a high chance of resonance success (along with the fact that they can make successful attempts once per second) and it's essentially a coin flip whether the angel knows the truth of any statement their helpful assistant has the necessary "connection" to utter.

/As such a Seraph:/

I'd start by asking experts in various fields who in their field has the most complete understanding of it (starting, of course, with themselves). If they prove not to know this right off the bat, they could supply a list of other experts which can be culled mathematically (starting with "The person with the most complete understanding of your subject is on this list?" of course).

Then the angel goes to this expert and repeats the process until they find the greatest expert. At that point, they ask this person about the greatest outstanding unknowns in the field, fishing for their understanding of the best theories. It would be relatively easy to guide them in the right direction this way.

Thus, over the course of a matter of months (largely travel time and scheduling), every major discipline could be advance its fundamental understanding.

In most cases this wouldn't even require any revelation of my abilities and motives, nor much in the way of motivated cooperation, as these are exactly the sorts of questions that experts love to answer.
