If knowledge of your abilities is not widely known, then people won't necessarily have any reason to trust anything you say. You could ask a bioinformatics expert whether the program which accurately predicts protein folding 99.9% of the time has a unicode translation greater than 10^{10^{100n}}, then pare down from there until you find the correct program, but with no direct means of testing this program it would not be widely used until it could be proven to work anyway.
