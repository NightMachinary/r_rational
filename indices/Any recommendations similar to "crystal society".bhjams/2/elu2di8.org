I'm not done reading them yet, but [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/bookseries/B01MUI3TG0][The Divine Dungeon]] series is essentially about a runaway AI process (in a Xianxia world.) So far (I've read the first three books in the five-book series), it has accidentally created a zombie plague, semi-purposefully destroyed entire cities (killing off their entire populations) in the process of powering itself, and /entirely/ purposefully created and released mosquitoes into a blissfully pre-mosquito world.

If you know /Dungeon Keeper/, the AI is essentially a sentient Dungeon Heart, acting as its own dungeon keeper (which is just how Dungeon Hearts work in this setting.) The AI also /used/ to be a human, but, because it doesn't retain much of its original human preference function, it's more intuitive to just think of it as a straight-up AI.
