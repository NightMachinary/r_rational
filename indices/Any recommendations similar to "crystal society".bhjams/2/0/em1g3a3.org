Seconding this. I'm up to date to book 4, waiting on 5, and it's excellent.

It also appears to somehow share a universe with the author's other work, the Completionist saga, in which not Elon Musk is forced to take the fall for an environmental disaster, vows to put big oil out of business, and somehow in the process finds and uses a dungeon core (which may or may not be Cal) to create a near-perfect VRMMO that serves as the story's setting.

I mean, it's never mentioned again, but that prologue is, by itself, worth a read even if you don't intend to read the first book.
