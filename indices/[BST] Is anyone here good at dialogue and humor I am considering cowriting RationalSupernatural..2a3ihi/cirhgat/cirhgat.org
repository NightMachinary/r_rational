The worst part of most rational fanfic is the new, awkwardly shoe-horned in superpower(s) the rational-world protagonist needs to receive to make them able to survive the initial contact with a plot without their plot-armor. Sometimes it is pre-plot powerleveling, sometimes it is being Sherlock Holmes reincarnated; often it is very meh.

This story idea seems like it could have that issue in spades, as you are jacking the threat of Supernatural universe creatures. This is a world where "unkillable" demons are an issue from the word go. In the series, survival was initially (and usually) almost solely because their foes were lazy and stupid, and they often had plot armor or literally had God on their side.

In general terms, how do the boys and other hunters rationally deal with uncertainty long enough to get good information? Or even survive their first hunt?

Have you made major changes to what hunters are and what they do?

Does God exist?

To me, how those sorts of issues are resolved would make or break this.
