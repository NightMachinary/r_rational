I had a plan for this. The answer is...sort of, but in a way I think is very very much in the spirit of a rational fic. I am still deciding whether to put it in though. I have a few plot sticking points I would have to resolve and I think it has more than enough rational fun without this thrown into it.

I will summarize as... God will either be in the fic as a large arc of plot, I can't say more, or I will do something like what you just said and steer the focus toward other issues.

In other words, Rationally or not at all.
