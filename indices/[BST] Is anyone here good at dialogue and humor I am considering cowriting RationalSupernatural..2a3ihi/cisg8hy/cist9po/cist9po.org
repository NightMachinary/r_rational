This reminds me of some writing advice I once read. If you want to write a Supernatural fic, you should probably try just putting a couple of episodes on paper. Just write what happens, what the characters say... This should give you a good feel of the way the characters act and talk. It's a lot of work, but might be worth it.

  People don't expect a great deal of creativity from action heroes' jokes. Aren't they usually one-liners or sarcastic observations?

Actually, one of my favorite things about Supernatural is that the banter between the brothers is pretty realistic. It's a bit smoother and faster than actual conversations, but the content and style feels realistic to me.

The "action hero one-liners" in the show are also pretty toned down. There are phrases that would be big actions-quotes in other series or movies, but in Supernatural they're shot like they would sound in real life.
