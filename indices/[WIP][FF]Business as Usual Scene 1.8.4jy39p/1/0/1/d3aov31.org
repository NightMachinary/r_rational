I really enjoy the series. Vlad is very intelligent, probably a level 2, but the story is written in something of a Sherlock Holmes style, where Vlad's eventual solution to whatever problem he is resolving is nearly impossible to guess because the reader doesn't have enough information.

The books are also written non-chronologically, making it a bit harder to follow the thread.

However, it is possible that the books are written non-chronologically as a plot device. Time travel may be possible, though it hasn't been performed by Vlad yet.

The story is narrated by Vlad himself, and he does talk to the fourth wall occasionally. He also appears to be somewhat of a untrustworthy narrator. Again, this might be plot related.

Perhaps the most irritating thing about trying to determine if the Vlad Taltos books are rational or not is that despite appearing to be non-rational, the overall arc of stories may, in fact, turn out to be rational. (Other than Doyle-like information hiding. That's clearly a thing.)
