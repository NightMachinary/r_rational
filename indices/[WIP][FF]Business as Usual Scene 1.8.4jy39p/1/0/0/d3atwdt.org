I was the one who [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2m2i9y/rthf_steven_brusts_vlad_taltos_novels/][recc'd that series]] here. Most of the characters have reasons that seem fairly reasonable for their goals, and while the reader usually can't put everything together beforehand it's still really well written and interesting. One of Vlad's defining characteristic as a protagonist is his skepticism and tendency to think about things in an interesting and incisive way - he's not necessarily using anything like the scientific method, but he is using a lot of skepticism and careful analysis and reasoning and deduction that makes sense.

I rank the series extremely highly. I really like the worldbuilding in the series - the Dragaerans are rubber forehead aliens to an extent (physically - not that different) but they have a very well developed and interesting society that is far more believably foreign than the vast, vast majority of aliens in fiction.

I like that Brust does a bunch of experimenting with his books in various ways. His characters change and grow over time, and become different. He also makes the books structurally different in a lot of ways as well - he mixes up the voice and structure of his Dragaera books a lot. In particular, Dragon is told nonlinearly through repeated flashbacks, Athyra is told through the perspective of a different character, Orca is told as a sort of 'tale within a tale' framing where characters relate events to one another nonlinearly... one book has the entire thing structured around a laundry list, where every chapter lists one stain/rip/etc to be laundered as a result of the chapter. Basically, there's tons of playing with foreshadowing and nonlinear plotting and readers' expectations in a lot of really neat ways. There are a lot of longrunning series where each novel is basically the same as the last, and the Taltos books avert that the most of any fantasy series I have ever read.

I strongly recommend reading in publication order, not by the series chronology.

Finally, Brust's other work is /mostly/ pretty good. His Khaavren Romances are a pastiche of Dumas in the world of Dragaera and I really loved them - but the writing style (including dialogue styled after /Rosencrantz and Guildenstern/) is really dramatically not for everyone. Cowboy Feng's Space Bar and Grille has an amazing premise that seems really amazingly cool but the conclusion and so forth is super disappointing (complete failure to follow through). Agyar is a pretty good prototypical urban fantasy vampire novel. Freedom and Necessity is a crazy detailed epistolary novel that explores a really realistically crafted 19th century England, with a big focus on political philisophy stuff (Marxism) that is fairly well done. Brokedown Palace is a fairly good fairytale retelling. To Reign in Hell is basically a Zelazny pastiche - it's pretty solidly done in Zelazny's style, if you like Creatures of Light and Darkness or Lord of Lights you will probably enjoy this. The Incrementalists is the sort of thing where the basic idea is probably super interesting to anyone interested in EA-adjacent ideas, but the actual EA-type-stuff is sort of infuriating by the standards of anyone who is into EA already, and the other stuff is not terribly interesting. The Sun, The Moon, and The Stars is a work about a failed artist and it's trying to be artsy and stuff and it didn't really work at all for me. Finally, The Gypsy is the worst thing that either Steven Brust or coauthor Megan Lindholm (AKA Robin Hobb) have ever been involved in.
