Recently I mentioned this writing project here and there seemed to be some interest. Vlad does seem to be reasonably rational but I'll warn you that he does compartmentalize a lot. I'm not entirely certain if this really qualifies as rational writing, but I'm doing my best to write a believable and interesting Vlad Taltos crossover into Worm.
