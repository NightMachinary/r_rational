- 1 I discussed this in the thread. If it were an original work, I'd fix it, but it is a derivative wrk, and the vast majority of people don't know the pronunciation, only the spelling. Lady Teldra technically wouldn't allow Vlad to misunderstand. Still, it is too tempting to poke at from Loiosh/Vlad's point of view, as they are being incorrigible smartasses.

- 2 Vlad was reading old magazine articles. Wall street likely still does exist. There are a LOT of alternate New Yorks.

- 3 Vlad wasn't surprised by books being available. He was surprised to find them in a pile of refuse. Books are mentioned in the Jhereg stories, but they are uncommon. Book and broadsheet availability in the Jheregverse seems to track with early post-printing-press in our world.

- 4 I was thinking that Brockton Bay survived in some fashion, but re-reading Bitches epilogue clearly indicated that it didn't. Boston did.

- 5 answered below

- 6 Tattletale and Bitch do still speak. Miss Militia even made certain to pass on a message that TT wanted to speak with Bitch again. Perhaps this meeting is what TT wanted to talk to her about... /grin/

Thank you for pointing out some loose ends. I will address 4 and 6 in the next chapter. The rest either can't be addressed without cutting something I want to stay (1), or don't seem to require attention (2, 3, 5). If you want to press a point, feel free. You might change my mind if you are convincing and can point me at things that counter my view about 2, 3, 5.
