For 3, there is also "These people are so spoiled. I order a book, and it arrives in a week, and they apologize?" I don't think book orders would typically take much longer in Dragaera. Outside of the capital or the major cities, perhaps.

For 5, Loiosh replies "You don't have the brain-thing that capes have, /but/ I don't think taking the risk would be smart." This looks to me like they agree there is a chance that Teacher could give Vlad powers without being able to control him, they are just considering how likely it is. But I don't see why they think it's possible at all. Or why the absence of the "brain-thing" is relevant: Teacher can give powers and control the recipient whether they had powers already or not.

For 6, at any rate Bitch has been off-world for a long time (and they can't be on Earth Gimel to fix 4, because it doesn't have big cities yet). And they haven't talked long enough that MM actually needed to pass the message :) So Vlad would likely know of Bitch as a /former/ Undersider, not a current one.
