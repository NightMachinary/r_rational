Will review and reply when I have a keyboard. I will say that #5 is exactly how I want it. Vlad and Loiosh are more a single mental entity than it seems on the surface. My belief os that when they argue, it is really a single mind deliberating. Vlad knows Teacher's power will almosy certainly make him a mental puppet - but he really hates that Dragon can spy on him so easily, so he's considering things that he knows are bad ideas.
