  How exactly are we supposed to operate and make useful predictions in the face of this extraordinary and currently unimaginable reality-to-be?
#+end_quote

Maximize power, so that when you have a better idea of what the future will look like, you're poised to respond to it.

More specifically, maximize money (which is directly fungible with power), and minimize financial liabilities.

I know that doesn't sound particularly actionable-- after all, I'd wager that most of us are already doing our best to be as financially independent as possible, to get good jobs, to make good investments, and so on and so forth, but it's the only real catch-all advice there is for preparing for an uncertain future, and even it has its problems (as it doesn't cover how much of your current happiness you should sacrifice to ensure the greatest probability of future happiness.)

I could talk about how I make my own predictions, but as my methods are pretty untested, and unlikely to be generalizable, it's probably best that I don't.
