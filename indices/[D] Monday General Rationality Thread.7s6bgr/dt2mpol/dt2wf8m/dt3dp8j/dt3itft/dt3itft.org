Efficiency has value. Great Britain tried focusing on the working class in between the end of WW2 and the Thatcher era. It worked well at first but eventually lead to massive stagflation and economic upheaval. The government could not effectively adjust to changes in the global economy like the lack of demand for British coal.

There is an ideal middle ground between anachro capitalism for pure money making efficiency and total state capitalism for pure humanitarian concern for the poor. Where exactly that is is very difficult to say, especially since it shifts as technology changes.
