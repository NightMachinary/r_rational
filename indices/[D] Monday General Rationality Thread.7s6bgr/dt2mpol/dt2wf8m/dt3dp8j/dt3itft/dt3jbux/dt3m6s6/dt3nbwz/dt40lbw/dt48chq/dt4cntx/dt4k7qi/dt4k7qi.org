  Food is failed to be distributed because of violence in areas.

I'm not convinced, so I decided to do some [[https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_state_time_value=2005;&marker_axis/_x_which=murder/_per/_100000/_people&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null&scaleType=linear;&axis/_y_which=malnutrition/_weight/_for/_age/_percent/_of/_children/_under/_5&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null;;;&chart-type=bubbles][data analysis]]. Your hypothesis would predict a line going from the lower left up towards the top right, but there does not appear to be any strong correlation. As an example, in 2005 India had slightly fewer murders per 100,000 people than the US, yet had 36 times higher rates of malnutrition in children under five years old. Violence rate could certainly be a contributing factor in famine, but it's clearly not the main factor.

For comparison, per capita income and famine appear to have a [[https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_state_time_value=2002;&marker_axis/_x_domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null;&axis/_y_which=malnutrition/_weight/_for/_age/_percent/_of/_children/_under/_5&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null;;;&chart-type=bubbles][strong negative correlation]]. Oddly enough, agriculture as a percentage of GDP also appears to be [[https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_state_time_value=2007;&marker_axis/_x_which=agriculture/_percent/_of/_gdp&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null&scaleType=linear;&axis/_y_which=malnutrition/_weight/_for/_age/_percent/_of/_children/_under/_5&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null;;;&chart-type=bubbles][positively correlated]] with famine, while industry as a percentage of GDP appears to be [[https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_state_time_value=2007;&marker_axis/_x_which=industry/_percent/_of/_gdp&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null&scaleType=linear;&axis/_y_which=malnutrition/_weight/_for/_age/_percent/_of/_children/_under/_5&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null;;;&chart-type=bubbles][negatively correlated]]. Odd that the countries seemingly making the food are in famine while the countries making the iPhones are not. Also, more time spent in school appears to [[https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_state_time_value=2007;&marker_axis/_x_which=mean/_years/_in/_school/_men/_25/_to/_34/_years&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null&scaleType=linear;&axis/_y_which=malnutrition/_weight/_for/_age/_percent/_of/_children/_under/_5&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null;;;&chart-type=bubbles][inversely correlate]] with child malnutrition.

From looking at the data, [[https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_state_time_value=2008;&marker_axis/_x_which=corruption/_perception/_index/_cpi&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:1.1&zoomedMax:9.4&scaleType=linear;&axis/_y_which=malnutrition/_weight/_for/_age/_percent/_of/_children/_under/_5&domainMin:null&domainMax:null&zoomedMin:null&zoomedMax:null;&size_which=income/_per/_person/_gdppercapita/_ppp/_inflation/_adjusted&domainMin:null&domainMax:null;&color_which=children/_per/_woman/_total/_fertility&use=indicator&scaleType=linear;;;&chart-type=bubbles][this graph]] seems to explain things best. Higher up means more child malnutrition, further right means less perceived corruption, larger dots means more income per capita, and color represents fertility rate (babies per woman). Most countries with GDP/capita < $6K have child malnutrition rates > 10%. Most countries with a Corruption Perception Index < 3 (lower is worse) have child malnutrition rates > 10%. The countries with both CPI < 3 and GDP/capita < $6K almost universally have child malnutrition rates > 10%, excepting only the Kyrgz Republic, Honduras, and Bolivia. No country with GDP/capita > $13K has a child malnutrition rate > 10%. No country with a CPI > 5 has a child malnutrition rate > 10%. Lower fertility rate also tends to correlate with lower child malnutrition rate.

So, if you want to mostly fix famine, the solution would likely be to eliminate government corruption as much as possible, provide affordable access to birth control, and promote economic development in every country up to at least a minimum GDP/capita of $6K and preferably $13K (adjusting for inflation, of course).

You may now carry on with your discussion.
