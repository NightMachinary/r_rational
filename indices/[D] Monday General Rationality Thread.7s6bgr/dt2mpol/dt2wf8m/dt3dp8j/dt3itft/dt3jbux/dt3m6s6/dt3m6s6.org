I told you already, having no concern for efficiency and just trying to get people jobs and welfare has been tried and failed. The Soviet Union and every other communist nation was founded on the concept. Much of the world excluding the US were doing government funded inefficient industries so the working class had advantages.

It failed.

You presumably consider the Nordic countries a good example of the ideal nation states. I do too. They do not have minimum wages. They do rely heavily on market forces, not government forces, to determine wages and prices. They have strong unions that set minimum wages for each industry, which works because if an industry is growing weaker, then for it to keep any jobs it'll need to lower pay, which a government federal minimum wage would unflexibly disallow.

I think a 0% corporate tax should be the goal that is worked towards, because corporate taxes are inefficient. They deincentize investment into the economy and incentivize corporations wasting money looking for loopholes.

I also believe in high taxes for the upper income brackets and taxes for investment gains. Taxing rich individuals is better than taxing corporations.

Then those taxes can be in turn invested into an effective social safety net, and that social safety will ideally be efficient at having poor not-die.
