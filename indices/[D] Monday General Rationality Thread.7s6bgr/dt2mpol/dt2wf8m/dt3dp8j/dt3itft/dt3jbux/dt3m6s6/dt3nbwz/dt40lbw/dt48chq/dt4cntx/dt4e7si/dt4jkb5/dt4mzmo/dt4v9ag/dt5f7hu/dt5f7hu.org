  Yes, that is me exactly. The children were essentially slaves, and there was a monarch in power in Belgium, albeit a constitutional one. Belgium exercise control in the Congo through military power, not through any sort of democratic process.

Are you saying this as if it makes the situation not-capitalism somehow? Not sure where you're going with this.

  Mainland Belgium itself at the time was fairly capitalist and, while I don't know that much about 19th century Belgium, from what I know it's internal policy was pretty good for their time period and technology. Their foreign policy was however downright evil.
#+end_quote

The social order at home was funded by exploitation abroad, as ever. Even after the Belgian government took their mad king's abattoir, they left the administration intact and the exploitation going for another half century, just somewhat less bloodily.

  A capitalist country does not need to have a downright evil foreign policy. One example would be how Denmark(one of the best modern countries in the world IMO other countries should aim to be) does not currently have a foreign policy that exploits other nations. You might say that's just because they're small and don't have the power to, and that's fair.

I don't know of any specifically Danish atrocities at the moment, but the Danes benefit like the rest of us in the West/global North/what have you from the poverty and exploitation imperialism brought.

  A better example is what the US did to Japan after WW2. Japan was an exploitable enemy nation the US had immense power over. The US did not turn Japan into a country of slaves to make cheap goods for America, although short term they were making cheap goods for America, they turned Japan into a capitalist democratic nation that over the following decades rose to become one of the most powerful countries in the world.

Japan is poor in natural resources and land. Hell, from the Japanese perspective, that was the major cause of the war. Lousy place for resource extraction, lousy place for plantations, great place for a naval base.

  It depends on what your definition of exploitation is. I'm fine with someone taking the surplus value of another's labour if both people's standards of living are rising, especially one we can tax the "exploiter" and redistribute the wealth back to the "exploitee". And extreme exploitation is being reduced. Before, there were literal slaves in the US. Now there aren't.
#+end_quote

Flat lie. Slavery is alive and well in the US as allowed by the 13th amendment. Our incarceration rate is not an accident.

  Saudi Arabian and other powerful Muslim states funding terrorists is a problem. It's one we can solve, but not by making the US isolationist. American police killing people every day is a problem, but again it's improving, things are on the right track there, but expecting instant results is unreasonable. Coal subsidies are really nasty, but Denmark doesn't have them, and Denmark is what I want. The US is not the best example of capitalism there is.
#+end_quote

First, I insist that you stop projecting isolationism onto my arguments. "Socialism in one country" was one of Stalin's madnesses and I disavow it yet again.

US (and British) imperialism created and have sustained KSA for its whole existence, funding its promulgation of wahhabism both directly and indirectly. The US (again in partnership with the UK) overthrew the democratically elected government of Iran to install their pet dictator, causing the Islamic revolution.

But the solution is not isolation, and I have not suggested it is. Globalism and the international project surely share, if nothing else, a recognition that we are not American or Saudi or anything else but human.

  Forgot to reply to a couple points. The alienation of late stage capitalism isn't causing a backlash, Brexit and Trump and Duterte are just a couple missteps in an otherwise improving world. Trump says a lot of really nasty things and done a few bad things, but hasn't actually done much that'll shake up the country long term. Brexit and Duterte are pretty small in the grand scheme of things.

This is an extremely large pile of unjustified optimism.

Generally the world is getting better on reducing extreme poverty, increasing literacy, that stuff. If you want me to bring some official stats in I will.

Generally, slowly true. But millions die waiting.

  International rallying has been the socialist's cry, but it hasn't actually worked very well. Working from your perspective that the USSR did so badly from USA intervention, if the USA goes through a similar revolution, what's to stop China from intervening in the USA and establishing themselves as an hyper power?

For the third time this thread, no one country can progress alone.
