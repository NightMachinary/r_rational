Forgot to reply to a couple points. The alienation of late stage capitalism isn't causing a backlash, Brexit and Trump and Duterte are just a couple missteps in an otherwise improving world. Trump says a lot of really nasty things and done a few bad things, but hasn't actually done much that'll shake up the country long term. Brexit and Duterte are pretty small in the grand scheme of things. Generally the world is getting better on reducing extreme poverty, increasing literacy, that stuff. If you want me to bring some official stats in I will.

International rallying has been the socialist's cry, but it hasn't actually worked very well. Working from your perspective that the USSR did so badly from USA intervention, if the USA goes through a similar revolution, what's to stop China from intervening in the USA and establishing themselves as an hyper power?
