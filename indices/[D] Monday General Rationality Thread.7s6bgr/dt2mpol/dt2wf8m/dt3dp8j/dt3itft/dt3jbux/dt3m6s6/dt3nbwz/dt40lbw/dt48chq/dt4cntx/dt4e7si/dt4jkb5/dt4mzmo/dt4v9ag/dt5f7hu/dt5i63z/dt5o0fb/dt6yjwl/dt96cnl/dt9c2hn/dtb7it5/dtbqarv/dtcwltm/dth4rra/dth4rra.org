  The purpose of copyrights and patents isn't to ensure businesses can earn money for their works, the intended purpose is so that people, artists and inventors, can earn money for their works. That purpose has been so perverted by capitalists that you literally don't even remember it. Gotta go. As for relying on US businesses to do all the medical research, I wouldn't. Patents are actually worse, because the nature of invention and discovery is that each step is upon the shoulders of giants. There is no entirely novel invention in the world, only refinements and adaptations and combinations of existing things. All patents do is hobble that process.

Individual people that have patents essentially count as a business for the purpose of this discussion. I don't see a meaningful way, when discussing patents in the manner we are, how Disney the company holding a patent and Walt Disney the person holding a patent are different. And if Disney isn't allowed to hold a copyright, they won't make as much money to make movies like Frozen, so they won't make as many movies like Frozen. That's bad. If Disney makes some amazing movie, some random person shouldn't be able to make a cheap Frozen toy and make money off of Disney's work and investment. The copyright shouldn't last forever, but at least ten years would be good. How do you want medical research to proceed without patents? Does the government take up research? Do the people vote on which drugs they'll try to advance, do we elect someone who's head of research, does Congress vote on which drugs receive funding?

  I don't trust cops to correctly identify nazis, and I don't want the state suppressing political speech. I also don't want the nazis dead or enslaved, merely punched.
#+end_quote

Say you punch someone. You claim they're a nazi. They claim you're a lunatic. The court rules on it. Then the courts are identifying nazis, and they're pretty close to cops. Another scenario. You punch someone. They were clearly a nazi, everyone agrees in it, you were in the right according to Nazi Punching Law. But they had a medical condition that made them more vulnerable, and they die. Do you go to jail?

  Nope. Don't agree. I don't approve of any weapon-based gun control, only person-based gun control. There are definitely people who shouldn't have guns, but I don't think there are any guns people shouldn't have. I'm really not sure how to proceed here. Not letting civilians have access to artillery or large caliber automatic weapons seems like an obvious choice to me. I don't suppose you have sources or examples of your policy working?

  Freeing slaves is never wrong.

Even in states that have legalized marijuana, they have not implemented retroactive immunity, immediate release, and reparations for previous marijuana-related crimes. I specified this one because this trend would/will likely extend to the hopeful repealing of the rest of these bad laws.

The are just so many problems with legalized prison breaks. There are good laws. Murderers should stay in prison for at least some time, I hope you can agree. Your proposal would make it legal to break them out. That's a big issue. Also any rich person could always hire people to break them out of prison, so you're essentially giving the rich legal immunity.

  This is bad history. If slavery stopped because white people suddenly grew a conscience, why did it take a hundred more years and a massive protest movement for black Americans to secure the ability to vote?
#+end_quote

There's a big difference between thinking someone should be a slave and thinking someone doesn't deserve a vote. Becoming more moral as a culture is a slow process that takes time, but it's happening. There wasn't any economic incentives to discriminate against gays, but over time we've become less discriminatory. The only explanation I can think of is us as a culture becoming more moral.

  If I've got a neoliberal saying that requiring work to live is a problem to be solved rather than The Market Working, I'll call it good. My only quibble is that it's not actually money we need to worry about running out of, but stuff like food and houses. Money is just a token. When the market "loses" or "gains" x million or billion dollars, nothing is actually destroyed or created. All the actual stuff is right where it was before.
#+end_quote

Go to [[/r/neoliberal]]. I think most everyone agrees people shouldn't work to live, it's just a necessary reality, and one that's pretty quickly fading. And when the market loses x million dollars, that money lost does represent something. Maybe it'd poured million of dollars into designing a phone that didn't sell, then all the research was essentially wasted. It is not meaningless.

  Good joke.

Every job isn't minimum wage. If companies colluded to only pay minimum wage, they would be. Why aren't companies all colluding? The laws are working.

  Fuckin' sez you. And, now that you say it, no Skyrim might be an okay price to pay for no CoD or Madden. Really, though, there're a lot of people who like Skyrim, and in fact probably more stuff for Skyrim produced by random modders for free than actually by Bethesda.
#+end_quote

What Skyrim level game has been produced by small indie developers who don't have the resources and organization of a corporation? Also, a lot of people like CoD and Madden. The entire principle of liberalism is that if CoD or Madden were really bad games, no one would be buying them. 12 year olds and casual gamers have interests too, and their favourite genres shouldn't be killed off because they're different genres than what you like. Also this is the discussion I really want to focus on. The other stuff were tangents I don't care a ton about. But this discussion about how the production of the highest level games will only be possible will corporations is the driving reason why liberalism is good(and I hope it's implied other industries are benefited in the same way).

People are not going to organize under anarchy and make AAA games. Lots of people have lots of free time even today. None of them join together to craft an AAA game. The video game industry is probably among the easiest for people to join together and make something AAA level too, under any other industry AAA equivalents would have an even harder time getting made. And even if you're willing to give up AAA products, lots of people aren't.
