  Sure. I just have an exceedingly hard time picturing how you're going to reach anarchy. You say that you want workers around the world to unite like communists always wanted, but I do not see any practical way of that happening. It's even more unlikely than a single country reforming/revolutioning to anarchy. If you could draw me a clearer path of how we go from here to your world in a best-case reform scenario(that you could envision actually happening, like more than approximately 1 in 1014(about the odds of winning a major lottery twice in a row). The odds of course are approximate, but no stuff like having all American citizens just decide to become anarchists and let the state disintegrate on its own) and worst-case revolution scenario(that does work), that'd be great.

This is basically the same question as your parallel post, so I'll just refer you to my parallel reply.

  Copyrights and patents exist for a reason. They ensure businesses can earn money for their works, motivating them to create works. Copyright law does go on for too long, but copyrights should exist for longer than a year and less than what it is now. I think patents are actually good as they are, twenty years isn't too bad. It's terrible that a company can charge $1000 for a medicine that takes $2 to manufacture, but better than never inventing that medicine at all. I'm not even sure a Denmark-esque model where companies aren't allowed to do that would be good, since right now non-US countries essentially have their healthcare subsidized by the fact that it's the US paying the costs for research, not them.
#+end_quote

The purpose of copyrights and patents isn't to ensure businesses can earn money for their works, the intended purpose is so that people, artists and inventors, can earn money for their works. That purpose has been so perverted by capitalists that you literally don't even remember it. Gotta go. As for relying on US businesses to do all the medical research, [[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/08/576443442/pfizer-halts-research-efforts-into-alzheimers-and-parkinsons-treatments][I wouldn't]]. Patents are actually worse, because the nature of invention and discovery is that each step is upon the shoulders of giants. There is no entirely novel invention in the world, only refinements and adaptations and combinations of existing things. All patents do is hobble that process.

  Punching Nazis should be illegal. I'm not even sure what you define as a Nazi- does someone who advocate for totalitarian Mussolini-esque rule but not racism count? Does someone who wants to bring back black slavery but hates Hitler and nazism count?
#+end_quote

Yes and yes, though the two tendencies basically always co-occur.

#+begin_quote
  Why not just make being a Nazi illegal, have them sentenced to some sort of punishment, and let formal courts deal with them? We don't solve any other behaviour we don't like by letting others punch people, why is Nazism an exception? If you punch someone, do you have to go to court and prove they're a Nazi to not get arrested for assault?
#+end_quote

I don't trust cops to correctly identify nazis, and I don't want the state suppressing political speech. I also don't want the nazis dead or enslaved, merely punched.

#+begin_quote
  We need to draw a line somewhere. I think we can agree owning a 50mm working artillery piece should be illegal, given how easy it would be to cause mass devastation with it and it'd have no purpose besides causing mass devastation. We can agree owning an hunting rifle, whether for use at a gun range or for actually hunting, should be legal. Where do you draw the line in between there on what weapons should be legal and which should be illegal? Gun control has always been one of the issues I've been most conflicted on, so I'm really not sure where to draw the line.
#+end_quote

Nope. Don't agree. I don't approve of any weapon-based gun control, only person-based gun control. There are definitely people who shouldn't have guns, but I don't think there are any guns people shouldn't have.

#+begin_quote
  This is basically the same issue as the copyright/patent issue I think.
#+end_quote

Not quite, because DMCA. Even circumventing DRM for the purpose of fair use under the existing extremely restrictive copyright is illegal in the US.

#+begin_quote
  I haven't actually heard of this issue and a quick google search doesn't turn up any good reading. Off the top my head that'd be good for preventing North Korea from getting better missiles, but if you could share some reading that'd be great.
#+end_quote

The search term you want is ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulation). The problem with it is that basically any really interesting technology can be a weapon. All space rockets are overqualified as ICBMs. Any really useful beamed power device would basically be a death ray. Any entity which can build a fission plant can build a nuclear bomb. And Niven's Kzinti Lesson: "a reaction drive's efficiency as a weapon is in direct proportion to its efficiency as a drive." (from the excellent short story [[https://www.baen.com/Chapters/9781451639001/9781451639001___4.htm]["The Warriors"]]) ITAR is an export ban on many of the technologies necessary to build a positive future.

  This should definitely be illegal. If we make storming prisons for just the laws you mentioned legal, might as well make those laws no longer exist. If we make storming prisons in general legal, then nothing to stop the family of a terrorist from storming the prison to free the terrorist.
#+end_quote

Freeing slaves is never wrong.

Even in states that have legalized marijuana, they have not implemented retroactive immunity, immediate release, and reparations for previous marijuana-related crimes. I specified this one because this trend would/will likely extend to the hopeful repealing of the rest of these bad laws.

#+begin_quote
  This is just something we have to overcome, not by getting rid of liberalism, but by being better people. It was in white people's best interest to keep slavery. It was stopped because people were moral.
#+end_quote

This is bad history. If slavery stopped because white people suddenly grew a conscience, why did it take a hundred more years and a massive protest movement for black Americans to secure the ability to vote?

#+begin_quote
  Granted it was only stopped when it was no longer as much of a money maker as it used to be, but we can still make progress against NIMBYism.
#+end_quote

So, the lesson to take is to make it no longer profitable to be a NIMBY. Okay.

#+begin_quote
  I think we agree on this. I support an universal basic income that can give people everything they need, or at least as high as we can make it without running out of money. We'll put in an universal basic income or otherwise expand welfare so people don't need to work.
#+end_quote

If I've got a neoliberal saying that requiring work to live is a problem to be solved rather than The Market Working, I'll call it good. My only quibble is that it's not actually money we need to worry about running out of, but stuff like food and houses. Money is just a token. When the market "loses" or "gains" x million or billion dollars, nothing is actually destroyed or created. All the actual stuff is right where it was before.

#+begin_quote
  If they're 5 different employers, and one of them pays $1/hour and the others pay $2/hour, if there isn't surplus employees, no one will go to the $1/hour employer, and if there is surplus, the $1/hour employer will still only be able to hire the least capable. So the employer would be motivated to raise to $2/hour. Unless the job would only earn the employer $1.50 an hour, in which case the job would just disappear, and that's not good. Maybe the 5 different employers conspire together to only pay $1/hour. That's illegal and they'd go to jail.

  Employers...go to jail.
#+end_quote

Good joke.

  Denmark has unions. They are strong unions. Therefore strong unions are possible, and more achievable than anarchy which is the archenemy of the superintelligence.
#+end_quote

Unions can't survive automation. It's the perfect scab.

#+begin_quote
  I think switching from socialism to anarchy and capitalism to liberalism was productive. That's just pedantic.
#+end_quote

No, it's a snarky TL;DR of something like a Marxist theory of labor relations.

#+begin_quote
  No, that's feudalism, maybe mercantilism. Resources were better distributed in the US than the USSR. I know the USSR isn't socialism or anarchy, but it's still an example of non-liberalism. Anyways, I do agree some degree of redistribution is good. But redistributing all resources is incredibly inefficient and not going to work well.
#+end_quote

No, it's the [[https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressreleases/2017-01-16/just-8-men-own-same-wealth-half-world][actual real liberal capitalist world we both live in.]]

  A lot of neat indie games will be made. No AAA Skyrim-esque games will be made, since it'd require a level of cooperation not possible in anarchy.
#+end_quote

Fuckin' sez you. And, now that you say it, no Skyrim might be an okay price to pay for no CoD or Madden. Really, though, there're a lot of people who like Skyrim, and in fact probably more stuff for Skyrim produced by random modders for free than actually by Bethesda.

  I really can't seem to find the part that'll explain the Culture's solution to video game making or large scale pharmaceutical invention, or effective distribution of resources.
#+end_quote

That's not what I posted it for and I kinda just want people to read it in general. My mistake putting it in the same paragraph. But since you asked, Culture people have basically finished pharmaceutical invention and resource distribution, and are free to make games all day if they want to.
