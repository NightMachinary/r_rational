  I told you already, having no concern for efficiency and just trying to get people jobs and welfare has been tried and failed. The Soviet Union and every other communist nation was founded on the concept. Much of the world excluding the US were doing government funded inefficient industries so the working class had advantages.

Between the idiocy and the CIA assassinations and the extremely self-contradictory notion of a "communist nation," tankies are pretty fucking hopeless.

  You presumably consider the Nordic countries a good example of the ideal nation states. I do too. They do not have minimum wages. They do rely heavily on market forces, not government forces, to determine wages and prices. They have strong unions that set minimum wages for each industry, which works because if an industry is growing weaker, then for it to keep any jobs it'll need to lower pay, which a government federal minimum wage would unflexibly disallow.

No. I reject wholly the premise here: of an "ideal nation state." No such thing. A nation state carries with it millennia of toxic bullshit and constitutes hierarchy. The ideal is obviously to destroy all forms of hierarchy, and also death. State, corporate, everything. The state capitalism of the soviets and the child sex slave emporiums of the anarchocapitalists are extremes of concentrated hierarchy.

If you want to talk about ideals, my ideal is something like, "[[http://www.vavatch.co.uk/books/banks/cultnote.htm][the Culture]], but with a willingness to live forever and more enthusiasm for megastructures."
