The culture might work in a post-scarcity galactic civilization with powerful AIs, but that is not the reality we live in. The reality we live in is that "the market" is a super intelligence driven by billions of peoples of decisions that any sort of central planning cannot match.

Do you have any sort of reasonable plan to reach that point anyways? The ideal form of civilization is one thing to discuss in theory and another to actually discuss in practice.
