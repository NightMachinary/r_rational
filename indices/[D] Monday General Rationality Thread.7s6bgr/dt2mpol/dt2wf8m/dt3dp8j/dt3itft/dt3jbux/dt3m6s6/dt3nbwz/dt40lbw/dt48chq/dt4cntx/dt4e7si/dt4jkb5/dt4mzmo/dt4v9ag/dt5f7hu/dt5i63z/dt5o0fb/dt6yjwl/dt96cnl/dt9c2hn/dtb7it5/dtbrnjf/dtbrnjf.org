I was thinking a bit more on this and decided I really needed to see your best-case, worst-case scenarios to understand your position but I didn't provide you one. We are talking past each other a bit.

Best case scenario: I've separated this into a couple different areas to be a bit more organized.

Branch 1, international economic reform: Reforms to increase immigration. Reforms to increase free trade. More countries sharing a single currency. Movements to create European Union style unions in more continents. Those unions joining together into a single global government with no trade barriers or immigration barriers.

Branch 2, renewable power: Continue to build solar panels in areas where they're effective. Build fission nuclear reactors where solar panels are not effective. Massive investment(like hundreds of billions of dollars) into nuclear fusion research.

Branch 3, Nuclear bombs: Dismantle lots of nuclear bombs. Keep enough for MAD, like each major power can keep 10 big bombs, but that's it. No need to have any risk of ending all human life.

Other stuff: Switch to proportional voting like what Germany has. Reform drug laws and housing laws. Set up an universal basic income. Set corporate tax to 0% over a period of 15 years to make sure it has the predicted effects, raise income tax on high brackets, capital gains tax, and estate taxes to compensate.

This is all accomplished by the general population smartening up and realizing those are good ideas. Not particularly likely, but not unimaginable and this is a best case scenario. They then consistently elect Hillary Clinton style politicians and rely on professional advisors within the current system.

Those are all the big things I think.

Worse case scenario is that the general population goes even further away from those ideas but not catastrophically so, and rapidly increasing technology gives us a post-scarcity utopia anyways.
