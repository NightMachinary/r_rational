Can you define fascist for me, and give me a few examples of what policies you think they'll enact? When I hear fascist I think Hitler or Mussolini, but you seem to be using it to group everyone two steps to the political, economic, and social right of me together, kind of.

Using your options, I'd rank 3 as by far the most likely except an overall liberal distribution of (at least extreme luxury) resources model remains for pretty much forever. Number 4 is the next mostly likely, although I have pretty high hopes that won't occur in the majority of the human population so even if the West falls China'll advance to greatness only a couple decades slower. And I still don't think it's particularly likely even to occur in just one major country.

I have no idea what the odds of 5 or 1 are, I'm not going to guess at them. I can't say number 2 without a clearer explanation of fascism, and how exactly fascists take over the majority of the planet.
