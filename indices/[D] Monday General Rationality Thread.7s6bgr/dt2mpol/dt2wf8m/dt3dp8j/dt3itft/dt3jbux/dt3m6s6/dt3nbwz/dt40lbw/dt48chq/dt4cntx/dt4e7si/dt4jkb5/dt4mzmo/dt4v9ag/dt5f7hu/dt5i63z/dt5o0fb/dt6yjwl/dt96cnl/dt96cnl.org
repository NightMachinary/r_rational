  Capitalism's only been dominant for the past two centuries at most. Before that feudalism and mercantilism were in control. What's your definition of capitalism then? Because we're going to have to agree on one or we'll just be talking past each other.
#+end_quote

I'm counting mercantilism, since it's just capitalism with concessions to kings instead of to the people, as modern liberal/ neoliberal capitalism does. Capitalism is basically the condition where people have to give a shit about money.

#+begin_quote
  The problem with this definition is that it quickly runs into problems when there are limited resources and multiple people want the same stuff. If there's one 100 units of gold but 101 people want an unit of gold, there's not much you can do about it.
#+end_quote

The goal is post-scarcity. But on the way there, we must simply do the best we can. Each of them get 0.9900... units gold and then they collaborate to go grab some random space rock with 10 million units gold. But it might also be worth thinking about why a hundred people want gold. It's not all that useful a material actually, and pretty much everything it can do copper can do almost as well. Do they want it because it's shiny?

  As for people being free to do what they want to do, there's only a few things in the US that are wrongfully illegal IMO. Some of the punishments are way off and some things need to be fine tuned better, but most of the restrictions are good.

We've already established you don't know a damn thing about the US criminal justice system, so maybe shut up about it.

  A lot of homeless people are homeless because they have disabilities or conditions that make them very hard to house.
#+end_quote

Hard to employ. Say what you really mean. They could be housed by the simple expedient of opening (literal, physical) doors to them. They just cannot pay you to open said doors.

  The housing market is broken because of some bad regulations in some areas. Not that we should just get rid of all government intervention and believe the market will fix itself. The government does have a role to play, but it has to be careful. I'll be honest, I'm not sure what the most effective way for the government to intervene is, I'd have to read up on it, I just know price controls aren't it. Building low income housing sounds good, since it's fine for the government to undertake charity.
#+end_quote

The housing market is broken because it's a market on a necessity. If a government just goes and starts building housing, the housing-sellers and homeowners raise holy hell over "property values" being depressed by the new, more available housing.

#+begin_quote
  That just sounds like reality. If people don't work but get as many resources as they want, we'll run out of resources rapidly. We are not in a post-scarcity society. But I am fine with giving limited resources. I like the idea of universal basic incomes and other welfare programs are fine to.
#+end_quote

We do live in a post scarcity society in terms of many things already, like food.

Kropotkin already replied to this fear of running out.

"'But provisions will run short in a month!' our critics at once exclaim. 'So much the better,' say we. It will prove that for the first time on record the people have had enough to eat."

  If you only can work for McDonald's, they'll pay you $1 even if you're earning them $8 because you have no other options. If you have a choice between McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, etc. you can negotiate for an higher salary,
#+end_quote

lol

#+begin_quote
  and having balanced negotiating power is extremely important.
#+end_quote

True. Which is why companies spend so much time and money demonizing unions.

#+begin_quote
  So the US government might set the minimum wage to $9 and McDonald's would never higher you since they'd be losing money, even if you'd want to take the job for $6 or $7.
#+end_quote

In that case, there would be no reason to support McDonald's continued existence.

#+begin_quote
  I said this before. If both parties benefit, even if one party is benefiting more and is being "exploitative", it's a net good. If everyone's getting richer, I don't care so much if the 1% are getting super-richer. But taxes to redistribute that wealth are still good and still exist, mitigating the issue further.
#+end_quote

Your mistake here is taking the full set of technological aids to living standard and attributing them all to the exploitative dynamic of capitalism.
