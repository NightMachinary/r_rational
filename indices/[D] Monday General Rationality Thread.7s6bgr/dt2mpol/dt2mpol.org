tl;dr: The hypothetical rogue AI's job of turning our world into a dystopia (at best) is already slowly being completed by corporations (governments, etc) because that's just what the evolutionary selection criteria dictate them to do in their biomes (e.g. unhealthy competition in financial markets, quarterly profit reports, etc).

[[/r/rational/]] and other related communities, as well as the more mainstream infosphere is full of hypothetical discussions about how AIs should be restricted /when/ they finally become a finished thing. However, not much practical discussion is happening on restricting those agents that not only are similar to such rogue AIs but also already exist and already are influencing the structure of the world-wide political, economical, legal, ecological, etc systems.

Is it because corporations --- and corporate unions, governments, etc --- have no sense of novelty as phenomena, so what they do gets overlooked as part of the “Normal”, the status quo? Or maybe it's because it's easy to imagine how you'd be fighting some imaginary monsters that don't exist yet in real world, but when it comes to real gargantuan entities like these mentioned, people just realize just how helpless they are and don't even contemplate trying to change something?

And mostly, even when people /do/ try to change something (through protests, activism, etc) it either has no results or the results are just not enough in the constant tug of war (e.g. privacy rights, internet rights, ecological regulations, etc). And even then the energy is being directed against specific things that are happening /right now/, instead of against the underlying system (of values economical, political, etc) that is the cause of all these symptoms. People often talk about problems of a two-party political system, or modern capitalism, etc, but what actual, concrete things have been happening towards adding working muzzles for the relevant agents operating in these fields, or towards changing the very basic nature of these systems?
