I feel like your statement, that many [[/r/rational]] type people are not interested in the dangers of capitalism, is false. For just one example, [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][the most popular post]] from Slate Star Codex, an [[/r/rational]] related blog, is about the dangers of capitalism.

That aside, while it's true that AI and current-world-structure (corporations, etc.) have many similarities, they function quite differently in important ways.

The type of AI that [[/r/rational]] type people are interested in are not rogue AIs that turn the world into a dystopia; they're rogue AIs that exterminate the human race in a matter of days from when they're created. While dystopia is bad, extermination is (probably) worse.

And, like you said, it's /very hard/ to destroy capitalism, but it's relatively easy to make a stand against AI risk because there's hardly anyone working on it. I'd guess something like a couple hundred people worldwide are working on AI risk while hundreds of thousands of people worldwide a working on capitalism.
