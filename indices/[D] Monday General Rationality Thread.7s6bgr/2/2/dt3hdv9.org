I would replace "Romance" with "Character focused".

I think in general fiction can usually be split into these categories. Where a story is based on either exploration of a world through actions and reactions (Plot focused), or it's based on the interactions between characters with the plot around the characters mostly being used as a means to explore those relationships.

The best stories (IMO) manage to form a middle ground between the two, where the characters appear to have real agency within their world and the actions that they do take reveal more nuances about the characters themselves and their relationships to others. But most stories lean in one direction or the other.
