I've been thinking about the organization of fanfiction recently. I don't have any big takeaways here, but I think it's fairly interesting.

I feel like fanfiction can roughly be broken down into two categories: plot and romance. Plot fanfics are fanfics that, while they might have romances, the focus of the story is on things happening. Almost all non-fanfiction literature is the equivalent of this category. Romance fanfics are fanfics that are only based on romance and there might not be plot at all. While not technically romance, one shots based on cute character interactions, etc. are also in this category. Trashy romance novels are the non-fanfiction version of this category.

Also, it's fairly obvious that some types of fiction are much better for /plot/ fanfiction than others. I propose that this can be determined by what I call the "self-insert test." If you were to insert yourself as one of the main characters in the fiction, how much can you influence what happens while still playing your part? In something like Harry Potter or Naruto, there's a ton. In something like Sherlock Holmes or The Martian, there's hardly anything.

I'd also like to propose that how rational a work of fiction is correlated with the self-insert test.
