Like, you /could/ break fanfiction into the categories of "romance" and "not romance", but I don't think it's a particularly useful distinction, because either "not-romance" completely excludes a lot of plot-heavy stuff because it has the barest trace of romance, or you get into the paradox-of-the-heap thing where you have to define "how much romance is romance." And as [[/u/jeray2000]] said, you get into the weird situation where some erotica fits into that not-romance category because you can have porn without any semblance of actual romance.

Really, the "tagging" approach to genres is probably the best: almost every work fits into multiple, non-exclusive genres, but to different degrees. Harry potter is heavily fantasy, lightly romance, moderately adventure, and moderately high-school. Twilight is heavily romance, lightly adventure, moderately fantasy, and lightly high-school.

Also, while your hypothesis in your third paragraph is somewhat correct (some fandoms naturally lead towards romance fics, some naturally lead towards action-y fics), you're misinterpreting the causes. If find the greatest predictor of whether a fandom is romance-dominated is the proportion of young girls in that fandom, while the greatest predictor of whether a fandom is action-dominated is the proportion of older men (older still only being "in their twenties") in the fandom. Worm and MLP:FiM predominantly have older males as their fandoms, and as a result are inundated with action-heavy fics. Harry Potter and Naruto are more mixed, and reflect that by having plenty of both romance and actiony fics. One Direction, being almost exclusively female, has overwhelmingly romance fics.

The "self-insert test", as you call it, doesn't directly predict that prevalence of actiony fics. Rather, it's part of an equation that predicts how many total fics there are in a fandom. Namely, (potential audience for fandom)/(proportion of potential audience that writes fanfiction)/(percent of potential audience a work of this quality is likely to get the attention of)/(average works per fanfic-writer)/(percent suitability for writing the kinds of fanfics the potential fanfiction-writing audience ) = total # of fics. So for works written towards males, who typically want power fantasies, a high score on the "self-insert test" means that those males are more likely to write fanfiction for that work instead of another work, which in turn results in more action-y fanfics. Meanwhile, even if your work is better suited for action fics than romance fics, if your potential audience is primarily of the kind that wants to write romance fics, you're still going to overwhelmingly get romance fics, because the people who want to write action-y fics will move to a fandom where more people want to /read/ action-y fics.
