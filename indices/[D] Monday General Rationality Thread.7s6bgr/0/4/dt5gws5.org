i was actually giving this some thought the other day, and i guess the thing about corporations (in their existing pre-AGI form) is that while they're paperclip maximizers in many ways, there's an important distinction: decisions are all made by people. And people generally have more complicated motivations than stock prices, so that /potential/ for morality makes it less risky than a paperclip maximizer AI.

And it doesn't even have to be morality - there are other ways people can make decisions that get in the way of corporate paperclipping - embezzling funds, leaking privileged information to the press, just being lazy...

I think the difference isn't so much that we're used to one and not the other, but that it's like a comparison between a particularly vicious grizzly bear and a particularly dumb three toed sloth.
