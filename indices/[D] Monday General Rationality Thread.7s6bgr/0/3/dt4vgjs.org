[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/27/things-that-are-not-superintelligences/][This]] SSC article talks about all the reasons trying to compare things which are not AGI to AGI is never really that useful or accurate if you want to make more than an /extremely/ abstract comparison.

Organizations are fundamentally different from AGI in that they are never really much smarter than the smartest people within them and often much less than that, plus they are quite slow in their operations. Because of that organizations are a bad metaphor for AGI since they are extremely slow and not particularly smart, so they are far less of a danger than an actual superintelligent /agent/.
