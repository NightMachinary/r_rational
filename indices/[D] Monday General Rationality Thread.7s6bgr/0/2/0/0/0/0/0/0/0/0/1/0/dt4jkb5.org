Those warlords were created by European colonialism and reactionary beliefs within Africa, not capitalism. Capitalist countries may have supported some, but capitalism itself didn't make them.

I think it's much less difficult to get rid of those warlords than it is to create global socialism. They can be destroyed without destroying capitalism. Dictatorship and strife has been globally decreasing over the past 80 years. It's just a matter of time now.

Your system seems like it needs the whole world to adopt it as well. If just the US adopts it, Russia will march in and conquer the US.

The status quo is better than violent revolution. Violent revolution isn't inevitable either, right now we're not on a perfect course, but it's good enough that people aren't going to be motivated to risk their lives.
