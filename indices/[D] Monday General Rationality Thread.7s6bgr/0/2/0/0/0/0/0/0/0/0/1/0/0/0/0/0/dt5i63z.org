  Are you saying this as if it makes the situation not-capitalism somehow? Not sure where you're going with this.
#+end_quote

To be clear, my definition of capitalism is the ability of people to freely choose what skills they want to develop, who they want to work for, what they want to buy, and what they want to sell. The less freedom people have to do what they want, the less capitalist. Sometimes that's good, e.g it's a good thing people aren't free to sell heroin. I don't want pure anarcho-capitalism. Sometimes it's bad, for example rent controls limit people's ability to sell housing how they want, leading to people not developing housing as much as they should because it's not profitable.

Colonialism is a very bad thing, 1. Because it's actively immoral and hurting people, and 2. It's not granting them freedom to work where they want, they're being forced into labour. When labour is forced, it's not capitalism.

  The social order at home was funded by exploitation abroad, as ever. Even after the Belgian government took their mad king's abattoir, they left the administration intact and the exploitation going for another half century, just somewhat less bloodily.
#+end_quote

It didn't have to be funded by foreign exploitation. Belgium was doing pretty well prior to their gaining colonies. Drawing the line so we don't do terrible things to others can be tricky, but I don't think it's as tricky as trying to create a socialist utopia that actually functions. Denmark's doing pretty well. Japan is a major country that doesn't even have a military force for foreign intervention.

  I don't know of any specifically Danish atrocities at the moment, but the Danes benefit like the rest of us in the West/global North/what have you from the poverty and exploitation imperialism brought.
#+end_quote

Yes, they benefit, but my point is a capitalist state that doesn't actively exploit others can exist. If Africa and Asia begun to raise their standards of living and were non-exploited, Denmark wouldn't collapse, especially since it'd probably mean Africa and Asia would have even higher production capacity to trade.

  Japan is poor in natural resources and land. Hell, from the Japanese perspective, that was the major cause of the war. Lousy place for resource extraction, lousy place for plantations, great place for a naval base.

Interesting perspective I haven't seen before. It still shows it's not impossible for weak countries to rise through capitalism.

  Flat lie. Slavery is alive and well in the US as allowed by the 13th amendment. Our incarceration rate is not an accident.
#+end_quote

I'm not super familiar with the prison situation in the US, it probably is bad, lots of developed countries have a fine incarceration rate though and the US can fix its issues too. It's still easier than the radical changes you suggest.

#+begin_quote
  First, I insist that you stop projecting isolationism onto my arguments. "Socialism in one country" was one of Stalin's madnesses and I disavow it yet again. US (and British) imperialism created and have sustained KSA for its whole existence, funding its promulgation of wahhabism both directly and indirectly. The US (again in partnership with the UK) overthrew the democratically elected government of Iran to install their pet dictator, causing the Islamic revolution. But the solution is not isolation, and I have not suggested it is. Globalism and the international project surely share, if nothing else, a recognition that we are not American or Saudi or anything else but human.
#+end_quote

What is the solution? Say Great Britain goes through a successful change, peaceful or violent, to your ideal state in the next five years and it works. How does Great Britain spread the socialism and stop terrorism?

  This is an extremely large pile of unjustified optimism.
#+end_quote

I think you're a large pile of unjustified pessimism. Europe's had elections since Trump too, and while reactionaries and nationalists have done better in some areas, liberals like Macron have won too. Doug Jones beat Roy Moore. Reactionary forces are not riding an unstoppable wave.

#+begin_quote
  For the third time this thread, no one country can progress alone.
#+end_quote

How could this possibly be accomplished? The US going through violent revolution to end up in a socialist state is unlikely enough. The entire world going through violent revolution to all end up in a socialist state is virtually impossible. I'm fine with slow Sanders-esque reforms though, since I believe they'll just stop from the point the US is currently at when they arrive at my beliefs and never get to the socialist point. Unless technology changes a lot of things, automation and AI may make your socialist state more realistic.
