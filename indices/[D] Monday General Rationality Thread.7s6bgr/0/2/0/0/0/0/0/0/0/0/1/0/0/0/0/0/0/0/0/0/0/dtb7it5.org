  I think we need two different words then, because we're both using capitalism for two different things. How about instead of my version of capitalism, which is about freedom of various things, I'll say "liberalism". It has connotations which also include freedom of press and democracy, but those are both pretty essential to what I was referring to as capitalism so I think it works.

Alright, let's talk about liberalism. And since we're changing words, allow me to swap "socialism" for "anarchy." I consider them inseparable and mean both when I say one. You have a persistent wrong notion that socialism implies a (strong) state. It has been demonstrated that a state is not the path to (socialism/anarchy). Anarchy opposes all hierarchy, and a state is a pretty massive expression of hierarchy.

  Gold is good at holding value. It doesn't corrode easily, so it doesn't naturally depreciate like how copper fairly easily rusts. It's pretty rare, it's relatively unlikely a massive new mine or a trade agreement with Chile will change it's value much. It's been traditionally something that holds value and that momentum helps it along.

Value is a spook, a made-up thing that we all agree to pretend is real. Gold holds value because people want it because gold holds value because people want it because... It's a closed loop, with minor outflows for electronic or catalytic or whatever use. Part of what anarchy aims to do is collapse pointless loops like that. But I didn't mention the space rock part for nothing. There are individual rocks out there with more precious metals than we've mined in all of history.

  Weighted preference seems like a fair model. The guy who loves gold gets more gold than everyone else, but fewer other resources. The guy who thinks gold and copper are equal gets extra copper. Liberalism is a super-intelligence at distributing these resources in weighted preferences.

Sure, weighted preferences seems like a fair model to distribute luxuries. But there're two problems here, and either is fatal alone.

First, capitalism in practice fails to resemble in any way this ideal system of yours. The actual outcome of your hypothetical is that of your hundred people, one person's big toe owns almost all the gold, sapphires, diamonds, copper, and food. The problem with creating superintelligences, as has been stated around here too many times to count, is that you have to be really really sure their optimization criteria match your own, or they'll eat your planet to make paperclips. Liberalism is paperclipping the planet to make shareholder value this quarter.

Second, liberals haven't just unleashed their rogue superintelligence on luxuries, but on necessities. In doing so, it treats human people as resources, fundamentally demeaning and endangering them.

  Isn't this a learning conversation? Let me know what you think is wrongfully illegal. I'm guessing marijuana usage is something we both agree on, but I'm not sure what else is blatantly wrong. Maybe illegal immigration being illegal, open borders would be nice, but that'll have to be worked towards, it'd be chaos if they were completely opened immeadiately.

So, first, fuck the law and all cops are bastards. But for the moment, assuming a transitory period of socdems with laws and shit before we establish complete anarchy, here's a (non-exhaustive, emphatically not ordered) list of things which are wrongfully illegal in the US:

-Use and possession of any drug

-Distribution of any drug with the possible exception of opiates

-Infringing on a copyright

-Infringing on a patent

-Jaywalking

-Marrying multiple adults at once

-Punching nazis

-Occupying empty buildings

-Public nudity

-Taking things from dumpsters

-Owning various specific types of firearms

-Living here while having been born on the wrong patch of dirt without winning a literal lottery

-Giving away food and supplies to unhoused people

-Protesting in unapproved areas

-Ever voting after having been convicted of a felony (in many states)

-Reverse engineering DRM software or hardware

-Exporting space rocket technology

-Storming the bastilles to free the modern-day slaves captured under the aforementioned laws.
