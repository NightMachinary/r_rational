Alright, so I see five basic categories of future to consider:

1: Global thermonuclear war wipes out humans or reduces us to the ancestral condition: no farming or writing. Bad future, 0/10

2: Fascists take and consolidate power, liberals help them as usual out of fear that socialists will take their +toothbrushes+ factories just like liberals did last time fascists took and consolidated power. Bad future, 1/10

3: Liberals don't cooperate with fascists for once, and gradually more socialist policies (policies which increase the freedom of choice for everyone) are enacted over the protests of business owners. Variations on liberalism form the right wing of politics, and variations on social-democracy the left, and even though automation kills unions, people are educated and materially secure enough not to vote against their class interests. Over the same period of time, megastructures to democratize access to space (Lofstrom loops, rotovators, and eventually orbital rings) are built and we can all escape the well and its hierarchies. Good but implausibly gentle and smooth future, 10/10

4: Revolution. Like future #2, but the fascists don't win completely. They're eventually overthrown and replaced with a succession of various shitty governments, from emperors to state-capitalists to liberals, and billions die even faster than they do now. Maybe eventually, sane societies come out the other side and take another shot at future #3. Only temporarily bad future, 2/10

5: Strong AI or other black swan, weird future, ?/10

I'd put them in order of descending likelihood 5, 4, 1, 2, 3.
