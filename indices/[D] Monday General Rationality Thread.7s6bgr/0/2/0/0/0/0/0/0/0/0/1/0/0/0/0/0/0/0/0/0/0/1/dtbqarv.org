  Alright, let's talk about liberalism. And since we're changing words, allow me to swap "socialism" for "anarchy." I consider them inseparable and mean both when I say one. You have a persistent wrong notion that socialism implies a (strong) state. It has been demonstrated that a state is not the path to (socialism/anarchy). Anarchy opposes all hierarchy, and a state is a pretty massive expression of hierarchy.
#+end_quote

Sure. I just have an exceedingly hard time picturing how you're going to reach anarchy. You say that you want workers around the world to unite like communists always wanted, but I do not see any practical way of that happening. It's even more unlikely than a single country reforming/revolutioning to anarchy. If you could draw me a clearer path of how we go from here to your world in a best-case reform scenario(that you could envision actually happening, like more than approximately 1 in 10^{14(about} the odds of winning a major lottery twice in a row). The odds of course are approximate, but no stuff like having all American citizens just decide to become anarchists and let the state disintegrate on its own) and worst-case revolution scenario(that does work), that'd be great.

  Value is a spook, a made-up thing that we all agree to pretend is real. Gold holds value because people want it because gold holds value because people want it because... It's a closed loop, with minor outflows for electronic or catalytic or whatever use. Part of what anarchy aims to do is collapse pointless loops like that. But I didn't mention the space rock part for nothing. There are individual rocks out there with more precious metals than we've mined in all of history.

Checked in with my neoliberal brethren because I wasn't totally sure about the correct response to this was, and the conclusion is that you're right on this one. My bad.

Good list. A lot of those things shouldn't be illegal, I agree, although some of them should be. If I don't respond to it, I agree it shouldn't be legal, and reform would be good, but also think any sort of violent reform would be a terrible idea.

Copyrights and patents exist for a reason. They ensure businesses can earn money for their works, motivating them to create works. Copyright law does go on for too long, but copyrights should exist for longer than a year and less than what it is now. I think patents are actually good as they are, twenty years isn't too bad. It's terrible that a company can charge $1000 for a medicine that takes $2 to manufacture, but better than never inventing that medicine at all. I'm not even sure a Denmark-esque model where companies aren't allowed to do that would be good, since right now non-US countries essentially have their healthcare subsidized by the fact that it's the US paying the costs for research, not them.

Punching Nazis should be illegal. I'm not even sure what you define as a Nazi- does someone who advocate for totalitarian Mussolini-esque rule but not racism count? Does someone who wants to bring back black slavery but hates Hitler and nazism count? Why not just make being a Nazi illegal, have them sentenced to some sort of punishment, and let formal courts deal with them? We don't solve any other behaviour we don't like by letting others punch people, why is Nazism an exception? If you punch someone, do you have to go to court and prove they're a Nazi to not get arrested for assault?

  Owning various specific types of firearms
#+end_quote

We need to draw a line somewhere. I think we can agree owning a 50mm working artillery piece should be illegal, given how easy it would be to cause mass devastation with it and it'd have no purpose besides causing mass devastation. We can agree owning an hunting rifle, whether for use at a gun range or for actually hunting, should be legal. Where do you draw the line in between there on what weapons should be legal and which should be illegal? Gun control has always been one of the issues I've been most conflicted on, so I'm really not sure where to draw the line.

#+begin_quote
  -Reverse engineering DRM software or hardware
#+end_quote

This is basically the same issue as the copyright/patent issue I think.

#+begin_quote
  -Exporting space rocket technology
#+end_quote

I haven't actually heard of this issue and a quick google search doesn't turn up any good reading. Off the top my head that'd be good for preventing North Korea from getting better missiles, but if you could share some reading that'd be great.

#+begin_quote
  -Storming the bastilles to free the modern-day slaves captured under the aforementioned laws.
#+end_quote

This should definitely be illegal. If we make storming prisons for just the laws you mentioned legal, might as well make those laws no longer exist. If we make storming prisons in general legal, then nothing to stop the family of a terrorist from storming the prison to free the terrorist.

  I'll have you know I rant about filthy NIMBYs too. The problem here isn't just NIMBYs, though, it's that liberalism actively makes it in homeowners' best interests personally to be NIMBYs. It rewards them by increasing their "property value" score, and that makes them feel good, and that interaction is one tiny fractal piece of the rogue superintelligence. Not only that, it also punishes them by reducing their score for not being sufficiently NIMBY.
#+end_quote

This is just something we have to overcome, not by getting rid of liberalism, but by being better people. It was in white people's best interest to keep slavery. It was stopped because people were moral. Granted it was only stopped when it was no longer as much of a money maker as it used to be, but we can still make progress against NIMBYism.

#+begin_quote
  Good. Now, are you ready to generalize the lesson? If people have everything they need, they will approach a somewhat equitable negotiating position, and having done so, will have no need to sell their hours and become employees, but can instead work together on what they wish.
#+end_quote

I think we agree on this. I support an universal basic income that can give people everything they need, or at least as high as we can make it without running out of money.

#+begin_quote
  Nobody wants a minimum wage job. Currently, many people need minimum wage jobs to survive. The fact that several allied billionaires instead of just one run fast food makes no material difference.
#+end_quote

We'll put in an universal basic income or otherwise expand welfare so people don't need to work.

But you seem to be missing the economics point I'm making about supply and demand. If there is 1 job and 100 people want it, the employer can pay dirt. If there's 1 job and 2 people want it, then the employer's going to have to pay more or the potential employees will walk away knowing they're valuable.

If they're 5 different employers, and one of them pays $1/hour and the others pay $2/hour, if there isn't surplus employees, no one will go to the $1/hour employer, and if there is surplus, the $1/hour employer will still only be able to hire the least capable. So the employer would be motivated to raise to $2/hour. Unless the job would only earn the employer $1.50 an hour, in which case the job would just disappear, and that's not good. Maybe the 5 different employers conspire together to only pay $1/hour. That's illegal and they'd go to jail.

But my point is, competition is good. The reason Comcast is so bad is that they don't have much competition.

  Unions are good, but the rogue superintelligence hates them because they can harm its shareholder value this quarter. It thus incentivizes the human actors who (are/serve) it to fight them.
#+end_quote

Denmark has unions. They are strong unions. Therefore strong unions are possible, and more achievable than anarchy which is the archenemy of the superintelligence.

  You can't earn something for someone else, silly. "Earn" means your own achievement.

I think switching from socialism to anarchy and capitalism to liberalism was productive. That's just pedantic.

  What's happening isn't the rich guy ending up with 2 gold, it's the rich guy ending up with all the gold and making the government a tool to keep it that way.
#+end_quote

No, that's feudalism, maybe mercantilism. Resources were better distributed in the US than the USSR. I know the USSR isn't socialism or anarchy, but it's still an example of non-liberalism. Anyways, I do agree some degree of redistribution is good. But redistributing all resources is incredibly inefficient and not going to work well.

  I don't see any compelling reason to govern video games as an industry. If the tools are open, and the people have time to use them, they'll build plenty of neat games. Please, please do read that link about the Culture, it's just an essay, you've probably read more of my words than its total length at this point.
#+end_quote

A lot of neat indie games will be made. No AAA Skyrim-esque games will be made, since it'd require a level of cooperation not possible in anarchy.

I really can't seem to find the part that'll explain the Culture's solution to video game making or large scale pharmaceutical invention, or effective distribution of resources.
