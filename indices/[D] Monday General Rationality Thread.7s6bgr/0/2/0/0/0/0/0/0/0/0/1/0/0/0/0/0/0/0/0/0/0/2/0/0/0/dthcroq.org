  Can you define fascist for me, and give me a few examples of what policies you think they'll enact? When I hear fascist I think Hitler or Mussolini, but you seem to be using it to group everyone two steps to the political, economic, and social right of me together, kind of.

[[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/][Here's]] a good description of fascism. The author uses "ur-fascism" to indicate the generalized form.

  Using your options, I'd rank 3 as by far the most likely except an overall liberal distribution of (at least extreme luxury) resources model remains for pretty much forever.

When have humans ever done a social change the most peaceful and gentle way?

  Number 4 is the next mostly likely, although I have pretty high hopes that won't occur in the majority of the human population so even if the West falls China'll advance to greatness only a couple decades slower. And I still don't think it's particularly likely even to occur in just one major country.

And what if the US falls to fascism and decides that we have always been at war with China?

  I have no idea what the odds of 5 or 1 are, I'm not going to guess at them.

Well, 5 is so broad that it will happen sooner or later. "Something weird and unexpected will eventually happen" is not a bold prediction. As for 1, just remember that you're only alive now because of people like Stanislav Petrov and Vasili Arkhipov.
