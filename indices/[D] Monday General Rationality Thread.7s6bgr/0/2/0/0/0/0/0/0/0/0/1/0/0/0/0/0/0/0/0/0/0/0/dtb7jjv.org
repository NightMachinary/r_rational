  No, I mean hard to house. Not hard to employ as in they're missing an arm, hard to house as in they're hard drug users or mentally unstable and will literally destroy any home given. If they're missing an arm, I think it's a good idea to give welfare so they're not on the street. Mental disability that won't make them actual damage the home can be given similar help. Not all people who could fairly easily receive homes do, but that's a problem with the US, not liberalism. Denmark is doing much better in that regard.
#+end_quote

Basically, I don't believe you about literal destruction. Maybe they'll destroy the property value or, heaven forbid, make it dirty, but I kinda doubt they'll tear their own roofs down on themselves. Unhoused people don't destroy the stuff they have, they protect it. The narrative that the poorest among us bring their own suffering is leftover Calvinist trash-memes.

  They will. NIMBYism is a big problem. You rant about the filthy elite who steal money from the poor, I rant about the filthy NIMBYs who don't allow effective regulation of markets at the expense of the poor. I think it's easier and more effective to try to fix NIMBYism than to try to nationalize every unused home and try to hand them out. Maybe nationalizing houses is good policy in some areas, I think it's rare one policy fits all, but it'd probably be a policy best taken at the by specific municipalities and shouldn't be generalized to too many different municipalities.

I'll have you know I rant about filthy NIMBYs too. The problem here isn't just NIMBYs, though, it's that liberalism actively makes it in homeowners' best interests personally to be NIMBYs. It rewards them by increasing their "property value" score, and that makes them feel good, and that interaction is one tiny fractal piece of the rogue superintelligence. Not only that, it also punishes them by reducing their score for not being sufficiently NIMBY.

  I think we agree on this. I'm fine for people getting free food. Food stamps do exist. It can probably be expanded or made more effective. And that'll be a good thing, going back a few points, if people don't have to work to not-starve, that'll give them more negotiating power and I think workers having more negotiating power is generally a good thing.
#+end_quote

Good. Now, are you ready to generalize the lesson? If people have everything they need, they will approach a somewhat equitable negotiating position, and having done so, will have no need to sell their hours and become employees, but can instead work together on what they wish.

  Working conditions in McDonald's are not good. It is delusional to think they wouldn't be immensely worse if there were fewer companies providing minimum wage jobs. There are a lot of people who wants minimum wage jobs so it gives companies a lot of negotiating power, so conditions are bad, but conditions would only be worse if there were fewer businesses offering minimum wage jobs.
#+end_quote

Nobody wants a minimum wage job. Currently, many people need minimum wage jobs to survive. The fact that several allied billionaires instead of just one run fast food makes no material difference.

#+begin_quote
  I agree. Unions are good. Denmark has great unions.
#+end_quote

Unions are good, but the rogue superintelligence hates them because they can harm its shareholder value this quarter. It thus incentivizes the human actors who (are/serve) it to fight them.

#+begin_quote
  McDonald's can still hire other employees. There are diminishing returns. First employee earns them $50, next earns them $40, next earns $30, keep going until it's no longer profitable. And your solution to McDonald's, which can provide jobs people do want and can sell products do want, not being able to meet minimum wage is to just shut it down? That just sounds like an intrinsically bad idea. Sometimes minimum wage can be good, forcing McDonald's not to take too much advantage of workers and e.g only hire them for $5 instead of $7 that they just as well could. Other times if forces them to pay $9 they can't afford and not hire someone for $7 who wants the job. It's a tricky balance to manage that takes professional economists.

You can't earn something for someone else, silly. "Earn" means your own achievement.

  I am giving a lot of credit to that. I'm not sure we can prove whether the iPhone could invented as well under a less liberal economy. But that's not all I'm giving credit to it for. Going back to the talk about distributing resources, even if one rich guy ends of with 2 golds where as in a perfect economy distributed by a strong AI he'd only get 1, it'd still be better than trying getting the government to distribute all resources equally. That's the crux of why I think liberalism is good and socialism would not work: the government is not able effectively take into account weighted preferences and changing preferences to efficiently distribute resources, unlike the super intelligence that is liberalism.
#+end_quote

What's happening isn't the rich guy ending up with 2 gold, it's the rich guy ending up with /all/ the gold and making the government a tool to keep it that way.

  A question I want an answer to: until we reach post-scarcity, do you agree at least some industries should be governed by liberalism? For example the video game industry. If the government managed it, they'd have a hard time allocating their resources to different genres and styles that rise and fall in popularity, and would have a very hard time justifying using the taxes of someone who doesn't care at all for video games to pay for the wide variety of genres from first person shooters to visual novels to grand strategy. I just skimmed the link about The Culture so sorry if it's explained there.
#+end_quote

I don't see any compelling reason to govern video games as an industry. If the tools are open, and the people have time to use them, they'll build plenty of neat games. Please, please do read that link about the Culture, it's just an essay, you've probably read more of my words than its total length at this point.
