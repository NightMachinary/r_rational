  Those warlords were created by European colonialism and reactionary beliefs within Africa, not capitalism. Capitalist countries may have supported some, but capitalism itself didn't make them.

"it wasn't real capitalism when the Belgians were hiring mercenaries to cut children's hands off for not meeting rubber quotas"

- You, basically

Africa is the victim of centuries of genocide for profit.

  I think it's much less difficult to get rid of those warlords than it is to create global socialism. They can be destroyed without destroying capitalism.
#+end_quote

They cannot. Without exploitation, capitalism cannot profit.

  Dictatorship and strife has been globally decreasing over the past 80 years. It's just a matter of time now.

Is it? Or is the alienation of late capitalism and the suppression of socialist thought creating a worldwide fascist backlash? From Duterte to Daesh to Brexit and Trump, alienation and rage at the violence inherent in the capitalist system is being leveraged by authoritarians and outright fascists.

  Your system seems like it needs the whole world to adopt it as well. If just the US adopts it, Russia will march in and conquer the US.

Solidarity and the international ideal have been the socialist's rallying cry from the start.

  The status quo is better than violent revolution. Violent revolution isn't inevitable either, right now we're not on a perfect course, but it's good enough that people aren't going to be motivated to risk their lives.

The status quo /is/ violence. The status quo is what created Daesh over half a million Iraqi corpses. The status quo is the American police killing about three people per day. The status quo is coal subsidies while the world burns.
