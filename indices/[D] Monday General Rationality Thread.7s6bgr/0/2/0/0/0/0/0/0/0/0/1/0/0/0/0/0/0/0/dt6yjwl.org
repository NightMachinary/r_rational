  That description is utterly alien to the actual experience of capitalism in its role as the dominant economic ideology of the past few centuries. My definition of socialism could be phrased as the ability of people to freely choose what skills they want to develop, what they want to do, and what they want to have. The less freedom people have to do what they want, the less socialist. Note that supposed "socialist states" also bear no resemblance to this description. We are both dreamers, then, and I contend that my dream is the brighter.

Capitalism's only been dominant for the past two centuries at most. Before that feudalism and mercantilism were in control. What's your definition of capitalism then? Because we're going to have to agree on one or we'll just be talking past each other.

The problem with this definition is that it quickly runs into problems when there are limited resources and multiple people want the same stuff. If there's one 100 units of gold but 101 people want an unit of gold, there's not much you can do about it. As for people being free to do what they want to do, there's only a few things in the US that are wrongfully illegal IMO. Some of the punishments are way off and some things need to be fine tuned better, but most of the restrictions are good.

  Anarcho-capitalism is actually not an ideology, but an attempt to fuck children.

I think anarcho-capitalists are not evil like you're implying, just naively idealistic, but it would lead to that and that is bad. That's why I don't like i.

  How about instead how there are currently more empty investor-owned homes than homeless people in the US? And, even setting that aside and assuming an actual, not structural, housing shortage from a global view, how do you see the problem there being rent controls instead of being that people can only do large scale stuff if it's profitable?

A lot of homeless people are homeless because they have disabilities or conditions that make them very hard to house. The housing market is broken because of some bad regulations in some areas. Not that we should just get rid of all government intervention and believe the market will fix itself. The government does have a role to play, but it has to be careful. I'll be honest, I'm not sure what the most effective way for the government to intervene is, I'd have to read up on it, I just know price controls aren't it. Building low income housing sounds good, since it's fine for the government to undertake charity. Charity is only bad when you're unreasonably expecting corporations to be doing it when they're job is to make money, not charity. Better for them to maximize money then the government taking a portion of that money for charity than to try to get the government to tell/order corporations to give to charity.

  Under capitalism, if you don't work, you starve to death. There is no force greater for compelling labor. That just sounds like reality. If people don't work but get as many resources as they want, we'll run out of resources rapidly. We are not in a post-scarcity society. But I am fine with giving limited resources. I like the idea of universal basic incomes and other welfare programs are fine to. Anyways you missed part of the point that it's not able being forced to work, it's being forced to work without choosing who to work for. If you only can work for McDonald's, they'll pay you $1 even if you're earning them $8 because you have no other options. If you have a choice between McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, etc. you can negotiate for an higher salary, and having balanced negotiating power is extremely important. Denmark et al have strong unions, a big part of why they're so successful. In the US the government is essentially the negotiating power of the lower classes, enforcing minimum wage, maximum hours, etc., but they're inflexible unlike unions. So the US government might set the minimum wage to $9 and McDonald's would never higher you since they'd be losing money, even if you'd want to take the job for $6 or $7.

  What gives a character of passivity to the general exploitation of the worker to extract surplus value? I said this before. If both parties benefit, even if one party is benefiting more and is being "exploitative", it's a net good. If everyone's getting richer, I don't care so much if the 1% are getting super-richer. But taxes to redistribute that wealth are still good and still exist, mitigating the issue further.
