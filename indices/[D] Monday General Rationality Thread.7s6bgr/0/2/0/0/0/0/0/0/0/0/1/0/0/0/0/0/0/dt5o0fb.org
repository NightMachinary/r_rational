  To be clear, my definition of capitalism is the ability of people to freely choose what skills they want to develop, who they want to work for, what they want to buy, and what they want to sell. The less freedom people have to do what they want, the less capitalist.
#+end_quote

That description is utterly alien to the actual experience of capitalism in its role as the dominant economic ideology of the past few centuries.

My definition of socialism could be phrased as the ability of people to freely choose what skills they want to develop, what they want to do, and what they want to have. The less freedom people have to do what they want, the less socialist.

Note that supposed "socialist states" also bear no resemblance to this description.

We are both dreamers, then, and I contend that my dream is the brighter.

  Sometimes that's good, e.g it's a good thing people aren't free to sell heroin. I don't want pure anarcho-capitalism.
#+end_quote

Anarcho-capitalism is actually not an ideology, but an attempt to fuck children.

#+begin_quote
  Sometimes it's bad, for example rent controls limit people's ability to sell housing how they want, leading to people not developing housing as much as they should because it's not profitable.
#+end_quote

How about instead how there are currently more empty investor-owned homes than homeless people in the US? And, even setting that aside and assuming an actual, not structural, housing shortage from a global view, how do you see the problem there being rent controls instead of being that people can only do large scale stuff if it's profitable?

  Colonialism is a very bad thing, 1. Because it's actively immoral and hurting people, and 2. It's not granting them freedom to work where they want, they're being forced into labour. When labour is forced, it's not capitalism.
#+end_quote

Under capitalism, if you don't work, you starve to death. There is no force greater for compelling labor.

#+begin_quote
  Drawing the line so we don't do terrible things to others can be tricky, but I don't think it's as tricky as trying to create a socialist utopia that actually functions.
#+end_quote

The problems are, in fact, isomorphic. If we manage to draw a line so we actually don't do terrible things to others anymore, I'll call it good and declare socialism achieved.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, they benefit, but my point is a capitalist state that doesn't actively exploit others can exist.
#+end_quote

What gives a character of passivity to the general exploitation of the worker to extract surplus value?

#+begin_quote
  What is the solution? Say Great Britain goes through a successful change, peaceful or violent, to your ideal state in the next five years and it works. How does Great Britain spread the socialism and stop terrorism?
#+end_quote

Again, the words "your ideal state" imply that you haven't read a damn thing I've written. So let me use the bluntest possible phrasing. FUCK ALL STATES. Past, present, and hypothetical. Moving on, let's just suppose that the UK goes full put-the-queen-in-a-council-flat labour and achieves relatively-not-barbarism. What can they change? They'll still need resources and goods manufactured around the world, mined in the deathtraps and assembled in the sweatshops of capitalism. They can't expropriate the assets of their parasitic billionaire class, who would simply flee to another bourgeoisie democracy. They can't start a war against the entire global capitalist hegemony. All they could do, practically, is what people can do anyway without a state's power, that is, to try to convince more people.

  I think you're a large pile of unjustified pessimism. Europe's had elections since Trump too, and while reactionaries and nationalists have done better in some areas, liberals like Macron have won too. Doug Jones beat Roy Moore. Reactionary forces are not riding an unstoppable wave.
#+end_quote

Liberals are reactionary defenders of capitalism. Macron's emperor fetish is worrying, and the fact that beating Roy Moore is an achievement speaks more to our doom than the fact that it was (barely) pulled off speaks to our salvation.

#+begin_quote
  How could this possibly be accomplished? The US going through violent revolution to end up in a socialist state is unlikely enough. The entire world going through violent revolution to all end up in a socialist state is virtually impossible.
#+end_quote

Violent revolution is almost the worst possible option, right after a boot stamping on a human face forever. Also, again, all socialist states are impossible contradictions in terms.

#+begin_quote
  I'm fine with slow Sanders-esque reforms though, since I believe they'll just stop from the point the US is currently at when they arrive at my beliefs and never get to the socialist point.
#+end_quote

There's a bold strategy I'm willing to watch play out.

#+begin_quote
  Unless technology changes a lot of things, automation and AI may make your socialist state more realistic.
#+end_quote

A high degree of automation is to be assumed in any vision of a positive future. Strong AI is a black swan, and as such cannot usefully be included in the discussion at this time.
