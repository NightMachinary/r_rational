I was referring mainly to large scale famine from wars, not murders, e.g what's happening in Yemen. If there was a famine the level of Yemen's in India, India would receive a great deal of support because they are relatively peaceful.

But regardless, your proposed solution is exactly what I would encourage in non-war torn countries.
