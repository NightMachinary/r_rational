  "it wasn't real capitalism when the Belgians were hiring mercenaries to cut children's hands off for not meeting rubber quotas"

  You, basically
#+end_quote

Yes, that is me exactly. The children were essentially slaves, and there was a monarch in power in Belgium, albeit a constitutional one. Belgium exercise control in the Congo through military power, not through any sort of democratic process.

Mainland Belgium itself at the time was fairly capitalist and, while I don't know that much about 19th century Belgium, from what I know it's internal policy was pretty good for their time period and technology. Their foreign policy was however downright evil.

A capitalist country does not need to have a downright evil foreign policy. One example would be how Denmark(one of the best modern countries in the world IMO other countries should aim to be) does not currently have a foreign policy that exploits other nations. You might say that's just because they're small and don't have the power to, and that's fair. A better example is what the US did to Japan after WW2. Japan was an exploitable enemy nation the US had immense power over. The US did not turn Japan into a country of slaves to make cheap goods for America, although short term they were making cheap goods for America, they turned Japan into a capitalist democratic nation that over the following decades rose to become one of the most powerful countries in the world. Denmark's is what I want the US to be, but Japan is what I want most of Africa to be.

  They cannot. Without exploitation, capitalism cannot profit.

It depends on what your definition of exploitation is. I'm fine with someone taking the surplus value of another's labour if both people's standards of living are rising, especially one we can tax the "exploiter" and redistribute the wealth back to the "exploitee". And extreme exploitation is being reduced. Before, there were literal slaves in the US. Now there aren't. Before, a fifth of the planet was colonized by the UK and had their resources unfairly extracted. Now, very little of the planet is colonized by the British and former colonies standards of living have been rising for decades.

  The status quo is violence. The status quo is what created Daesh over half a million Iraqi corpses. The status quo is the American police killing about three people per day. The status quo is coal subsidies while the world burns. Saudi Arabian and other powerful Muslim states funding terrorists is a problem. It's one we can solve, but not by making the US isolationist. American police killing people every day is a problem, but again it's improving, things are on the right track there, but expecting instant results is unreasonable. Coal subsidies are really nasty, but Denmark doesn't have them, and Denmark is what I want. The US is not the best example of capitalism there is.
