  I'm counting mercantilism, since it's just capitalism with concessions to kings instead of to the people, as modern liberal/ neoliberal capitalism does. Capitalism is basically the condition where people have to give a shit about money.
#+end_quote

I think we need two different words then, because we're both using capitalism for two different things. How about instead of my version of capitalism, which is about freedom of various things, I'll say "liberalism". It has connotations which also include freedom of press and democracy, but those are both pretty essential to what I was referring to as capitalism so I think it works.

  The goal is post-scarcity. But on the way there, we must simply do the best we can. Each of them get 0.9900... units gold and then they collaborate to go grab some random space rock with 10 million units gold. But it might also be worth thinking about why a hundred people want gold. It's not all that useful a material actually, and pretty much everything it can do copper can do almost as well. Do they want it because it's shiny?
#+end_quote

Gold is good at holding value. It doesn't corrode easily, so it doesn't naturally depreciate like how copper fairly easily rusts. It's pretty rare, it's relatively unlikely a massive new mine or a trade agreement with Chile will change it's value much. It's been traditionally something that holds value and that momentum helps it along. It is useful for conducting electricity in certain scenarios where other metals aren't as useful. It being shiny makes it good for jewelry, that is a value. I think investment in it is fairly silly, there're better investments, but it's not a massive amount of irrationality with no explanation.

But my scarcity argument wasn't actually very good. I haven't debated capitalism in depth very much. It's basis was good but I didn't expand on it much.

Giving everyone an equal amount of gold is fine in a simple economy. I think hunter-gatherers could live in that start of equal distributive economy because they only had a few goods. But when it's a massive economy, it's much more complex.

You have 100 people. You have 10 units of gold. You have 20 units of sapphires. 20 units of diamonds. 100 units of copper. 200 units of food.

How do you distribute it when different people like things different amounts? Some people going, "I like copper just as much as gold, they do practically the same thing." Other's going, "No gold is way better. I'd prefer 1 unit of gold over 200 units of copper". Everyone needs 1 unit of food but after that it's luxury.

Weighted preference seems like a fair model. The guy who loves gold gets more gold than everyone else, but fewer other resources. The guy who thinks gold and copper are equal gets extra copper. Liberalism is a super-intelligence at distributing these resources in weighted preferences.

Problems do result when the mild preferences of the rich take preference over strong preferences of the poor. Like if the gold guy was poor but the equal metals guy was rich, equal metals guy would still end up with more gold. But that's the trade off we pay for a super intelligence that we need to distribute resources in an economy as complex as the one we live. And it's fine to limit that intelligence to make sure that everyone gets their 1 unit of food even if it's not as efficient. You just need to decide if you stop limiting there, go farther so everyone gets one unit of copper too, go even further, go not as far, whatever.

When we reach post-scarcity, your model is fine. Everyone gets as much as they want, it's infinity of every unit. Until then, we need a distributive model of some sort, and I don't think the government is capable of distributing effectively in the modern economy as nice as that would be.

  We've already established you don't know a damn thing about the US criminal justice system, so maybe shut up about it.
#+end_quote

Isn't this a learning conversation? Let me know what you think is wrongfully illegal. I'm guessing marijuana usage is something we both agree on, but I'm not sure what else is blatantly wrong. Maybe illegal immigration being illegal, open borders would be nice, but that'll have to be worked towards, it'd be chaos if they were completely opened immeadiately.

  Hard to employ. Say what you really mean. They could be housed by the simple expedient of opening (literal, physical) doors to them. They just cannot pay you to open said doors.
#+end_quote

No, I mean hard to house. Not hard to employ as in they're missing an arm, hard to house as in they're hard drug users or mentally unstable and will literally destroy any home given. If they're missing an arm, I think it's a good idea to give welfare so they're not on the street. Mental disability that won't make them actual damage the home can be given similar help. Not all people who could fairly easily receive homes do, but that's a problem with the US, not liberalism. Denmark is doing much better in that regard.

Drug users and others who would destroy homes should still be helped too, but if we can house 2 people missing an arm for the cost of one drug user, we prioritize people missing an arm. If we determine if the order of cost effectiveness is: housing people missing an arm, giving total universal health care, housing drug users, then there may not be resources left over for drug users in the current scenario we live in.

  The housing market is broken because it's a market on a necessity. If a government just goes and starts building housing, the housing-sellers and homeowners raise holy hell over "property values" being depressed by the new, more available housing.

They will. NIMBYism is a big problem. You rant about the filthy elite who steal money from the poor, I rant about the filthy NIMBYs who don't allow effective regulation of markets at the expense of the poor. I think it's easier and more effective to try to fix NIMBYism than to try to nationalize every unused home and try to hand them out. Maybe nationalizing houses is good policy in some areas, I think it's rare one policy fits all, but it'd probably be a policy best taken at the by specific municipalities and shouldn't be generalized to too many different municipalities.

  We do live in a post scarcity society in terms of many things already, like food. Kropotkin already replied to this fear of running out. "'But provisions will run short in a month!' our critics at once exclaim. 'So much the better,' say we. It will prove that for the first time on record the people have had enough to eat."
#+end_quote

I think we agree on this. I'm fine for people getting free food. Food stamps do exist. It can probably be expanded or made more effective. And that'll be a good thing, going back a few points, if people don't have to work to not-starve, that'll give them more negotiating power and I think workers having more negotiating power is generally a good thing.

Working conditions in McDonald's are not good. It is delusional to think they wouldn't be immensely worse if there were fewer companies providing minimum wage jobs. There are a lot of people who wants minimum wage jobs so it gives companies a lot of negotiating power, so conditions are bad, but conditions would only be worse if there were fewer businesses offering minimum wage jobs.

#+begin_quote
  True. Which is why companies spend so much time and money demonizing unions.
#+end_quote

I agree. Unions are good. Denmark has great unions.

#+begin_quote
  In that case, there would be no reason to support McDonald's continued existence.
#+end_quote

McDonald's can still hire other employees. There are diminishing returns. First employee earns them $50, next earns them $40, next earns $30, keep going until it's no longer profitable. And your solution to McDonald's, which can provide jobs people do want and can sell products do want, not being able to meet minimum wage is to just shut it down? That just sounds like an intrinsically bad idea. Sometimes minimum wage can be good, forcing McDonald's not to take too much advantage of workers and e.g only hire them for $5 instead of $7 that they just as well could. Other times if forces them to pay $9 they can't afford and not hire someone for $7 who wants the job. It's a tricky balance to manage that takes professional economists.

  Your mistake here is taking the full set of technological aids to living standard and attributing them all to the exploitative dynamic of capitalism.

I am giving a lot of credit to that. I'm not sure we can prove whether the iPhone could invented as well under a less liberal economy. But that's not all I'm giving credit to it for. Going back to the talk about distributing resources, even if one rich guy ends of with 2 golds where as in a perfect economy distributed by a strong AI he'd only get 1, it'd still be better than trying getting the government to distribute all resources equally. That's the crux of why I think liberalism is good and socialism would not work: the government is not able effectively take into account weighted preferences and changing preferences to efficiently distribute resources, unlike the super intelligence that is liberalism. A question I want an answer to: until we reach post-scarcity, do you agree at least some industries should be governed by liberalism? For example the video game industry. If the government managed it, they'd have a hard time allocating their resources to different genres and styles that rise and fall in popularity, and would have a very hard time justifying using the taxes of someone who doesn't care at all for video games to pay for the wide variety of genres from first person shooters to visual novels to grand strategy. I just skimmed the link about The Culture so sorry if it's explained there.
