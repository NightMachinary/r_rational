  Individual people that have patents essentially count as a business for the purpose of this discussion. I don't see a meaningful way, when discussing patents in the manner we are, how Disney the company holding a patent and Walt Disney the person holding a patent are different.
#+end_quote

This is a major problem with liberalism, failing to distinguish between actual people and the paperclip maximizers we call companies. A person with a patent wants it to be actualized. A company with a patent wants to increase shareholder value this quarter, and only cares about making the thing described in the patent if doing so serves that ultimate goal.

  And if Disney isn't allowed to hold a copyright, they won't make as much money to make movies like Frozen, so they won't make as many movies like Frozen.
#+end_quote

Disney didn't make Frozen. A bunch of people made Frozen. Their names are listed at the end. They did it organized hierarchically as a corporation because that's how liberalism works. But have you ever heard of an artist who got into art for the big paychecks?

The fundamental function of copyright and patent is to ensure artists and inventors are fed and supplied, materially free to make more art and inventions. But that function can/must be subsumed into the general function of ensuring all people are fed and supplied, materially free to do what they want to.

  If Disney makes some amazing movie, some random person shouldn't be able to make a cheap Frozen toy and make money off of Disney's work and investment.
#+end_quote

But should some random person be able to make a cheap Frozen toy and give it away, for example to their kid? Should people be able to sing the songs from Frozen? Should they be able to share clips of that one scene? And once you have a few billion people's ideas of that one scene worth sharing, isn't pretty much the whole thing shared? Copyright is ill-suited to our current piecemeal defeat of scarcity.

#+begin_quote
  The copyright shouldn't last forever, but at least ten years would be good.
#+end_quote

While we're on the topic of Disney, Disney specifically has lobbied extensively to extend copyright long, long past all reason, and will likely repeat and successfully lobby to extend next time Mickey gets close to the public domain.

While we still use liberalism and the market, IP law has some very limited use, but it needs to be structured to benefit people, with a short term, no transferability, and no corporate ownership.

  Say you punch someone. You claim they're a nazi. They claim you're a lunatic. The court rules on it. Then the courts are identifying nazis, and they're pretty close to cops.
#+end_quote

Well ideally, everybody simply fails to remember who punched the nazi when the cops ask. Courts are close to cops, but at least there's a jury. And way fewer people get shot in court than interacting with cops. Also, I don't really see a difference between Nazi punching being legal and settled in court and Nazi punching being illegal but widely approved of by a populace fully informed about jury nullification.

#+begin_quote
  Another scenario. You punch someone. They were clearly a nazi, everyone agrees in it, you were in the right according to Nazi Punching Law. But they had a medical condition that made them more vulnerable, and they die. Do you go to jail?
#+end_quote

First of all, obviously cut off their head and freeze it, like we ought to do anytime anyone ever dies. Judging specifics is what juries are for, but one dead nazi is less bad than nazis getting power.

  The are just so many problems with legalized prison breaks. There are good laws. Murderers should stay in prison for at least some time, I hope you can agree. Your proposal would make it legal to break them out. That's a big issue. Also any rich person could always hire people to break them out of prison, so you're essentially giving the rich legal immunity.
#+end_quote

Not in an American prison, no. Not even murderers deserve that. But the thing is that murderers make up a vanishingly small minority of the prison population. Mostly, it's the victims of the war on drugs. Some are in for property crime mostly driven by poverty, and some are in simply for being unable to pay fines or court costs for minor misdemeanors. As long as that is the case, and as long as the 13th amendment isn't amended, the US system of incarceration has no justification to hold people.

And the rich already have legal immunity.

#+begin_quote
  There's a big difference between thinking someone should be a slave and thinking someone doesn't deserve a vote.
#+end_quote

No there isn't. There's a tiny, slight difference of degree, but no difference of intent.

  And when the market loses x million dollars, that money lost does represent something. Maybe it'd poured million of dollars into designing a phone that didn't sell, then all the research was essentially wasted. It is not meaningless.
#+end_quote

It means the bourgeois gamblers have changed their wager, nothing more.

  Every job isn't minimum wage. If companies colluded to only pay minimum wage, they would be. Why aren't companies all colluding? The laws are working.
#+end_quote

The joke is that any employer would actually be punished for labor violations. Each employer individually tries to pay as little as they can get away with, that's just good business. The net effect is as good as collusion. Especially because companies have used their resources to systematically cripple the power of labor with newspeak-riddled crap like 'right to work' laws.

  What Skyrim level game has been produced by small indie developers who don't have the resources and organization of a corporation?
#+end_quote

I already told you and I wasn't joking. Skyrim mods. Unpaid unorganized internet weirdos have done more for Skyrim than Bethesda ever has.

#+begin_quote
  Also, a lot of people like CoD and Madden. The entire principle of liberalism is that if CoD or Madden were really bad games, no one would be buying them.
#+end_quote

You've admitted it doesn't work for gold, why should I expect it to work for Madden?

#+begin_quote
  Also this is the discussion I really want to focus on. The other stuff were tangents I don't care a ton about. But this discussion about how the production of the highest level games will only be possible will corporations is the driving reason why liberalism is good(and I hope it's implied other industries are benefited in the same way).
#+end_quote

This is what you want to focus on? Liberalism kills people every day, and you want to focus on AAA games? I've been being flip about them because they're so utterly secondary.

But let's talk about what I hope is the underlying question here: how are large projects generally to be accomplished without hierarchy?

Let's consider something more impactful. Take NASA and SpaceX. NASA is a bunch of engineers and physicists, with political appointee bosses and congressionally defined goals. SpaceX is a bunch of engineers with a rich workaholic boss and his one goal.

Now SpaceX is actually a fascinating case to consider when talking about organization under liberalism. As much of a proponent and beneficiary of capital as Musk is, he's very carefully keeping SpaceX privately held. This is because he knows The Market doesn't actually care about his goal, and would demand SpaceX deliver profits above all.

But that's an aside. More to the point, what do you think all those engineers and scientists would do if you told them they don't have to work for a living anymore? Would they stop engineering and experimenting? Of course not. Would they scatter to the four winds? Why should they?

No hierarchy doesn't mean no organization.
