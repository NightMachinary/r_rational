I wouldn't say the threat of corporations is overlooked - I mean, the means for addressing the ongoing threat seems to be a key feature of most political ideologies. On the liberal side, you have people saying we can get the government to regulate corporations and make them work for society. "Let's put the AI in a box and use it strictly for our benefit."

On the conservative side, you have people saying that the government is corrupt, inefficient, and unable to effectively regulate corporations. They argue we should relax or even suspend corporate regulations and let competition in the market along with intelligent and well-informed consumers/workers direct the course of corporations. "Don't box the AI, just allow everyone to produce their own competing AI and then let the fittest survive and dominate."

The problem is, corporations already run the mainstream media and corporations fund the media with advertisement. Media outlets that suggest solutions which are bad for corporate profits/shareholder gains will be less likely to get funding than media outlets which do the opposite. "The AI already controls your main sources of information and is allowing you to debate two different options to deal with its increasingly global domination..."

Of course, both sides have something right. Liberals are correct that the side-effects of corporate profit-maximization are a major threat while conservatives are right that corporations tend to take over any government agencies meant to regulate them. Unfortunately, this makes corporations both very dangerous and very hard to control. We're already living in a dystopia of sorts, a world where corporate profits are maximized at the expense of human health and global climate security. "The AI is already maximizing paperclips while leading you to debate about what's causing the change in climate."

The only proven approach I'm aware of for dealing with this is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism][anarcho-syndicalism]]. Basically, workers start forming unions and vote on the services they want their unions to provide (healthcare, disability, education, etc.), and vote to start forming alliances with other unions. The unions use strikes to get employers to pay their workers fairly and thereby enable the unions to provide the benefits the workers have opted for. As the alliances grow larger, the unions provide larger-scale services (disaster assistance, welfare, lobbying, etc.) and gradually a national or even transnational federation of unions is formed which begins providing even more services (security, national infrastructure maintenance and development, etc.). Capitalism and the state gradually become irrelevant as the unions take greater and greater control, using strikes as needed to enforce compliance. When businesses collapse as a result of the strikes, the union turns them into worker-owned cooperatives, transforming capitalism into socialism. With organized voting blocs, the state is gradually taken over and withered into nothing, turning a corrupt republic into an anarchist opt-in direct democracy.

In practice, this was tried in Spain and got to the point of having a large federation of unions providing essential services in Catalonia when a fascist coup in 1936 turned into a civil war and forced their slow transition to happen immediately. An [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Revolution_of_1936][anarchist revolution]] in Catalonia followed and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederaci%C3%B3n_Nacional_del_Trabajo][CNT]]-[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federaci%C3%B3n_Anarquista_Ib%C3%A9rica][FAI]] formed the backbone of an anarchist democracy. George Orwell [[http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/][wrote a book about it]] after he traveled to Spain to join the revolution and even survived getting shot in the neck by a fascist sniper. He wrote:

  "I had dropped more or less by chance into the only community of any size in Western Europe where political consciousness and disbelief in capitalism were more normal than their opposites. Up here in Aragon one was among tens of thousands of people, mainly though not entirely of working-class origin, all living at the same level and mingling on terms of equality. In theory it was perfect equality, and even in practice it was not far from it. There is a sense in which it would be true to say that one was experiencing a foretaste of Socialism, by which I mean that the prevailing mental atmosphere was that of Socialism. Many of the normal motives of civilized life---snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc.---had simply ceased to exist. The ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England; there was no one there except the peasants and ourselves, and no one owned anyone else as his master."

  "There was much in this that I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I recognized it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for...so far as one could judge the people were contented and hopeful. There was no unemployment, and the price of living was still extremely low; you saw very few conspicuously destitute people, and no beggars except the gypsies. Above all, there was a belief in the revolution and the future, a feeling of having suddenly emerged into an era of equality and freedom. Human beings were trying to behave as human beings and not as cogs in the capitalist machine."
