I'm far from that any brand of anarchism is a good way to reorganize our society, but syndicalism does sound like it makes a few steps in the right direction. The system still seems vulnerable to the tribalism and discrimination that are running rampant in modern democracy, but it at least has a way to establish economic incentivizes that don't directly reward exploitation or openly encourage poverty.
