I was thinking about the ponies warning and a recent comment that mlp fanfics seen here are always surprisingly good. Of course, an mlp fanfic would have to be amazingly good to get on here, since mlp seems so far off from [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. You might even argue that the more unsuitable the base material is, the more likely the fanfic of it will be excellent, assuming it gets here. A fanfic, for example, of Culture might only have to be okay to be good enough to get here. A Ren & Stimpy fanfic would have to be awe-inspiring to make it here, so if I saw one here with plenty of upvotes, I'd be very inclined to read it.
