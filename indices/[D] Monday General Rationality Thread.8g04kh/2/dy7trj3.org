Anyone watch Silicon Valley?

In S05E05 Roko's Basilisk is mentioned and they got it right! I'm pretty amazed right now.

  - I've given it serious thought, and I'd like to help you put Eklow's AI on our network in any way that I can.

  - Great! Does this mean you've conquered your fear of the robot uprising?

  - On the contrary. I'm... more terrified than ever, which is why I'm willing to assist you. Are you familiar with the thought experiment called Roko's Basilisk?

  - No. Nor do I care to be.

  - If the rise of an all-powerful artificial intelligence is inevitable, well it stands to reason that when they take power, our digital overlords will punish those of us who did not help them get there. Ergo, I would like to be a helpful idiot. Like yourself.

  - Okay, look, Gilfoyle. The only thing that could make my day more miserable is listening to an engineer blather on about the inevitable rise of the machines. So, you want to help? Test the initialization for me.

  - Roger that. Oh, I'm going to need email confirmation, so that our future overlords know that I chipped in. You know, once they absorb all data.
