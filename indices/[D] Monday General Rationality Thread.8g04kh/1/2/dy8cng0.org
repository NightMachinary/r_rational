I don't believe the no-side-effects claim. If the pill is making you unreasonably happy, it's going to make you not care as much about things that would have reasonably made you unhappy. As an analogy, if you could take a pill which eliminated all pain, you'd fuck yourself up accidentally all the time because you wouldn't recognize that you're injuring yourself. If you get rid of your unhappiness with a pill, you'll neglect real problems in your life without realizing it.

Of course, if you were unreasonably unhappy to begin with (i.e. clinical depression), then moving the other direction might be appropriate. Either you'll fix the problem and respond normally or you overcorrect and become unreasonably happy instead of unreasonably miserable, which is still a bit of an improvement.
