Nah. Exercise accomplishes that purpose for me. If it didn't, I'd be less likely to exercise. I tend to enjoy the time I spend working out, at least after the fact, and having abs is nice. Even with no direct side effects, I think the pill would sap motivation from an area of my life I enjoy. Now, a pill that made me not need 9 hours of sleep a night? I'd take that in a heartbeat. I have very fond memories of back when I was in elementary school and only needed 6 a night. Now it seems no matter how I try I can't quite reclaim that, or even manage 7.5 consistently.
