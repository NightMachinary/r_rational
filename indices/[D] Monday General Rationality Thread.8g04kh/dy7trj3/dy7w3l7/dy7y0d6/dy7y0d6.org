That's an interesting and pretty accurate description :)

Sure, but isn't that kind of how our society functions? Without caring about what others care about, you would never be able to create and grow communities. The basilisk itself may be absurd or overmentioned, but it still provides an entry point into a way of thinking you're not normally exposed to. For example, thinking about whether you should care about simulations / clones of yourself as if they were you.

And even if you hate every mention of it due to oversaturation, I still think it's nice since it shows the absorption of concepts originating from the "rational community" into popular culture. The mention in the show ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/SiliconValleyHBO/comments/8e7xez/silicon_valley_5x05_facial_recognition_episode/dxtecjt/][and reddit thread]]) gave the corresponding rationalwiki article and thus the whole wiki public exposure, which I think is great. Just look at all those juicy things the wiki article links to that it might get people to read.

I mean realistically, if you could have any mention of a concept you might see here on a comedy show in less than 20 seconds, what would it be?
