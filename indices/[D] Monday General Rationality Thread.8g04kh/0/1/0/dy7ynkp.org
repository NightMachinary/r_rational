  List of conversation topics
#+end_quote

As I mentioned last time that list came up, I think that kind of "roll a d20 to chose a subject" methodology makes for poor socializing. (also, some of these questions kind of suck; eg: "Where are your preferred borders between Europe and Asia?")

But thanks :)

Yeah, I think it's clear you're missing a frame of reference.

Speaking from experience, alternatively asking questions of each other can get pretty stilted if you don't have a "spark". I think you don't realize how awkward these questions and your methodology would be on a date.

Efficient socializing and dating requires adaptability most of all, and preparation quickly becomes counter-productive. It's an improv game; the rules are flexible, and in a sense, you need to figure them out in real time, which is part of why math/computer nerds are typically bad at it.
