Having insufficiently interesting 'conversation subjects' doesn't strike me as a real problem.

As you say, you could talk about your interests all day, so if you're having issues with communication it's got to be coming from the other party. I'm making a guess from your other responses that you think conversation drives attraction, but I think this is wrong and that attraction drives conversation. For example, I believe that if a girl were on a date with Ryan Reynolds (or w/e superstar), she could listen to him talk all day about his hobbies of 'watching paint dry' and 'killing hobos' and then walk out of it thinking she just connected with her soulmate.

Good or bad conversation can influence how you connect with a person, but I fundamentally think the words don't matter. Tone, vocality, body language, reciprocity, all that stuff is important... But the actually words could be nonsense.

To directly answer your question about how you can have compelling, unique conversations with new dates? Hit the gym, dress well, use skin care products, etc..

TLDR; to use the cliche... be attractive; don't be unattractive.
