The problem is, thinking about my first dates, the ones that were /really successful/ (leading to 5 year + relationships), I don't have a clue what happened, only that I e.g. planned to meet a guy for coffee for 2 hours and we ended up talking for 8 hours straight about nothing in particular, just because we had good chemistry and built a rapport. Ditto with my now-husband, we met at a friend's party and both ended up talking to each other for 4-5 hours about god knows what (I think about atheism/the skeptic movement, this was circa 2007 so it was not as neckbeardy a thing to discuss then).

I had a "less successful" relationship that only lasted about 8 months and I remember finding it kind of awkward / not gelling perfectly. Then after our first date I managed to convince him to go roller skating with me, and we went roller skating and he was as inept as you'd expect a first-time roller skater, and then for some reason we made out in the car afterwards and it was.... it was furious makeouts... and that was what I credit with being the seed that gave the relationship its longevity. So you know? Just... be really good at smooching!

I don't have any specific advice, I think having a few conversation topics in mind would be good - if you're getting dates from OKC still, make sure you don't talk about one of the parts of their profile that makes for a good conversation topic and hold that in reserve to have something to discuss on the first date.

Another general conversationalism tip is, when someone tells you what their job is, if your first thought is "wow, any idiot could do that job/it sounds so boring", go against that instinct and say "wow, that sounds like a difficult job, what's the hardest part?" - everyone thinks their job is difficult, and without fail whenever I ask someone with a "dumb" job this their eyes light up and they go and tell me about some aspect of their job that is really difficult and I get a new appreciation for it. This sounds kind of similar to your rationalist spark / "what makes you passionate" thing, but has the advantage about being about a very concrete topic that is also not very intimate.
