  Yeah, but the thing is I don't really connect with men or women.

Which is why you probably would benefit from lowering your standards and dating everyone you possibly can; or, perhaps more productively, go on [[http://www.meetup.com][www.meetup.com]] and find meetup groups in your area. English/French practise, science fiction fans, they have singles meetups, hell, even something like "yoga in the park", whatever you find interesting (or bearable if you can't find interesting). There's dozens and dozens in my Australian city of 2 million so I'm sure you'll have no trouble wherever you happen to be. You'll probably find something with similar-ish people (atheist or skeptics meetups are common and likely to have your demographic), and get good practise building rapports with a large group of strangers.

... I actually met a guy on meetup.com that I had a short and very, very bad FWB thing going on with (we're still great friends though he lives in another country now). We used to have "dates" after the skeptic book club that met at his house. So you know, you can connect with people at those sorts of things too.
