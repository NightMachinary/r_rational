  I think someone else mentioned it but you want to replace the word "girl" with "women" or even "dates" in statements like this
#+end_quote

Ugh. I'm 22! I'm still basically a kid! I don't date "women". I wouldn't know how to approach one! (also, I thought ToaKra was being sarcastic)

  women are just like men
#+end_quote

Yeah, but the thing is I don't really connect with men or women. Most men are shallow in ways I dislike a little; most women are shallow in ways I dislike a lot. So, you know, that's a barrier to overcome and all.

(I'm really not as misogynist or misanthrope as this makes me sound)

#+begin_quote
  have you tried going for every single date you possibly can, even with women you know you wouldn't want to go on a second date with?
#+end_quote

"Say, you look like a fine introverted, socially isolated young man with niche hobbies who spends most of his time on the internet. Have you tried getting a ton of dates?"

"Yes."

"Right, but have you tried online dating and lowering your standards and staying in emotionally unsatisfying relationships?"

"... Yes."

:P

But seriously, I'll repeat what I said something I said last time we had this discussion: don't worry too much for me!

The way I see it, dating as a nerd guy is like job hunting: it's a solvable problem, it's just soul-crushingly difficult. I'm looking for shortcuts, but I'm not desperate.
