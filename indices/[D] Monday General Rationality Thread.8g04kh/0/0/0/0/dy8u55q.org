I think there's definitely a "hardest part" of grad school stuff: maybe framing it as "what do you find the most challenging" would be a better jumping off point? If you'd asked me that question when I was writing my undergrad thesis I would have ranted about how unreliable my supervisor was, so you know, you'd still get a convo out of it.

I think someone else mentioned it but you want to replace the word "girl" with "women" or even "dates" in statements like this, it probably seems stupid but it really does sound disrespectful to the modern ear.

Anyway, old chestnut is women are just like men, so if you can emotionally connect with men then you can emotionally connect with women. Which I'm sure isn't satisfying for you at all.

I don't think there's a way to improve your chemistry without a lot of practice: have you tried going for every single date you possibly can, even with women you know you wouldn't want to go on a second date with? Would low stakes like that help?
