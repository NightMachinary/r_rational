Let's optimize dating! But in a socially aware way!

One of the problems I've had while dating is that I have a really hard time finding conversation subjects. This is kind of a catch-22: once you have a close relationship with someone, you get a sense of what subjects they're interested in, you have a few recurring themes that you can come back to and you know your common interests well enough that you can start a conversation from scratch easily enough; but you need to have interesting conversations in the first place to build that level of familiarity.

Ideally, the kind of conversations I'd want to have with new dates are about what they care about (I can talk about /my/ interests all day with very little prompting). The very specific type of conversation I'm aiming for is one where the girl I'm talking to tells me about what she thinks everyone else gets wrong. Like, the rationalist itch? I think everyone has it at one point or another, that moment where they go "Man, X should really be that way, but most people who do X do it that over way instead, that sucks!". I've had these conversations a few times, and I really loved them, and I always felt like I was connecting with the person I was talking to, like I was glimpsing at a piece of their source code, you know?

The problem is getting to this conversation gold. I don't really know how to do that except by chance. I mean, I guess I could just tell my date everything I just said, but:

- It requires some social trust that's not always there (although I think that's more of an excuse to weasel out than a real cost-benefit statement),
- It can grind the conversation to a halt; the girl I'm talking to doesn't /necessarily/ have a pamphlet on her life and personality and interests that she's just waiting to dump on me; and I mean, if someone asked /me/ "What are your deepest passions in life", I don't know if I'd find something interesting to say on the spot.
- Asking "hey, can the conversation be about that subject and have that structure" is a very stilted way to go about socializing, and you don't want all your conversations with your SO to start out that way for weeks.

What I'm getting to is, I'm looking for ways to drive a conversation towards the compelling, unique aspects of someone's personality without being overly structured about it. Anyone have experience doing that?
