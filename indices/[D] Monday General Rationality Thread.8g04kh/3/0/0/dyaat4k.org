  Personally, I think that feedback is valuable, but less valuable when it has little thought or charity put into it. e.g. "good" negative feedback being something like, "This chapter didn't work for me, because the fight scene didn't really seem to have much in the way of stakes, and it was a bit of a retread of something that happened earlier in the story", where "bad" negative feedback looks something like "This story is kind of shit. I don't understand the hype." (Both of these are paraphrases of comments that I've gotten in the past month.)

Well I wouldn't say the difference in your quotes is charity or thought but of specificity. Saying this story is shit is as useful as saying this story is great, all you learn is that what you're currently

  More generally, I'm a fan of Slate Star Codex's comment philosophy, which can be summed up as any two of true, necessary, and kind. See here.

Hadn't heard of that, I like the analysis, though I think the problem will clearly arise from all three of those. People thinking things are true, when the author disagrees, people thinking things are necessary (to be honest it seems to me that literally nothing would fall under this category) would probably be the biggest problem since a lot of people have the opinion that it's necessary to stop people from being eternally tortured in the afterlife due to their ignorance about the Dark Lord Sauron or something, most people probably know when they're being kind but the internet makes it clearly very hard to read tone into messages.

  To the problem at hand, if you feel that you might be writing a comment that might demotivate an author whose work you'd like to see more of, I would say that emphasizing "kind" is probably wise from a strict utility standpoint, assuming that your goal in giving criticism or negative feedback is to improve the work, rather than to publicly gripe about something that annoyed you and get it off your chest.

Depends on how they get motivated, but yeah in general, I agree. Speaking of which I really loved Glimwarden wink wink.

  (This goes double if there's a chance that you've misunderstood the author's intent, essential facts of the story, etc.)

I doubt that most people who makes messages are aware that they have misunderstood or think that it's not clear.
