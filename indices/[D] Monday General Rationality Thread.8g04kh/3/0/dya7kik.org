Personally, I think that feedback is valuable, but less valuable when it has little thought or charity put into it. e.g. "good" negative feedback being something like, "This chapter didn't work for me, because the fight scene didn't really seem to have much in the way of stakes, and it was a bit of a retread of something that happened earlier in the story", where "bad" negative feedback looks something like "This story is kind of shit. I don't understand the hype." (Both of these are paraphrases of comments that I've gotten in the past month.)

More generally, I'm a fan of Slate Star Codex's comment philosophy, which can be summed up as any two of true, necessary, and kind. [[http://slatestarcodex.com/comments/][See here.]]

To the problem at hand, if you feel that you might be writing a comment that might demotivate an author whose work you'd like to see more of, I would say that emphasizing "kind" is probably wise from a strict utility standpoint, assuming that your goal in giving criticism or negative feedback is to improve the work, rather than to publicly gripe about something that annoyed you and get it off your chest. This will /also/ probably help to smooth the line of communication between yourself and the author, and help your voice be heard, so should be general practice even if the author hasn't expressed any particular reaction to negative feedback.

(This goes double if there's a chance that you've misunderstood the author's intent, essential facts of the story, etc.)

Note that the only rule this subreddit has is to the effect of being pleasant, and we /very/ rarely give out warnings about people being unpleasant unless it's part of a persistent problem, community consensus, or something else. Bans are extremely rare for a community of this size, mostly reserved for the extreme cases. I recuse myself from all moderator action on stories that I write for (obvious) reasons of conflict of interest.
