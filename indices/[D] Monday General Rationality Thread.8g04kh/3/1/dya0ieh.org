None of these. Ask the mods to post and enforce a sticky that actual discussion of the story is out-of-bounds, or is restricted to only positive comments.

And when commenting, always try to not hurt the author too much, at least if he/she hangs out here (critique can be kind or can be discouraging, depending both on tone and the author's state of mind).
