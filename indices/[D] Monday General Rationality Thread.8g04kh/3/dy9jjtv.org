Let's do a thought experiment on writing, prompted by some recent interaction in this subreddit.

Let's imagine an author who is discouraged by all feedback. They write content and post it publicly, but if there are any comments, no matter how positive, they find it harder to write. This attention fright doesn't apply to just posting the link somewhere, it's only real to them when they see comments.

This author is posted to [[/r/rational]] and reads it personally and sees their own thread. The work they produce has a net positive and it gets considerable upvotes.

Is it bad to leave a comment? Should we avoid doing so? Should any comments left be downvoted and be automatically hidden (which doesn't decrease the persons motivation)?

Let's move it closer to a home, an author loses motivation from any comment that they can ever read as negative, and gains motivation from those that can only be read as positive. Think a very pessimistic person who automatically assumes everyone hates their story. Even the most well couched criticism will decrease their motivation to write. Again, their story is enjoyable to some people on the subreddit and they get some upvotes.

Should you only comment positive things and downvote to hide the negative things?

And finally the most realistic case an author claims to be motivated by both positive comments and the nebulous "well" formed criticism, but demotivated by negative comments and "poorly" formed criticism, no one is sure what standard the author uses for this form of well and poorly.

Should you risk commenting with criticism? Or stick with just purely good comments? There seems to be some quantity effect here where even 1000 good comments don't outweigh a single poor comment? Should you hope the author has the same mindset as the average [[/r/rational]] downvote weight and upvote/downvote every single comment to categorise it?
