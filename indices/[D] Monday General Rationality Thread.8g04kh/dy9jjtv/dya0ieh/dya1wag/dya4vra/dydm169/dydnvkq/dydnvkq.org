True. Let me give a hypothetical example:

Suppose we lived in a parallel world where Ayn Rand was a low-key writer posting on [[/r/rational]], and we now see weekly updates posting new chapters of "Atlas Shrugged". Some people would tune out after the first chapters with "meh, lame". I would not tune out immediately (imho the beginning is not badly written and an intriguing premise), but would consider it "vile stuff", and totally call out this somewhat talented writer for advocating genocide-through-starvation as well as not thinking through her premises. This would supersede considerations of kindness and hope for more production.

Not thinking though her premises: very small fraction of "force sensitives", but very weak heritability; this means that a pure "force sensitive" population cannot be stable, by numbers, which is a problem that her protagonists must tackle instead of ignore. A more believable background would have been as a Worm-fanfic (establishing parahuman feudalism by letting the masses get eaten by the endbringers).
