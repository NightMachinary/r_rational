I prefer moderation to downvoting for enforcement of this kind of thing. That way, we can have a clear line, with a small panel of judges instead of mob-justice. Also, I'd feel bad downvoting insightful comments just because they are not nice to the author.

And yes, I can totally live without discussing the demerits of a specific story on [[/r/rational]] if it would emotionally hurt the author.

I mean, priorities: People in the public sphere don't get to decide whether their work is discussed publicly, but small-fish fic authors? We should grant them this privilege if they need it. We would be a nicer community for it, and to me it's not so much about the value of the existence of content, but rather about common human decency.

Possible exceptions for stuff that is vile, instead of bad. But we don't have a pedo-nazi-snuff-troll problem here, so no need to delineate rules for that, yet.
