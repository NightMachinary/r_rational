  I prefer moderation to downvoting for enforcement of this kind of thing. That way, we can have a clear line, with a small panel of judges instead of mob-justice.

Some people would describe that as a dictatorship rather than a democracy.

At least a person is unlikely to stray too far from how they usually rule though. The mob can be all over the place.

  Possible exceptions for stuff that is vile, instead of bad. But we don't have a pedo-nazi-snuff-troll problem here, so no need to delineate rules for that, yet.

Surely that would come under moderator not commentary?
