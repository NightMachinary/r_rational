  Surely that would come under moderator not commentary?

As I said, no need to cross that bridge yet; but most of the time, common sense beats rules. Yeah, and I absolutely would fume about a holocaust denial story, and call the author out for it, even if it hurts him, and even if the mods disagree (and if I then get banned, well, I asked for it, no reason to whine).

But stories that just suck in my opinion? Meh, let's all be nice to each other. But, of course, barring explicit requests to the contrary, the default assumption must be that authors can take some criticism, especially if it criticizes specific aspects of the work, not the person.

  Some people would describe that as a dictatorship rather than a democracy.

I'd call it civilization. Scott calls it "coordinate necessary meanness". But regardless, we're not trying to be model-UN here, we're trying to enjoy our shared interest in a niche genre of (often pulp) literature. Whatever works, man.
