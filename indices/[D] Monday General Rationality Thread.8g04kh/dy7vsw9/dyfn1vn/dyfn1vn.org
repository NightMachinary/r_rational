Have you tried alcohol? Okay, hear me out. People put lots of filters on the things they say and do, building familiarity with the person in question will bring down a few, at best.\\
So use that to your advantage. Put the person in a place and situation they are comfortable with and build rapport. Being with friends eliminates a bunch of filters. Tiredness brings down a lot of filters (really, it's amazing) as does alcohol.\\
It all depends on the person, though.
