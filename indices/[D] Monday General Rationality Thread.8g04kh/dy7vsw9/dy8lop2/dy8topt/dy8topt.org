  everyone thinks their job is difficult, and without fail whenever I ask someone with a "dumb" job this their eyes light up and they go and tell me about some aspect of their job that is really difficult and I get a new appreciation for it

I'm mostly meeting grad students these days, so the equivalent question is "What are you studying", and most people don't really talk at length about that stuff; maybe it's because studying has a "mandatory but pointless" aspect, where people feel they have to be here but aren't really associating with what they're doing?

Or maybe I'm just asking it wrong. I never tried the specific "This sounds hard, what's the hardest part?" question, but yeah, I kinda like it as a hook.

  just because we had good chemistry and built a rapport

Yeah, I get that.

The thing is, I'm trying to find ways to cheat the system. I'm kind of operating on the assumption that I'll know my True Love when I see her, but in the meantime my dating life feels kind of shallow, so I'm looking for ways to emotionally connect with girls. Like, even if I can't get "great" chemistry, try to make it "good" instead of "passable".
