  One of the problems I've had while dating is that I have a really hard time finding conversation subjects.

[[https://pastebin.com/q016vjxE][List of conversation topics]]

  I mean, I guess I could just tell my date everything I just said, but:

  - It requires some social trust that's not always there
#+end_quote

Note how, in the list of questions linked above, most of the questions are casual, but, as the numbers ascend, intrusive questions become allowable. I haven't been on any dates, but it's obvious that you have to have a gradual ramp-up.

  - It can grind the conversation to a halt; the girl I'm talking to doesn't /necessarily/ have a pamphlet on her life and personality and interests that she's just waiting to dump on me; and[,] I mean, if someone asked /me/ "What are your deepest passions in life", I don't know [whether] I'd find something interesting to say on the spot.

I don't think that questions of such extreme abstractness are easy to answer for /anyone/. It's much easier to be concrete.

#+begin_quote

  - Asking "hey, can the conversation be about that subject and have that structure" is a very stilted way to go about socializing
#+end_quote

Alternately asking questions of each other doesn't seem /too/ stilted, as long as you don't go too in-depth on the topic of equality in the number of questions asked by both parties.

Watch out---people might take offense to such language.
