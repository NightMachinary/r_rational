Things that helped me with conversations (didn't try it on dates):

- state something true about yourself (like I just watched Amazing Spiderman a second time and now I don't like it anymore.)

- ask a question related to that (Did you ever dislike a movie/something after watching it again?)

- follow up on answer (Oh, I never read the book, what is it about? Or Oh, than I better not go in that restaurant again, cause I liked it. Or I never enjoyed racing games in the first place. And yeah the answer will be all over the place.)

- Repeat until you find conversation gold (Best the follow up is also statement about yourself and a question. If you get a question in return make your answer the statement about yourself and ask a question or let her time for a follow up question.)

I like it cause it doesn't feel structured, even if it is structured. And you will give your conversation partner an opportunity to steer the conversation in a direction of her passions.

Just try it out with some friends (without telling them.... experimenting on unknowing friends is totally ethical) and choose topics you are not familiar with.

And I wouldn't answer with my deepest passion on a date.
