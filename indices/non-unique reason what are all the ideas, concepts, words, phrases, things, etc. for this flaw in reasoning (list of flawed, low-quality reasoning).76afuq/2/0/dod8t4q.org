i think that [[/u/CouteauBleu]] has got it -- though im looking for something more that exist out there, but it doesn't seem like ppl like really focusing much on the quality of a reason, or if a reason if actually comparatively good

im going to make a summary of all this eventually

mainly for myself, but maybe for everyone (well for those that want to be educated), not sure yet -- those that understand already do understand, and those that don't likely don't want to understand anyway so not sure yet

anything i say would be kinda pointless to them cos they're already locked into a system of thinking, and likely don't understand much about its inherent flaws
