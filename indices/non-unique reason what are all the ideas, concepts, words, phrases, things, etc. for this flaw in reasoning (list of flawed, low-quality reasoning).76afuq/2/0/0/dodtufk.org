  mainly for myself, but maybe for everyone (well for those that want to be educated), not sure yet -- those that understand already do understand, and those that don't likely don't want to understand anyway so not sure yet

You know you're being really arrogant, right?

It's not even a "it doesn't matter how you deliver an argument as long as the argument is good" thing, you're just legitimately assuming that you can separate people into two categories "People who reason logically (like me)" and "People who don't and aren't worth talking to".

It's childish and petulant; I've seen a bunch of people like that in LW-adjacent communities (I've been like that, it was partly what drew me to HP:MoR in the first place), and this kind of smarter-than-you attitude is exactly what makes people not take us seriously.
