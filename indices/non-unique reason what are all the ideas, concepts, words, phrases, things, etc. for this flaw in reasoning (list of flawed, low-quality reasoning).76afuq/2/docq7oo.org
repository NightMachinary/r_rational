Arguments don't map like that, though. The space of argument y -> conclusion x is not a case of y = x linearly. You can have many arguments for one conclusion, and many conclusions for one argument. Are you referring to specificity? Like, instead of "surveillance is not effective", one should say "surveillance is not effective at x, y, or z, based on evidence a, b, and c, and therefore I recommend a reduction or severe modification in surveillance practices"? Because if so I agree. That's basically the format of a scientific paper.
