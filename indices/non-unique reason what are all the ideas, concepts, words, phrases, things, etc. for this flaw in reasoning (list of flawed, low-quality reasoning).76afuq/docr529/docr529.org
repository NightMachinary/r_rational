I think you're looking for [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/13/proving-too-much/][Proving too much]]. If an argument applies to absurd ideas, that's evidence for the argument being flawed in some ways.

On the other hand, you're being very very vague. Saying "X is not effective" can be a valid or invalid argument against X, depending on context. Epistemology rules are hard to put into words, because then they sound absolute, but in practice you have to weight then against one another.
