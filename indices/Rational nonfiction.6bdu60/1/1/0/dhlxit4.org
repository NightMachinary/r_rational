I haven't heard that before. It's had several versions since the original---it's currently on its fifth version, which was released in 2003 (I think). Of course I haven't read any of Cialdini's books that were released after it, so I don't know if he's updated it since then; but the central concepts (reciprocity, commitment, group think, liking, authority, and scarcity) are still pretty mainstream psychology.
