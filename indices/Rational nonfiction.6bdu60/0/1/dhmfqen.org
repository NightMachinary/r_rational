I like Carl Sagan and I've read some of his books, my one problem with him is that he's very poetic and tends to focus on the beauty and amazing nature of reality as opposed to the concepts behind it and how humans think about it philosophically.

I liked Predictably Irrational too.

I've seen Thinking: Fast and Slow recommended a lot here and in other places, I'll definitely pick that up soon, thanks.
