I've seen Thinking: Fast and Slow recommended a lot here and in other places, I'll definitely pick that up soon, thanks.

I've read The Black Swan - I agree NNT is aggressive but I really like his 'self awareness', explaining the narrative fallacy and so on, that's the kind of thing I really like - I can see it used by people all around me now, along with confirmation bias that I learned from Dan Gardner.
