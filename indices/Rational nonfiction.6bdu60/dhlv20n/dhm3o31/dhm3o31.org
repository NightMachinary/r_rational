  The Knowledge: How to Rebuild Our World from Scratch by Lewis Dartnell

For a book that has the opposite premise, check out [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/248787.The_World_Without_Us][The World Without Us]] by Alan Weisman. It's also great reading for writers who might be thinking about how to world-build a post-apocalyptic setting.
