I really enjoyed 'The Power of Habit'. I'm not sure how entirely generalisable the ideas in it are, but it completely changed my view of my own behaviour (and human behaviour in general).

On a different note, 'The Ascent of Man' was very fun as well. It's a sort of history of civilisation, heavily abridged.
