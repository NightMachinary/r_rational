Since you're already reading Malcolm Gladwell's Blink, I'd recommend [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow][Thinking, Fast and Slow]] by Daniel Kahneman, which explores (and challenges) some of the ideas in Gladwell's book. Kahneman is a researcher rather than a journalist like Gladwell, so his book doesn't have the same "entertainment value," but its arguments are well-rooted in the science.

For a broader perspective on humans, read Yuval Harari's [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens][Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind]]. Harari's thesis is that humanity's capacity to engage in and understand shared fictions (even irrational ones) serves as the basis for much of human civilization. On a somewhat related topic, [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1842.Guns_Germs_and_Steel][Guns, Germs, and Steel]] by Jared Diamond is a somewhat more recent history of contemporary humans and societies.

I always feel a bit awkward whenever I recommend Nassim Nicholas Taleb, as he has a personal style that I think many would characterize as "unnecessary aggressive," and understandably so: he seems to take personal shots at many of his critics and "opponents" and to illustrate points he often provides specific examples in a way that seems to "call out" specific parties in a way that understandably seems to foster. (Even in cases where I find myself agreeing with Taleb, I often find myself shaking my head and questioning whether he could have made the point without naming and invoking disdain for specific parties.) That said, he has plenty of interesting ideas that are certainly worth exploring, with [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile][Antifragile]] being perhaps the most notable of them. (Specifically, the idea that "stability" and "fragility" are not opposites is a very interesting premise.)

For a "fun" book that doesn't really fit the idea of this thread but seems to fit with the theme of this subreddit, Randall Munroe's book [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21413662-what-if][What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions]] seems like it could be worth your time. (If you enjoy speculative fiction, think of this as "speculative non-fiction.")
