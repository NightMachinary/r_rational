Hm. The classical "flesh" domain of Gaelwyn does pose a problem, until he delves more into modern medical texts and does experiments on phospholipids, actin/myosin, microfilaments, microtubules and cellular transport to see what he can actually affect on a molecular bio level...

And Taylor can affect anything with a "simple mind." Gaelwyn lacks the restriction of affecting minds that Panacea does... and he may be able to distinguish himself from her by healing and rewiring brains which possess a lot of fatty tissue in the form of myelin sheaths for Schwann cells.
