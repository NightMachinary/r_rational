Define insect. Gaelwyn can affect /flesh/, which means muscles and fats, with some secondary control over things that are made of muscles and fats (like veins and arteries). My knowledge of insect morphology/physiology isn't great, but I would think that he'd only be able to affect certain parts of the insect that fall under his domain (namely, not the exoskeleton). So if you want a hulked out cricket, that might work.

As shown in 3.1, Taylor can control larger creatures like crabs, or other things that have shells or exoskeletons, so he could soup up one of those in some way, which might make sense.

The better application is probably altering Taylor directly. Gaelwyn can remove any extra fat and pack on (or tweak) muscles to give someone the Steve Rogers treatment. I'm fairly sure that Panacea /can/ do this, but doesn't for personal/psychological reasons.

(And obviously this is just Opinion of God.)
