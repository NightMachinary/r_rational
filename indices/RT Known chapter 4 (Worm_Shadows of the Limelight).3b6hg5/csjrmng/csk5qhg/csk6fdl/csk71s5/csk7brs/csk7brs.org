Hmmm, yeah, take that more as me being bad at voice than a deliberate decision. I guess I didn't want to write a sad, unsure protagonist. I wanted to write a "new world, new leaf" kind of protagonist. I figure the shock to his system, near-BBQ-experience, and sudden new social environment is enough to justify the changes, but it wasn't a conscious decision.

I am not an experienced writer.
