Hehe, I liked the dig about Atlas. Glad I called it on that one!

Worm!Gaelwyn is surprisingly emotionally mature. He'd be a great "been there, done that" mentor for Bonesaw if she claws her way out of the darkness. While we don't yet have a full sense of Limelight!Gaelwyn, he seems to have... naïveté... and a sad hound-dog tailing his master sort of a feel to him.
