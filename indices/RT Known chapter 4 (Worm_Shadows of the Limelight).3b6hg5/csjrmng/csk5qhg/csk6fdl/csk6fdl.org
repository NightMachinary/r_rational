It's already up, but once I do the next one, I will. If I do anything that requires precise knowledge of medical facts, I'll ask. I've been trying to keep them vague so as to avoid bogging down the wordcount and/or infuriating anyone who knows anything, but Gaelwyn's precise abilities, limits, and the workarounds for such are going to come up at some point.

I think Gaelwyn and Bonesaw would be interesting as well, but that'd be a pretty major thing that'll require a hell of a lot of run-up. Gaelwyn's arc in canon, I noticed, is a lot like Bonesaw's, but stretched out over a lifetime.
