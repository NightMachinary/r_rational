When I was a young teenager I read a book called /Hitman/ that used the "psychosomatic" model of curses. Kind of. That was unclear because the writing really blurred the lines between the effects of the magic used by the antagonist and the drugs used by the protagonist. It was fun, but in hindsight, probably not age-appropriate.
