Hm. Not much to go on, but the fact this chapter exists implies mind-altering substances can influence or be influenced by magic somehow, which further implies a very simple uniting magical method, which doesn't actually need names. Or it could be like the sumerian tongue in /Snow Crash/, a shared language of all human brains, and /that/ is what interfaces with magic.
