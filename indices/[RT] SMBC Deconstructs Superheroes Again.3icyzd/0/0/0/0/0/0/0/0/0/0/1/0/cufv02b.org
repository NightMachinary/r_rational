Eh ... I'm gonna disagree with that.

See, you can only be efficient /within your own knowledge/. Just as we can only express concepts through communication (including language, signing, writing, etc). There may exist concepts expressable outside of communication, but communication is our mechanism for expressing things, so even if we could somehow express these concepts, they're not going to be understood. A new pathway between expression and understanding would need to be created, which would then come under the heading of communication.

In order to "not be a cape", Taylor would have had to know things that she didn't know. After gaining that knowledge (aka "learning") she would have had to reach backwards, through retrocausality, to change her own prior view of the world, and thereby avoid having to gain that knowledge.

The starting assumption for Taylor, and everyone else without retrocausal informational powers, is that "person with powers" is and only is "a cape". She can only be efficient within her assumptions.
