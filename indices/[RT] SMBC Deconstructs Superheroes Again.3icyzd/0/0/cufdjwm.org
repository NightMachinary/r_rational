Yeah, if there are superpowered villains, you don't want Superman lifting and lowering his arms repeatedly, you want him preventing society from collapsing under the strain of superhuman crime. I wonder what Speedsheet would do to directly fight crime. Forensic accounting to show Lex Luthor's nefarious money laundering or funding of secret supervillainy?
