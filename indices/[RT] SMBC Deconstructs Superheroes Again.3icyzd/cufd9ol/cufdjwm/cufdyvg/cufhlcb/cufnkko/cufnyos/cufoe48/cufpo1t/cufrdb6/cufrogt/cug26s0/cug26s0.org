People really oversell Taylor's munchkinry. EVERYONE'S powers are blackboxed and restricted. Munckinry is limited. You can only do it so much as you have a versatile power or teammate. You can't alter the power itself.

Someone like Taylor has a pretty versatile power when you think about it,combined with some insane insect feats (I suppose you could blame it on Master control) and just leveraged it.

Someone like Purity isn't not leveraging her power. She charges it at the appropriate times and uses it wisely, but there's little she can do to make her power better or more "efficient". She's not being inefficient, she's making lemonade with what she has in a specific social context.
