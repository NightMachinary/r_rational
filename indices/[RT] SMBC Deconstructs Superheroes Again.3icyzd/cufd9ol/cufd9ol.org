This works for street-level crime, but not for city-scale or larger threats. If Ra's al Ghul is going to disperse Scarecrow's fear toxin into the water supply of Gotham, the same crime-fighting action arguably has /more/ impact on a large city than a small one (because a large city has more infrastructure, which means there are more chances for catastrophe). Same goes for an incoming asteroid, Weather Wizard bringing the city into a perpetual winter, etc.

This is assuming we're using the comic's metric of overall security, which I'm not sure is a good one. This is also without getting into the whole "superheroes as security vs. superheroes as utility" issue [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2305][dealt with in this comic]]. (And yes, I know [[/u/mrweiner]] is just making a joke.)
