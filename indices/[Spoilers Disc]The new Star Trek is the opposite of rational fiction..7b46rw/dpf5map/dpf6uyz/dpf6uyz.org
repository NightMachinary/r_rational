It may be a straw straw Vulcan at that: Vulcans aren't inherently logical; it was their extreme passion and emotion (and violence) which drove them to impose a very strict and passionless way of living on themselves in order to move past their constant warfare and general crab-bucketing. So it may be less of a case of (human) emotion beating (Vulcan) logic than human balance and acceptance of both emotion and logic beating Vulcan extremism.
