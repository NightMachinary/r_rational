You'd think that, right after the first Vulcans forced down their emotions enough to become vaguely consequentialist, they'd realize there was nothing but "instinct" (the thing they're ignoring) telling them to reject solutions involving self-modification (through drugs) or species-modification (through genetic engineering) to fix the problem with less discipline.

Honestly, Vulcan sounds not like a planet of alcoholics, but rather like an entire planet of people with ADHD who for some reason are trying the "just use willpower" non-solution, rather than the "take an ADHD medication" solution to their problem.

There are a decent number of basic compounds that give humans the (usually unwanted side-)effect of "emotional blunting." Why wouldn't Vulcans just take an analogue to these and then relax?
