Essentially, natural vulcan emotion is so blindingly extreme that the only statistically meaningful way they can /ever/ achieve logical results is to reject emotion entirely.

Using chemical intoxicants as an example, imagine if your entire species was so prone to addiction that a single sip of alcohol could send someone into a self-destructive death spiral, so you collectively decide to never touch the stuff. Then, one day, you encounter a species that's tipsy /all the time/. You have thousands of years of culture telling you they're doomed, so you keep trying to convince them to forgo this intoxicant. It doesn't matter that this other race seems to be doing fine; your people were still struggling with their intoxicant when they began to colonize space, and they nearly wiped themselves out. From your only frame of reference, giving up this intoxicant is do or die.

It certainly doesn't help that vulcans live so long that "living memory" encompasses something like the last 600 years, or that their only modern comparison to emotional vulcans is the romulans, who have been expanding a xenophobic fascist empire for the last 2,000 years. Extreme threats, real or perceived, call for extreme caution, and the generational turnover is very low, so that caution tends to stick around.
