On the other hand, "logical"-adjacent people [e.g. rationalists] seem more likely than most to talk themselves into accepting an ethical framework such as positive utilitarianism, where---since all lives have nonzero =abs(utility)=, and death has zero =abs(utility)=---suicide is essentially an "invalid output" and will never be considered.

A /society/ of very "logical" people might end up deciding that something like positive utilitarianism is just "correct", and then suicide becomes an "erased concept", something people stop even having the words to grapple with. Maybe clinically depressed people don't even contemplate suicide in such a world, because it's so foreign a concept to them. Etc.

Then again, I can imagine that they'd still /hear/ about suicides in other cultures, so they'd have to rationalize the concept somehow. (Or just consider all non-Vulcan societies "flawed" in that way.)

Alternatively: maybe there's a Vulcan MiniTruth that constrains Vulcan-homeworld journalists and entertainers to never speak of suicide---even foreign suicide---in public. (Which is believable, even for a non-totalitarian society: the US media voluntarily self-censors news of suicides, because they encourage copycat suicides, increasing the total suicide rate.) Maybe Vulcans joining Starfleet are thus given a briefing like the Amish give children on departing for their Rumspringa: that the outside world will be saturated in this or that harmful meme, and that you must not let yourself believe---just because it's everywhere---that it makes sense.
