That would actually make for a really interesting episode. Doctor-assisted suicide never even came up when Sarek died of Vulcan hyper-dementia, they would go on and on about old age and loss of dignity and how he had been suffering for months knowing that his condition is absolutely incurable but for some reason putting him out of his misery was never even considered an option. You'd think a logical people would consider the utility of either choice and then just snuff him.
