  Vulcan Logic Extremist: My sacrifice will be a rallying cry to those who value logic above all.
#+end_quote

I feel like this /could/ be a line a Vulcan could say---but it better belong in a different story: an episode-allegory to the legality of doctor-assisted suicide. Vulcans in old-age homes would totally be the type to kill themselves to call for an more attention to be paid to the plights of their fellows going ignored. Vulcans don't share much character with suicide-bombers, but they /do/ have a lot of similarities to self-immolating monks.
