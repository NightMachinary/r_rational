I don't think that reasoning works out. If I were an observer, seeing someone die for beliefs that don't require it, I'm more likely to think the individual is mentally impaired in some way rather than think that they're correct /solely because/ they died for their cause. Vulcans are logical as a species, but not every individual is, so the first premise is somewhat misleading. If I were previously aware of arguments for leaving the Federation, I can't think of a reason why someone dying for that cause would change my opinion one way or another, as that only indicates the strength of someone's beliefs, not their logical soundness.

The first part is how it works IRL anyway, at least for a majority of people. Suicide bombers are much more likely to be seen as either mentally impaired or part of some organization that subverts their reasoning than it is to make people consider the bomber's beliefs to be more valid.
