    Vulcan Logic Extremist: My sacrifice will be a rallying cry to those who value logic above all. Vulcans will soon recognize and withdraw from the failed experiment known as "the Federation.
  #+end_quote

  Because as we know those who value Logic above all totally need a martyr to compel them to action

Maybe the persuasion goes like this:

- Vulcans are logical

- logic is universal

- if one of them came to the conclusion that the best course of action is to die until the goal is achieved - then all of them will come to the same conclusion eventually

- lots of Vulcans will die unless not-yet-enlightened will surrender to the POV of the already enlightened

Then the only rational action is to be persuaded after just one death.
