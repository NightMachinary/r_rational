If we want to defend it in-universe, then I would make an argument that their emotional variance is so extreme that most of their faculties are spent repressing urges to eat/fuck/kill all the time, and that humanity flourishes while being less logical because they have less of a handicap.

But to me it's clearly a matter of weak writing by a handful of writers polluting the shared mythology.
