All Star Trek series had that problem, there is a reason why they are the namer of the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan][Straw Vulcan]] trope.

Basically, the series has a recurring problem with portraying the Vulcan definition of "logic" as being limited to cold-hearted cynical values, monotone speech, obsession with some oddly specific space-buddhist religious rituals, and with dogmatic connviction of their own supremacy, and have that be constantly bested by humans using intuition and real practicality in a way that is /empirically working out for them really well/, but that is labeled to be "emotional" and "illogical" anyways.
