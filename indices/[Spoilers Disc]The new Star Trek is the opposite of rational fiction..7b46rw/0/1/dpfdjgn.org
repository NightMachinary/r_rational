What if Vulcan intuition just really sucks, and their "logical thinking" actually is categorically their best method of decision making? That another species has brains that work differently doesn't mean that the Vulcan approach is wrong, just that using it doesn't make them hyper-intelligent.

Actually, it would be somewhat entertaining if it was revealed that Vulcans without the logical training are really bad at decision making compared to humans, and said training makes them about equal.
