I agree with you that there is a difference between rigid stoical mindless logic that is portrayed in fiction and actual human logical thought processes but I still think that the message of this new Star Trek is opposed to rationality.

They have Vulcans who are said to be "logical" and then have all these examples about how being logical like that is bad (omitting that they only argue that being "logical" in this specific way is bad). It's literally a strawman argument against striving to be rational and I think that's a bad message.
