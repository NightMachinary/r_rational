While they've clearly been aesthetically dubious and they probably didn't have my nuances here in mind, I'd contend that being post-logic is not at all anti-rationalist. Rationalists are all about disrespecting the old logics.

Consider the following:

#+begin_quote
  Grey Eyed Elder: "The absense of evidence is evidence of absence."

  Philosophers, working in dialethic logic for thousands of years: "No! It's the opposite! That's a fallacy!"

  Modern rationalists: "Uncontroversially yes, that's how evidence/updating works."
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  Grey Eyed Elder: "It is logical to defect in prisoner's dilemmas against agents similar to ourselves"

  Philosophers: "Regrettably, yes."

  Modern Rationalists: "Only if you're using CDT, which is outdated. [[https://arbital.com/p/logical_dt/?l=5gc][We have a better logic now.]]"
#+end_quote

You can model the world as a bunch of crisp, artificial predicates and hard inference rules that fit well within an adversarial debate (which is what the average person will expect when they say "logic", and it is what most philosophy majors, and many legal students are taught (and I would teach it myself. It's a good way of showing a student what a discourse is made of, how words work.)), or you can model it as an inarticulably complex probabilistic fuzz of overlapping possible worlds, which is closer to what it is (and most people come to realise this). People who sincerely try to think in crisp, dialethic ways will never be able to build a working mind. Their councils will be heavy handed, dysfunctional, and sometimes deranged.

Also, at some point a person has to learn that logics are just abstract machines that we made up and maintained because they work. They are not perfect platonic forms that were handed down from god. To trumpet "logic" as if it's just one big thing denies the fact that there is diversity in the systems of mathematics and machine learning, and it is healthy.
