Fair point, but I would make the argument that (a) someone being willing to die is strong enough evidence of conviction that it warrants a closer look, (b) the people of the Federation will have their heartstrings tugged, and (c) if the martyrdom is more of the "Twin Towers" style as opposed to the "self-immolation" style, then it might have a very serious effect on both parties.
