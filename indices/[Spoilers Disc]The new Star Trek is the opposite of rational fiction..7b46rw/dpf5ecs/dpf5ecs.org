Why is martyrdom inherently illogical? If it's the optimal path to getting Vulcan-the-nation to pull out of the Federation, why wouldn't a wholly logical person who was not afraid of death do it?

Not to say that I don't agree with you, just that I lack the context to make a judgement and what you've offered doesn't seem sufficient so far. I haven't seen this version, but Star Trek has had very uneven quality over the years and it would surprise me more if the new one were great than if it were horrible.
