YOU. I /like/ you.

  My biggest complaint with capitalism is that it's optimizing (poorly, all things considered) towards a damn stupid utility function. That is, profit of a single business entity. Not profit of a society of a whole.

Capital/money is optimization power, stored in liquid form. This makes it pretty easy to explain what the hell is actually going on when we say someone is "poor" or "rich", /especially/ when we remember that people can only optimize in limited ways and at limited rates via singular, personal effort. Capitalism just maximizes capital, but... /yeah/. Bloody stupid utility function.

Personally, my favored solutions are [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_cooperative][syndicalism/cooperatives]], [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income][guaranteed basic incomes]], and several forms of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism][Georgism]]. I also like the idea for [[https://www.jacobinmag.com/2012/12/the-red-and-the-black/][socialized capital markets]], but think it needs a bunch more work to get it beyond "Just socialize the institutional investors", since you want a system that can direct investment by well-informed individuals to social purposes just as well as it directs mass investment by professional financial managers to such purposes.

What can be said, to those who read the links, is that each of these "reforms": is actually a major change in class relations, can be executed (hypothetically) through ordinary and nonviolent politics, and /has actually been tried and found to succeed in experiments/.

If [[/u/mylittleeconomy]] could come over here, being a market monetarist, I'd also like to propose a kind of "Georgist money", in which currency is issued as a liability/entitlement to some form of positional or ecological (ie: Truly Scarce, cannot be made in a factory) good.

I expect that any and all of these changes, made individually or together, would make the world a much better place, and, notably, a much safer place for other things rationalists like, such as transhumanism. I actually feel that [[http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/dangerous.html][Bostrom's response]] to [[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2004/09/01/transhumanism][Fukuyama's critique of transhumanism as inegalitarian]] was inadequate, and failed to address the genuine crisis of stratification that I personally expect to occur should transhumanism be wed to capitalist exploitation (or rather, the capitalist mechanism of exploitation in the absence of AI). Yes, biological-limitation transhumanism + way capitalism makes even the barest survival and barest happiness a positional good = vast human misery. Rather than addressing that problem by attacking transhumanism, we should address it by treating capitalism as a broken, obsolete economic machine and simply building a better one.

(All this assumes that we cannot produce a Friendly AI /Real Soon Now/, as in, soon enough to deal with the problems inflicted by capitalism on most currently-existing humans. There is enough human effort in the world to fix our economic system /and/ build a Friendly AI in the coming decades, at least in my view.)
