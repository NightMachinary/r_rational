Yeah. It actually working is pretty reliant on a lot of politics and PR. Which I'm not terrible at, in this sphere anyway.

If it does work, it shouldn't be hard to get a fraction of the utility of what amounts to the next industrial revolution. The beginning of real automated manufacturing.

Still, hard to get accurate estimates. And I'm always plagued by the vague sensation that there's something more I should be doing.

I appreciate people double-checking my reasoning. So let me know if you have any questions.
