Not /necessarily/. Current preferences appear to be for putting learning algorithms into wide-scale usage as soon as they're useful, /without/ trying to put together several /different/ algorithms into a human-equivalent, FOOM-capable "AI". The number of people consciously trying to create FOOM-capable AGI with even the remotest competence is very, very small (and it also appears to be a very difficult problem, compared to doing highly general but still strictly Narrow machine-learning).
