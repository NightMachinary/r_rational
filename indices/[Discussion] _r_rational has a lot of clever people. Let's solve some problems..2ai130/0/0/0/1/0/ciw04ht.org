Friendly is a integer, not a boolean.

There's a lot of hate for thingiverse right now. Thingiverse being the place people go to for their 3D files. Part of that is them [[http://traverseda.wordpress.com/2014/05/23/makerbot-blatently-steals-and-patents-a-community-design/][allegedly stealing a community design]], part of that is them having a bad IP policy. Part of that is them abandoning their open-source roots.

The point is that a lot of designers hate them, and their aren't any good alternatives.

I'm working on an alternative to thingiverse. Take a look at the [[http://alpha.rhombik.com][alpha site]] and our [[https://github.com/Rhombik/rhombik-object-repository][github]].

It's a strategic asset. Mostly just setting me up in a good position to implement things down the line.

There's 3 main factors that potentially go into its success.

- Open-source/community support

- A neutral commons (it doesn't make sense for all the smaller 3D printer companies to make their own)

- I run [[/r/3Dprinting]], which has a large concentration of designers. They can be nudged, although obviously I have to maintain a certain amount of neutrality.

Finally, thingiverses not-us competition generally isn't very good. It's a bitch to overcome their network effect. But it's worth a shot.
