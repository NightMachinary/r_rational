I question why humans are assumed to have a less dangerous utility function than other empowered intelligences. I'm thinking it's probably unwise to meddle with hyper-intelligence of any kind until we have much better models of axiomatic space. Now if we could just invent some kind of AI to help us understand axiomatic space.
