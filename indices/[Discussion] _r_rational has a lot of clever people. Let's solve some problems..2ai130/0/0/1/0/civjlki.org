  no D: it's just the NGDP Targeting Festival. That doesn't mean I like it....

Well I guesstimated, based on your explicitly mentioning NGDP Targeting and also based on the fact that market monetarism /is/ a current theory in mainstream economics with plenty of evidence and sway behind it.

  Like...gold?

And therein lies the rub. When you tie money purely to something like debt (burdens of optimization placed on individuals or institutions), you get an explosion of toxic financialization (nominal debts grow beyond the real economy's ability to repay). When you tie money purely to something like gold, you become unable to manage the economy, but nominal productivity and real productivity fall into line with each-other.

I think we need some new solutions.
