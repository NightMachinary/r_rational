Well, [[http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba611][sort of]], but when you said tied to debt it put me in the mind of something akin to a gold standard but with debt. My mistake.

The [[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/helicopter-drop.asp][helicopter drop]] is something I find rather tempting myself, but the Fed normally works through banks and the market because it's easier to judge and easier to get the money out there--banks are better than pilots at finding people who want to add to aggregate demand. There may be other reasons. Printing money has something of a bad reputation for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic][some reason]].

There are different definitions of the money supply (M1 and M2 and so forth), and they don't always move together. "Get the money supply right" is easier said than done.

But people like Milton Friedman, Scott Sumner and, uh, me (who doesn't count) think that the Fed should be focused more on the monetary base than the interest rate. Maybe helicopter drops (I prefer roving open vans with cheerleaders armed with those t-shirt cannons myself) will be a tool of monetary policy in the future.
