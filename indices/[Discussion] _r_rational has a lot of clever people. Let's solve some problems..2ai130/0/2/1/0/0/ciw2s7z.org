  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_economics][law and economics]], the *Coase theorem* (pronounced /ˈkoʊs/) describes the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_(economics)][economic efficiency]] of an economic [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_system][allocation]] or outcome in the presence of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality][externalities]]. The theorem states that if trade in an externality is possible and there are sufficiently low [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_costs][transaction costs]], bargaining will lead to an efficient outcome regardless of the initial allocation of property. In practice, obstacles to bargaining or poorly defined property rights can prevent Coasian bargaining. This "theorem" is commonly attributed to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_University_of_Chicago][The University of Chicago']]s Nobel Prize laureate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase][Ronald Coase]]. However, Coase himself stated that the theorem was based on perhaps four pages of his 1960 paper "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_of_Social_Cost][The Problem of Social Cost]]", and that the "Coase theorem" is not about his work at all.
