I think it's worth noting that these particular issues can be pretty much considered "solved" in my home country of Belgium.

While I also have a problem, there are ways in which you can exploit capitalism (as a government) to increase overall wellbeing that seem underutilized. I remember a Slate Star Codex post about how governments could pay private corporations for certain things (like public policy to reduce crime, lowering homelessness) *but* only pay out of that corporation actually reaches its goal. There's more to it than that and I'll see if I can find the post I'm referring to.
