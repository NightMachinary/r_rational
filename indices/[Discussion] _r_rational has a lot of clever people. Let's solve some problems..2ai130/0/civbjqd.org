I have a problem with capitalism in general.

It's kind of a stupid optimization processes. But it does work, generally. Just replacing it with something else entirely isn't likely to work, if only because whatever we'd replace it with would need to be /complicated/. And have rules for updating the rules and all that built in. And also generally out-compete capitalism, which is hard if you don't have some way of enforcing cooperation.

My biggest complaint with capitalism is that it's optimizing (poorly, all things considered) towards a damn stupid utility function. That is, profit of a single business entity. Not profit of a society of a whole.

It's captured value vs created value. In capitalism, it doesn't matter how much value you create across your entire society. Just how much value you manage to capture. That leads to a lot of entities choosing, let's say, 2 private utilitons (units of utility) and 1 public utiliton, instead of choosing 1 private and 3 public. Sure, there's more overall utility in situation two, but there are selection pressure's to consider.

The most relevant examples of captured vs created value are probably health care and student loans. An educated populace increases utility across society as a whole, but universities have know way of capturing any of the value they create. We use student loans as a sort of shim, but it still completely decouples value creation from receiving value. Instead favoring schools that can attract large numbers of students and operate cheaply.

So what approaches might we take to solving that? Either changing capitalisms utility function or figuring out alternative ways to run (scale models of) a society?
