I am pretty sure that most of the things that most people buy are things that they find useful in some way. "Hey, let's spend money on this useless junk!" is not the modal shopping experience. Externalities are another question, but people do spend money to get things that they can use for some end or that are an end in themselves.

It is easy to mock consumers for being hoodwinked and suckered by flashy advertising, and so people often do, but when you reach the point where you are doubting that people even /want/ to buy useful things, unless you mean something very specific by "useful," it is worth taking a step back and asking just what kinds of predictions your theory generates and whether they really seem to match your experiences.

Status competitions, imperfect information, etc., etc., but people are constrained optimizers, if imperfectly so. It is the pony way to look upon people with the utmost dignity and respect and to be charitable in your thoughts and dealings with them.
