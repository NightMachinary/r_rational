Ok. Let's take a step back... from standard revealed-preferences theory. What can falsify the basic theory of rational shopping (ie: prices at which people bid reveal preference information), and how have the standard irrationality-revealing experiments in behavioral economics failed to meet that standard? Basically, what sort of behavior /can't/ you explain as a preference, but instead only as a failure of rational economic behavior?
