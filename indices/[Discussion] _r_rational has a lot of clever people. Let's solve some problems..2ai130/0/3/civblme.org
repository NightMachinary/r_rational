[[http://liquidfeedback.org/][liquidefeedback]]/Fluid-democracy looks like a good way of letting preferences be known. Admittedly there's a lot of overhead, although I don't know how it would compare to the overhead of a market economy. It presumes that everyone is truly equal, thus making compelling arguments very important. Of course compelling arguments probably aren't the best way to run a society... Truth does matter.

Prediction markets are a thing. They don't seem to generally be used though. They may just be too incompatible with normal society. But they do nicely bolt on to the existing economy. They also encourage secret keeping. They don't need to do better overall, just better then everyone else.
