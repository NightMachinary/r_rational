There are a lot of things I think about, but I'm going to post my most selfish (currently, at least) problem that could still benefit a wider community.

I'm currently unemployed and the main thing that I've learned (apart from how not working sucks) is that the skills needed to *get* a job and the skills needed to *do* a job are often completely unrelated. This isn't true for all jobs, but it is true for probably the majority of jobs.

This leads to the problem of perfectly capable human beings (such as me) spending a lot of time and effort applying for jobs they could handle, without any real result (apart from feedback, which becomes useless after the first few times you apply). Not only is this a source of worldsuck, it also seems a highly inefficient way to do things (which is currently only allowed because there are more applicants than jobs).

Relatedly, figuring out which job actually fits you is also a rather hard problem for quite some people (I notice a lot of people stuck on "good enough" jobs) and it's a problem you're supposed to tackle when you're 14 - 18 years old.
