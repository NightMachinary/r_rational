- Wizards can create matter using the spell circles, though they have to specify with precision what it is they want. These spell circles can be written on any surface, and reused as much as desired. This gets past one of the biggest hurdles, which is that machined parts are bloody expensive.
- Spells can take in light and sound as parameters - used traditionally to set up alarms or give simply one-word commands. This takes care of vision and hearing, since magic already handles at least a portion of the control aspects.
- Spells can interact with circuit boards, and with each other, which allows the robots to be programmed.
- Spells can be used to ... uh, make an equivalent of muscles in some way. I guess in theory I could just have the spell circles be capable of producing force in addition to matter.

For example, a simple robot would have a spell circle giving it visual input and set to trigger on the color red. When the trigger condition happened, the spell circle would link up to the circuit board to send input in the form of electrical signals. The circuit board would decide what to do, and send output in the form of electrical signals, which a spell circle would interpret as a command to activate something (probably a muscle).

A full humanoid robot would be composed of a ton of spells and a ton of materials. Every time a new robot needed to be made, all you'd need to do was open up the spellbook that contained all the spell circles, touch each one in turn, and then assemble it.
