It seems to be a clich√© or [[/r/rational]] that we always weaponise magic to test the premise... But here's some other ideas too:

- Portable artillery/railguns/whatever. Have one circle create ammunition, and another impart force.

- Energy weapons. Enough said.

- Antimatter. Fissile material. Chemical explosives. Chemical or biological weapons. Supercompressed plasma. Etc. (to many suicide-substances to list)

- On a more positive note, space travel. Fuel, supplies, structural stuff. End the tyranny of the rocket equation, and then create a space elevator out of carbon nanotubes just to show off.

- What does the complexity and density of a spell circle look like? Modern CPU? Victorian clockwork? Hand-drawn calligraphy? To what degree foes this limit the complexity of the output, in shape and composition?
