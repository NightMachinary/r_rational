Hmm. The more I think about absurd exploits and their plausibility, the better this sounds. Example cases:

- spell circles that create or modify spell circles

- space travel is basically free, and any mage can plausibly settle other planets or large moons.

- There is a hard upper limit on the price per unit of any (simple) substance, as mages can trivially make more. Platinum catalysed everything, hello!

- Many ways to make one-man WMDs with no materials == security freakout

It sounds pretty similar to /Ra/, actually.
