1. That's totally fine, the spell circles just need to be able to erect a defense against those things.
2. Also totally fine.
3. Antimatter probably gets restricted - robots are meant to be an increase in war-making capacity, and having them be strictly suicide bombers seems like it would go counter to maximizing coolness.
4. Space travel is fine.
5. Complexity and density are on the level of calligraphy, though the simplest of spells can be written in the dirt with the point of your shoe. Magic does most of the heavy lifting, and follows from intent, with a couple caveats.

Thanks for the questions.
