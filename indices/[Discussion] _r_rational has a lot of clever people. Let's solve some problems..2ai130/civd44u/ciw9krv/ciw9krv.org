For one thing, you could start by creating a cryonics organization that is actually fiscally responsible. From what I have seen several are extremely shady and pay far too much money tot heir boards, and alcor, which seems legitimate, spends ridiculous amounts inefficiently on do it yourself projects when they could buy their materials much more cheaply and with less chance of problems. Because of their poor finances alcor will go under unless they expand like a pyramid scheme, and this isn't happening.

Also relevant, I have studied molecular biology with a focus on neuroscience. In my opinion, cryonics as it is now is very unlikely to preserve what I believe to be the core structures for memory, and even if it did it would not preserve enough detail for eventual recovery even if every molecule could somehow be mapped in its state at the time of revival. I am EXTREMELY in favor of cryonics if they can get it to work. I will be donating large amounts of my income to get it to work. I do not believe it currently works.

What has been happening is that cryonics has been improving significantly in the last few years, especially since they began vitrification.

The problems are... We haven't determined what structures contain memory, though we are getting close. None of the current prevailing models would be preserved by cryonics in its current state even for magical Drexlerian nanotech which is not feasible under out current understanding of physics.

Most of the money in cryonics is going to organizations run by people with little or no medical knowledge, spending resources inefficiently, and with the majority of the money going to preserving people with the current faulty processes instead of developing new ones.

If you want to convince competent molecular biologists and doctors to help you, these are the problems you solve.
