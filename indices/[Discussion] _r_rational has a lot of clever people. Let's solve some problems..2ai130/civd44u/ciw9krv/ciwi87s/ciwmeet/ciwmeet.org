I am trying to answer that too. I have been keeping an eye out for organizations doing pure research and admitting it doesn't work now, or even reasonably responsible companies that do claim the freezing could work now as a fundraiser. There was one under development I had high hopes for but it went under before it started. At the moment if there is one out there I don't know where it is.

I wish I could be more help, but for now I am stuck saying there is a problem without being able to offer a solution beyond "someone should make an organization that fixes this." (maybe a little better than doing nothing, but not by much) I will donate money if I ever find one that I think has the right approach but right now I haven't got disposable income because law school and I don't know of any that fit the bill. I don't imagine you'll think of it, but if you somehow run across one in the near future that has these qualities let me know. I could at least spread the word then.
