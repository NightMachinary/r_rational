Is that a goal? I'd probably say something like "making cryonics easier to obtain" or "get more people signed up for cryonics". Is this specifically about /convincing/ people? Is it about cryonics' PR? I'm going to presume it's not.

--------------

The reason I'm not signed up for cryonics is that it's too expensive. I imagine that's true of a lot of people.

The first step would be to figure out why people in general aren't signed up for cryonics. Presuming price is as much of a factor as I intuit, figuring out where that cost comes from is important.

So what do cryonics companies spend their money on? Presumably a lot of it is spent on upkeep, and investments ensuring that they can continues to pay for upkeep.

--------------

Significantly decreasing the cost of upkeep hits both of those quite nicely.

Technologies that might make cryonics upkeep cheaper:

- Heat echangers.

They've seen a lot of commercial application recently. It looks like the technology is maturing pretty quickly. Potentially a lot more efficient then whatever cooling methods they're using now. I don't really know, but it might be something other people haven't looked into.

- Aerogels

Very very efficient insulation. Minimize heat creep. Too expensive to implement now, but with a significant initial investment aerogel vessels could be a pretty big game-changer.

--------------

Alternatively, you could make their investments more efficient. I imagine they can afford pretty top tier investment council. That leaves getting the government more involved, or crazy schemes involving crypto-currencies.

Or doing it better then the best investors around. They have to deal in bulk, but some dedicated venture capitalists might get a better ROI, if they're very good at predicting the future.

Riskier, and most cryonics groups are rightfully risk-averse.
