  What does the complexity and density of a spell circle look like? Modern CPU? Victorian clockwork? Hand-drawn calligraphy? To what degree foes this limit the complexity of the output, in shape and composition?

Also, we can assume, since he mentioned circuit-boards, that spell-circles have very limited computational power of their own, right? So we can't try to leverage some conservation-law violating property of magic circles to build hypercomputers?
