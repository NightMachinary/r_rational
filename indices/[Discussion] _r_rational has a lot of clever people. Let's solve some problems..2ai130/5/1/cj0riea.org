Random thought: what if magic makes it so that an enchanted object behaves the way that the people looking at it expect it to? Magicians set up optical illusions and such and make them real with magic, etc. A robot servant that does what you expect it to would probably be good enough for most purposes. There would have to be limitations of course. For example, they probably wouldn't work for the person who created them, because they know too much about how it works to expect it to work.

The idea is way too powerful as it is, but properly nerfed it could be interesting.
