I have a writing problem. The premise of the story is that wizards can create robots using a combination of magic and technology. So here's my problem; I need a magic system which allows a wizard to get past the hurdles in modern robotics in order to make humanoid robots. I got about a fourth of the way into the story before really thinking about how the magic system actually worked, and would rather not have a story that runs on handwavium. I guess I'll put my own solution in a comment to this one, but I'd like a better idea than I have now.
