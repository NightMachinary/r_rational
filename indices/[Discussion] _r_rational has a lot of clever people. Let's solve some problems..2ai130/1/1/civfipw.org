Well, Fallacy Mania is... obvious, but Zendo provides a bit more instruction as to the principle. Zendo is actually basically [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probably_approximately_correct_learning][PAC learning]]. This is what makes it so /hard/ with complicated rules: PAC learning is very inefficient even with an ideal learner.

So if you want a "rationality game", figure out how to make a game that can be won by best approximating an ideal learner from some class of learning algorithms.
