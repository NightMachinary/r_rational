Counterpoint: how do we create cryonics/body-preservation methods and providers whose treatments verifiably work, with strong evidence for their working?

Point 1: this is a life-or-death decision. A positive, even highly positive, expected-value based on a low probability of success /is not good enough/: expected values are measurements of average-case utility, which implicitly assumes a repeated set of either possible worlds (Bayesian) or experiments (frequentist). For me to sign up for such a treatment and start pushing it on others, I want it to pass a hypothesis test: "with high probability based on experimental evidence, this thing actually works". Those are the statistical tool you use when you will only get one opportunity to make your bet.

Point 2: Ideally, I would like to see the development of methods that could, for instance, preserve a dead lab-rat (or other experimental mammal) (after its heart was stopped, say) to the degree necessary that it can actually be "resurrected" at a predetermined later time (by restarting its heart, say). ALCOR can't do this, the Brain Preservation Foundation only does brains and has gone quiet, so I don't know whom to turn to.

Yes, this is /mountains of evidence/ I'm talking about demanding, but again, it's a life-or-death decision. You only get life-insurance money once, after all, so if I'm going to spend it on something other than my family (when I have one), I need, at the very least, solid molehills of evidence that I could in fact be brought back /without the use of a Friendly superintelligence/.

Because any plan that hinges on Friendly AI demands putting my money and effort into MIRI stuff, not signing up for medical treatments not known to work.
