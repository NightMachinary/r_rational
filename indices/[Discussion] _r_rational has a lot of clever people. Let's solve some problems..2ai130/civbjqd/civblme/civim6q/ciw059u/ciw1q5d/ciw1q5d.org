It is true that prediction markets don't compel every actor to share all the information they have immediately. But they will, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceteris_paribus][ceteris paribus]], promote the creation and sharing of information as compared to an otherwise identical system that lacks prediction markets. They only encourage secret-keeping in the sense that agents will be discouraged from sharing information on a whim, since there is first money to be made. Nevertheless, a whim-based information-sharing system would be much more inefficient.
