The very act of buying or selling a share distributes information to the rest of the market that you think this or that prediction is more or less likely to be true. Depending on how detailed the predictions are ("Iran will go to war" vs. "Iran will go to war with Israel" vs. "Iran will go to war with Israel in less than 24 hours over an incident involving U.S. president Obama, a bottle of vodka, and a llama"), that could be quite a bit of information.
