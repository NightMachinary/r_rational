Hmm, perhaps some kind of semi-socialist economy. Have a large amount of taxes overall but use them to make sure people have the basic staples of living, food, shelter, basic medical care and the like.

Then ever certain period of time (yearly or biyearly or every ten years what have you) give a tax break to companies and individuals who are producing value or research toward a certain goal, like say solar panel efficiency.

The problem with capitalism that there is no natural incentive to drive companies to produce something that is useful as opposed to it having a high marketability. If we can get around that roadblock then there might be hope for the system yet.
