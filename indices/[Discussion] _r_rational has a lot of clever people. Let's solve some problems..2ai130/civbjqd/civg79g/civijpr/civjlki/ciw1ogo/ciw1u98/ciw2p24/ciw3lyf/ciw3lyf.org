  banks are better than pilots at finding people who want to add to aggregate demand.

With respect, I completely disagree. Banks are very good at finding people who want to add to aggregate supply and who want to accumulate capital. That's their job. Thing is, from a bank's perspective (and that of the financial-services sector as a whole, nowadays), "adding to aggregate demand" is called "profligacy".

Of course, they'll /also/ lend you money to be profligate and even downright irresponsible with (see: credit cards), but the whole point is that they do so in order to create liabilities from you to them, adding to their balance sheet, adding to "aggregate supply" and accumulated capital, and /those debts always come due/. You /can't/ add to aggregate demand by loaning money: that just moves aggregate demand from the future to the present.
