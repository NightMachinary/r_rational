As an aside, I thought [[http://c4ss.org/content/12491][this]] article was an alright overview of the problem space of "power, and how to topple it" in a lot of ways. I don't know where to post it, but it mirrors my general strategy in a lot of ways. Especially

  1. Identify the vulnerabilities: Fragility, overconcentration, ignorance, arrogance, lack of diversity, centralization, lack of redundancy, popular disgust, anxiety, dissatisfaction or apprehension, ill-preparedness, lack of agility, overcomplexity (left hand doesn't know what the right is doing), lack of imagination and creativity, etc.

  2. Acquire resources stealthily: Put together what you need without letting your target know you're doing so, or even what you are capable of doing with them.

  3. Develop solutions that exploit the vulnerabilities.

  4. Rigorously assess the likelihood of those solutions working effectively (incapacitating the incumbent power), and deploy only the high-probability solutions, quickly, before the incumbents have time to react and defend themselves.

Firstly, I'm trying to capture some of the utility of the quickly growing 3D printing market. Then expand the market into just-in-time/decentralized manufacturing. Something everyone is trying to do, just stupidly.

I'm firmly in the camp of "AI is probably too dangerous, friendly or not. Do it that hard way and uplift existing humans.". But there's some many existential risks coming to a head at once that it may be our best bet, even if the odds aren't good.

Better then that would be a sane organization taking control, and initiating a slow singularity along with measures to deal with radicals and extremists. Mostly good psychiatric care, plenty or opportunities to kill/wire-head yourself, and generally keeping everyone happy.

Basic income was on my list, but I forgot it add it. It's also good for reducing existential risk. People who are content are a lot less likely to be extremist/blow-up-everything.
