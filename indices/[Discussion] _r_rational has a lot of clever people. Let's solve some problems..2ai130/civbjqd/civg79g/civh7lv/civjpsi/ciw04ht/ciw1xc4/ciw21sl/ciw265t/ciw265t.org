  By the time we get around to formally verifying an AI, said AI will have existed for a long while. Are we trusting people not to turn it on before it's formally verified?

The actual primary problem is figuring out which algorithms constitute both Friendliness /and/ rational AI. Writing a formally verified implementation of those algorithms is actually the smaller ending step, though it could be significantly large since mechanized proofs tend to be rather larger than formal-proofs-for-humans.
