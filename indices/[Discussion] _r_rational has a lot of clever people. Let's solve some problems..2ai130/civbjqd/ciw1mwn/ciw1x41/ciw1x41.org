Ultimately, the universities are capturing the value of the students higher future incomes. But they can't do that, because they don't exist yet.

So we add on yet another layer of complexity. Which increases the cost of good-decision-making/information. In practice, it's a situation that falls apart pretty quickly.

You could have the government take the costs of good decision making. Have them produce research on the best majors and the best schools. There's economics of scale involved. The information is more valuable the more data points you collect.

I don't know how you could, as a private entity, recoup the costs of gathering that kind of data. Incredibly valuable data, but no way to get it to people. Any thoughts?

  It is worth noting that in the absence of externalities capitalism achieves exactly what you want it to.

Hmm. The internet is a market where I don't think there's too much in the way of externalities. Maybe I'm just not seeing them very well though. Can you give me any examples of externalities on the internet?

The internet isn't really achieving exactly what I want. I think it would be closer to a "pure" idealized market, but it seems like corruption is even worse on it.
