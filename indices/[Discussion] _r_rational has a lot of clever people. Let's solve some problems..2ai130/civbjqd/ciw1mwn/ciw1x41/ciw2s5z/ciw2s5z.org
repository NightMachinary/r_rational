Well, there is a good deal of uncertainty involved, of course. This is always the [[http://www.econlib.org/library/Knight/knRUP.html][source of profit.]] (What a handsome face....) But this is true of any market to some degree. A man who distributes apples and captures that value by charging money for them will not charge more for someone with supercharged taste buds and a hankering for apples even though that person would be willing to pay far more than the typical price. Our poor apple distributor is not capturing all the value he created, but it is also not clear that this is particularly a problem--the economist's challenge is always, "What are you going to do about it?" It may be that the apple seller's price is never exactly correct, yet I would say that it is correct to say that he is capturing the value he creates.
