  Universities capture the value they create with tuition.

With respect, no they don't. I mean, there are /really obvious counterexamples/ to this universally-quantified statement of yours: Harvard and MIT. Two of the most prestigious universities on the planet, and they mostly actually run off their endowments and real-estate holdings in Boston-Cambridge. Their tuition is actually artificially low /precisely because/ they're not actually funding themselves through tuition, which means their tuition /isn't/ a rationalized inputs-to-outputs price signal.

And then there's /public/ universities, which are a major thing /everywhere/ but the United States of America... and also sometimes even in the United States of America. These run off state funding, which again, means their tuition is artificially low and not a price signal.

  Students capture the value they create with higher future incomes.

This is circular logic: it assumes value is "that which is captured in market transactions".
