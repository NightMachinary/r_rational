  So Harvard and MIT go after their students' future earnings rather than their current meager finances.

Quite to the contrary: they actually extensively subsidize their students' tuition. If they go after future earnings, it's by soliciting for donations via alumni associations.

  But sure, the higher education market is so distorted it practically warps space-time. Of course the argument implies that there is too much education rather than too little. I would bet that "Less education for all!" will never make much of a political slogan.

This assumes that you can talk of "more education" or "less education" from an economics perspective without asking the educators to clarify those terms. My personal belief is that we do, of course, have too little education, but that we certainly have too many /degrees/.

Note that unlike other people who believe this, I don't believe we had /more/ education in the past. However, in the past, the amount of knowledge in the average degree was larger /relative/ to the amount of total knowledge academia actually had. Whereas nowadays, starting somewhere around the end of elementary school, we basically teach students tiny fractions of what educated adults /should/ know, we fail to teach them things educated adults should know (ie: basic finances, job training, civics, statistics, a little bit of decision theory), we teach even the academically-bound students very little of what academia knows about their specific fields (instead preferring fake sorta-kinda wannabe-job-training that doesn't train for a job and doesn't give academic foundations /either/)... and then we kick them out with degrees.

We face a weird situation: the degree tracks that aren't targeted at in-demand job fields are overly vague and uninformative because they're focusing on trying to convey General Humane Education, while the tracks that /can/ lead to well-paid work fail to convey rigorous foundations because they're trying too hard to be job training.

The result is that graduate schools have to accept barely-educated beginners (this includes myself when I first got into grad-school) into their PhD programs, because you only really start /actually learning your field/ at a truly rigorous level in PhD school.
