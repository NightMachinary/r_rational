  That leads to a lot of entities choosing, let's say, 2 private utilitons (units of utility) and 1 public utiliton, instead of choosing 1 private and 3 public. Sure, there's more overall utility in situation two, but there are selection pressure's to consider.

Ah, externalities. Like when a dragon's smoke drifts over the quiet town of Ponyville....

It is worth noting that in the absence of externalities capitalism achieves exactly what you want it to. In the absence of transaction costs, capitalism is ridiculous at achieving every achievable and present human goal.

Universities capture the value they create with tuition. Students capture the value they create with higher future incomes. And so on.
