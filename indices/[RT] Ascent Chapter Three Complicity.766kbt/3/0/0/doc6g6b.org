Ah. Well THATS awkward.

Vash the stampede is the protagonist of a show called Trigun. He is a sharpshooter wasteland cowboy in a post apocalyptic retro sci-fi Western setting. He is nearly unbeatable, but also happens to be a strict pacifist. He will not kill no matter the circumstances. He also has long blond hair and wears a signature red over coat. In the show, he ends up pairing up with a grim dude bent on revenge, but his goofy antics and pacifist ways has them get in each other's way more often than not.

I've not read much of your story yet, but just reading the synopsis and a bit of this chapter made me wonder if it were a spin-off fic. You should probably be aware of it if using such a unique but well known name in such a setting.
