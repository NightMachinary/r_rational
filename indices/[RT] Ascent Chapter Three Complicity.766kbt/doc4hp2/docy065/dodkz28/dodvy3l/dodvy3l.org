So far there seem to be three main throughlines - the AI plot, the aliens plot, and the alien AI plot. I'm hoping that Ascent will touch on the origins of the enemy from Bows and Arrows, because that really intrigued me last time. On the other hand, Ascent seems to be a somewhat personal story about somewhay personal stakes. On the other other hand, it's called "Ascent", which carries some pretty strong implications of transcendence as a theme, so who knows? Either way, I'll be following.
