I liked this chapter way less than the other two. The dialogue felt very... I dunno, off. Stilted, on the nose.

I remember reading an article called something like "Travel by plane if it were written by bad sci-fi authors", that went "Oh, we are taking a plane. It's a very efficient means of transportation that can take us all across the world." /They embarked on the flying machine./ "But aren't you afraid the plane might crash?" "Well, it's possible, of course. I mean, planes have crashed in the past. But it remains the one safest way to travel, statistically speaking."

What I mean is, the exposition and dialogue don't feel like things the characters would talk about and think about, they feel like things being communicated to us, the audience. It feels like the whole chapter is screaming at me "This character is a kind man who has to make utilitarian choices that lead to many deaths".

--------------

The dialogue with the alien AI thing felt like the worst part of the chapter. It's SoD-breaking. Among other things:

- Vash is supposedly the president of the world, and has had his job for a while. But he demonstrates very little competence, or at least very little negotiating skill. It would make sense if the narration was trying to imply that he's not fit for the job and he's just completely overwhelmed, but the rest of the chapter seems to imply that he's somewhat experienced, and can keep a cool head. Basically, the question I'm asking is: if Obama (or Bill Gates or someone who's leading abilities you respect) were having this conversation, is that how they'd react?

- Vash doesn't seem to understand the Alien at all. I know this is supposed to indicate that the Alien is weird and inhuman, but as written it just implies that Vash isn't fit for his job. Has Vash never talked to the Alien before? If not, then hasn't he at least been briefed? Talked to previous ambassadors? Listened to previous recordings of the Alien? At the very least, Vash should know enough to realize that his appeals to compassion and respect for human life aren't going to cut it.

- The Alien threatens to nuke the entire colony if the crowd doesn't disperse. Why does Vash believe it, but the crowds don't? Presumably, the crowds are aware that the Alien exists. Has it never blown a colony before? (I think it's implied it did recently) I know crowds can be irrational, but "An entire city was nuked from above and the same might happen to us" isn't something that people just rationalize away. "This person can and will kill me if pushed" is a very basic, very instinctive concept; especially in a post-apocalypse society where cops shoot to kill.

- Why doesn't Vash try to reason with the Alien? An argument he could have made is "These protests were started /because/ you blew up a city. I can disperse this one, but if you blow us up, other protests will pop up elsewhere. It will work out better if you leave me time to disperse the protest."

- Also, I'm not sure I get why the Alien doesn't like riots, but if it's memetic propagation, I'm not sure how much sense it makes. I don't think people socialize that much in violent protests; they're all going to be focused on the citadel, not each other.

Overall, the whole situation seems blatantly forced to give Vash a reason to order civilians to be shot.
