Regarding the phone exchange, I think it would work better if Vash was more... I don't know, centered. Like, if it felt like he had a plan in mind of dealing with the alien, and that plan backfired because of incomplete information or because he lacked experience dealing with it. As it is, it felt like he had no plan at all beyond "Please don't kill people, don't you see that they are innocent?"
