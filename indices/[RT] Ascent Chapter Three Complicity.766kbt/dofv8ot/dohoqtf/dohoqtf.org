I'm sorry to hear that. I too have read that and found it hilarious, in part because it perfectly satirises a failing I can acknowledge that I'm guilty of at times. I wonder if it may be the fact that Vash is a new voice and one that still needs refining? I'll certainly bare it in mind... Your criticism of Vash's phone conversation however I think is partly based on mistaken assumptions. The exchange is intended to seem 'off', and hopefully as the story unfolds things will become clearer. To respond (without giving too much away):

1) Vash's role is more complicated than that. He's 'ambassador', but the title is essentially euphemistic. 'Those above' and the Arco administration are not on an even footing in any sense and they both know it.

2) Contact has been incredibly limited. There is no real diplomatic exchange, just orders issued via the phone. Thus Vash has only a vague idea of how they think, discerned from the orders they give.

3) A great number of people are beginning to believe that 'those above' are an Arco fiction to justify repression, or that the two directly collude. Surely Arco wouldn't flatten it's own capital to stop a protest? Furthermore the use of orbital strikes against population centres is a recent phenomenon. The perpetrators are not a monolithic bloc.

4/5) I'm not sure I can really address these without giving too much away at the moment.

Normally I'd just respond with 'wait and see' to these kind of questions, but the fact that you clearly get the 'point' of the chapter whilst feeling it is forced gives me pause for thought. I went with the approach of giving very little away about the context of the exchange, in order that it might be revealed more gradually, but maybe I didn't explain enough. I'll definitely think about this one.
