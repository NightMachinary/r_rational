You could go insane, your friends and family could all die, etc. right now, and then you're left in a situation where you have ~60+ years to live on (at 17).

And obviously, if you figured out a way to cure your own horrible degenerative disease, you'd try and apply the cure to your family, loved ones, friends, and then just sell it to people.
