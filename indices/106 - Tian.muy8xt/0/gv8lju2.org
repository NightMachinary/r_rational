Some flashback/backstory on Tian to flesh her and the Cultivation world out a little bit more. Also, hopefully the logic regarding why she wants to be immortal makes sense. It is very much inspired by this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25qzDhGLx8][CGP Grey]] video I watched when I was 17 years old, which I could never quite relate to. Personally, I would never want to be immortal. I wouldn't mind living a little longer. Just... not dying sounds troublesome to me. What happens if you go insane? Lose your mind? Or what if everyone you know just... dies?

It just sounds lonely, to me. But how would a culture that can /actually/ cure death react to it? Certainly not the same way I would. Hence, the logic I hopefully try to rationalize here.
