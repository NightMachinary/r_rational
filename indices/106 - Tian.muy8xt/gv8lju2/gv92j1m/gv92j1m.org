I think you may have missed the main point of the video.

Growing up in a society where death has so far been inevitable, it's natural that we come up with rationalisation as to why death isn't so bad after all, even desirable.

But for each probleme which death gives a solution, death is the absolute worst solution! (Overpopulation? Just kill some of them... Bored? No probleme just die before you had the time to explore 0.1% of what there is... and my favorite: people i love might die, well i guess i really should also hurry up and die as well so i don't get lonely)

Don't take the status quo of how the world i for how the world should be.
