Ahaha, I knew Mark couldn't be dead if we didn't see the body. Suck it, Dylan! You thought he was your narrative appendage, but now you're just part of his backstory.

On a darker note, it concerns me greatly that an angel said Uriel is "dead." There's a real tone of finality to that. Do angels use that term for those who are temporarily destroyed but will recoalesce later? Is it possible that Uriel is gone for good? Because I would be /seriously/ bummed.
