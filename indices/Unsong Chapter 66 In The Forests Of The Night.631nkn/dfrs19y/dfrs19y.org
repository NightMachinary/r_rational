Mark, a man who spins stories to the universe is now on a boat, which makes him our Mark Twain. Mark Twain's original name (before he took the boating term) was Samuel Clemens. "Samuel" refers both to a name of Hebrew origin meaning "name of God" or "God has heard," and to the spirit of America, Uncle Sam. "Clemens" is a Latin name meaning "merciful." Therefore, Mark's arrival signifies that God will hear his own name and mercifully save America.
