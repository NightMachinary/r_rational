Fair enough. But if you want it to do a behavioral simulation, you would have to precisely input all the parameters of the simulation. Consider that "I" is not a well-defined entity -- your brain state changes every day when you have breakfast. Furthermore, asking about a being "with my brain state when I woke up this morning" could potentially lead to problems down the line - that brain state may be incompatible with, say, not having bright sunlight in your face while lying in bed.

But if you /can/ describe all the parameters of the simulation in an unambiguous and consistent way (while fitting it into 8.5x11" with 12 point font) then you will have an answer.
