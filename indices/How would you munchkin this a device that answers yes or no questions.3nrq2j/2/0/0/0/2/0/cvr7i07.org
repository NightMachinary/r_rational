Definitely. Anything you can do to move away from the 27^{50} search space to a "realistic set of options" space is going to vastly cut down the number of questions required. Dictionaries and guessing at words without bruteforcing /every single letter individually/ would be vital.

For example you could generate a list of hypotheses then for your first question ask whether any of them are correct; if it says yes then you've cut the search time enormously.
