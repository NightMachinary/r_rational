34 days isn't too bad, and I know if I had such a sheet of superpaper, I would definitely be alarm clocking it to get 24 answers out of it a day. 34 days for the rules, then binary search a path to immortality. That one might take a few years, but I'm patient, once I have immortality, I have all the time in the universe.
