Oh boy now we're cooking with gas! Okay, well, if it doesn't mind being recorded, then we can start with some equipment to check for things like EM fields, temperature fluctuations in the paper, and other stuff I can't think of offhand. When a person writes something on paper with a writing implement, a small amount of friction (and thus heat) is generated at the contact point between the tool and the paper, look for things like that. Make sure there's not a tentacle belonging to some huge eldritch entity reaching in with its intangible limbs and and writing the answers.

As for what questions to ask, lets start with basics.

Use [[/u/pyschobeans]] approach with the following starter questions.

What are you?

How do you answer questions posed to you?

How were you created?

Who created you?

Why were you created?

That's just a few for starters.
