If it is a bound demon with full read access to the universe, then you've already lost.

We've already established that it has unspeakable computational capability. We could conceivably convert Chinese characters into a numeral system, using all the characters in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangxi_Dictionary][Kangxi Dictionary]], in order, as numerals in a base-49,030 numeral system which we henceforth call the Kangxi Numeral system. We could then ask "When converting the following number, X, from the Kangxi numeral system into the base-10 Arabic numeral system, is the digit '7' the last digit in the smallest prime factor of X?" and follow this with 1,500 characters, creating a number which is 332,140 bits long.

We can repeat with each digit, and go from last digit to second-to-last, etc. and eventually establish the smallest prime factor of a number which could easily be a composite of two large primes. We would be able to prove the answer to be correct, despite not having anywhere near the tiniest, smallest, glimmer of having any shred of being able to provide enough computational power to actually calculate that on our own.

Brute force trial factorization by division would require 10^{49,992} divisions. There's only about 10^{80} atoms in the observable universe, and only about 10^{100} years before the heat death of the universe. Even if every atom in the universe were a 10 Ghz CPU trying to solve this question, you would not come anywhere even remotely close to an answer before the heat death of the universe. Yet this sheet of paper can start to print out an answer within one hour.

So why have you already lost? Because the sheet of paper, or whatever entity is behind it, is most likely capable of running billions of simultaneous complete simulations of our universe and running it substantially faster than real-time. Even if it does not give /you/ information about the future, we have established that it is fully capable of deriving nearly exact probabilities about events stretching years into the future (or even exact simulations if there is no true quantum uncertainty).

This means that any action that you take (including not taking an action) is something the sheet is already anticipating as your response to the information it provides. As such, if it is truly a bound demon, then destroying the sheet will only serve to further the demon's ends. Perhaps destroying the sheet releases the demon?

So, basically, if the sheet is a bound demon, you're doomed and nothing you do will change that, so you can enjoy what little you have left in life. If the sheet is not a bound demon, you are free to munchkin up interesting uses for it and improve life for yourself and everyone else.
