It having knowledge of everything but lacking contextual clues seems incompatible. Either an entity knows /everything/ or it doesn't. It would seem to me that it would know the answers to such questions, but be unable to give them for some reason.

I would begin by asking if it can answer questions about itself. Figuring out how the paper works (how it actually collects the information) could be even more valuable than the paper itself.

I would try to get more than yes or no answers out of it. For a question "X" I would ask "Is the first letter of the answer to "X" the letter 'a'?" and repeat for each letter.

What I would do next would depend on if the above works.

Edit: "Do you have a computational power limit?" and "Do you consume energy to function?" seem like highly important questions.
