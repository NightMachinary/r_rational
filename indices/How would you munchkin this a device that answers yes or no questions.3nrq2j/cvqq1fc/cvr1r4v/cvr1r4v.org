Even assuming you are awake 24/7 or can have a printer print new questions on it every two hours, that's only 12 questions per day. That may not be nearly enough to discover the precise parameters of even one path in a lifetime.

You /could/ use it to discover if anyone has already accidentally stumbled on the path, and eventually get a name and location for them. If you're blindly sweeping for the path, though, you could be there a very long time.
