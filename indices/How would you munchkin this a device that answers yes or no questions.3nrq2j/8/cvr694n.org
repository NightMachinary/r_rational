Become rich. Magic paper makes this trivial.

Find people who are better than me at this kind of puzzle. Effective altruists, FAI researchers, cancer researchers, whoever is working on the problems that stand to benefit the most people. Give them grants to do more research. Hire advisers to sift through and find which sectors would most benefit humanity.

Contact them through hired proxies then use said answers to supercharge their research rate. Something along the lines of 'this other lab of mine proved the following thing to be true, but I'd like you to check and make sure.' Because while knowing the answers is great, you have to prove that they're correct for the scientific community to listen, so these guys will essentially churn out explanations for the correct answers. More importantly, they will figure out what questions are important to ask next in order to keep speeding ahead.

Use those correct answers to develop and build a massive technology conglomerate that is years ahead of everyone else. Become fabulously rich. As we get further from current day technology and the questions get harder to find answers for it will take more time to churn out each scientific paper. As a result, more researchers would be needed to keep justifying answers. Acquire additional +pylons+ researchers.

Crank out the next generation of technology, solve the practical problem of fission reactors, cure diseases and solve immortality. Become hilariously wealthy. Do the Bill Gates thing and try to improve the world.

I look at the responses here so far (including mine), and it all seems like the obvious thing to do. Then I remember what most people would use it for. Kinda makes me feel strange.
