  I can specify an encoding and use it to output a binary representation of the answer to virtually any question
#+end_quote

All you get is still one bit. You can't get it answer any in a form you need. I think it will answer NO to a question "Is there any form of question/s that can be used to get several bits of information out of you that are answers to a same question in a binary coded manner?" It can't store any information. You possible could add new information to a new question making a growing chain but paper has it's limits in a size of a question.
