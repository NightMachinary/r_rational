Having flawless information looks pretty similar to predicting the near future. Humans already make all sorts of predictions of the future without knowing it.

Stock prices etc. are just a form of information, and any information advantage you have on the market can easily be translated into money. It's the ultimate in insider trading. Magic paper, is there a greater than 55% chance that Apple stock will increase by 2% in the next week? If I know whether a rumored merger is actually being discussed I have a huge advantage on the market. Magic paper, has the Fed decided to lower interest rates? Have G.E.'s earnings exceed the predicted value over the last quarter? This information is all known well before it's announced, and thus is well within the power of my notebook paper, but before it's publicly known, it's basically as good as gold.

Making lots of money ........ ✔

It also seems like it would be super useful for guiding research. Lots of long research projects have single bit answers at the end. Does P=NP? Is cold fusion possible? Can a superconductor stable at standard temperature and pressure be created using currently available technology?

Advancing science and human progress ........ ✔

And then of course my piece of paper is a halting oracle, and so I can specify an encoding and use it to output a binary representation of the answer to virtually any question. I'll need some knowledge to start with so I can ask good questions with short answers, but since I have plenty of money to hire researchers and I am hyper-efficient at directing research, paying people to come up with good compression algorithms for hard questions shouldn't be too difficult. Outputting the chemical formula of miracle materials like cancer cures and cheap water splitting catalysts seems particularly easy.

God-like power .............. ✔
