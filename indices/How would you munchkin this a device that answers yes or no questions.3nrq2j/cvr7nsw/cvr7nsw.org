  When your question is insufficiently precise, you will see a slanted question mark appear beneath your query in response. "Is Fermat's last theorem true?" produces such a question mark. By contrast "Does Fermat's last theorem follow from the ZFC axioms?" produces a "Yes." It seems that the paper has some background knowledge and does not need an explanation of what Fermat's last theorem is or what the ZFC axioms are.

So it solves the Halting Problem while also defying the normal laws of computational complexity. That basically violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics while also granting an easy path to recursive cognitive enhancement.
