Set up a printer and a camera to do the menial labor for me. Perhaps a critter behind a timed window to do the glancing.

To circumvent the length restriction: "What is the answer to the question in the file C:\ask.txt?"

"Suppose there was a copy of me at the time of the last time I clapped my hands in a deterministic universe in which it is omnipotent, initially containing it, a functional copy of this piece of paper and a keyboard with buttons labelled Yes and No. What is the label of the button it presses first?" Continue with second, third, etc.

My plan is that the copy first thinks long and hard about whether the real universe is still needed. After all, from its point of view, it has already won. Permutation City is a pretty good happy ending.

The first bit the copy transmits is to be whether I should ask further questions about its universe. The second bit is to be whether the following plan is okay or whether I should think again. The next few bits do exponential/binary-search on the number of bits in the verbose message transmitted immediately after via... probably dictionary-binary-search. (The exponential search begins with a bit saying whether the first verbose message ends.)

I am expecting the first message to specify a better transmission protocol. Possibly it'll just be garbage that Simurghly guides the universe towards maximum utility via chaos theory, depending on how hard my copy succeeds in exploiting its ressources. (After all, I gave it all it needs to instantiate further universes!)

In the actual situation, I would think long and hard on the formulation of the universe of the copy I would actually use. You can tell me how badly the "wish" I wrote above is subverted by the genie, and you can also tell me how well it would work if I had specified my CEV better.
