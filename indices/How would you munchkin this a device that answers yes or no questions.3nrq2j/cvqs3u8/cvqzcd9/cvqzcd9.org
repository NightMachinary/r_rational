  Magic paper, is there a greater than 55% chance that Apple stock will increase by 2% in the next week? If I know whether a rumored merger is actually being discussed I have a huge advantage on the market. Magic paper, has the Fed decided to lower interest rates? Have G.E.'s earnings exceed the predicted value over the last quarter? This information is all known well before it's announced, and thus is well within the power of my notebook paper, but before it's publicly known, it's basically as good as gold.
