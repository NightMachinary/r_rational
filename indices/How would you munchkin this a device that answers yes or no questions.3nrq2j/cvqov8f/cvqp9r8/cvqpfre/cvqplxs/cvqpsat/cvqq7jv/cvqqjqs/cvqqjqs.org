But it /has/ a precise map of my brain state, since it knows everything about the present. It knows everything I know, and can thus compute anything I can compute. So any question that I can arrive at a definite "yes" or "no" to, it can answer. I can just precommit to decide between "yes" or "no" in the case that I would be unsure.

Edit: Actually, I don't need precommitment. I can just ask "Would I answer yes to "Is my girlfriend cheating on me" if I had the same knowledge that you do?"
