Indeed, I agree. But if you do the calculations, you should still find it quite difficult to obtain answers which are even moderately long.

For example: suppose an answer has 50 characters (i.e., about ten words). There are 26 letters in the English language plus space, which leads to 27^{50} possibilities. Each question can cut down the space by a factor of 2 at most, so you will need at least log_2(27^{50)} questions; dividing this by, say, 7 questions a day, you get about 34 days.

You can probably do much better by making use of the redundancy of the English language, whose entropy is not that high, though your ability to use various error-correcting codes for this purpose is extremely limited by the fact that you need to fit the questions on an 8.5x11" piece of paper in 12 point font.
