We can assume by OP's answers that the paper is some form of conscious entity with (at least) full read access to the universe. The best course of action is to immediately destroy the paper, as we have no way of determining if the entity means harm to us. There is a high chance that it is a bound demon trying to escape, and that risk is not worth taking.
