Other possible angles of attack would be to figure out how the paper works, and if its recreatable. Things like, what counts as 'observed' in the context of the paper? If I have a machine taking video of it, does it stop working? Or does it do something weird like retroactively erase the information when you look at the video? (which would be crazy and imply all sorts of weird new physics)

Does the answer show up in ink, pencil, human blood? Does it just use what you used to write the question?
