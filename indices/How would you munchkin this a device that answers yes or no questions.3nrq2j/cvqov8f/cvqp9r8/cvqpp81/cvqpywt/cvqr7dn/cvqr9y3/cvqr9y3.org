Just to clarify: 34 days is an upper bound on the time to get an answer to any well-defined question /whose answer has 50 characters or fewer/.

That is assuming 7 questions per day. If you get 12 questions out of it per day (e.g., by sleeping half hour every hour or some such thing), you can get it in less than 20 days.

Edit: Actually, thinking about it, you can ask whether the k'th bit of the LZ algorithm (essentially what zip uses to compress text) is 1 or 0. Using Shannon's famous estimate of 1.6 for the entropy of the English language, this lets you produce answers at a rate of about 0.31 characters per hour. This means you would need about 7 days to get a 50 character answer.
