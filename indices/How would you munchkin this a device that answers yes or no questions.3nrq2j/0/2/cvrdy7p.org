Precision for direct immortality questions would be difficult. Does having your name "immortalized" in history (or a headstone) count?

I think I would start by looking for small molecules to cure various conditions. I'd start with diseases that are currently sucking up all the research funding, but aren't producing very fast advances, for example Alzheimer's: "have one or more molecules existed that would, at some correct dosage, cure greater than 80% of Alzheimer's patients without killing them?"

If you get a yes then you find it with

"For the molecules referenced by the question asked at [first question's date/times]. Is the k-th character of the IUPAC name for the molecule with the shortest IUPAC name numeric?"

You'd know you had the complete name when you asked about the next character and got a ?.

Now you just have to ask about dosage per kilo and/or administration methods and hardest of all, get the FDA to trust the paper enough to skip clinical trails for things discovered by precise use of the paper.
