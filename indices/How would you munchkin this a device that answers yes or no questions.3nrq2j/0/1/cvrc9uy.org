That would also be my goal, but I'm not sure we could get all the way there given the time constraints others are talking about, but it would definitely get you some really really great to have information about where to look.

I'd probably start by categorically ruling out things that, while most rational people dismiss them, would completely change the game if they existed. I'd ask about magic, the supernatural, and perhaps spend one question on technologically advanced aliens. Hopefully it wouldn't take long to rule out things like lich-dom and then you could go back to the difficult task of asking specific enough questions to get answers that advance science.
