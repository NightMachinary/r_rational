As a hypothetical, imagine that someone in Ancient Greece had this piece of paper. Could that person use it to advance the state of scientific knowledge to 20th century level within their lifetime via binary search?

I'm not so sure. It seems that certain conceptual leaps are necessary to even /ask/ the right questions. For example, to even conceive of relativity theory one has to be able to imagine time as "just another dimension" not altogether different from the three spatial dimensions. I believe even something as basic as the use of coordinates was foreign to ancient Greeks and introduced by Descartes.
