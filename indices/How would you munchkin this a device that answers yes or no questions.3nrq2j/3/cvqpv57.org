  The piece of paper cannot predict the future. It does not know which stocks will rise or fall tomorrow. It can, however, answer any question about the present or the past, provided the question itself is well-defined.

It knows the state of the world, it knows physics, and it is apparently good at calculating, so it can be used to predict the future even if you have to use some workarounds.

As the simplest possible example, ask it "is there milk for sale at Store X". Given its answer, you can predict whether or not you will find milk there when you go shopping.

You can flip a coin and hide it under a cup without looking. Ask it "Is it heads?" You can then predict what you will see when you lift the cup to check.

You can also set up a Rube-Goldberg machine (that will flip a coin) in very controlled conditions, and ask it "Is this machine set up to flip heads?" You can then predict the machine's actions.

You could ask "Does this person have pre-cancerous (or cancerous) tumors that are consistent with mortality within five years if untreated?"

Not being able to /directly/ predict the future isn't that big of a handicap.
