I don't really understand why people try to consciously control tense use, or why it matters if you arbitrarily switch tenses when it feels right. I just go by instinct, do what feels natural. Usually, past tense feels natural, probably because everyone else uses it, but not always.

I think someone just decided one day that everyone aught to keep consistent tense, and no one questioned it.

I guess it's nice to be /aware/ when you switch tenses so that you don't just arbitrarily shift due to lapses in attention or something (since the longer time scales involved in writing might contain accidental tense shifts which would be jarring and unnatural in a spoken conversation) but I don't think it matters that much.
