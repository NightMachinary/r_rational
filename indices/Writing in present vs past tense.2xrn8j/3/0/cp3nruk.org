I think this is a good analysis. One other point I'd like to add is that you can weave present tense into a predominantly past-tense story if you're careful. I forget exactly where so I cant link it, but Eliezer has a few passages written in present tense in HPMOR that I thought worked really well. Any present tense at all is nonstandard, but it can have a good effect when used judiciously.
