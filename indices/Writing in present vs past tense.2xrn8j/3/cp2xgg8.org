I almost always write in past tense. I tend to prefer stories written in past tense. However, there are a few exceptions:

- [[http://qntm.org/fiction][Sam Hughes is great]] and most of it is present tense
- Neal Stephenson mostly writes in present tense
- Charles Stross has written a few books in /second person/ present tense

Mostly I think it's a matter of getting into the style for me - I won't put something down because it's in present tense, but I does take me out of the book up until the point that I get used to it. I've found that this is true of a lot of choices authors make about style and voice.

As for pros and cons, the large point of picking out a tense is what you want the reader to feel on a subconscious level. People often make the claim that immediacy is the big benefit of present tense, and that grounding is the big benefit of past tense. I'm not entirely sure that I agree, but it's a popular line of thought.
