Note: I'm not much of a writer; this is exclusively from the perspective of a reader.

Anyway, in my experience, either tense can work. As long as the story doesn't randomly change between tenses, I tend to be fine. /However/, an interesting pattern I've found is that it's much more jarring for me to read a past-tense story after spending a lot of time on present-tense ones than it is to read a present-tense one after spending a lot of time on past-tense ones. Kind of an interesting asymmetry.
