I see people mentioning that present tense is jarring but not why. (And jarring is the right word.) When you use present tense you're describing a succession of presents, like a slideshow, whereas setting something in the past necessarily gives it direction---"and this led to something".

And as eaglejarl points out below, present tense can make it difficult to anything but live visual description. Where's that pocket time coming from?

But there's definitely an unuseful stigma against shifting between tenses in a single work.
