I'm currently writing a story in second person present tense with occasional digressions into past and future tense, and it is the most enjoyable way I've ever written fiction.

My advice would be to slam out a couple paragraphs in each tense, making full use of the toys that tense gives you, to see which you enjoy writing in most. If you enjoy working with the constraints you set for yourself, it will show up in your work, and your enjoyment of the work will be infectious.
