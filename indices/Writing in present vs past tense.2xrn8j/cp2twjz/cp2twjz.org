Present tense can make a story feel urgent and present, giving a strong sense of pace, but it can also be jarring and off putting. It can be quite exhausting to read something that is set in present tense. It can also constrain the type of stories you can tell in a way that past tense does not. For an excellent example of where it works, try reading the Night Circus (which is a lovely book anyway).
