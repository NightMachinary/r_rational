Tense usage is one of many tools you can choose to use. I used second person intentionally as a kind of 'imposition of world view' in one of my stories.

This works DISTURBINGLY WELL for some audience members, to the point that I decided to stop using second person.

Present tense works a certain way, past tense works a certain way. First person, second person and third person all act on the audience in different ways.

The 'what feels natural' thing I find is something that generally has to be learned either from reading a lot of fiction or by really studying language.

So Consciously paying attention to tenses and trying out short hand easy rules as a kind of 'framework' to teach yourself effects can be usefull.
