When you consistently tell some one "you feel this way" or "you see this" and do it with intent of presenting them that consistent world view I noticed that it seemed to really 'get into the heads' of some of the audience members.

By about halfway through the story no one really was 'breaking character' at all from what I'd planned even though the entire project was built around the idea of user contributions and I intentionally made an effort to never ignore or waste ANY suggestion no matter how ridiculous.

I'm trying something a bit different in my tense usage now with my current project and It seems to be slightly better about that.
