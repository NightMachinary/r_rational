I think that past tense has its place, and perhaps it isn't a bad default, but all of the tenses and points of view should be used at least few times.

I prefer present-tense for a lot of my writing, but I think that just might be a side effect of liking to write in the second-person. I don't do it all the time, or even half the time, but it's pretty close.
