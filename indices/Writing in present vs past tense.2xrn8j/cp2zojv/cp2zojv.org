I write in past tense myself. I find it far easier to get a feel for what I write when I read it back to myself. Past tense is a storyteller tense, so I can imagine the story being spoken out loud, and pick out at least some of the awkward parts.

Nothing wrong with present tense, but it's difficult for me to deal with as check what I write.
