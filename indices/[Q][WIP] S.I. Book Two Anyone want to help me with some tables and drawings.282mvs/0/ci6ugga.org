I'm game. Although I too am going through a period of exam-induced PS celibacy, yet unbroken - I'd be happy to help out. A bit unsure as to what exactly you are going for though, particularly about the tables. Could you elaborate a bit?

Maybe you could draw a quick draft of the symbols on paper and then send us a picture. We could then clean it up a bit, touch it up..

Also, First contact is totally <3 - can't wait to read it :P
