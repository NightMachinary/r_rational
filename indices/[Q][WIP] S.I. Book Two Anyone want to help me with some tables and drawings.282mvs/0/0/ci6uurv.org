I'm just now writing down what I've worked out in my head... and I'm about to run some errands, so it'll be a few hours before I can add more, but here's what I've got down so far:

- Physical medium: Using knives to scratch onto wooden/plastic blocks, the blocks about a meter across.

- First table: introduces various representations of numbers 0-12.

- First column: That number of dots.

- Second column: That number in binary, with vertical strokes for '1' and horizontal strokes for '0'.

- Third column: Variations of regular digits, so that each digit has the appropriate number of interior angles holding digits. Eg, 0 is round; 1 has a serif on top but not bottom (looking almost like the number 7); 2 looks like a Z; 3 looks like a sideways W; 7 has both a crossbar and a serif at bottom. 10, 11, and 12 have no entries in this column.

- Fourth column: Regular digits.

- Fifth column: The number written out as an English word, though written in para-Unifon letters.

- Para-Unifon: Unifon is a proposal to write English with one sound per letter and one letter per sound. 40 letters. Para-unifon uses the same principle, but slightly different letters. (Para-unifon is the alphabet used by the Toledo Free Press.) Ant: A Apron: A with stroke at bottom, or [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Gaelic-fonts.png]] bAll: A without a horizontal stroke Bee: B CHair: C with a horizontal stroke Dog: D Egg: E EAgle: E with the vertical stroke in the middle hER: mirrored E merged with R Fish: F Goat: G House: H Igloo: I Ice: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eihwaz]] Jaw: J Kiss: K Law: L Man: M Name: N riNG: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yngvi#The_Ingwaz_rune]] pOt: O Ocean: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odal_%28rune%29]] bOOk: O with a vertical stroke, or double-o OWl: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wynn]] OIl: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%92]] Pipe: P Rat: R Sun: S SHirt: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esh_%28letter%29]] Tent: T feaTHer: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eth]] THermometer: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_%28letter%29]] Umbrella: U rUler, nEW: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur_%28rune%29]] Unicorn, YOU: U with horizontal stroke at bottom Vest: V Wagon: W, or double-u viSIon: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhe_%28Cyrillic%29]] Yam: Y Zoo: Z with horizontal stroke

Basic math symbols through examples: Equals, plus, minus, times, divide (using obelus sign), exponent, decimal point, negative number, imaginary number

- Physics
- Based on the Voyager record, the symbol for hydrogen: a 1 in a circle, with a small stroke at the top of the symbol.
- A hydrogen atom: Two symbols for hydrogen. On one, there is a small dot on top of the small stroke, on the other, a small dot on the bottom of the small stroke. They are scaled so that a line with two endpoints above the atom is as close to 21.1 cm as possible.
- Length unit: 21.1 cm is titled "Span" (in para-unifon)
- Oxygen: An 8, surrounded by a circle with two strokes, surrounded by a circle with six strokes (2, 2, 1, 1).
- Chemistry: Water: two Hydrogens and an Oxygen, joined.
- Mass unit: One cubic span of water. (~20 pounds), titled "Stone"
