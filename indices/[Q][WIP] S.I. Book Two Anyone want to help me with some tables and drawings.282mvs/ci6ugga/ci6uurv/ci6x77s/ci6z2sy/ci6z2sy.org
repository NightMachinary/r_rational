Close, but not quite. The point of the internal-angle column is to form a bridge between the numbers of dots, and the standard Arabic numerals. With a bit of thought, it's possible to stylize Arabic numerals to have the appropriate number of internal angles. Eg, for 4, use a closed top and no line sticking out to the right - three angles inside the triangle, plus one beneath it make four. 6 and 8 can come straight from digital calculators. 5 can be a 6 missing a bit of the lower-left line. 9 can start like an upside-down 6, but with a few more line-segments curling in the bottom.

I'm a texty sort of person; I'd be happy even with plain black symbols on a plain white background. Anything more than that is gravy. :)
