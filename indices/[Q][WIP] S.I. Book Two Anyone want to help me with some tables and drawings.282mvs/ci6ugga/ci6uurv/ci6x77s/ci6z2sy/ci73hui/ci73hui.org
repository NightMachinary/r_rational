Depending on how Reddit formats this out, this is my current iteration of notes:

- Goal: Indicate to a non-human intelligence that Bunny has intelligence, agency, and isn't happy about being abducted.

- Physical medium: Using knives to scratch onto wooden/plastic blocks, the blocks about a meter across.

--------------

- First table: introduces various representations of numbers 0-12.
- First column: That number of dots.
- Second column: That number in binary, with vertical strokes for '1' and horizontal strokes for '0'.
- Third column: Variations of regular digits, so that each digit has the appropriate number of interior angles holding digits. Eg, 0 is round; 1 has a serif on top but not bottom (looking almost like the number 7); 2 looks like a Z; 3 looks like a sideways W; 7 has both a crossbar and a serif at bottom. 10, 11, and 12 have no entries in this column.
- Fourth column: Regular digits.
- Fifth column: The number written out as an English word, though written in para-Unifon letters. To keep things simple, numbers over 9 are written with just their digits - twelve is 'one two' (or more closely 'WUN TU').

- Para-Unifon: Unifon is a proposal to write English with one sound per letter and one letter per sound. 40 letters. Para-unifon uses the same principle, but slightly different letters. (Para-unifon is the alphabet used by the Toledo Free Press.)

- Physics

- Based on the Voyager record, the symbol for hydrogen: a 1 in a circle, with a small stroke at the top of the symbol.

- A hydrogen atom: Two symbols for hydrogen. On one, there is a small dot on top of the small stroke, on the other, a small dot on the bottom of the small stroke. They are scaled so that a line with two endpoints above the atom is as close to 21.1 cm as possible.

- Length unit: 21.1 cm is titled "Span" (in para-unifon)

  - Bunny is just over 7 Spans tall (not including ears, which add about another span))

- Time unit: 7.04e-10 seconds. (Time light takes to traven one Span.), titled "Tick" 1 second = 1.42e9 Ticks (ie, 1420 MHz, Hydrogen line) 1 day = 1.2e14 Ticks 1 year = 4.4e16 Ticks

- Colors: Red: 3.3e-6 Spans Orange: 2.9e-6 Spans Yellow: 2.7e-6 Spans Green: 2.5e-6 Spans Blue: 2.2e-6 Spans Purple: 1.4e-6 Spans

- Chemistry:

- Oxygen: An 8, surrounded by a circle with two strokes, surrounded by a circle with six strokes (2, 2, 1, 1).

- Water: two Hydrogens and an Oxygen, joined. (Eg, [[http://obaronchemistry.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/untitled1.jpg]] )

- List of main atmosphere constituents: 78 parts Nitrogen (2 atoms of element 7), 20 parts Oxygen (2 atoms of element 8), 1 part Argon (element 18), 1 part Water (H2O)

- Mass unit: One cubic span of water. (~20 pounds), titled "Stone"

  - Bunny masses about 7 Stones.
