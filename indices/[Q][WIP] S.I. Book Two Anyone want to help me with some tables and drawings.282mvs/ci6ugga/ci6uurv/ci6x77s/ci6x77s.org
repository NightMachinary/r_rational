So.. the beginning of the table is roughly [[http://oi58.tinypic.com/152c47q.jpg][something like this]]? The idea with the angles is brilliant - love it.

This might need a collaboration with a few people though - breaking it into parts. We can do plain black brush strokes or set fonts on a transparent background and then someone can compile it together on the plastic or wooden background. Mess around in PS to change all the black strokes into scratches.

Edit: the writing is on improvised materials so, stock images of random worn junk with flat-ish surfaces for each section? If we have a photomanipulator or digipainter here who knows, maybe we could even add furry pink hands holding them.. n_n
