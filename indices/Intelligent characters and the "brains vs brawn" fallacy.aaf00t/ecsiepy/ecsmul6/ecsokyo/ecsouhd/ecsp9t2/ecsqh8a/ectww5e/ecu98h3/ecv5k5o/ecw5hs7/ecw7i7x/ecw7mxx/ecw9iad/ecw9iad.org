Look, you said that "There are very few problems the Hulk couldn't solve because the Hulk simply can afford to not give a fuck". My point is that A, no there aren't, because most relevant problems would be straight up unsolvable with brute force, and B, for the most of the ones that /would/ be solvable, Hulk's infinite brawl is not actually impressive because a much smaller (and much easier to accquire and produce en masse) bang would do the trick just as well, and you don't get extra points for overkill.

For the 1 in a hundred problem where, like, an unkillable alien that can't or won't just [[http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Glassing][glass]] Earth from space shows up, sure, Hulk is somewhat impressive. For every other case, pick Bruce Banner.
