Yep I get that, and I think it's a great notion of magic. Sanderson is very much the opposite--his magic systems have hard rules and principles, which means they can be investigated and experimented on. They're still absolutely magical, for reasons that are explored and that I won't spoil, but it's much "harder" magic than Tolkien or, say, Rowling.
