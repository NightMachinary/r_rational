I would put Sanderson on the same level as Wildbow there: incredible worldbuilding, magic systems and character development, with relatively standard, unflashy prose as a vessel. It's not bad writing by any means, but you for sure don't read Sanderson for the linguistic artistry.

That said, his settings and magic are (I think) far better executed than Tolkien's. I respect granddaddy T, but I like Sanderson's stuff a hell of a lot more.
