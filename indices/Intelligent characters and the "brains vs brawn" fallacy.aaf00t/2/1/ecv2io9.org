But as said below, those make for the most spectacular stories!

This whole discussion also reminds me to recommend to whoever's interested this Twitter account:

This Robin Black guy is an MMA commenter, and often does some great videos breaking down spectacular KOs, in which he slows down the action and highlights the cues and strategies the fighters were using. Some of these are really spectacular, and highlight how much of both strength /and/ skill (and thus, brains) go into winning a fight like this. There also was an example some time ago in which he commented humorously a video of a street brawl where some massive dude went up against a much smaller one - but the massive one was completely incompetent while the small one was able to fight and strategize.
