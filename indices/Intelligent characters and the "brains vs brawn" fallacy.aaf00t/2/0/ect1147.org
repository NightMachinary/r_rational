Yes, but I would argue that it's the unlikeliness of a physically weaker hero winning that makes it interesting and worth writing about. Taking the classical example of David v Goliath, it wouldn't be a tale worth telling if Goliath casually bitch slapped David into oblivion like he did to every other opponent. St George slaying the dragon is thrilling and exciting because the odds are against him, St George being the dragon's dinner is expected and unremarkable. Stories aren't written about unremarkable events. So thats why this trope comes up in fiction so often (though I agree that due to sheer volume, it has become a cliche now)
