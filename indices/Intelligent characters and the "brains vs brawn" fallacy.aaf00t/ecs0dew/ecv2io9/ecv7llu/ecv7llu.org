Again, I completely agree, and the caveat to the advantage of strength is an absolute lack of skill, being strong doesn't mean a thing if you are wasting your strength. MMA is a good example of what are usually rather fair fights between two oponents of similar weight class fighting in a contest of skill. Not that I have ever viewed any MMA fights in their entirety, it just seems like it would be a silly sport if either side had the overwhelming advantage I stated above over their opponent.

All fighting requires skill and strength to some degree, and an absolute lack of either is going to give you a sever disadvantage likely outweigh the significant advantage of an abundance of one.
