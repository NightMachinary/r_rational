I think that's a slightly different issue though. "Reed Richards is useless" exists not to underplay the value of brains, but to keep the world in which the stories are set relatable to us. In other words, if left unchecked, the Reed Richards/Tony Starks of the various fictional worlds would quickly turn them unrecognizable, and then we would have space opera, not superhero stories. To conveniently nerf their impact on society is a way to avoid a genre drift.
