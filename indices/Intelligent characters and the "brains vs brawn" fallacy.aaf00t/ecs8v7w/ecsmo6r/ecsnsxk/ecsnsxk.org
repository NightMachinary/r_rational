  Iron Man is a superhero by virtue of having built his own armour. That's brains and innovating. He solves (and sometimes creates!) problems through innovation.

I think Iron Man illustrates my point. His suit contains multiple revolutionary technologies, that if he put his brains to it even slightly would radically improve the status quo of mankind. Does he do that? Nope. Instead, the sole purpose his technology serves is turning him into a better brawler, and any other application is a distant secondary use. Because this is a world were brawn is king, and brains are only useful insofar as they increase your punching power. See [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless][Reed Richards is useless]] for another example of a scientist who /should/ utterly change the fabric of society, but who instead just uses his technology to be better at fist fighting.
