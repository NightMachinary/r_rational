One of my favourite examples of this is from the Masquerade series. The protagonist, a tall, strong woman with combat experience who practices a military martial arts system recreationally, says something to the effect of "the only thing that can stop a soldier is another soldier. If you're cornered by soldiers, you're already dead." She's capable in combat, sure, but she understands that her strengths lie in scheming.
