Really it depends exactly what sort of physical combat we're talking about:\\
If we're talking unarmed then brawn will win pretty much every time.\\
Introduce some weapons and it's more complicated, if it's an expert vs. someone with no training then for anything more complex than a bludgeon (mace, club etc. anything that just needs you to hit them hard) the trained guy will have the advantage. But if they're both competent, it's just that one has strength and the other even more skill, strength probably wins again.\\
Then we get to modern firearms where strength doesn't matter much, though assuming both are competent skill doesn't either, that's when you get into the fun world of both parties getting injured unless one jsut gets real lucky.
