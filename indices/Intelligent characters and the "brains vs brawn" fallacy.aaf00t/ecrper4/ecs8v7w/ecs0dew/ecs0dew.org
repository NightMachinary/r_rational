I wonder if there is a similar write up of a similar concept, the skill vs. strength fallacy, would be a good name for it. It shows up in a lot of fiction that involves melee combat, in which a smaller or weaker protagonist defeats their much larger or stronger opponent through sheer skill of arms, this is however horrendously unlikely, in almost all cases of physical combat the stronger individual has an overwhelming advantage, it is /possible/ to use technique to win against an opponent of superior strength, it is just incredibly unlikely, and would require near perfect execution or some rather good luck.
