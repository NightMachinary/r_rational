In many settings the rational thing to do is to become very strong. I like characters who break the iq vs strangth tradeoff trope, especially when they are on the "evil" side.

Witcher universe has 2 of my favourite examples (Witcher 2 game and Baptism of Fire book spoilers ahead):

Letho who looks like Conan, and exploits this to outsmart powerful political factions, and Vilgefortz, who looks like nerdy wizard, but mops the floor with fucking Geralt of Rivia in a melee duel.
