I don't agree. I think it is unfair to call this article anti-intellectual, when the entire point of it is that intelligence does not have to be the opposite of physical skill/strength.

To me, on of the hallmarks of rational fiction, as opposed to fiction about classic 'Hollywood smart' characters, is their willingness to 'kick down the door'. To stop acting like what a story expects smart /characters/ to act like, and instead act like normal, intelligent /people/ instead.

Yes, good stories always challenge the protagonists with things that both match their skill set, and things that contrast it, but that isn't what this article is about. This article isn't about specialists vs. generalists; as far as I understood it, its about complexity vs. simplicity, and how favoring complexity when simplicity is a perfectly viable solution is a fallacy, with 'brains' vs. 'brawn' just being stand-ins.

It's not about how stories that favor brains are bad and complex, and stories that favor brawn are good and realistic because they go for the simple approach. Its about how, if you are going to have the solution to a problem in your story be complex, you should first make certain that there isn't a much simpler solution you're ignoring, waiting to undercut your entire plot. If you are going to have your hero hack the keypad guarding an electronic door, you should first make certain that they can't just kick the door down.

Stories that favor brawn sometimes avoid this fallacy, because in many cases the best solution available to the characters really is 'punch harder'. And when it isn't, people on the internet come together to create communities like [[/r/rational][r/rational]], where they laugh at how foolish the characters are, with their fixation on 'brawn', and try to write alternate versions of the story where the protagonists realize they can use brains instead. If that is fair, then I think its perfectly fair to be annoyed by characters that fixate on brains, when brawn would have been a much easier, and much simpler solution to their problem.

The author even addresses your point about real world problems, albeit in a roundabout manner, when they say that a very easy way to avoid this fallacy would be to create problems that actually can't be solved by brawn; for example, making doors that are impossible to kick down. Writing a story where the main conflict is about getting people to vote for a law, without starting a civil war, is exactly the kind of thing the author seems to be advocating for; using complex means (brains), to solve complex problems, instead of being so allergic to simple solutions (brawn) that you end up using needlessly complex means to solve simple problems.

And on the whole generalist vs specialist argument; yes, specialists tend to win out, especially in the modern world. But in this context its less 'being a specialist is bad', and more 'being so specialized that you become incapable of doing simple, basic tasks is bad'; the difference between going to college to become a physicist, and only ever studying physics from the moment you are born until the moment you die, without bothering to ever learn language or social skills. Specializing in computer science and becoming a hacker is still great. But focusing so hard on that narrow area that you become incapable of thinking outside it and realizing that kicking down a door is lot easier than hacking the keypad that keeps it locked, is definitely bad.

TLDR: I think calling an article anti-intellectual nonsense, when its all about the benefits of out-of-the-box thinking and how physical fitness does not have to be opposed to be intellectual ability, is very unfair.
