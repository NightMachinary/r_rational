The Hulk however doesn't just have brawns, he has brawns on a scale beyond human comprehension. There are very few problems the Hulk couldn't solve because the Hulk simply can afford to /not give a fuck/. He doesn't need to sneak, if he's found out what are they going to do, shoot him? They can try taking hostages, I guess, but in general he's an absolutely unstoppable force of nature, a one-man army. It takes a more contrived setup to get an enemy that /can't/ just have their head crushed by the Hulk and problem solved.
