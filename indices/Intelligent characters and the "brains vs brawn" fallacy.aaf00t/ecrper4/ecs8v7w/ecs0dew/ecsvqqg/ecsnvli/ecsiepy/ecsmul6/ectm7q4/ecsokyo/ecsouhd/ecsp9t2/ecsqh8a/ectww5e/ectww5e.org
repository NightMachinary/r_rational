Military might is not the same thing as a bigass spacearmy coming through one portal during one battle with a single artifact being key to the whole thing. Just as some examples of military might you can't smash:

- Any random guerilla movement has military might, but no central command or a big army hulk could smash. He could smash /a/ squad of fighters, if he could find it...while the rest achieve their objectives. Suppose heroes' objectives is something like war in Vietnam: need to pacify the population and estabilish a stable government while being opposed by resistance movements made up of farmers. Who is hulk going to smash? More farmers? That would just unite the rest in righteous hatred against him (and whatever force was stupid enough to use him), and they would keep killing whatever officials heroes would put in place. If he stays to protect the figurehead president, farmers kill the tax collectors, and hulk can't protect a thousand individual tax collectors. Bad guy 1, heroes 0

- Suppose villain wants to just kill every human on earth, Avengers 1 style. Big army of loyal aliens with guns that shoot people. But instead of opening a space portal above a city, he opens it in a random cave in the middle of Kenya, gets all the army summoned first, sends it all across the world in standard shipping containers, and only then triggers the attack. Suppose each alien (villain distributes them optimally and stuff) can kill 1 person per ten seconds and there is, like, a million of them. Suppose hulk's top speed is, like, 600 meters a second (twice the speed of sound, never shown in the latest Marvel movies). Then it'd take him 8.3 hours to get to the other end of the earth. In 8.3 hours, at 100 thousand people a second, that's 3 billion people killed, and that's just hulk running at top speed to the opposide end of the earth. Not, like, running to every city and killing all those aliens. Even with conservative assumptions about how good aliens would be at killing, they'd easily murder 99% of human population before hulk stops them - there is no central command to smash(all aliens are given the same "kill everyone" order that won't change and doesn't require micromanagement), no portal to close(army is already here), no badguy to beat into rescinding the offer(he is, i dunno, on Mars and Hulk can't jump that far). Bad guy 2, heroes 0.
