  The issue is that there are a lot of situations where Hulk is better at solving problems than Bruce Banner
#+end_quote

There are a lot only because situations are infinite.

Proportionally physical capability (especially since good use of physical capability requires intelligence) in a society has to come up way less. That's not the same as never of course. Battles that matter usually involve armies after all, so an individual difference in physical capability is not significant.

Really, I can think of very few scenarios Hulk can solve that you can't just hire five guys to solve instead. Except like infinite energy stuff.

Stuff like the door is hardly a place where the Hulk would shine, sneaking into somewhere. Bruce Banner would still be better suited. A bad followup example don't you think?

The rest of the article is pretty good.
