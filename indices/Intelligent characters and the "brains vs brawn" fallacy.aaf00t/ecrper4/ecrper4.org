I think there's another key reason for why "brains" solutions are preferred over "brawns" in the written medium: they come off better. If you watch a superhero movie or an anime, physical combat can be made to be nothing short of spectacular. It's aesthetically pleasing and narratively dense, as many details of a well-choreographed quick exchange of blows can communicate a lot to us about what the combatants are like and what's going on in general. On the other hand, in written word, physical combat translates poorly. You got a lot of telling and little showing, long technical descriptions or vague hints at prodigious feats of strength. Puzzles and riddles on the other hand are very well-suited to the written word. Reading about the pieces laid down and then a clever solution feels much more like I've actually /seen/ what is so great about the hero rather than just reading "and then he punched the enemy to death, the end".
