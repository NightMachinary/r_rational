It all depends on how well it's written. And I've kind of got a high bar there. Inject Lord of the Rings straight into my veins, but I dropped both Shannara and Wheel of Time out of sheer disgust. They both felt like very generic settings (of course it doesn't help that sort of high fantasy setting has been at this point codified and redone to death by every RPG I've ever played), and without a good prose to carry them, nothing really hooked me to them.
