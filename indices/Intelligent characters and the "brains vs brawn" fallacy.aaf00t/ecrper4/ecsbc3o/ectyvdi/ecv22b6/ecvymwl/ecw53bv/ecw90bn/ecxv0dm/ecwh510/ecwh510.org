I get the impression a lot of people dislike Tolkien's worldbuilding because of how vague and undefined his magic system is, but I always thought that was /the point/. It's magic. If it's logical and follows rules, it's actually more like science, natural laws, just different ones from those we're familiar with. It's magic /to us/; to that world, it's normal. But with Tolkien magic doesn't work like that. Magic is just a sheer, abstract, transcendent notion of /power/ in Tolkien. It's not the ability to shoot a finite number of fireballs, after which you're without mana and thus vulnerable. It's the ineffable notion that you're just someone who's not to be trifled with, a main character of the universe, if you want. Reality and fate themselves are your bitch (unless someone even more powerful comes along). And that lack of specific, consistent rules or logic is exactly what makes it magic in the purest sense of the word.
