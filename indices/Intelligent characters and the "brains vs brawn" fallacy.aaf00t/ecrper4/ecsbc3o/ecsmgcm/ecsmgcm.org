Hah, funny you would link that, I literally saw that movie yesterday.

But yes, I write and post a Dragon Ball fanfiction on this very subreddit, so of course I have to deal with descriptions of fights, and try to make them compelling. But it's definitely harder, and as I said, it tends to not work as a proper 'show, don't tell' moment. It can be okay but you hardly will go ZOMG HOW STRONG IS THIS GUY?!? the way you could by /seeing/ them in action.
