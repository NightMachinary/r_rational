  Super heroes dominate our pop culture, and they do no thinking, no innovating, no problem solving, they just punch and fight and employ their muscles and yet somehow keep saving the world.

I mean, not /entirely/ fair. Iron Man is a superhero by virtue of having built his own armour. That's brains and innovating. He solves (and sometimes creates!) problems through innovation. Spider-Man too is pretty clever and it often shows, if only in a vague "Hollywood science" way (which is in itself a problem, but a different one). Batman is /supposedly/ the world's best detective, and he does do some detective work... from time to time. But then yeah, we just get to the part where he goes ninja on crime's ass.
