I mean, I can keep bringing in more equalisers based on intelligence if you want, and you can keep making the opponents more and more ridiculously improbably strong to compensate (and more and more able to avoid various strategies you'd have used to not get surrounded in the first place, likely by postulating their own intelligent puppet master) until the only solution actually /is/ to be a hulk. Won't make it have any connection to reality, of course.

Intelligence is strongest when it has time and resources to counter problems in advance. You don't try to mcgyver a machine to disable your opponents on the spot, you anticipate needing to deal with physical enemies, buy/machine a gun 3 years in advance, put it in your pocket and it's there when you need it. This is entirely unlike anything that happens in comics or fiction in general, of course, as there it would be totally anticlimactic if villain couldn't put protagonist in danger because protagonist was hired by DARPA and was behind 7 proxies at all times.
