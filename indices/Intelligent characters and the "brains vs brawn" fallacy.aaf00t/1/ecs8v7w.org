I don't think brains vs. brawn is a fallacy, at least on larger scales. A mob has enforcers (brawn) and a boss (brain). The military has enlisted (brawn) and officers (brain). Medieval society had noble-warriors (brawn) and priestly-scholars (brain). Greek society had citizen-soldiers (brawn) and philosophers (brains). Dividing groups of humans up into "These guys do the thinking, these guys do the fighting" is a fairly time tested way to quickly sort things, and strikes me as a broadly useful heuristic.

What I do think is a fallacy, and the author gets at, is the idea you can rely purely on brains in all situations. There is no realistic way to convert a profound knowledge of physics into avoiding getting your ass laid out in a street fight. Real life isn't like cartoons, there won't be a convenient rube goldberg esque sequence of events you can trigger that will predictably knock out your opponents for you. This doesn't mean the protagonist needs to be capable of filling the role of brawn in the story, though. Jack Ryan illustrates this in its early episodes, were analyst Jack hangs back and lets door kickers assault terrorist strong holds. Brains did its thing finding the stronghold, now brawn does its thing clearing it out.

Overall I think the rationalist community under-appreciates the importance of a good goon. Quality goonry can turn a B-list brains villain into an A-lister in no time flat by coupling his mental power with physical power - just ask the Joker. You think that pencil-necked geek would be even a blip on Batman's radar if he didn't employ top shelf goons to keep Bats physically occupied?

  Kicking down the door may be intelligent, but it does not always live up to the romantic ideal of intelligence, which is less about actually making the best choice in any given situation, and more about believing “reading books is a better use of your time than sports, scientists are always better at solving problems and winning conflicts than linebackers.” This partly feels a bit like concession to the fact that the crowd of people who read for recreation tend to be the same kind of people who spent much of their youth indoors reading books rather than flipping tires on the football field, and people like reading stories that serve and flatter their own sensibilities.

Almost all mass media fiction is dedicated to the romantic ideal of brawn. Super heroes dominate our pop culture, and they do no thinking, no innovating, no problem solving, they just punch and fight and employ their muscles and yet somehow keep saving the world. The authors of these works need to keep inventing increasingly absurd problems that can only be solved by brawn, to justify these lunk-heads remaining employed. The real world is not lacking for tough guys who like to punch things, yet in super hero comics there is an utter drought of such individuals. The hard part of fighting crime is /solving/ the crime and finding the bad guy, but that's too brainy for super heroes. So in superheroland the primary problem is in /physically apprehending/ the bad guy because he's now 12 feet tall and shoots radiation out of his eyes, while the actual brain work of finding him is glossed over.

Or going beyond super heroes, how many movies have ended with our hero saving the day by physically beating the bad guy down? How many space battles have ended in a man on man slugging contest? How often has the villain's carefully laid out and meticulous plan been foiled by the hero charging in guns blazing, shooting everyone, and then walking off into the sunset victorious?

By contrast the 'romantic ideal of intelligence' is both much more rare, and yet ironically much more applicable to real life. There are some problems that can only be solved with brawn, but it's a small amount and gets smaller every day. Conversely, the amount of problems that can be solved only (or in a majority) by brains gets higher and higher every day. So seeing media that explores that side of things is refreshing and feels more plausible, even if taken to an absurd extreme of the entire world only consisting of intellectual puzzles it becomes rather silly.
