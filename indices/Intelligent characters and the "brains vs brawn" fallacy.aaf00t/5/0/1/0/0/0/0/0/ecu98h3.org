Yes, that's true. I guess the key premise has to be the lack of a sense of self-preservation. If the enemy has any kind of centralised base or home country, it can be ravaged in retaliation. It's not much that the Hulk is intrinsically able to solve all situations, but at the very least he always is a deterrent. Unless the enemy really is from another dimension or such and can always protect his territory from any incursion.
