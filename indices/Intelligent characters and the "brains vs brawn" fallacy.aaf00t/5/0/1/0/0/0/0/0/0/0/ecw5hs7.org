"A truck of TNT" severely undersells him and the amount of damage he can do. Try several ICBMs, armed with 50 Megaton fusion warheads, able to guide themselves intelligently, virtually unstoppable, and able to follow you even underground /if/ they know where you are. The Hulk really pissed off and with no moral restraints is an extinction level event.
