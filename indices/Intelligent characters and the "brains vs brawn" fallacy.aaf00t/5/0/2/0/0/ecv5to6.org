All you need to do is make Banner suicidal enough to be willing to take a rocket to solar orbit(by e.g. orchestrating events such that he is shunned by society everywhere - don't even have to do anything special, just let hulk rampage in a city and then release his private info through a proxy), walk out of the airlock with a space suit on, and then turn into Hulk. Extremely easy to deal with, really. Hulk can't fly so he is stuck in orbit, banner is as good as dead because Hulk won't untransform where Banner would suffocate.
