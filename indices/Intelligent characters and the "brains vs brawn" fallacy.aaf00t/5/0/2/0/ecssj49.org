True, but ultimately, the Hulk could at the very least threaten a very believable retaliation in kind. There is no winning with him - at best, a draw. If he finds you, you're dead. If you made him mad enough, your whole family may be dead, or whoever is around you at that moment anyway. Whatever you do, you can't really kill him, only make him angrier, thus stronger. And the /Hulk/ on his own (that is, detached from Banner - they're separate personalities anyway, effectively) has precious little things he cares about in the first place. He's mostly a lone wolf. A threat is only worth something if it's likely to be effective. The Hulk is basically on his own a nuclear deterrent.

That said, obviously, this is because the Hulk is fundamentally broken as a character in the first place. The considerations about IRL brawns vs. brains make sense mostly because both those things have limits. In comics we have both nigh infinite brawns characters (the Hulk) and nigh infinite brains (Tony Stark, building an invincible exoskeleton from scratch IN A CAVE! WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS!). So we find ourselves with absurd situations where simply one of the two qualities can win everything.
