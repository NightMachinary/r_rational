Looking at the description they give, the issue doesn't seem to be that they don't think we're a trope (and depending on how close they still stick to "There's No Such Thing as Notability" that shouldn't even be an issue), but that they think the page isn't written according to their standards. (Not that I fully trust the standards of TV-tropes, but that's something else entirely.)

This is a solvable problem.

One of the issues seems to be that there's not enough crosslinking. One of the first things that come to mind is "Awesome by Analysis", which would probably pop up more than once in rationalist fiction.

I'll look over some other trope pages to see if I can find feasible links.
