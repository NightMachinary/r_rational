I suspect Willow/Secretly Awesome has serious problems with Giles' attitude towards vampires and souls...

The Culture is from a materialistic universe. The strong Church-Turing hypothesis is true, to "laws of physics" levels. There are no "philosophical zombies".

So it doesn't matter if a vampire has a soul or not, by the Culture's standards it's still a person.
