It doesn't matter whether the culture's expectations are /correct/ or not, they are still going to treat a vampire as a person. Because that's what their /very thoroughly tested and culturally critical/ assumptions will make them do.

If something without a "soul" is not a person, then what about culture drones? What about Minds? Even if a soul is real, "not having a soul" doesn't mean you're not a person, it just means you don't have this backup option when your primary substrate is no longer viable.
