A very fun and interesting to read story.

I have been meaning to read the culture novels for a while. Never got around to it. I was never really sure of them. They're absurdly powerful so I doubted there would be much conflict, and I wasn't sure about how much I cared about the character development of alien minds, and even for the books I hear they heavily focused on the fringe's of society.

Shall be interesting to see how this develops.
