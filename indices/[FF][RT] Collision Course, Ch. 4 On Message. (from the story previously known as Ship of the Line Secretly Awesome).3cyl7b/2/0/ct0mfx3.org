That's how Bank's maintained his conflict. Most of the books have secret agents plots around civilians or citizens of the Culture becoming agents of the Culture and interacting with other cultures or agents of the Culture interacting with other cultures.

If you want a good anti-death book though, then I don't think you can do better than *Surface Detail*, aside from one rather spectacularly parallel-killer soldier/warship, that is. If you do read it, the weird ending may force you into reading a few other books or spoilers to understand the big reveal.
