Well there's already the Ascended, the Ancients and the Ori. The Replicators might count as well depending. I'm kinda expecting the Goa'uld to fold fairly simply. Not quickly and easily because of their numbers, but yeah.

It is a little bit of a worry though. Overpowered characters are fun for a while but you can't really do lasting tension with them.
