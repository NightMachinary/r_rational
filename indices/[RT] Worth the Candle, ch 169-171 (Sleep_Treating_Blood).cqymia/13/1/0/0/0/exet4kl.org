So, the setting is a post (or ongoing? I forget) climate apocalypse where food is the major resource everyone is fighting over. Massive agriculture conglomerates control the seed strains that can actually be grown in the current conditions, and are always on the hunt for new varieties. Nations have secret seed banks of native plants and stuff which are guarded like blueprints for WMDs. The story takes place in Thailand, which is one of the few countries not yet utterly enslaved to the conglomerates on threat of starvation.

The first character we meet is a spy from one of these conglomerates in Thailand, walking around a marketplace and exploring some exotic fruits, beautifully crafted worldbuilding and scene dressing. Like I said, the early chapters are actually quite nice.

This all sounds good, right?

The problem is when the titular windup girl is actually introduced. Windups aren't actually machines, they're more like genetically altered humans than robots. This girl is a prostitute, and she and the agri-agent meet and have sex.

Lots of sex. A /lot/ of sex. The windup girl also has sex with other people but whatever. She doesn't really do anything else, but takes up a lot of chapters.

The book isn't even a romance, there's no actual relationship to speak of here, just tons of wheel-spinning until suddenly climatic action occurs and the book ends. There's also some other characters, a revolutionary/gangster dude who gets killed off just when he was getting interesting, not even halfway through the book and another guy who is just some factory dude that allows /even more worldbuilding/ to be presented to the reader.

It's a novel of nice worldbuilding, almost no plot, and no likable characters to be found anywhere. The author blatantly had a I bought it for the title and because it had an airship on the cover (usually a good indicator of something I'll like) but it was a slog from like chapter 3 to the end.
