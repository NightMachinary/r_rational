  Massive agriculture conglomerates control the seed strains that can actually be grown in the current conditions, and are always on the hunt for new varieties. Nations have secret seed banks of native plants and stuff which are guarded like blueprints for WMDs.

And the people with the tanks and attack helicopters and nukes somehow don't expropriate the people with the seed tech licenses even though their might ultimately is the guarantor for enforcing said licenses and the laws being applied are fragile compromises woven of privileges in the first place, because everyone has forgotten about words like "state interest" and "national security exception", and because History of the XIXth and XXth centuries has been wiped from everyone's memory I guess. Such a very credible setting... Also, somehow insider cadres don't sell out their direct rivals to the authorities or the board of shareholders the moment organized crime is being discussed as part of their business plans.

And you say the world-building is the /good part/ of the book ?
