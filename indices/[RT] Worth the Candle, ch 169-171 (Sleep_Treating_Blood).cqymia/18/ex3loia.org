Between the dragons in this and the fledgling Dragon Conclave in [[https://tiraas.net][The Gods Are Bastards]], I'm beginning to really like the idea of Dragons as a group that operates as a small group of individuals but represents itself to the outside world as a single party to a treaty made with governments. Are there examples of other fiction that have loose coalitions of similarly-overpowered beings whose goals are a bit tangential to the rest of the world?
