The narrative and story goes out of its way to make him seem right

Like Valencia the demon eater, she kept SAYING she didn't want to intervene and offer advice for his relationship problems, and he kept pressing it

When she finally did, he blamed her for the consequences and the text hammers that in

And there's absolutely no push back from anyone worth a damn, which is a recurring theme
