Captain Bluebottle is, if I'm remembering correctly, a person who can reanimate corpses into classic zombie types and has total control over them. (In a seemingly unrelated way to the zombies in the Risen Lands) He/She (do we know their gender?) used these zombies to become an economic powerhouse using them in factories and such, until it was discovered by everyone else that the zombies are conscious and experience everything just like when they were alive.

After that I think he/she just chills in his/her exclusion zone (can't remember when the zombie magic got excluded in this chain of events).
