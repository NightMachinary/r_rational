It's slightly complicated. The suggestion of [[/u/Gr_Cheese]] that Juniper breaks the fourth wall in triple parentheses isn't exactly accurate, either.

Juniper narrates with a lot of asides and comments, some of which break the fourth wall. The first example is way back in chapter two, when describing Amaryllis.

  I'm not really sure what protocol is here, in terms of prose. I mean, I don't want to sound like a creep, so maybe I should stay as generic as possible and tell you [...] And if that analogy sounds a little bit frightening to you, then I think it did its job, because [...]

WtC is narrated with knowledge of future events, but not unlimited knowledge. In Amaryllis' first POV chapter, she references the Cannibal implicitly in her thoughts as narrated by Juniper. When Juniper himself learns of the Cannibal, he notes how he didn't understand that reference until that moment. Then, there are a few more examples of Juniper referencing future events, such as Amaryllis planning to alter her soul in the chamber.

  Looking back, that might have been when she'd started making plans.

The DM appears with a time titled "Worth the Candle" by "Juniper Smith" in a recent chapter, causing Juniper to muse -

#+begin_quote
  (It did occur to me to ask about the book, especially given the supposed author. The byline could have just been metaphorical, or it could have been a joke, or it could have been literal in some fashion, written by me after it was all over, or when I was asleep, or simply by yanking me out of time to write a chapter whenever anything important happened then scrubbing my mind afterward. But the number of possibilities, and the untrustworthiness of the Dungeon Master, made it sort of pointless to ask about. Besides, I didn't really care about the poor schlub who was writing that book, even if it was, in some way, me.)

Finally, triple parentheses aren't a general safe space for breaking the fourth wall, they're specifically for interjecting in third-person narration. These comments (of which there have been four, three in Amaryllis first POV chapter, and another in her most recent POV half-chapter) are generally /sort of/ fourth wall breaking (since anything readily apparent could be communicated through third-person narration) but not inherently so.
