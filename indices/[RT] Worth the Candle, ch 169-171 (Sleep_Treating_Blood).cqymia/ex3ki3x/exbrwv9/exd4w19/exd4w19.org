There's even more than a fourth wall when you take into account that the story is a self-insert written for an audience who are told that it's a self-insert. [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7vxian/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_7274/dtxq5ax/][On ch. 73, I noted]] that quote as the first time the nature of the fourth wall changed for me, with the line "I hope you don't mind." The narrator [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-reference][meta-comments on their own narration]] and expresses a desire to tell a good /story/, which raises all kinds of wild theories about the frame and phenomenon of Joon's existence within the game. Since then, my leading theory has become that the game is /not/ a simulation being run post-Singularity but rather a literal fictional story written live in the vein of D&D, as a form of soft therapy. [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7zbyej/wiprt_worth_the_candle_ch_79_rule_zero/duohhko/][I've been a big fan of the therapy theory]] and the author himself (as [[/u/cthuluraejepsen]]) [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7h4qqb/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_63_the_chemical_history/dqoct4t/][lightly implied this in retrospect]], but it never clicked why the DM or creator would bother with such indistinguishably magical technology and resources just to fork a brain simulation of (presumably) his 2017 self for such a relatively mundane purpose. Rather than explaining away the gross jump in tech between 2017 and the current game timeline, it makes more sense if Joon and the game is a "simulation" /within the author's mind/universe/. That's why the book is already written (up to the point we get to see), that's why the DM is a kindred spirit - because the DM is AW at one remove is Joon at two removes, except on actual Earth. Joon is the what-if split: he is literally the *self-insert* into AW's cumulative, conglomerated D&D worlds. Time is a flat circle for poor sim!Joon...
