Awesome stuff, I love how we still get to learn more about junipers life l, friends and family. When the line about the water mage learning going off with a problem, I had the slightest disappointment about not seeing that process, great way to reveal the mom.

Its been some time since the last tabletop game earth chapter, would be interesting to see what arguments there were regarding dragons especially in light of Uther's actions with them. As someone who doesn't play D&D what other aspects of the game have yet to be reconstructed in this story.
