I know it's sort of been hinted at before, but that meeting with "his mom" really drove home for me the fact that June had a /shitty/ childhood. It really shouldn't be a surprise that he turned out like he did. Also, this definitely means he'll be meeting "his dad" too at some point, even if he doesn't interact with the entire cast of doppelgangers.

Also, is it just me, or was that last June/Amaryllis conversation unusually... jovial? Like, there was a lot more joking and smiling going on than there usually is when the two of them talk. I really liked it, especially coming off the Bethel thing. June feels like he's slowly getting himself into a healthier place, in part because he keeps being forced to confront and work through issues from his past (like with his mom, here) and in part because he's got a lot of people who care about him and are looking out for him now.
