i agree that that's probably *part* of it, but I don't think that's the whole story. If the non-juniper characters turn out to be philosophical zombies and this was *just* an extended therapy simulation, then that would invalidate all of these experiences that Juniper is having *because none of it is real*.

My suspicion is that this is an Earth that got a kinda sorta benevolent ASI a bit early, and that ASI decided to create Aerb as a real simulated world in order to help Juniper overcome his past, by providing him with a community of people with cultural and psychological baggage in common with him. As Juniper overcomes his own traumas and steps into the light of a better future, so will the people of Aerb. Also, the Dungeon Master is obviously just future Juniper with some wacky simulated time travel shenanigans, made possible by a *probably* friendly ASI. The Arthur who became Uther probably isn't the original one from Juniper's Earth per se, but a simulated copy that the ASI created by predicting what kind of person Arthur was with a high degree of fidelity, based on how he impacted Juniper while he was alive.

Also, the part where Palida said that too much power corrupts everyone including herself, probably is foreshadowing. The DM at one point promised Juniper that he could become the Dungeon Master, the new god of Aerb, or something along those lines. I'm guessing that if one goes back and looks over the chapter where that was said it's probably worded very carefully. Probably the Dungeon Master just said that Juniper would become Dungeon Master and would become a God, but did not say that he would become the ONLY god of Aerb--because maybe all the mortals of Aerb ascend to godhood rather than just Juniper. I don't remember which chapter I'd have to look back at to verify this though.
