When I heard about water magic right after dragons, fire-breathing dragons, I thought, "Great. Might be useful". But Juniper did not seem to have a single thought about using water magic against dragons. Hmmmm.

I wonder why Juniper did not explore the relationship of the dragons to Hyacinth when he was talking to Perisev. At least he could try to find out how Hyacinth manipulated the dragons. He might even have been able to get Perisev mad at Hyacinth by telling her how Hyacinth had manipulated her as a tool to accomplish her own ends. It might not work, but it seems like it could have been worth a try.
