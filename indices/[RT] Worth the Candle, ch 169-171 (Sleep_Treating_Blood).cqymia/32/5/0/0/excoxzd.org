... yeah, but a lot of Joon's most destructive behavior is in his past on Earth, where he hurt everybody who cared about him for petty reasons.

The current Joon seems like a really nice person overall, who makes a lot of effort to listen to his friends, be there for them and address their concerns.

You can point at all the people he killed murderhoboing, or at a few social faux-pas he's made, but calling him toxic seems really excessive.
