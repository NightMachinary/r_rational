There's already kind of a lot of litrpg content where the protagonist is some sort of perfect Mary Sue / Marty Stu, who is perfectly and uncomplicatedly The Righteous Hero Of The Story who's role in the story is to Save The Day, who never has to compromise and who never has any foibles or failings. Part of the reason I value and enjoy WtC precisely /because/ it's so much... not that sort of story.
