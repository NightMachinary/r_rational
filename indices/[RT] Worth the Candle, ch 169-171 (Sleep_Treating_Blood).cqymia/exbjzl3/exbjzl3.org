Sounds like someone has personal experience trying to cope with a parent having bipolar disorder, because that did an entirely too accurate job at pulling from my childhood memories of my mother. And chillingly close to home most of all, due to my own even-less-fun-version-than-june's-mom's bipolar disorder. Honestly even though it was only a page or so, that has been one of the most accurate descriptions of the more common variety of BP1, that I have encountered in fiction writing.

You even spelled Lamictal right. I've been taking it for about 3 years and I still have trouble spelling the generic name.

I emphasize with both June and his mom for so many reasons. Her psychiatrist failed her so hard for not doing a better job with medication management. And her husband absolutely failed her regarding her mental health ( even offering basic empathy and trying to understand at all!) and all the impact it had on everything that her life touched.

What sucks even more regarding the frequent and hellishly under-treated full blown episodes , is that they literally cause brain damage and memory loss in a couple different ways. The higher the severity of symptoms, the more cognitive functionality declines, with executive functioning being hit the worst. Which just makes it all worse.

On a non-related note: Something I just realized while typing; it took me 14 years to understand the fruit flies like a banana pun. It was on my biology teacher's wall. I have always just had the wrong internal cadence and tones when saying in my mind. Along with some mental imagery of a banana moving through the air like a missile, or with a super hero cape on it.
