Punishing people for their mental illness won't help in any respect, so I don't really have much sympathy for that, beyond the sympathy I feel cause he just had no idea what to do, which is there but not... really something I think should be happening in the first place.

The situation as a whole got me mad, one of those "how do we get people properly educated on how to deal with this" situations rather than a "what an asshole" situation, although there is some element of that.
