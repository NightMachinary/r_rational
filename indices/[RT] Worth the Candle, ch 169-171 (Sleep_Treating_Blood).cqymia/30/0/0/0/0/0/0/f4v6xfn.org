I think he can, at least that's what's implied in Chapter 81:

  With seemingly nothing left to do -- a full 90% of Essentialism seemed locked behind various exclusions -- I tried transferring some of my points from Essentialism back into my other skills, only to find that the game still seemed to count them as points transferred for the purposes of the Skilled Trade malus. This was pretty basic anti-cheese; otherwise I could have had over 100 in any skill for a handful of minutes and only have to pay a single point as the price.

And Still Magic 100 stops this anti-cheese measure^^ Although from a game-mechanical point or for the story to not devolve into an outright power-fantasy, maybe it would be sensible to not be able to transfer sacrificed points at all.
