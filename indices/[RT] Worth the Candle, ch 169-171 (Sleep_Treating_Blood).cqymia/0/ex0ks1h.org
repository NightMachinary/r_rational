Sorry for the long wait, I've been trying to get the worldbuilding doc into a more complete state and at the same time trying to stave off and/or manage some burnout. I'm /hopeful/ that the worldbuilding doc will be "done" within the month, after which it will probably thrown to some [[https://patreon.com/alexanderwales][patrons]]/fans for proofreading/editing/continuity/feedback, which I'm going to have a hard time doing myself given that it's already over 25K words and is going to climb even higher.
