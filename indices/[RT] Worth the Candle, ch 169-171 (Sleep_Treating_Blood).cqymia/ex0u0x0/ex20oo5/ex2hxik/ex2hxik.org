I think the mention of water magic being bloodline was a bit of a clue, it's literally closely tied to a genetic predisposition to depression. While a lot of the other magics are actual disciplines that can be learned, I imagine many of the bloodline magics are tied to genetic conditions/tendencies from Earth.
