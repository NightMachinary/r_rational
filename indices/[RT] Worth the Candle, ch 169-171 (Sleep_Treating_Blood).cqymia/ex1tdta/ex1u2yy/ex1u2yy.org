You were not. I'm curious about how it interacts with people. Can you sense people by the water in their bodies? Can you move them via that water?

Then there's the question of force. How big an area of water can you affect? How small? How much force can you generate? Can you generate the same amount of force for any amount of water (meaning smaller amounts move faster) or is it the same velocity produced for any size blob of water?

Basically, I really want to know more about this magic. :>
