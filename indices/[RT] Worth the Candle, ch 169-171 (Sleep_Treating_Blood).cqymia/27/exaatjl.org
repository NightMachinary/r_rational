I've been reading until chapter 116

I get that Joon is supposed to be an asshole but like

He's really problematic in so many different ways. Is this supposed to be intentional or a part of the authors writing style?

Like the Superman story, Kent being jealous over Lois getting a one night stand makes sorta sense

But I feel like there's an undercurrent of trying to justify his shittiness in story by posting how he feels about the becndal test, and other feminist stuff via the ex girlfriend in an attempt to show “well he's actually a decent person” vs “I'm showing you how he thinks about this in an attempt to distract the reader from his problematic behavior”

Like meta wise, is the story showing how the world now conforms to him, regardless of their status? Which means that all of his problematic behavior is excused as “the DM wanted that”?
