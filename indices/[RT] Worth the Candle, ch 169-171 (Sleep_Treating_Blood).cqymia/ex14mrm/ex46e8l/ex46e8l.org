  deeply misplaced hope that for some reason the Draconic Confederacy would decide to be merciful
#+end_quote

The Draconic Confederacy is so depressingly irrational for a bunch of uber-immortals. Reading about their strained relations with the rest of the mortal species just makes me wonder if they're fundamentally incapable of fighting their genetic predispositions or if their alliance at large is ruled by the bell curve and the tragedy of the commons. Their desire to control airspace is probably an innate territoriality or tied to their pride, but it still feels like such a horrible waste of political capital given this fresh example of overwhelming strongarm negotiation. For all their longevity, it seems like the majority of dragons are blind to their self-destructive trend. So now they're endangered. Screw Violations Officers, they're desperately in need of a public relations officer. And maybe the narratively-savvy Perisev should ring up the DM for some quick therapy / gene-editing.

In other news, why does the Confederacy want Cpt. Blue Bottle dead? (There's a smallish chance Perisev is pushing her own agenda as the Confederacy's will and never intended to honor their agreement but seems unlikely) Besides the obvious follow-up of why the hundreds of dragons can't do it themselves, what did the Captain do to offend them? Or possibly related: like Joon asked, what's Perisev's game (not sorry) revealing the dracicide? Her implication was that it was a move to array the D.C. against any possible return of Uther / new Uther-like figure. But then some way through the negotiations, she just happens to give Joon a 'quest'? Full well knowing how the quest features in Uther's oeuvre. Joon gave away a lot of confirmations during their chat but maybe this is just bait to /prove/ Joon is the new Uther. Casually agreeing to end exclusions /cue eyeroll/

Plus, why is her title 'the Wretched'?
