Dragons are (indefinitely) long lived, not immortal, and that's my point. They're slowly dying off and they live long enough to see long term patterns: they're sapient, so they can put 2 and 2 together. And if dragons like Perisev have intelligence networks, some surely know the public perception of them, but they aren't putting the pieces together here.

Why even bother with a Confederacy if they're going to half-ass it and ignore major existential crises. They definitely don't discount their ability to force polities to play ball (they don't seem to want to change the world, just be on top of it).
