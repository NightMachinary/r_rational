I didn't particularly like the Blood chapter.

Not because it wasn't good, it was fantastic. But it came out of fucking nowhere. All we knew was that Joon's parents' marriage was perpetually on the verge of collapse, but there was no hint /why/. At least I think there was no hint when Joon mentioned his family. This makes me feel that Joon kinda lied by omission to the readers. Maybe not really lied, but...

That said, I'm noting that grandmother foreshadowing.
