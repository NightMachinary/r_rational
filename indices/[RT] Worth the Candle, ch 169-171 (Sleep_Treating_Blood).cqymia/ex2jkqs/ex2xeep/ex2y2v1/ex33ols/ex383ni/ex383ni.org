Yup, ch 120:

  “Bouts of mania,” said Grak. He turned to look at me. “Juniper was helpful.”

  I shrugged. “My mom had a few episodes,” I said.

  “I didn't know that,” said Amaryllis, frowning slightly. “You managed?”

  “With her, or with Grak?” I asked. “I guess the answer to both is the same.”

  Grak had all sorts of ideas while he was in his manic episodes, mostly related to warding. I'd recognized the signs when he started talking quickly in Groglir, and tried my best to direct his efforts towards things that didn't have too much of a cost. When the mania passed, he'd realize all his ideas and plans had been half-baked, the warding diagrams he'd drawn up nonsensical. I had talked with him some about what mania was like, which seemed to help. His affliction was passing too, though still not completely gone.
