Great analogy, feels like an inspiration for Aerb's dragons. Though the sad part is dragons don't /have to/ have low time preferences and seek only to maximize wealth in a fleeting decades-long lifetime. They're not just going to die of natural causes and leave a shitty situation for future generations: if they have to live through the long-term consequences, single-minded greed and antagonistic elitism aren't too wise for self-proclaimed "Wise" creatures.
