Not for fun, for profit, or as a hand out to the arms industry. Look at the trillions in profits generated by the invasion of Iraq, or the ongoing genocide in Yemen , or look at the fortunes made when the US dropped more bombs on Cambodia than they did on Japan in all of world war 2. They literally bombed every city flat, wrecked every bit of infrastructure, killed nearly a million people in a population of 8 million, and finally caused civilization to collapse, and allowed a full blown death cult to rise from the ruins.
