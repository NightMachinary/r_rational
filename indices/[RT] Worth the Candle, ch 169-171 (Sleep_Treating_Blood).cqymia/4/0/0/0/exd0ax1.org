Organizing a proxy genocide of her own race would put herself in even more danger, without the power bloc offered by their numbers. She doesn't seem shy about bringing Tommul along for extra insurance in numbers, so I don't think that's her plan, unless she has some trump card to ensure her perpetual safety. She's not strong enough as a single actor on the world stage. It'd only take one murder-happy DND poaching party to end the line.
