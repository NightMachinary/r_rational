You don't have a better argument. Getting rid of the house is a purely pragmatic decision.

Bethel is at best a sadistic serial killer who likes to watch people as they sleep and remind the that there is nothing stopping her any moment she decides to stop holding back and whose inclusion into the group was predicated entirely on the belief that Junipers reality warping powers would be able to handle that somehow.

At worst Bethel has avoided being catalogued in the same list of existential threats as Fel Seed mostly by luck and DM fiat. She is objectively a bigger threat to the party and the fate of the universe than the dragons are and the long term psychological damage she inflicted with her presence is every bit as real as the worst they've had to deal with coming from their enemies. If Juniper winds up altering his values and basically reprogrammed into a robot by the time he gets to level 100 then that outweighs any short term benefit of Bethel's presence.

You're counter argument from what I'm seeing is that it isn't fair to Bethel who isn't human and therefore not culpable (who cares?) but still humanizing it by saying it's pushing people away (surely you meant to say that the UI is busted if you want to keep the former argument going?) how it's selfish and irrational not to live within a dangerously malfunctioning magical artefact (???) and how you understand the logic and sympathize but both feelings and logic are wrong because reasons this margin is too narrow to contain.
