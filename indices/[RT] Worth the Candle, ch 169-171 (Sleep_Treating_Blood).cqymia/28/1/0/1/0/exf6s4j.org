And all you had to add was an appeal to emotions, while I've explained why the decision was ultimately selfish and short sighted. I can understand the thought process, I just think while it follows a certain logic, it places his best friend in a relly bad situation. It places his companions in danger. I opens Bethel and Val to danger as well. It places his island and goals in jeopardy. It places all the millions of soula being tortured constantly in risk of losing the best weapon they had in ages. All because Juniper refuses to insta-therapy. Nevermind Bethel arguably not knowing what she did wrong, because she is barely a person.
