I find myself increasingly disliking Juniper as a person. On one hand it's a fantastic presentation of someone in a less than ideal headspace - which I can relate. On the other hand he needs a slap in the face and a talk about how the world owes you nothing but harsh lessons.

I believe the team did a disservice to themselves by sending Bethel away solely for Juniper's mental wellbeing ( which while I sympathize, it's small potatoes considering the sheer number of threats they opened themselves sans the house.) But then again, this world is about Juniper and his feelings, after all.

I also feel we're being robbed of tension a little bit - if this world is built for him (as the encounters with the Dungeon Master have led us to believe, as well as the insertion of the facsimile of the family and friends in his path) then he won't fail.

Still, the human moments were touching. I liked the interaction with Raven and Juniper. The remark about power over Maddie is... eyeroll-worthy, but I'll chalk it up to cultural differences.
