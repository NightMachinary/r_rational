Proponents of isolationist policies usually see the failure of interacting with the wider world as being due to abandoning of the isolationism, rather than a failure in the interaction. If long lived dragons start banding together to talk to people, after centuries of not banding together, and then they start dying, they will draw back, not rush forward.

The trope can be seen all over the place in fantasy, dragons, elves, even dwarves in the worlds they are long lived. Long lived beings are notoriously slow to adapt to a quickly changing world. Tommul is listed as 2000 years old, Uther's time and all the changes it brought were recent for him.

The confederacy was likely a massive, centuries long effort for them. That it doesn't do more is expected.
