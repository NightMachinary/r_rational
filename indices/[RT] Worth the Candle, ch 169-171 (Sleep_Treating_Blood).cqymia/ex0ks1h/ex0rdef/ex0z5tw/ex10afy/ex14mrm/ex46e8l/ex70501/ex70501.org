  what's Perisev's game
#+end_quote

Well, what did she accomplish? She's arranged for Juniper to reveal himself to the world at large, and she's arranged for the dragons to oppose him. She also believes that opposing him is suicidal.

It was stated that dragons don't really care about each other. Perisev seems to care even less than is usual for them --- if Tommul had some respect for "the dragonkind" as a concept and was offended on its behalf by Uther's slaughter, Perisev seemed entirely unperturbed.

I'm guessing she wants to kill off the majority of the remaining dragons (herself excluded) using Juniper as a tool (possibly because she sees them as a threat to herself). The Wretched indeed.
