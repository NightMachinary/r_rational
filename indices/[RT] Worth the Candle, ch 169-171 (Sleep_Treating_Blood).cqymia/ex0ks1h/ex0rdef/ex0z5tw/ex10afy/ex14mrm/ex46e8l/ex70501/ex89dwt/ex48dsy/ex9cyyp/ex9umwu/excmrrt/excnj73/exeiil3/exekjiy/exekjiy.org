Starvation in China and the Soviet Union was the result of crash industrialization programs, and the disruption in land use and labor starved about as many people as were killed by the western powers during their own industrialization , and a fraction of the number of people killed during the slave trade, which is what provided the original rush of resources and free labor to kick start capitalism.
