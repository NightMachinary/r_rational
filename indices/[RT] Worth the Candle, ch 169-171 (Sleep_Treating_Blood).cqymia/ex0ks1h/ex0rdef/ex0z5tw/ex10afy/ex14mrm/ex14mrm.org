I have or had this deeply misplaced hope that for some reason the Draconic Confederacy would decide to be merciful. Now that I think of it, I bet the Second Empire also had little success using soul magic on dragons. /That/ would be too easy. On the same note: Would the good relations between the dragons and the hells curtail Valencia's influence?

My understanding of relative power is that Bethel could probably win in combat with one or two dragons, especially because she has a few wishes daily, but the political implications are probably untenable.

This latest chapter explores the original meaning of its title: the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb. First the tabletop party, and now the kharass.

I can't help but think a manic water mage is literally a disaster waiting to happen. Maybe this incarnation of his mother has (occasional?) depression but not mania.

Water as depression checks out, unifying the chapter nicely.
