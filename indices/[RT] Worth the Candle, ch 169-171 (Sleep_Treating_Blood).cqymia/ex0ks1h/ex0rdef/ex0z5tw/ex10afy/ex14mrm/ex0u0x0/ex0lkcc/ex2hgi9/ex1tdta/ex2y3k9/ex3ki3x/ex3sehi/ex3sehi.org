Chapter 73, Mary's story during the Fallatehr conflict:

#+begin_quote
  (((This is probably the part where you're wondering to yourself, ‘but I thought Juniper was our narrator, how does he know, and why is he talking in the third person?', and here, safely hidden within triple parentheticals, I can tell you: some of this might not actually have happened in precisely these ways. We're operating under really loose definitions of ‘actually happened' already, but I don't just mean that it ‘might not have happened' in the sense that people might just disappear as soon as I stop looking at them, only to have an interstitial history written for them in accordance with the demands of the narrative as dictated by the Dungeon Master as soon as they become relevant to me again. Here, I mean ‘might not have actually happened' in the sense that this is a recreation of sorts, me working backwards from information that I didn't have at the end of the last chapter, and won't have at the end of this one. The thing is, if you learned it like I learned it, it would be a drawn out, incomprehensible mess, so this is a little bit of poetic license and extrapolation on my part in order to present something coherent. I hope you don't mind.)))

Triple parentheses are Juniper's safe-space. I think we've had a couple of other wall-breaks during the D&D flashbacks but don't recall well enough to quote any.
