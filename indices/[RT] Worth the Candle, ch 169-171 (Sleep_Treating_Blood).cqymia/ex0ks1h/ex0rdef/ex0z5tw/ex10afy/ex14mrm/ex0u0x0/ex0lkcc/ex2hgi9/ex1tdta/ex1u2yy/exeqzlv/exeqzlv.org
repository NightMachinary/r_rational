That Joon mentioned boosting his skill via essentialism made me wonder if that was something that would become useful later. Several magics have really powerful applications at the highest levels, maybe water mages never got that high so people don't realise.

It could either be just large scale movement (moving around a mile long blob of water would take care of plenty of problems, if they didn't teleport), or that you get sufficiently precise movement that you can influence things on an individual person level.
