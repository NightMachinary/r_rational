Every time Juniper sacrifices a skill, it becomes more difficult to re-learn that skill. Old training methods (specific books, tutors, exercises, etc.) don't work at all and even new methods are noticeably slower. So sacrificing skills to increase Water Magic faster would be a pretty bad idea (a lasting loss in order to save time in the short term), and sacrificing Spirit for any reason would be spectacularly bad (he only knows of one way to learn Spirit and he's already used it), sacrificing other things to increase the valuable and hard-to-increase Spirit skill is possibly a good idea.
