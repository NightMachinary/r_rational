Regarding water magic, what's he going to do? Make it rain on top of the Dragons? Maybe they'll get depressed and leave. It's possible that at higher levels he'll be able to summon storms and maybe even a hurricane, but I'm still doubtful they'd be inconvenienced by it. The way dragonfire is stated to just burn cities off the map, I get the impression that large amounts of water would barely even slow it.

On the other matter, Perisev was already aware of Hyacinth's game, the two dragons being there had nothing to do with her. What Hyacinth did was basically tattle to the Draconic Confederacy that they had violated the rules (it seems like she did something more, especially where Dianthus is concerned, but it's not really clear what). Regardless, Perisev makes it clear she's aware of it and doesn't care.
