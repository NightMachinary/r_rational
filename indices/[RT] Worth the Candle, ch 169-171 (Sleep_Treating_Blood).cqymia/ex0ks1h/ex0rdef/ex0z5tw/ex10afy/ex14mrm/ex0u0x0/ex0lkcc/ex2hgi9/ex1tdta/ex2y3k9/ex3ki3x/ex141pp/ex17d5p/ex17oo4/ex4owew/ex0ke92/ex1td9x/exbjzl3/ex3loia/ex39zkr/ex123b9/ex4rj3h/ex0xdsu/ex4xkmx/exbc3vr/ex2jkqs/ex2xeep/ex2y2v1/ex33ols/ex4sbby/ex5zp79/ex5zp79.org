This is not unreliable to me. As long as Joon provides the facts, I am free to pass my own judgement, and Joon his. For example he may have found Arthur's tendency to get argumentative endearing, but that doesn't undermine his narration as long as /we/ know about that tendency.

Subjective != unreliable
