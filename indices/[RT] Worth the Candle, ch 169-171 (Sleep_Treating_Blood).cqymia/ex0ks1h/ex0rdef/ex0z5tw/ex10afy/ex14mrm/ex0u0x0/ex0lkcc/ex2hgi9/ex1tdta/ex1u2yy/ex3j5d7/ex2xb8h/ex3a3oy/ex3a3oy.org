I'm assuming since it's explicitly macro-scale you can't do any of the fun micro-scale stuff. It's probably built so your control gets less 'focused' the less water you're trying to control. Although, that raises my own question. What about crowds? If you go to a major city or a concert, could you use water magic to push the entire crowd of people as if they were one body of water?
