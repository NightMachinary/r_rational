  Getting rid of the house is a purely pragmatic decision.

Except it obviously wasn't. They were fine keeping her around before the incident.

#+begin_quote
  Bethel is at best a sadistic serial killer who likes to watch people as they sleep and remind the that there is nothing stopping her any moment she decides to stop holding back and whose inclusion into the group was predicated entirely on the belief that Junipers reality warping powers would be able to handle that somehow.
#+end_quote

True. But she is very powerful, and arguably the most powerful member of the party.

#+begin_quote
  At worst Bethel has avoided being catalogued in the same list of existential threats as Fel Seed mostly by luck and DM fiat. She is objectively a bigger threat to the party and the fate of the universe than the dragons are and the long term psychological damage she inflicted with her presence is every bit as real as the worst they've had to deal with coming from their enemies. If Juniper winds up altering his values and basically reprogrammed into a robot by the time he gets to level 100 then that outweighs any short term benefit of Bethel's presence.

Seriously? You come with this BS and / I/ don't have a better argument? In no way shape or form she is a bigger threat than Fel Seed. You're also discounting her obvious attachment to the party.

And Amarillis is supressing her love for Juniper, why can't he repress his trauma? Oh right, feels.

#+begin_quote
  You're counter argument from what I'm seeing is that it isn't fair to Bethel who isn't human.
#+end_quote

No it isn't. Sorry, no intention of arguing with this rambling nonsense.
