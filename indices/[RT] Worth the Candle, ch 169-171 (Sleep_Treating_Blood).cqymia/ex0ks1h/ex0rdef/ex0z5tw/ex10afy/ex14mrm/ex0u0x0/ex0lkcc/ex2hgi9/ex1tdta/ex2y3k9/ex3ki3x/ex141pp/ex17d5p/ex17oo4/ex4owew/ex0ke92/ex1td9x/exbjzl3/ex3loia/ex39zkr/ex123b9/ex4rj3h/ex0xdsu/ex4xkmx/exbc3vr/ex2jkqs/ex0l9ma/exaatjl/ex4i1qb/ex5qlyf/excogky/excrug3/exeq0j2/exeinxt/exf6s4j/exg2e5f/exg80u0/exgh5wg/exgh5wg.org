>Except it obviously wasn't. They were fine keeping her around before the incident.

They were under the mistaken assumption that Juniper had it under control.

>In no way shape or form she is a bigger threat than Fel Seed.

As evidenced by what exactly? It isn't human, regards non-entad life as being inconsequential and shifts personalities based on what it's eaten lately. You complain about feels over reels and then mention the "obvious attachment" this thing has as if it were a given.

>And Amarillis is supressing her love for Juniper, why can't he repress his trauma? Oh right, feels.

She commits a half-assed spiritual self-lobotomy mostly for emtional reasons making herself briefly believe that she's Solace's real mother and then fixes it back once it's clear it isn't doing anything useful. I'm not sure what AU you're reading where amateur self-modifcation hasn't been clearly sign posted as a trap for the unwary.

>No it isn't. Sorry, no intention of arguing with this rambling nonsense.

Then I've yet to hear you advance a single argument other than people shouldn't be emotional so that obviously they should be submissive to a hostile alien instead of doing the things that actually benefit them.
