Per /Soft Matter/, all mammals take [[https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/sm/c6sm02795d/unauth#!divAbstract][about 12 Â± 7 seconds]] to poop. 12 seconds * 100 = 1200 seconds = 20 minutes. This doesn't count the amount of time taken to "prepare", though a lot of that in the West is a result of sitting as though on a chair with feet on the floor, rather than in a squat, which misaligns the colon and makes pooping more difficult and less natural (though the research is pretty thin on the subject).
