The phrase is "Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana". It's only technically a pun, in that it takes advantage of the ambiguity of the word "like" in English, which can mean either "in the same way as" or "appreciate".

The first half is meant to be read as "Time flies in the same way as an arrow", while the second half is read as "fruit flies appreciate a banana". But because the first half is there, your brain will tend to parse the second half completely wrong, with fruit being the object noun, flies being the verb, like meaning "in the same way as", which is incorrect. (One of the brilliant parts of the phrase is that "fruit flies" is a noun, while "time flies" is a noun and a verb together, which makes the parsing even more difficult.)

The term for this is usually "garden-path sentence". Others include:

- The old man the boat.
- The complex houses married and single soldiers and their families.
- Fat people eat accumulates.
- The man who whistles tunes pianos.
