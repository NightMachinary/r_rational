It's explicitly mentioned that a really high skill water mage could probably do something that looks like waterbending. Though I have a feeling that the way water magic works is similar to how you construct brillouin zones(visually speaking), you have a plane or area of force, and a high skill water mage can just overlap so many of them that he can create finer structures.
