  June had a shitty childhood
#+end_quote

He taught himself to stop processing language in order to filter out his parents arguing. That was a pretty big holy shit moment.

The terribleness of his home life does shed some light on how attached he was to his small group of friends, and devastated when Arthur died. With his family being so awful Arthur was his main support system, and he didn't have any way to process his death.

Random thought, he used to escape into fantasy to escape his parents in the form of worldbuilding, now he has literally escaped his parents and problems by moving into a fantasy world.
