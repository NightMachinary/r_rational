  (It was always mildly surprising to me when I had read or watched something that Arthur hadn't. He had an annoying way of playing it off sometimes, either putting me down for wasting my time on something that was objectively garbage, or making some excuse for himself, which was never wanted or needed.)

  “What the fuck are you even on about with hair like fingers?” asked Arthur with a laugh. He could be loud.

  yeah, maybe the dismissive way that Arthur had been talking about it had me feeling upset with him, and maybe I just wanted to show that I could do something with the idea.
