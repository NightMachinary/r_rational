As a fellow adhd'er , I concur. If ADHD was a magic, it would be a very chaotic one with bits and pieces of the other ones.

Wait. Tattoo magic! Different skill levels, different specializations, wide variety of tattoos ( types of functionality, uses, use durations etc). Some tattoos will affect your physical functioning and skills, others affect mental and emotional. Sometimes it's obvious person A is a tattoo mage, sometimes it's more under the radar. Being a tattoo mage changes your life path because of what you display, what you can hide or cover up. And how much stimuli you can tolerate.
