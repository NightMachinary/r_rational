OK, if you took really fast 2 minute shits, you'd still end up with a 3 and a half hour shit, so where'd 20 minutes come from.

Man the more I think about it, the dumber the human x100 thing gets. Sneezes that last for an hour, hiccups for months. Not to mention the fact the 100x multiplier would have to be really pick and choose to make sense; some biological processes can be 100x slower and explained away with magic, but not others. She ages, heals, produces blood and digests food slower, but her reaction speed and and thinking can't be that much slower.

And then there's the mood. People get over things relatively quickly, we have the hedonic treadmill, but hers is a hundred times slower. Imagine getting upset and staying that way for decades or having a panic attack that lasts weeks. Ever get randomly horny? Well too bad, your erection is going to last days now. If any of her kind ever got caught in a depressive episode, they'd almost certainly kill themselves cuz no way they last decades like that.

But anyway, cool chapter.
