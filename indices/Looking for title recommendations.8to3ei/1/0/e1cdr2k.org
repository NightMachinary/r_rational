I actually gave The Dresden Files a shot but dropped it after finishing the first book because I thought it was pretty mediocre. Hearing that it doesn't really get good until book 3 or 4 is a bit disappointing, but I'll give it a shot if it means I scratch the itch. I'll also be looking into Alloy of Law as that seems up my alley.
