Just wanted to mention, I started reading this and am quite amused. I've watched the first season anime of "/Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?/" but haven't ever read or watched "/My youth romantic comedy is wrong as I expected/," so I'm missing a bunch of character references to that while still understanding "the world" overall. I've already caught references to One Punch Man and School Days though, which made me laugh. And it does seem fairly rational overall, though considering the protagonist recognizes he's in a light novel reality, it's VERY plot-driven a few chapters in. It does a good job of encapsulating the light novel writing style though, and without a bunch of nonsensical, poorly translated phrases that really mess the flow up.

Anyway, not sure how it'll turn out, but so far it's been amusing to read!
