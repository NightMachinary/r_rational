yeah, totally agree. i recommend watching that second anime tho, IMO its better than the first one which is pretty much just shonen trash. The MC in the romcom is one of the few rational MCs who actually act fairly rational in anime.

As for this, it doesn't drop off at all and goes full steam to the current ending. Enjoy!
