I recommend the Taltos books by Steven Brust. They follow a character known as Vlad Taltos as he works as an assassin in a magical empire dominated by elves. They are best read in publication order (not chronological order). The series has a very noir tone, and a lot of them function as mysteries in their plot, /especially/ the first novel, Jhereg. They're all extremely good and tightly paced, and still being written - he comes out with a new one every couple of years. Supposedly the series will be 19 books total, so at 15 published we're looking at maybe a little less than a decade before it's done.

They're pretty rational books, as such things go - the plots are all driven by various characters' agendas and desires, and people solve problems intelligently. They tend to have great plots and characters. The worldbuilding is also extremely good - there's a lot of cultural stuff there that make Dragaera one of the most well-realized fantasy worlds I've enjoyed.

One of the books was actually somewhat painful to read for me for a few reasons (not the writing quality, which was not particularly worse than normal, but other elements) - Teckla. If you find Teckla gets a little too painful but you enjoyed earlier books in the series, I recommend just pushing through; the unique qualities of Teckla do not persist throughout the rest of his writing. In general his books in the series do a surprising amount of experimenting and trying different things every book, and some of these experiments work better than others. But his books are mostly short enough and quickly paced enough that none are a huge slog to get through.
