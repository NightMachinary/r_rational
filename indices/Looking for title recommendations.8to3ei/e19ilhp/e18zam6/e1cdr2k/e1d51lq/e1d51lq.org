Butcher is well known for starting off his stories mediocre and building upon them with each book. They get better and better until the later ones become magnificent. His other series, furies of Calderon, chronicles the rise and development of a young military leader in a magical society, and starts off pretty mediocre, becomes good in 2 books, excellent after the third, and magnificently awesome with the fourth and onward.
