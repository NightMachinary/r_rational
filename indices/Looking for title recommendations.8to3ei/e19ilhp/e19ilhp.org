I'll second Dresden Files as one of the few urban fantasy stories that is worth reading. Most others that you see recommended tend to be Dresden Files knock-offs. Also agree that the first two books are the weakest, the third book is an improvement but still a little weak, and the series gets going with the fourth. With that said, it's a difficult series to start from the fourth book so you have to slog a little. Dead Beat., Changes, and a few others stand out as superlative.

It's not squarely on your target, but I recommend Best Served Cold. It's a revenge story that takes the form of a heist plot.

Pact to me seemed like a real waste. The world and its rules were so well-cafted and the situation setup had a ton of potential. The plot then just careens from fight scene to fight scene where the MC has no chance of winning and is protected only by thick and enveloping plot armor. There are many decisions, like attacking the warehouse monster, that make zero sense given his power level.
