Are you sure you mean noir, and not grimdark? I don't think noir describes Pact very well.

Have you tried [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40346-the-dresden-files][The Dresden Files]], the urban noir fantasy series? If not, start at book 3, or read the comic book version of the first two books. They're not great. The story and writing gets progressively better. For example, Dead Beat (book 7) is an absolutely enthralling action story. Not particularly rational, though.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13538824-the-alloy-of-law][Alloy of Law]] is another urban fantasy noir kinda deal. I liked it a lot, and I feel like it is a pretty rational story. A lot of genre subversions and intelligent characters using their powers creatively.
