I've heard of massive issues with the translation quality on that site. Personally, I've only read what [[/u/strivon]] has translated [[https://friendshipispower.wordpress.com/forty-millenniums-of-cultivation-chapters/][here]].

If I recall correctly, the fan translation made the story popular in the English speaking community, then the Qidian began bullying its way into being the only source of translations, as with many other fan translations. Alternatively, strivon has been focusing on the other story they are translating.
