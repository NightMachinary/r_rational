They are divided into volumes, so I would suggest starting from the first chapter of the second volume, [[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Forty-Millenniums-of-Cultivation/1068304.html][Chapter 98]].

Just understand that the protagonist has been spending the previous volume improving his strength in high school fighting competitions and completed his college entrance examinations. With some corrupt higher-ups who tried to oppose him now ruined for life.

Around chapter 95, it's where they start behaving more rationally than the norm for the genre.

Villain Boss to Minion about killing the Hero:

  Zhou Yin stared at him and even furiously roared, "Who do you think you are!? Do you think you some ancient cultivator from forty millenniums ago!? Do you think you can kill anyone at the drop of a hat? Don't you know about the federation's laws? Don't you know the punishment for a cultivator is even more serious than a normal criminal? Don't you know how many eyes are watching our Crimson Nimbus Sect? Don't you know the Crimson Nimbus Sect has eight Elders, seven of which are just waiting for me to make a fool of myself? If truly something happens to Li Yao, there will be no need for a police investigation---even an idiot would know that it was us! Do you want to completely destroy me and the Crimson Nimbus Sect, ah!?"

The only important part to know about the chapters before #98 is a certain scene I'm paraphrasing:

#+begin_quote
  Top-Tier University Recruiter: Join us and we'll make you into a top notch refiner! I sincerely apologizing for missing your potential!

  Hero: Thank you so much for helping me train, Trash University Recruiter! I wish to call you my sister from now on!

  Trash University Recruiter: You should follow your dreams! Don't worry about not joining me!

  Hero: I have decided! I will follow my heart! I will join Trash University and make them into the next Top-Tier University!

  Trash University Recruiter => Sister: You are a dumb-ass! But I'm also happy you'll be coming to my university!
