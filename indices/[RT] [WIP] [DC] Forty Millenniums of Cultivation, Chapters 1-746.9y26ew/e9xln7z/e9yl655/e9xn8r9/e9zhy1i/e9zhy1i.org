I think the proper mentality to enter into when reading novels like this and ISSTH is to enjoy the nonsensical elements and let some of the bad writing wash over you. I find these light novels a break from more serious reading and they have their own genre conventions and tropes that you pick up as you read. They also hit tropes and get into situations that you don't see in Western literature, which can be fun. That said, I wouldn't force yourself to read any of it if there's no immediate appeal. This isn't literature, it's stress relief. I will say that this an d ISSTH are a cut above most Eastern translations, so if you know you can read this stuff, you should try them.
