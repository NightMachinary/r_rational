Anyone else really bothered by the writing style of xianxia? I wish I could enjoy these (I did like Cradle / Sufficiently Advanced Magic), but reading paragraphs like these just makes me cringe:

  Sure enough, when Li Yao passed through a faintly bulging mound of dirt, the mound of dirt burst, shooting out countless rock fragments. In the midst of the rock fragments was a pair of dirt yellow Sand Wolves!

  Li Yao felt only a ferocious and vicious hurricane sweep over from behind his back. A powerful oppressive aura, nearly on the exact same level as Fiend Blade Peng Hai's, appeared behind him!

  The only difference was that... Fiend Blade Peng Hai's aura was earth-shattering in form of ebbing tides and waves. This aura was as if a tyrannosaurus rex had come crashing from afar, fiercely and viciously. A strong air of terrible beasts was mixed in the aura!

  All Li Yao felt was the tip of a spear pressing against his back. He could no longer bear the barbell, so he directly rolled forward, utterly miserably, to avoid the “terrible beast” assaulting from behind. He spun around like lightning with a strength that nearly broke his waist, automatically adopting the tightest defensive guard!

  Cold sweat rained from his forehead. His wild beating heart nearly ripped open his chest!

  “Who's aura could be so overbearing!? It's simply a tyrannosaurus rex in the form of a human!” Li Yao gasped for breath with a gaping mouth. He was trembling with fear as he sized up this “Human-shaped T-rex.”

It's like everything in these is presented in superlative, leaving no word space to distinguish things that actually matter. And the superlative is always told, not shown - extreme adjectives by the narrator, but you get maybe one sentence for something that's supposedly important, and then you just move on. You're supposed to care about it because of the adjective, not because you've been shown how it impacts the world or the characters.

​

It's a shame because I do feel like I'm missing out, but just don't know how to get over this :P
