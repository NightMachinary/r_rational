You're kind of mixing categories here. Your issue isn't with the genre of xianxia fiction, it's with poorly translated Chinese literature - though I suppose it's a moot point as those domains overlap fairly heavily...

For what it's worth I don't believe you're missing out, xianxia fiction has many of the same genre trappings as the litrpg genre.
