Just a reminder: Many people in the chinese webnovel community (translators and readers) have boycotted Qidian, the owner of webnovel.com, for scummy and underhanded business practices, including but not limited to lying and massively unfair contracts.

Personally, I always read 40 Millenniums of Cultivation on the leecher site [[http://wuxiaworld.co]] (not to be confused with the translation website wuxiaworld.*com*) They usually get the most recent updates shortly after they're posted on webnovel.com
