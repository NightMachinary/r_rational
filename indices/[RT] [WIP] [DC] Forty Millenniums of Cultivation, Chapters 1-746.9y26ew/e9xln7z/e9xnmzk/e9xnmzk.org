People have also boycotted them for stealing translations from others and posting them up on there site. If you want to read Forty Millenniums is Cultivation, I'd suggest a different site so as not to give Them any traffic or revenue.

As for the story itself, it is a pretty good story, (I have only read up to end of book 1) but from what I have read, it is definitely a top tier novel amongst the other translated Chinese Webnovels.
