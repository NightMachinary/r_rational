I think it's a bit more than just 'being poorly translated'. I've noticed similar things with official translations of japaneese LNs, and western fiction that emulates these styles. There seems to be a consistent difference in writing - short paragraphs, a lot of exclamations, etc. But well, that's just guess work since I can't read the source :P
