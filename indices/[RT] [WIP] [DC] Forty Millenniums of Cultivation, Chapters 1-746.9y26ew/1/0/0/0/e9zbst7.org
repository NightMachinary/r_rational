True, it's not quality writing. That said, for Light Novels at least, that's the point of them - being 'light' in terms of ease of reading, at the expense of detailed description, showing instead of telling, etc. They're intended to be written quickly and read quickly, and they are usually targeted toward a young adult demographic. It's the literary equivalent of junk food. Then on top of that they often go through a shoddy translation process. I tend to prefer watching the anime versions of popular light novels since then the lack of description doesn't matter since it's a visual format.
