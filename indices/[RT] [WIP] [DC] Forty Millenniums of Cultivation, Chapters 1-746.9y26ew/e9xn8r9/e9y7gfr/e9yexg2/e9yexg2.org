It's the method of meditating to gain strength in this genre. They meditate and drink some potions or pills or bathe in some fancy liquid to boost their cultivation rate. Of course the main hero always cultivates waaaaay faster than anyone else ever.

It's not quite that different from gamerfics. Except that literally anyone can cultivate and be awesome martial artists instead of just one guy being the gamer and having those fancy powers. And the powerlevel of a guy is measured by just a single number instead of having all those skills and spells and stuff. Though they do gain fancy moves with a certain powerlevel by reading scrolls. They feel a bit like proto-gamerfics, but the genre seems to be so tight that when you've read one, you've read them all.
