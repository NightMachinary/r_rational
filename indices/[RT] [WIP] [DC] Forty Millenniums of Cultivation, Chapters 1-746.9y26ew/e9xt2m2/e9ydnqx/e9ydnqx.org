Agreed. I pushed through to chapter 12ish but don't see myself continuing.

The protag just received his second completely unearned power up via him randomly stumbling across some powerful old cultivator guy. Kind of a red flag for me personally.

I thought it'd be the MC overcoming his lack of initial magical power via the use of tech and planning/preparation, like in Mother of Learning, but it doesn't seem to be going that way.
