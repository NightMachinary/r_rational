Yeah, I figured that would be the case.\\
But Blue really shouldn't just assume that tactic, he's never seen.

And I think the scene shows that Red and Leaf didn't coordinate their story at all. Whereas Lizzy and Maria did (possibly with Red telepathically). Because there was no reason to admit of intentionally attacking a renegade here, when you could have sold a plausible story.

I guess, I'm just really pointing out all the (possibly unintended) story inferences one can draw from scenes like that.

Maybe I'm overdoing it, but I'm trying to pay more attention to details when reading, instead of my default of just skimming over numbers, forgettable Japanese names (does Japanese only have like ..... five consonants?!) and Pokemon past generation 3.

It's a lot of fun.
