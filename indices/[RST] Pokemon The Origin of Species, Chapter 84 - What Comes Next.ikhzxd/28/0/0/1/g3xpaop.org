  You wouldn't have to justify an unintentional AOE attack against someone, who you couldn't have possibly known was there.

I'm pretty sure you /would/ have to justify an unintentional AOE attack against someone, if only with just "I did not see a person there and could not reasonably have forseen that a person was there". If the unintentional AOE hypothetically happened, the attacked person could probably accuse the attacker of being a renegade as soon as they recover, so a Ranger inquiry to get the sequence of events straight would probably be made as a matter of course.

I think a fair comparison is if you set some traps in a forest covertly and a person ended up being hospitalized for it. There probably should be a police investigation to make sure it wasn't an actual murder attempt.

That said, this probably isn't the case here. From the quote you initially posted:

  “No exciting story for me, Joy saved us,” Leaf says with a shrug. “Again. If it ain't broke, right? Red could feel his pokemon coming, so I had her sing *just as they opened a hole in the wall to get us out*.”

And also consider Ramin's own pattern of calling out to trapped survivors, talking to them, and getting them out before killing them. So in this case Leaf should have known that there was someone there to ostensibly get them out, the guy probably even talked to them, and still hit them with Sing, putting her trust in Red's side of the story. That absolutely would have to be justified to the Rangers.
