This part is a bit confusing:

  “I'm alright, just... trying to make sense of all this.” He looks between them. “Red says each of you fought a renegade... what happened?”

  “No exciting story for me, Joy saved us,” Leaf says with a shrug. “Again. If it ain't broke, right? Red could feel his pokemon coming, so I had her sing just as they opened a hole in the wall to get us out.”

  Blue blinks, then glances at Red, who's staring at the ground. “How did you know?”

  “I could feel it, killing other people,” Red murmurs without looking up. “It was... pretty bad.”

  Blue winces in sympathy, then turns back to Leaf with a wary respect. She put a lot of trust in Red, using her pokemon on a stranger because he told her it was a Renegade. That's even less clear cut a justification than the last time she did it, but luckily they could check this one's pokemon to verify...

  She was here just yesterday, before she went to visit Blue in the hospital, and even though that was to testify in the justified use of a pokemon to stop a renegade, even though Red's mom wasn't with her, it was still much less nerve-wracking defending herself against a potential Renegade charge than it is being called back in for something else.

The renegade, Leaf captured was dark. Red didn't tell her to use a Pokemon on a stranger, but on a Pokemon which could just have been a rampaging wild for all Red knew.\\
So why would Leaf even have to justify Pokemon use to stop a renegade, when she had no idea, there was a trainer controlling it?\\
But Blue doesn't know that the renegade was dark and just assumes he wasn't. [which is fair, most people aren't dark, therefore Red can sense them]

But then again, Ramin announced himself before "rescuing" people, so it would make sense that Roark used the same tactic.\\
And that's what must have happened, because otherwise Leaf wouldn't have to justify Pokemon-use against a renegade at all, since it would have been unintentional.

But then Blue couldn't know about that tactic either nor could he have known that it was possible to shout through the wall, since he was unconscious for the whole adventure.

So Blue was right, but only by complete accident.
