So I guess the Silph Scope is just.... basically a VR headset without any VR. Red saw ghost pokemon on TV before, so the Silph Scope would just have to be something like an Occulus Quest. A helmet, with built-in displays, a camera outside.

A bit difficult to think of this as cutting-edge tech, but I guess our world is more advanced at least when it comes to Virtual Reality.\\
Kinda makes a lot of sense, that the first HMD wouldn't be for Virtual Reality, but for seeing Ghost pokemon, come to think of it.
