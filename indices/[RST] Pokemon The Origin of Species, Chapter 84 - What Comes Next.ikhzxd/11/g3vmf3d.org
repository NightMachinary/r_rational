Thoughts:

- Ugh, I totally missed that MG was actually lying about the magmar to cover for her vulpix (as opposed to the magmar actually being found to have done the deed on investigation) until I read the comments here. Learning that Red did cause the sandslash after Lizzy to turn on its trainer made MG's scenario more plausible in my mind...which was the whole point, wasn't it.
- On another note, Red's properly turning into a character with good battlefield presence like Taylor and Zorian. But I wonder how many other psychics in-story have done similar... It doesn't seem like it should be hard in terms of skill needed, but I haven't seen any hint of a similar strategy being implemented as a matter of course (e.g. one of Surge's gym's lectures mentioning it as a possible formation if a psychic is present). Then again, even Red isn't advertising that loudly what he could do - or what he actually did. Seizing control of pokemon to attack trainers /is/ kind of iffy.
- I definitely get the sense Blue is trying to over-compensate for being bedridden by jumping onto Giovanni's bandwagon. Before, he usually tended to be the kind of character to lead the pack. I hope this change in character isn't a sign of anything too bad.
- Kind of unrelated, but I wonder how Bill's doing. His house and lab is near enough to the ocean to have been affected, I think, nevermind the earthquakes and deluge of rain. I'm not sure if any of the tech he put into them had anything to do with defending his house against natural disasters. Man, just imagine if on top of all the bad news in this chapter Bill lost significant research progress on stuff like the tangela regeneration capabilities he wanted to give to humans.
