Yeah, I think Lizzy also lied about the Sandslash killing Maddie.\\
If Red could have done that, why wouldn't he have killed Roark with his Golem as well?

He probably used Lizzy's Mareep, as that would have been the last thing she'd use against the Sandslash and she probably really did run thru her whole belt slowing it down.\\
Though.... maybe that was the first pokemon, as she used Flash to blind it at first.\\
Come to think of it, I don't see how you could unleash the killing instinct of a.... sheep.

And then Red coordinated psychically with them after the fact, without involving Leaf, whilst the three of them made their way out.\\
Lucky that MG and Lizzy are sensitive, though it hasn't been explicitly stated that Lizzy is.
