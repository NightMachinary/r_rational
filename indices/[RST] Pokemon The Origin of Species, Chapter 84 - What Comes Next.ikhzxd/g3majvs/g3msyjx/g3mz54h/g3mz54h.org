Isn't the conditioning specifically about not attacking humans and additionally following their trainers orders?

In a wild pokemon the power just adds rage towards an allowed target.

In a renegade pokemon you need to overcome the difference between the trainer and other humans.

And in a regularly captured pokemon you need to overcome the resistance against killing any human.

I think that would be more difficult.
