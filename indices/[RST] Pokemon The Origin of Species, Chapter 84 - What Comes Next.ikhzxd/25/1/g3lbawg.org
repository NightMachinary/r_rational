Blue spent the time the time around the doctor's visit reassuring {"the time" is the trouble, you made it double}

A story of humanity rising from frightened mammals cowering in hovels to being who can harness the powers around us for our own needs. {being/s/?}

One of the major debates is whether it should be classified as a "Tier 6" event, a hypothetical world-affecting incident, or if it merely had the potential to be, but in either case many are reacting to a near-miss cataclysm as if one is still coming by stocking up on survival supplies and fleeing the islands, though some of that might just be foreigners who don't want to stick around as the local regions recover. {This isn't really a typo but it is all a single sentence and I wound up having trouble parsing it by "coming by"}.

Thanks for the continued reason to look forward to the first day of the month!
