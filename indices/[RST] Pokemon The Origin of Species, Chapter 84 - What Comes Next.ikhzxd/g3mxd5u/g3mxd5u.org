We finally get a chapter with the trio back together after, what, a year at least! I liked that Red and Blue seem to have ironed out their fight and are on the way to becoming friends like they used to.

Interesting that no one (except MG probably) have realized Red's involvement in killing the Renegades. 2 Pokemon suddenly turning on their trainers while you're being guided by a psychic who's known for /sakki/ should raise some alarm bells.

Excellent introduction to the Silph Scope. With it now in play the story can move on according to the games just fine. Blue's injuries seem to have put him off anything for a long time. Maybe a visit to Lavender Town for a bit of down time to recover?

Blue's monologue about how these major, earthshaking events can just happen and the whole world can be put in turmoil is an accurate representation of the corona crisis too. Completely blindsiding the world and all its leaders, leaving behind a lasting impact, fear and panic being spread. Whether it's a virus or weather gods, you can never plan for everything so it's hard to know exactly what to do.

Which makes Giovanni's speech much more interesting. Claiming that we have grown complacent might be a fair charge to a certain degree, but where's a successful alternative? His attempt to prevent the awakening by dealing separately with Teams Aqua and Magma failed, since we can't always trust human nature to do the right thing (Archie going off on his own). Even his psychic legendary-killer has now escaped, meaning that another option for humanity's protection has vanished into thin air. He says that he "will do better", but what /can/ he do?

A last point about Blue's "I'm not the main character" line. It's nicely meta, but also shows just how big the world is in the face of your ambitions. There'll always be a Brendan and May, people out there who started before you and are far ahead. There'll always be Ethans and Lyras who come after you with even greater potential. It's important to note how to deal with this, and it'll be interesting to see how Blue gets over his new "inferiority complex".
