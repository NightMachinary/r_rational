There's so much to unpack in this chapter! I think people have covered most of the big story bits so how about some appreciation of the writing?

I really love how the first scene break has an implicit “Red gets shooed out from the room because he 100% didn't consider following the nurse's instruction.” It's like a Noodle Incident except without voicing over-the-top silliness that would disrupt the tone; we're free to imagine as much silliness as we want, and what would otherwise be a pretty minor detail becomes a fun little pause for imagination :D

I don't know if it's intentional but the way Laura interrupts Leaf's thoughts was perfectly jarring. I think by having my own train of thought (reading) suddenly interrupted in the same way by the grammatical weirdness was a great meta way to help me identify my experience with Leaf's, counterintuitively improving my immersion.

The way that we've been lacking Red's narrative perspective is great; I enjoy reading his perspective a lot but it's associated with anguish that can get a bit too heavy. Plus, in this case we can already imagine some of the thoughts he must have had so, again, instead we get to see even more from what other people are experiencing relative to him (especially from MG's and Lizzy's perspectives in the preceding chapters).
