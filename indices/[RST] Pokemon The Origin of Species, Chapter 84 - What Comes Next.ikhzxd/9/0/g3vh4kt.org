  He [Giovanni] says that he "will do better", but what can he do?

Thinking about it...he did order Petrel to steal Team Aqua's research (his moles in team Magma may also have gotten a similar order) and he knew the orbs were special enough to want them even before Steven used the Red Orb's leftover energy to Mega Evolve his pokemon.

So his most obvious next goal is probably to research Mega Evolution.
