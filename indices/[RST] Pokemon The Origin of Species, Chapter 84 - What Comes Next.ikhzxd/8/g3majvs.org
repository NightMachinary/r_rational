I hope that psychic trick of turning a pokemon against their trainer only works on pokemon that lost their conditioning (or never had it). Fighting against mewtwo is going to be difficult otherwise. Although fighting against any legendary tier is going to be difficult directly. Probably not how the story (could) end anyway.

Also with the worlds view on renegades Red probably should keep his ability to himself. Renegades turn their own pokemon against humans and people hate them for it. Turning other trainers pokemon against them? I guess that would be viewed as Super Renegade or something.

Maybe this ability is known in some psychic circles? Some of them might even kill to prevent this ability from being known before it starts a witch hunt against psychics. Makes the apprenticeship with Sabrina potentially dangerous.

/edit: As people have pointed out I forgot that the renegades pokemon turning against them was a lie. Red might be in big trouble.
