That was a nice speech from Giovanni.

You know, it feels weird to be reading about this Tier 6 post-mortem when our real world is also dealing with one pandemic. For all the subterfuge Giovanni might be involved in, I surely would prefer a leader with his humility and forethought to our modern world leaders, who all too often succumb to vicious bickering with each other.
