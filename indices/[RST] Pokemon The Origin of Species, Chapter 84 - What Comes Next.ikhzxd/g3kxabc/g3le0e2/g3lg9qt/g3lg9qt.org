True. What I said is more about his speech and less about the genuine merit of his actions. The entire incident with Mewtho is a big screw-up on his part no matter how you look at it, and he's also engaged in a lot of morally shady actions. I guess one thing that makes him fascinating is how, from his speech, we can see that he's a genuine subscriber of his sense of utilitarianism, while we the readers would at the same time be aware of all the wrongs he's committed.
