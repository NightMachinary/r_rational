Giovanni is a giant hypocrite. He may do a lot of good but he's bought into his own hype too much. Instead of setting up criminal organizations and murdering people with pokeballs, he could be using that time to do some unambiguous good. As it is he's a massive failure as a rationalist, justifying his horrible actions with a veneer of utilitarianism while making the world a worse place. If Mewtwo ends up helping it will be in spite of him not because of him. Don't mistake being good at optics for actually being a good leader. That's the same mistake made with modern world leaders all the time.
