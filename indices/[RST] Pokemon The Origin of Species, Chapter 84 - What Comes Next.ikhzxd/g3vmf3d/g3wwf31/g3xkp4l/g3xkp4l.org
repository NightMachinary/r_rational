+I recognize those names as Ramin's co-workers that he tried to contact, but I'm not sure it's been confirmed which is which...?+ EDIT: Huh, nevermind that, I missed that the two renegades after Leaf and Lizzy were of different genders the first time around.

Anyway, if one of Lizzy's pokemon did kill the renegade hunting her, it would've had to have something similar to a sandslash's attacks, or else the Rangers would see through the lie right away.

Definitely looking forward to a perspective from Red going over this event in his head.
