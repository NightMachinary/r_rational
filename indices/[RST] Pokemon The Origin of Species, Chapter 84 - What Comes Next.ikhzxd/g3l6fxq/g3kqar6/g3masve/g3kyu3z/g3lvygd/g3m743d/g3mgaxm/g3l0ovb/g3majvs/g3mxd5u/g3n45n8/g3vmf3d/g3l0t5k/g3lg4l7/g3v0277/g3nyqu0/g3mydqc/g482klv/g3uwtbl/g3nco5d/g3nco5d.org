This line just irks me:

#+begin_quote
  Blue winces in sympathy, then turns back to Leaf with a wary respect. She put a lot of trust in Red, using her pokemon on a stranger because he told her it was a Renegade. That's even less clear cut a justification than the last time she did it, but luckily they could check this one's pokemon to verify...

I don't remember if it's been on-screen. Maria was shown, though.

It feels like:

- Blue remembers something
- Blue wasn't always unconscious
- They did directly attack a renegade nearby

Argument pro is this line in the previous chapter.

#+begin_quote
  There's a sudden surge of /horror-fear-despair/ and then the presence retreats for a moment. Maria stops running, trying to sort through what she felt, assuring herself that Lizzy can't be dead, that she's not too late.

But it can be that Nidoqueen. Or Blue losing consciousness.

And things just continue to adds up.

- Maria never mentioned someone guides her and reassures her it's not her fault that the renegade was killed
- Lizzy never mentioned this guiding thing either

It looks like Red just make them all forget this. All except for Blue. Notice how Red asked if he remembers anything.

So, my thoughts on what happened: Red killed that renegade. They all meet at some point. At that point there is no multiple reds, as seen in this chapter, where he's always gaunt. He just killed a man using a pokemon as a weapon.

Yet even unpartitioned Red don't want to die. But he's Red, and I'm not sure he will just make them forgot at one point unwillingly. And I'm even less sure everyone else want him to be branded.

So they allowed to temporary/permanently block their memory. Mostly because police psychics.

But! All of these from a single line based on an event I don't remember happened, and confirmation bias. Did I forgot something?

EDIT:

I also like how it's obvious for Laura that Leaf actually could've done something fishy.

  "No, Leaf," Laura says, voice firm. "You can hand him the containers to look through and all that would lead to is him asking about other containers you own, then checking your PCs to see what you might have transferred recently. You have rights for situations exactly like this." She stands as she turns back to the detective. "Get a warrant if you can, or take her word for it. Either way, we're expected at the hospital to relieve my son from a bedside vigil."
#+end_quote

More than sure it comes with experience, recent and in general.
