This is just quibbling and wondering about the legal situation and how Leaf and Red would have described the situation after the fact, for which we also don't fully know, which of our merry group of friends coordinated to get their stories straight (it that happned at all) to protect Red's ability to turn Pokemon into deadly weapons. I also don't think that Maddie's sandslash turned on her, since it probably likes its trainer just fine even without conditioning [unless Maddie never fed it Pokepuffs or whatever].\\
I think it's more likely that one of Lizzies Pokemon was saki'd and Lizzie and MG both collaborated to lie about it. And if they collaborated to minimize legal hassle and suspicion, why not do the same with Leaf.

So..... it's not clear that she'd have to defend herself for "justified use of a pokemon to stop a renegade", since she was using Joy against a dangerous, seemingly rampaging Pok√©mon, not against a renegade.\\
There just happened to be a surprise renegade behind it falling asleep, which wasn't apparent before she used her pokemon. [unless Roark loudly announced a fake rescue like Ramin and announced himself]

You wouldn't have to justify an unintentional AOE attack against someone, who you couldn't have possibly known was there.

And then seeing that the person was obviously the trainer behind the rampaging pokemon (what pokemon, by the way?) hence a renegade, you'd tie him up without any help from a pokemon, which you'd also not have to justify.
