Glad you've enjoyed it so much :) A lot of this was vaguely planned years in advance, with more shape forming in the months leading in. The appearance of COVID is something of a "fortunate" coincidence in terms of being able to expound on these themes in the story, but I don't think I would be able to write them as well if it hadn't happened.
