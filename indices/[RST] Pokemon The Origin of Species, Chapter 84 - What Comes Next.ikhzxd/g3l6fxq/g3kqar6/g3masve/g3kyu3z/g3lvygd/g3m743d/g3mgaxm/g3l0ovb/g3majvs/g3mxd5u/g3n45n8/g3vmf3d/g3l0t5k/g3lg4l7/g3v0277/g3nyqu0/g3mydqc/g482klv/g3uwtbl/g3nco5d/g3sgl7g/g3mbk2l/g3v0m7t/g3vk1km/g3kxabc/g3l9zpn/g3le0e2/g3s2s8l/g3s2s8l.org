Seems more like false humility to me, considering he's still hiding his ACTUAL faults (that he was involved with aqua/magma and that he just lost control of Mewtwo). That omission makes this feel more like a fascist making the "existential threats require hard decisions, and as the servant of the people I'm the one to make them" speech than a genuine apology.

As for forethought, him forcing a peace between aqua and magma was quite possibly the reason they created a teir 6 disaster instead of just a gang war. He also just created a living superweapon and then lost control of it.
