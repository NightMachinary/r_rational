I'm not sure I follow the confusion, but in case this is it... Blue's guess is based on what he knows would have happened afterward; even if Leaf just had Joy use Sing on a pokemon, a person was affected too. After that the person would have to be tied up and presented as a Renegade, which Leaf would have to explain the justification for. Does that make sense?
