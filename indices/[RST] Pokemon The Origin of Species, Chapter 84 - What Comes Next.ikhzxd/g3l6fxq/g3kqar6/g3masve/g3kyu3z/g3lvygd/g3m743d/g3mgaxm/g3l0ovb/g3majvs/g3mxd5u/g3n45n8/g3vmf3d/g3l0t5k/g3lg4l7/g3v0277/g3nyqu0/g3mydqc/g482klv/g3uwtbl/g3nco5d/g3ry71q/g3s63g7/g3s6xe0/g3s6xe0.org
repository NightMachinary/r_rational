If Maria and Lizzy never tell anyone about voices in their heads, maybe he doesn't. But come on, they've met at some point and I bet they do talk about it. Red should talk with Leaf how he guides them. Even if he omitted he sakkied Magmar, Leaf is not dumb. Lizzy is aware about killer intent, and she's not dumb either.

Yet not one of them mentions this. Leaf never mentions Red guides remote party to safety, Lizzy and MG don't mention about mystery psychic help. Especially MG don't mention about relief that it wasn't her fault.

OK, maybe with all the stress they didn't have time to talk, and Leaf was distracted with her own lesser crime. Maria may not be aware about Red's ultimate move, she wasn't in Blue's group when it was revealed. Red is miserable enough to brings this and just waits while some of them figures it out. Also, it's not like he know how to block someone else's memories, even if he knows well enough how to block his own.

So, stressed everyone, private-y Maria, distracted Leaf and exhausted Red. Still not in character for Lizzy not to share this or not connect the dots. It's plausible she understand it all and hide as well, because, again, it saved MG and Glenn. We didn't see their thoughts anyway. Red might hope they didn't guess they know and definitely won't bring this up first.

So, yes, OK, it's plausible Red didn't wipe their memories. And late arrival thought, mind block may as well be quite visible for are psychics.
