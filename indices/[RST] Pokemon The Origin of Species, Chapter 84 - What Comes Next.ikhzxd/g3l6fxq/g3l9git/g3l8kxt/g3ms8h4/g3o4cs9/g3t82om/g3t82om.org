I actually get the sense he /was/ apologizing for Mewtwo and everything else, considering he specifically addressed the people of a thousand years in the future for a personal apology. As opposed to if he had apologized /on behalf/ of the people of the present who didn't do more, or try to provoke the people of now by what people of the future would think of them, a personal apology reads more like he fully expects to be found out eventually and wants to be seen by history as having been appropriately contrite.

Of course, he deliberately obfuscated the specifics for which he was apologizing to people who don't already know because he doesn't want to face the punishment by law and in public opinion yet.
