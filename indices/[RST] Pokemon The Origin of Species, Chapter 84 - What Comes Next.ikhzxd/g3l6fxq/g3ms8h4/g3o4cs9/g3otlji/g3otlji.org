Mostly because, come on, how absurd is it that he loses to the player there? In a gym match at least there's the excuse of limiting his team to be as strong as the badge number or something, but if he'd used even the same team he uses in his gym battle there he would have wiped the floor with the player.

Not enough games do the "you can't win this fight" thing, imo, or worse they let you win the fight then have you lose in a cutscene. It acts as a very powerful experience when done right through gameplay, like in Megaman X.
