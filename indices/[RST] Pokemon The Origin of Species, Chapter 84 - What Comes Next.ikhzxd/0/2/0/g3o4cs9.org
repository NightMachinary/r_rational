The whole "Giovanni-as-villain-with-good-publicity" thing has been amazingly well executed so far. I wonder how the protagonists will find out? They have to wind up fighting him eventually, after all, although we managed to skip the "fight Giovanni in the underground base beneath the casino" event from the game storyline.
