Holy hell, did Leaf's Mount Moon investigation actually force Giovanni to give out the "watch all Renegade's before excution"-warning?!

You know you're a good investigative journalist, when you don't even need to publish a story to completely cripple the global underworld's recruitment ability. Detective Hirai can now check the timeline and see for himself, whether Leaf forced Giovanni's hand, making him even more of a suspect. It should also be a matter of public record, that he was the one that secured a renegade's right to a private last conversation. [unless Giovanni lied about that to make himself more sympathetic to the Weedle-killer]

If Hirai then asks Leaf again, she's likely to bring up, that he illegally used a psychic on her to protect that secret. [which leads to what psychic you could hire for that job, if not a Renegade]

Oh.... Giovanni is in trouble :)EDIT: Actually, that warning probably didn't impede the process much. Not sure, why I was thinking that.\\
Possibly it contributed to Giovanni's org having trouble hiring new people in chapter 59.
