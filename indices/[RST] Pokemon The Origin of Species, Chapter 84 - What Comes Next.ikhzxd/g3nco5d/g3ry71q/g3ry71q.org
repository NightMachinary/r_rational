Don't think anyone else really needed memory wipe, Red killed a renegade with Maria's Vulpix (Maria thinks the Magmar did it because that makes more sense to her), and Leaf put the other one to sleep (legal). Red leading them around psychically is perfectly okay. Him asking questions because he's concerned that someone might realize he used killing intent seems more likely than him altering their memories.

Kinda disappointing this "aftermath" chapter didn't show the most important thing, which is how Red will handle it.
