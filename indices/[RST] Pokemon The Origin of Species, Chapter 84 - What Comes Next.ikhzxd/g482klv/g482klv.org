a bit late to this chapter, but felt like I wanted to say stuff about it anyway, because I haven't really commented on the Titans arc here before, and despite not being titled as part of that arc it's hard to read this chapter as anything other than the encapsulation of its themes. Some stuff that jumped out:

#+begin_quote
  "I had all these goddamn /plans,/ Red... and now I'm stuck in here while the world spends who knows how long recovering from shit no one saw coming!"
#+end_quote

the climate change allegories in this chapter in particular have already been commented on, but this line in particular snapped the whole thing together for me in light of current events. Makes me wonder how much of this stuff was planned in advance, and how much has been swayed by things that've happened in real life

#+begin_quote
  "It's like finding out... I feel like, I look at those videos, those pictures of them riding those pokemon... and it's like realizing I'm not the main character."
#+end_quote

this line really landed for me too - most of the criticism of the Titans arc has revolved around the fact that it focuses so heavily on characters we're not invested in dealing with events that have received zero foreshadowing, but I found that to be the arc's biggest selling point. I think I'm on the record as really praising the Stormbringer arc for managing to be on the same level as Worm's Leviathan arc (which is its main point of reference, right?), and obviously it's hard to top that, but these last few chapters have had a lot of standout moments (everything with Mewtwo in particular is the icing on the cake). In spite of the Worm comparisons, I still think this story is pretty much entirely unlike anything I've read before, and I can't wait to see where the heck it's going from here
