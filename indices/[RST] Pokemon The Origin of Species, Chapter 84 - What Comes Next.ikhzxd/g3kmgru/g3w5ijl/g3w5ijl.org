“The renegade, I caught, have they been executed yet? I haven't gotten any messages after the sentencing.”

Should be "has he been executed yet". Unless Leaf sometimes uses genderneutral pronouns at random, just to mess with my head.

-------

This one is actually quite evil, since I was thinking the entire time, that the gender was ambiguous, and didn't notice that there were *three* renegades actually killing people.

I was confused, because Leaf used Joy to subdue one renegade and then a renegade's sandslash.

But I jumped on that "they" and thought that Sandslash-Maddie was the one that got captured and since it was a "they" and it was a Sandslash staying at "her body" was apparently transgender.

So I looked up the first Mewto-Interlude and thought..... aha, Maddie used to go by the name Darin and worked as a (probably psychic or sensitive) comforter, and was implied to be a closeted transwoman ten years ago! Giovanni is such a tolerant employer!

So I patted myself on the back, thinking I finally noticed something!

Then I finally properly parsed this line and had to do a double take.....\\
“No. Just... this organization that employed renegades might find out one was taken alive, right? Even though he's dark, they might try to kill him before he can give anything away.”

This can't be Darin, since Darin couldn't possibly be dark!

Then I reread the Ramin-chapter and Leaf's account and finally figured out, that Joy put Roark to sleep, Maddie's Sandslash killed Maddie (or a saki'd Pokemon of Lizize did) and then Joy put the Sandslash to sleep.\\
Archer either died during the cave-in or managed to escape.\\
[The dark renegade can't be Archer, since Archer can "pull strings", therefore must be a public figure of some sort, which Interpol would have mentioned]

So please, don't use genderneutral pronouns. Or at least not at random. They make everything bloody confusing.
