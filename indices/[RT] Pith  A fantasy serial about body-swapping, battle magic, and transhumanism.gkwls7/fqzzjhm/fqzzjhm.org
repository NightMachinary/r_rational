Good first chapter, I liked it! I'll continue reading.

Minor note: I was a bit confused when you first mentioned smoke, as before only steam was mentioned. Made sense later on when I read about the cigarrete. Idk if it's worth changing.

  I wiped sweat off my forehead and dried my hand on my white dress shirt. Steam rose from the stoves in the middle of the kitchen, filling the room to the brim. It drifted into my eyes, making them sting.

  I waved my hand to clear the smoke and glanced around the room.

  Clutching a cigarette in her fingers, she looked over her shoulder to breathe out a cloud of smoke.

Also random question - is it convention to not tab paragraphs for web serials? I've noticed that authors in books generally tab their paragraphs (ex: Stephen King) but web serials like Worth the Candle, Worm, and Pith don't.
