Thanks! I like the freedom and fine-tuning that my own site gives me. But like Pirateaba and nobody103, I'm planning to cross-post to RR once I have a bigger backlog of chapters and can drop them all fast. My normal posting schedule is slow for web fiction, and that can make it hard to get noticed on the big sites.
