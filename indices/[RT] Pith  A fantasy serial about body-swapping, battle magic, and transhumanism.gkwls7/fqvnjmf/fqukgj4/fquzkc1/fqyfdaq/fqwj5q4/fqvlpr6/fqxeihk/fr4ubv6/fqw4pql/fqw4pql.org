I've read through the first section of the story and I don't think I'll be continuing from here. This isn't a criticism of the writing quality or anything, but being a trans girl that has some experience in being in a shitty body I don't like, I have to say that Ana's sections are too harrowing for me to deal with. Everyone is just absolutely awful to her, she has no hope, they fucking force her to go back into a masculine body after destroying the one she stole... yeah. I wish you well, but I find it hard to read stories where I want everyone in them save the viewpoint character to die horrible painful deaths.
