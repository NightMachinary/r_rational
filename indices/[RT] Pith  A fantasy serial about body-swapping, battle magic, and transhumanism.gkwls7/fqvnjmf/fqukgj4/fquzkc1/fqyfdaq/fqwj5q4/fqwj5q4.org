Does anyone else think that Ana is an unusually good person? I get that it's a literary conceit, that the main character almost has to be morally noble.

Still, if I were in her position, with a power that seemed almost purpose-built for theft - and if I really needed money to save my life... I suppose that she's ashamed about stealing from her parents, that that might move her away from making a habit of it. There's also presumably precautions and ways people try and prevent people like her from stealing on a long-term basis.

  Likewise when she attempts to save those people from being tortured to death. Wouldn't even a good person leave rather than try to do something about it, given their very limited powers at the time? Especially given Wes's arguments?<!

I suppose such people do exist in the real world and maybe I'm being too edgy. It's an interesting issue with rationality in fiction. If Ana was more pragmatic as a thief, she'd have made more money (maybe?) or have otherwise scammed her way out of death. If Taylor was more pragmatic in Worm, she would've joined the Wards or not gotten ensnared with dangerous criminals on a fool's errand trying to uncover Coil. Even in Worth the Candle, a 'pragmatic' Juniper might've bulldozed through a lot of diplomatic problems with soul magic or just killing whatever was in the way. But people don't really act on this birds-eye-view of pragmatism, choosing what values they hold in order to achieve their objectives. The values define the objective most of the time.

I guess more interesting stories come when people decide what to do in somewhat unrealistic ways, then try and achieve their goals as cleverly as possible, given the restrictions they've placed on themselves.
