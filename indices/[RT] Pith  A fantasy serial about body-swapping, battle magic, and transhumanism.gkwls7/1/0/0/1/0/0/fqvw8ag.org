Watch out, that lands you on the latest chapter--at least, it did for me! Try [[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/about/]] or [[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/2020/05/05/blood-run-cold-0-0/]] so Miles can start at the beginning. Not that I imagine major spoilers four chapters in or anything ...

(Pale is a story set in the same world as Pact--not exactly a sequel, as I understand it. It was originally named Poof for some reason, but that opened up a whole can of worms (har) for being a slur in Britain and also sounding silly so he retitled it)
