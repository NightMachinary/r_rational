Not commercial at all, and I'm not doing any editing on the sound or anything to bring it up to production-level quality. It's mostly a way to practice my storytelling while providing some entertainment to friends and family during quarantine while introducing them to good stories. Especially one friend who loves a good web serial but is dyslexic and has trouble reading them himself, so if there isn't already an audiobook he usually misses out. But I think he'll really like this one, so thank you.
