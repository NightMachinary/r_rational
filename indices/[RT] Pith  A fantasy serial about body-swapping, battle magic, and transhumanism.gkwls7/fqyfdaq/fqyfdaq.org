Okay, I've caught up with the story, and so far the greatest flaws are:

- There isn't more of it.
- It doesn't update on tuesdays, wednesdays, thursdays, saturdays and sundays.

The first flaw should fix itself over time though.

Seriously, I'm having a hard time conveying how much I like the story so far. The characters are on point, and I even find myself liking Wes, despite what an absolute scumbag he is. The worldbuilding is great, and every chapter I find myself giggling when the story adds another clever tidbit about how society integrates clones in good or bad ways.

You should probably post a new thread for every chapter. I know I want to comment on some things but I don't really like the wordpress comment box.

Also, any chance you'll post a world map at some point? I'm having a hard time keeing up with the different place names and ethnicities.
