Interesting, thanks.

Also I just read all the up to episode 5 in a shameful binge-read. Great web-serials are my weakness like Wes and his alcohol lol.

You have a really good setting! I like the characters too. I'm sad Kaplen died - hopefully the story is less grimdark than worm? ðŸ˜¬ The quality is really good, I think you could self-publish it.

Last question - do you have a patreon?
