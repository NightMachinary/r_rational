I type up my serial in LibreOffice with a tab before every paragraph. Then I copy-paste it into Wordpress, which removes all of the tabs. I could probably work out some way to indent, but it wouldn't be worth the bother. I suspect RR does something similar.

Indenting is useful to visually offset paragraph starts, but that's probably less useful in online works where you can simply increase spacing between paragraphs for the same result. I imagine books don't do that because paper costs money.
