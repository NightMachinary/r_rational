Oh, huh! I was surprised to see this here - I was thinking of posting it myself at some point since I saw you link it on a different forum, but I never got around to it due to fussing over my own work.

It's a good story! Very tightly written, and exploits the reader desire for catharsis for the injustices the main characters suffer masterfully - there's something about the way you write body/mind incongruence and betrayal from figures who should be trustworthy or caring that really captures the sense of something sacred or primally important being violated. It makes it difficult to stop reading, even against my better sense.

It's also very bold in how un-wishfulfillmenty it is for Ana in particular, considering how characters like that are usually written, even if the tease at the end of the first arc is agonizing. It has the potential to climax this part of her story in an either incredible moment of relief or an absolutely heartrending tragedy.

I also like the worldbuilding. It's unique and interesting without being too indulgent, unlike most of what I write, which goes right off the deep end.
