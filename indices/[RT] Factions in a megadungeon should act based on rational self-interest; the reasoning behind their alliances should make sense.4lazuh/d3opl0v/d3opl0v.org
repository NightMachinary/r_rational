I detest many of the claims of 'realist' geopolitics, but surely the worst is that states /should/ have no friends, no loyalty to higher principles.

It is obvious even from recent history that in practice /most/ do not, but to conclude that this is the natural and morally proper way of international relations can and should be contested. To passively accept the status quo of physical and economic violence between states is to surrender moral agency as citizens of those states, or claim that that the moral worth of humans varies with the location of their birth.
