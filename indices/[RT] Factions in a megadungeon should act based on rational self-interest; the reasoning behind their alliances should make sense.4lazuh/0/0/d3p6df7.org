I have a feeling that the aim is not to completely replace every depiction of politics with with dispassionate realpolitik (not exactly the term for this, but close enough). The author probably thinks that there is too much "good-aligned races are always allies against evil-aligned ones regardless of circumstances" situations occurring as the default. So they point out what's missing.

The point, I think, is not that realpolitik is good. The point is that it would emerge naturally in most political systems, at least to some degree, so it's weird for it to be missing in fictional worlds.
