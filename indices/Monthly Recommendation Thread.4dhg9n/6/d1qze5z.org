Practical guide for Evil. A little bit SJW but it is a nice story where characters knows the meta tropes of a fantasy story in advance. Even made a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/mapmaking/comments/4dflkd/finished_my_map_nitpicks_are_welcome/][map]] for it.

Chiaroscuro is an awesome Naruto fanfic. I like how they raffigure Kakashi.

Currently reading Twig. It's 1921 full of Frankestein monsters made byt the writer of Worms. The main character is an experiemnt with a brain that works better then that of most people.

In Fire Forged is a nice Naruto fanfic with a heavely lore rewrite (people become Genin at 15, if you fail Jonin test you are not returned to accademy) to make the world more logical.
