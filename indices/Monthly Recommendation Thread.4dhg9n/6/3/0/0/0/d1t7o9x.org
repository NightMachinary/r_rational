  An anti-SJW point may be that orcs and goblins are actually as savage as indicated, and that should they live in our world, I would have no desire whatsoever to preserve their cultures.

Ah, but in a world where war between Good and Evil is a fact of life, you probably would if you were a pragmatic villain.

And its clear that, although parts of their culture have been preserved, they have largely assimilated into the greater culture at this point.

There is also very clear racism on the part of pretty much everyone not directly allied with the main character, including both other Villains and Heroes. Basically every race or group gets a bit of it at some point.
