I had my internet education on 4chan and worse.

About SJW thematics, I don't consider it a bad thing but: the cast is 50% male 50% female. Most people whose sexual orientation is known are not straight. In background we have orcs who were oppressed for thousand of years and now that they can go to shcool are demonstrating to be as smart as humans. All the noble, privileged people encountered so far are evil.

This is from the top of my head, if you want I can try to think of more aspects.
