I read all of "A Practical Guide To Evil" a couple of weeks ago; pretty fantastic, though I wish more was out! The only part that stuck out for me about it being "a little bit SJW" was that the main character is bisexual, and openly announces that (although it takes a while).

I also really enjoyed the "Hero" chapter interludes in book 2, especially the one talking about why Good needs to win over Evil. Up until that point I was thinking "Man, Evil is pretty good!" But Bard convincingly points out that this is a deviation from the regular behavior of Evil. At its best, Evil is efficient; at its worst, it's brutally genocidal. So while the Empire might be a better place to live in now than Callow was, there's no guarantee that it'll stay that way - and if history is any indication, when that pendulum shifts, lots of innocent people are going to get massacred.
