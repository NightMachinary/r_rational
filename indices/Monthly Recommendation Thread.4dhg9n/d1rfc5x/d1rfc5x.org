I really enjoy reading Jonathan Strahan's /[[http://www.solarisbooks.com/post/575][The Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year]]/ anthologies. Here are two of the memorable stories from last years anthology which are available for free courtesy of tor.com:

/[[http://www.tor.com/2014/05/28/the-insects-of-love-genevieve-valentine/][The Insects of Love]]/ by Genevieve Valentine: One sister goes disappears into the desert, the other tries to piece together her life to find out why. Her journey is complicated by multiple realities and a lack of clarity about what's real and what isn't. The end is left open to interpretation, but I think clever readers are intended to figure out a specific timeline/history (I'm apparently only half-clever, and am hoping some of you will read this and discuss theories about what happens!).

/[[http://www.tor.com/2014/04/02/the-devil-in-america-kai-ashante-wilson/][The Devil in America]]/ by Kai Ashante Wilson: A story about a black family living tinged with magic, living in the American south in 1877, and their daughter that makes a deal with the devil. This story is pretty racially charged and gets graphic, but is a good read. I really enjoy settings like this (and other things like O Brother, Where Art Thou? and the first season of True Detective) because they tend to feature a really sinister form of evil that I find both terrifying and riveting.

I would write more but am about to board my plane!
