At what point does an author's "unusual style" become poor writing? Serious question, not trying to be inflammatory. I read about 60 pages in so far and I do think I'll keep reading, but as you said I think the author writes confusingly and it's not due to clever perspective or because what they're describing is innately complicated.

I say this as someone who's liked books in the past that are full of wide swathes of stream of consciousness or of classics which can be confusing due to their older dialect/context... I'm just not sure where to draw the line.
