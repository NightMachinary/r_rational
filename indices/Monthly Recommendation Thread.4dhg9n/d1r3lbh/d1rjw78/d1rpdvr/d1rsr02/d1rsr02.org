Ah! I didn't know he had a blog. Well, now I'm subscribed to it as well.

I'm curious, what's your opinion on March North? I loved Succession very much, but while March North is also good, the characters just weren't as engaging (aside from Halt of course!) and I treated reading it as if it was a way to get to know the setting better than taking pleasure in just reading it.
