That's pretty much how I took it - it's a good introduction to the characters and to the world. I'm a fan of military sci-fi, so I was interested by the military aspects of it as well. It was definitely NOT your average military fiction book.

I think the thing I liked best about it was that, despite it being a fantasy, it was so well grounded in the "science" and in tactics. The complete lack of mysticism on the part of the characters was very compelling - they were professionals, not "heroes" and I think that's the way it is in the real world.
