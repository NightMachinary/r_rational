Backing up the recs for PMAS and SayakaQuest. The latter is shounen but in a good way. The former is surprisingly scientific in the way the players interact with the world and the writer works very hard to make the world react realistically. Obviously since I help out with Marked for Death I can't exactly give a non-biased rec but I've certainly been enjoying it.

Maybe I should look into A Man's Dream, since it's being recced alongside 3 other things that I enjoy.
