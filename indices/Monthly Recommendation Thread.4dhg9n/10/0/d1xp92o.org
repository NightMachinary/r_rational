I'm the author of this serial so A) thanks for the recommendation B) a quick warning: I was told by the owner of the site that it would be going dark on April 4th. It's April 10th and the site is still up, so I've concluded that there was something flawed in that in that particular data point. However, the site could go away any time. Readers might want to make a note of my email address (crumjd on the gmail system) in case it does and they need me to get them a PDF of the last half of the story or something.

I'd hate to leave anyone hanging...
