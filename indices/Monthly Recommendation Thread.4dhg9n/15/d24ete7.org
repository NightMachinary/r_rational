I'm loving all the [[http://www.rosamundhodge.net/short-stories/][short stories by Rosamund Hodge]]. They're not exactly 'rational', but they're all without exception clever, moving, and colourful. Strongly recommended, given how short they all are.

Haven't tried her books yet but that'd be the next thing on the list.
