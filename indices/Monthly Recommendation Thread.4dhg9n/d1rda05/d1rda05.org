*Youtube*

It's not fiction, but there's a relatively small youtube channel dedicated to thorough, honest critiques of video games.

[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyhnYIvIKK_--PiJXCMKxQQ][Joseph Anderson]] is never negative just to be negative, and he doesn't gush over every little thing his favorite developers do. He also tempers his own opinions with contradicting views, and admits his limitations as a single individual with a single perspective. He first got popular with a harsh but honest [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-3kxiOzMOg][hour-long review of Hearthstone]]. Not all of his videos are that long, but his huge [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A34poZ6paGs][Fallout 4 breakdown]] is probably my favorite.

*Movies*

I don't watch many movies, but if you haven't watched [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477348/][No Country for Old Men]], you're only cheating yourself. The directing takes huge influences from Kubrick: Long shots with no dilaogue--only action moving the plot forward. And everything is done with honest intention, even if at times misguided. Oh, and there arguably is no main character, so you can rest assured no one has plot armor.

*Books*

I dunno how this sub is about light self-promotion, but I honestly believe my book will appeal to fans of rational fiction.

[[http://www.amazon.com/Perjure-Book-1-Welcome-Multiverse-ebook/dp/B01CF3MYLW][Perjure: Welcome to the Multiverse]] is my best attempt at blending the complexity and world building of A Song of Ice and Fire with the prose and brutality of Blood Meridian. It's a big, 600 page first entry in a series that tries to mirror No Country for Old Men in its equal treatment to all characters.

The subreddit is [[/r/wttm]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/wttm][if you're interested]].

*Music*

Oh god, please listen to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKqjs_6Qc-w][Pillow Talking by Lil Dicky]]. Even if you hate rap and you don't like his style of humor, I feel like everyone in this sub will relate with the subject matter. It's a song that recounts an argument Lil Dicky supposedly had with a girl after having sex with her. It touches on religion, aliens, pizza, veganism and Uber vs Lyft. It's amazing.
