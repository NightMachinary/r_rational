I'm currently taking a break from it (it's really long) but I'd like to throw my hat in the already-full-of-hats Worm ring. Worm is seriously great. Among the best superhero stories I've ever seen, and maybe the best serial fiction I've ever read. Please make it a (good) TV series, Hollywood. Actually, no, I think anime would suit it better than live action. Make it happen.
