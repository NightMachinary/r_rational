I caught this link here a while ago and loved it:

[[https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Graydon_Saunders_A_Succession_of_Bad_Days?id=tYyxCQAAQBAJ][A Succession of Bad Days]] - It's about a group of students learning to be wizards in an incredibly hazardous world with ~30k years of history and the results of hundreds of insane prior evil overloards genetic experiments roaming the countryside.\\
It's really unlike anything I've ever read before.

The characters are fairly rational and the whole social and political situation seems like a rational response to the world.

[[https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Graydon_Saunders_Safely_You_Deliver?id=Oju2CwAAQBAJ][Safely You Deliver]] is the third in the series with the same characters. (Just came out, reading it now)

The first one in the series is [[https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Graydon_Saunders_The_March_North?id=MoIOAwAAQBAJ][The March North]], mentioned here for complteness. Some of the characters are in the second books, but this one is not particularly "rational".
