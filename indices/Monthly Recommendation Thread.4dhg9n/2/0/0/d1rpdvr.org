I wish that there were. I enjoyed the first two so much that I tracked down the author to his [[http://dubiousprospects.blogspot.com/][blog]] where I posted inquiring about updates. He replied that the blog was about as good as it gets, so I added it to my RSS feed and pre-ordered the next book when it came out.

The good news is that book 4 is in the process of being written.

Yeah, I should have added a warning about the writing style. It is very hard to describe. I find that I have to put my full attention into reading in order to not miss something - his sentences seem to zig when they should zag. I did find that maybe 1/4 of the way through I grew somewhat accustomed to it. The underlying content is such a delight that I am more than willing to put up with an idiosyncratic writing style.
