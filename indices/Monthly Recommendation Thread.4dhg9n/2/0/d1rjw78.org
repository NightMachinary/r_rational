Just warning people here, read the offered sample of the chapter before you buy it. The author writes in a very unusual way which is hard to describe, but one consequence is that there are no or very few pronouns (he, she) in the entire book which can be very confusing for readers.

Also, thanks so much SaintPeter74! I was the one to recommend the series on the subreddit before and didn't realize there's another book out.

By the way, do you know if there's a way to track or follow authors on Google Play? There doesn't seem to be an obvious way to do it, but you are posting about the book the day after it was released, so you must have some way to do so.
