Steven Universe. It's an amazing show. It's almost if not just as good as Avatar the Last Airbender.

Also, I've been reading "The World is Your Oyster, The Universe is Your Namesake" which is a Steven Universe fanfic which diverges from the canon storyline after the end of season 2. It's very good.
