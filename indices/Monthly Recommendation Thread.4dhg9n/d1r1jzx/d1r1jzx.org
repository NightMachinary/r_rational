Some fun pieces of original fiction available for free on [[http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top][Project Gutenberg]], in no particular order... (The word counts are somewhat incorrect, since I haven't bothered to remove Project Gutenberg's headers and footers from most of the files.)

- The D'Artagnan Romances (1m words): /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1257][The Three Musketeers]]/ (233k words) is a very fun action story, and Project Gutenberg's translation of it is nicely lively. Its translations of the other books in the series ([[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1259][1]] [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2609][2]] [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2681][3]] [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2710][4]] [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2759][5]]) aren't the best, nor are those stories' plots quite as entertaining (so much court intrigue!)--but they're still interesting to read.\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1840][The Financier]]/ (198k words) is an extremely interesting story that details the rise of a prominent Philadelphian banker in the middle of the nineteenth century. Irksomely, however, in [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3629][the sequel]] the protagonist seems merely to repeat the errors that he committed in the first book; I've twice failed to complete it.\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/86][A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]/ (122k words): A nicely-funny story about a person's attempting to bring technology into medieval England.\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2145][Ben-Hur]]/ (202k words): A surprisingly-fun historical novel that doesn't get boring until it starts in the later chapters to deal with the religious stuff that the reader was expecting to show up much sooner. "Down Eros, up Mars!"\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10007][Carmilla]]/ (31k words): A nice little vampire story.\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/345][Dracula]]/ (164k words): A longer vampire story.\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/829][Gulliver's Travels]]/ (107k words): Fun sojourns in fantastical locations.\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32528][The Lusiads]]/ (165k words): An epic poem for /Portugal!/\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/558][The Thirty-Nine Steps]]/ (44k words): A fun little adventure story.\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39858][Trilby]]/ (106k words): Mind control in the nineteenth century.\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5231][The Way We Live Now]]/ (358k words): British aristocrats being unbearably stupid. (I cringed out at the end of Chapter Forty-Nine, personally.)\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/972][The Devil's Dictionary]]/ (64k words): Humorous "definitions" for many words.\\
- /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/82][Ivanhoe]]/ (196k words): An /extremely/-awesome piece of "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanhoe#Historical_accuracy][historical]]" fiction, featuring John Lackland and Robert Locksley as major players.
