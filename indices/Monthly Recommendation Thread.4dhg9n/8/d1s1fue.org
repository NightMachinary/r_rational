As many of you know, Dragon Ball Z is one of the the least rational story/settings you can find that isn't a parody of another setting.

However, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nYozPLpJRE&list=PL6EC7B047181AD013][Dragon Ball Z Abridged by Team Four Star]] is a hilarious parody of it. It isn't rational/rationalist itself, but it highlights the irrationality of the original in a funny way. The quality improves greatly as the series progresses, but it's a bit rough at first. Also, many, but not all, of the jokes require familiarity with the source material.
