I'm going to trust to the idea that there's some inscrutable similarity of thought pattern between people reading here, and that things I like that aren't necessarily "rational" will have good odds of also being things you might like... so these might be a bit all over the place. I figure that's more interesting than rounding up the HPMOR continuation-fics again.

Not sure how easy it is to find a copy to watch, but it will be a fun time for anyone who enjoys time travel movies and comedy. What with it being a comedic time travel movie. No promises with regards to the absence of plot holes, except that I was too busy enjoying it to notice them.

I've recently been enjoying working my way slowly through the back catalog of videos from this guy - he talks a lot about medieval/ancient weapons and tactics, with emphasis on the fact that most fighters from the period would have been quite invested in staying alive. So contrary to Hollywood opinion, one doesn't [[https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://i.imgur.com/agtRUV9.gifv][rush in recklessly]]; great care is taken to avoid the pointy bits of enemy weapons where possible.

Endearing old-school-youtube style of turning on the camera then going on a bit of a rambling discourse with tangents, while frequently saying "I should really start scripting these" and "I forgot a bit from last time, here's one more point on that". Also occasionally talks about swing dance and other matters, because he is a man of many interests (but those can be easily spotted and skipped if you're not into that).

- /Better Call Saul/

Has been my TV program of choice lately, is pretty good from a "creative solutions to problems" stand-point, and also excellent from a "cinematography and general TV-making" standpoint. Doesn't /require/ having seen /Breaking Bad/ but as a prequel it will make more sense that way, and also Breaking Bad is very good so I feel no qualms suggesting you watch that too.
