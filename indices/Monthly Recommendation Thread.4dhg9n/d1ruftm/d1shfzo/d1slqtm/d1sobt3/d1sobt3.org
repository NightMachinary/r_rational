There's a few I've enjoyed though I'd hesitate to call them rational. I'd only fullheartedly rec the first, though I did enjoy the other three.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/alchemical-solutions-worm-exalted-thread-21-unsuspecting-union-undergoes-unfortunate-upset.23984/page-186#post-5608380][Alchemical Solutions]] is of high quality and rather long, though sadly has gone without an update these past 5 months. It's on its 21st thread at the minute. Does a very good job of melding Worm with Exalted, and characters manage to act very believably. Definitely recommend.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/asukaquest-final-thread-i-told-you-so.1436/][Asuka Quest]] by the same person who wrote SayakaQuest is essentially more of the same if you enjoyed that story. Story is complete.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-gardens-of-enoch-terrascape-academy.25206/][The Gardens of Enoch]] has high quality writing but suffers from serial escalation problems as the writer seems to be bribing the playerbase with constant powerups. It's like a bag of gummy bears: nice while it lasts but not completely filling. Updates at least once a week so far.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/witch-quest.232691/][Witch Quest 1]], [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/witch-quest-thread-two.247174/][2]]. The adorable story of a not very smart Witch-magical girl in PMMM who gets in funny misunderstandings, makes friends, and dies repeatedly. Fun, but dead.
