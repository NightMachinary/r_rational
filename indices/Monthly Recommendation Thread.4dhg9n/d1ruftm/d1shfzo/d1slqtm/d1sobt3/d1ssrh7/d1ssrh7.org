Thanks. I'm actually almost done with AsukaQuest, though it isn't nearly as good as SayakaQuest, as a lot of the latter's problems are amplified in this one.

Already following Gardens of Enoch due to it being Rihaku, though just reading updates and not actively following the debates. The prologue and Imperia are the best parts about it, so it's at least worth keeping up to date with. The way it's run does have huge problems though, I agree.

Read Witch Quest ages ago, and did like it, but it died so not much point anymore.

I am hesitant to check out a quest that's on indefinite hiatus, but I will if I run out.
