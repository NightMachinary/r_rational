Well, seeing as my most recent obsessions have all been Roleplaying Quests on SufficientVelocity, I'll list some of the best ones I've found. Here's an [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/intro-to-questing.12494/][Intro to Questing]], for those who don't know.

- *[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][Marked for Death: A Rational Naruto Quest]]* - This one has been posted here a few times. Written by Velorien and EagleJarl, with two other guys helping with mechanics and worldbuilding. Out of all the quests I've found, this is still absolutely my favorite. Great worldbuilding, unexpectedly brilliant mechanics system, and expectedly great writing. Updates twice a week, and in need of more regular contributors.

- *[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-man%E2%80%99s-dream-never-dies-a-one-piece-quest.23728/][A Man's Dream Never Dies: A One Piece Quest]]* - I've never really checked out One Piece, so I was wary about this one, but the writing quality quickly won me over. This Quest follows the journey of the pirate Morgan D. Bartholomew, the Captain of the Black Suit Pirates and known throughout the world as Black Bart. The story starts in the aftermath of your ship being attacked and destroyed by Admiral Kizaru, with your whole crew either dead or captured, and Bart being critically wounded. But this is no reason to give up. Your dream is to become the Pirate King, and nothing short of death will stop you from achieving that. This quest is something of a Shounen/Seinin story, and the writing is extremely good. We just passed the Timeskip, with a new arc just getting started, so it's a good time to jump in.

- *[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/SayakaQuest][SayakaQuest]]* - Complete. This quest takes place in the Madoka Magica universe, from the perspective of Sayaka Miki, [[/s][PMMM spoilers]]. Words fail me when trying to describe this thing, but just know that it will always be one of my all-time favorites. The original designs of the Witches and Labyrinths are extremely impressive, creatively speaking, and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing. Here's the [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/sayakaquest-story-only-thread.9401/][Story Only Thread]], which has all the material for the first 10 parts, and you can find the rest in the index on the first page.

- *[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/puella-magi-adfligo-systema-story-only.9091/][Puella Magi Adfligo Systema]]* - Another Madoka Magica quest. This one's by far the most popular quest on the list, amassing a huge regular following and sitting as the largest quest thread on the entire website by a comfortable margin. Story starts with a girl named Sabrina waking up in the streets of the Madoka-verse in critical condition. She cannot remember anything about her past, but does have full knowledge of all Madoka canon, including the Walpurgisnacht and the whole Incubator system, and is determined to stop the incoming disaster from happening. The writing of this one is really quite fantastic, and the questers have done a pretty good job with everything so far.
