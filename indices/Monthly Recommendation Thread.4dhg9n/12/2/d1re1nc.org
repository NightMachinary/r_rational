I'll second the recommendation for the Dumas books (Three musketeers and the rest of the books). They're a lot of fun and the historical aspects of it is well researched for the most part (there are some editions with a lot of footnotes detailing the historical aspects which are great).

Ivanhoe is also a great read.

Outside of Project Guntenberg, if you're interested in historical fiction, I recommend Azincourt by Bernard Cornwell
