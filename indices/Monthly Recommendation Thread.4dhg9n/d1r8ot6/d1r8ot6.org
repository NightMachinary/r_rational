[[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents][The Fall of Doc Future]] and sequels. Bonobo Rationalist solutions to social problems, and superpowers.

The main character is neurodivergent, can trivially easily destroy the world, and most of the problems she faces are avoiding collateral damage and dealing with neurotypical people.
