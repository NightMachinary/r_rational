This is a pretty good one, though I've only read the first arc so far. Found it exceptionally grounded.

Though, speaking as someone who has lived his whole life in North Dakota, having been born in Bismarck and currently going to college in Fargo, it gets a bit weird when the state or the city gets referred to as this barren winter wasteland with only a smidgen of civilization. It sometimes feels like we're not talking about the same place. I did like that the recent oil boom was integrated into the story, with the huge influx of people moving into the state for that, as that is absolutely what happened.

I discovered this fic at random, just looking through recent Madoka updates on ff.net for something half-decent, and this caught my attention purely because it happened in my home state. Was pretty pleasantly suprised at the writing quality, and the update rate is great.
