[[http://starterserials.com/active/the-beginners-guide-to-magical-site-licensing/the-beginners-guide-to-magical-site-licensing/][This should have been recommended already!: Beginners Guide to Magical Site Licensing]] A serial fantasy novel set in a world where magic is real and magical spells are valuable intellectual property jealously guarded by the corporations and magi that created them. Kyle is a working corporate mage. His day job coaxing fragile magical equipment to continue operating is pure drudgery, but when he discovers a new and powerful spell he thinks he has it made. In this world, if you've got access to enough raw magical current you can live for hundreds of years, so it shouldn't be any surprise that the competition is starting to get a little medieval. Apologies for butchering the blurb.
