Seconded. Worth noting is that it has quite a series of musical albums dedicated to it (some songs of which are used in animations) that are worth looking into even if you've no interest in the story. One of the musicians that worked on it, a fellow by the name of Toby Fox, is responsible for my favorite game which I'll shamelessly plug here: Undertale.
