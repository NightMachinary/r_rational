I played lot of interactive fiction recently and IMHO these are the best games of the genre:

[[https://www.choiceofgames.com/robots/][Choice of Robots]] You are brilliant constructor creating new revolutionary type of robot. Your choices will shape your robot, your life and whole world. Lots of branching paths. Some events seems unavoidable but there is way to prevent them. Also, Singularity is an option.

[[https://www.choiceofgames.com/user-contributed/tin-star/][Tin Star]] - Western. It's one of the longest interactive novels, but it doesn't sacrifice interactivity and has lots of ways to roleplay and choices that actually matters. It has Deus Ex wealth of options. If you want you can kill every major character or you can go through game talking your way out of problems and not killing anyone. Great characters, even simple bandits have depth.

[[http://www.inklestudios.com/80days/][80 Days]] - steampunk retelling of /Around the World in 80 Days/. Really captures spirit of the novel with planning out routes, worrying about time and the misadventures of unfortunate Passepartout.
