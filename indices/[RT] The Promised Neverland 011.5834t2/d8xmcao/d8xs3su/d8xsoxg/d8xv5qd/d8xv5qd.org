This is way above HP:MoR. Harry was in a school that taught magic, he did a bit of experimentation on his own, and he could ask teachers for confirmation when he got crazy ideas; also, we're more or less supposed to assume he had many awesome idea that failed to work off-screen for every idea we saw work.

Here, we have children brought up by aliens with every incentive to deceive them about the world that surrounds them, no espionage experience whatsoever, no way to confirm most of their theories, a smarter, more experienced agent actively trying to mislead them (even if mama /is/ trying to help the kids, she's not exactly communicating clearly), and yet their complicated reasonings keep exactly spot on. It's not always egregious, but on the whole their priors are way, way too good for someone in their situation.
