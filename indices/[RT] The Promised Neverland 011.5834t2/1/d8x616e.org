Emma seems a bit paranoid today.......not paranoid enough !!!!, they should consider the posibility that mama has deduced that they will try the old trick of give fake information to the spy , or that Ray could be a spy ,or that mum has some way of listen their conversations, at least inside the house .Probably they considered at least some of this things , they have been very rational and almost properly paranoid until now( but not enough to realize the possibility of spies until now). Also I can see mama telling her own lies to the spy to explain why spy them. they shouldn't lie about Connie because the others are going to discover the truth and eventually and that will weaken their trust , also it might clash with any of the lies mama probaly told to the spy.
