Why would he test it on small animals? The risk isn't to Hermione, she is dead. If it doesn't work it won't make her more dead.

The risk is that he could unmake reality, and that risk is unchanged whether he tests on animals or people. In fact, there is even a small chance he could get the altered spell wrong, meaning each attempt carries an additional risk.

If he transfigured Hermione in canon, then he has done something to her body that experts have said makes life impossible. It is heavily implied that this does something bad at the microscopic level, which means probably genetic as well as brain (and all other tissue) damage.

This is literally the worst thing he could do, knowing what he knows, because now he has to solve death /and/ human to inanimate transfiguration complications, which actually sound harder to fix.
