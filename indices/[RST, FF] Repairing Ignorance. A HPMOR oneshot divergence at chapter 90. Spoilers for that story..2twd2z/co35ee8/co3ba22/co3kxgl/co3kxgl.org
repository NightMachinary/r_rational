Not the top post, but I do agree with him.

  Harry has no way to test this without trying it, and no-one to ask who will give him a trustworthy answer.

You are write that he can't ask anyone, however if he could catch and kill some small animals with blunt trauma and blood loss, he could at least confirm that the spell can be used to repair living things (it still doesn't ensure that it can do so without brain damage or that it can restore magic).

  He has also already failed to take sensible precautions 3 times in HPMOR canon.
#+end_quote

He at least nominally planned on doing better next time.

  In canon he has done this with partial transfiguration, Patronus and potions already.

I agree with you on this.

  the entire point of the oneshot is to show how even strict rationalists can make decisions counter to their own stated positions when forced by circumstance, and that the Wizarding society is set up to create those circumstances, thereby increasing risk. This is a feature of the story, not a bug.

I still feel like he would have wanted to try the spell on dead animals first.

  Harry did something to Hermione's corpse, which later disappeared. Whatever it is, it wasn't partial transfiguration, Patronus 2.0 or acorn potions, so even in canon he has tested something unproven on her.

Actually the consensus theory is that he transfigured Hermione into a stable form. The common theory is that in order to misdirect Dumbledore he transfigured her into the ring, then left a random object transfigured as Hermione in her place. The transfiguration ends causing her sudden disappearance. Dumbledore fall for his misdirection and only checks his stone and not his ring. Since Harry has Hermione in a secure form, he can take his time developing the repair charm modification and testing it on animals.
