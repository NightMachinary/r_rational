Yes, Harry has noticed the perception change is what makes his spells work better. It's totally cool to try that with every spell. :)

Maybe what makes magic disappear is just wizards not being able to change their perceptions. Maybe the spells to do great stuff didn't really disappear, but people use them all the time, but with wrong kind of thinking?

Maybe they aren't missing the spellbook, but the manual?
