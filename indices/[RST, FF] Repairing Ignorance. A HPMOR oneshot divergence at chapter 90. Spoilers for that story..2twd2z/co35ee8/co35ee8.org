Not to be /that guy/ (although I totally am him), but part of what makes HPMOR so good is that this would probably not happen. Instead, Harry would think about how unlikely it is that this clever thought would actually work and not do nothing or screw things up horribly and irreparably, and he would do tests and things first, and talk to professors, because he has read books about clever little shits messing with things they don't understand, and he knows things only turned out well for them because they are in a book, and he most definitely is not.

It worked with the Dementors and the Patronus 2.0, but that's cuz Yudders built it up, and it's so damn thematic. The logic was established before Harry did the thing, with every piece already there so it felt natural and right rather than Harry pulling a superpower out of his ass. And also as long as I'm on the subject it doesn't work dramatically to do it /twice./
