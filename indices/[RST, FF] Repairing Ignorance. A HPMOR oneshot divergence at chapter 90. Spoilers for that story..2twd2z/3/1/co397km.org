Thanks for saying this... the snippet didn't feel quite right to me, and your post put into words my issue with it. It seems like Harry would test it with dead rats or something first. Much less dramatic, but it would let him know if it can at least restore life and won't mess up the corpse and thereby ruin his future chance at resurrecting Hermione.
