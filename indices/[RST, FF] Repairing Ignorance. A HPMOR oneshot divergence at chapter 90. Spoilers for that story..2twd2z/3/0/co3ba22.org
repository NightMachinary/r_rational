Hopefully I don't come off like a defensive author here.

Your arguments appear to be

a) Harry wouldn't risk this without safety precautions and testing.

- Harry has no way to test this without trying it, and no-one to ask who will give him a trustworthy answer. He has also already failed to take sensible precautions 3 times in HPMOR canon.

b) He shouldn't use a perception change to make a new spell twice for dramatic reasons.

- In canon he has done this with partial transfiguration, Patronus and potions already. It is also shown that AK works differently with different mental states as well. It is pretty much a theme in the source material.

c) Harry is too rational to do this.

- the entire point of the oneshot is to show how even strict rationalists can make decisions counter to their own stated positions when forced by circumstance, and that the Wizarding society is set up to create those circumstances, thereby increasing risk. This is a feature of the story, not a bug.

d) He is not going to risk Hermione's body on untried magic

- Harry /did something/ to Hermione's corpse, which later disappeared. Whatever it is, it wasn't partial transfiguration, Patronus 2.0 or acorn potions, so /even in canon/ he has tested something unproven on her.
