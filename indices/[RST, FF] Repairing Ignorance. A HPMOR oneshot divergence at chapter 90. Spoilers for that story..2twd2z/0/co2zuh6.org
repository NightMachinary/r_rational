The smile that "stopped short of his glistening eyes"... am I reading this right if I take it as implying that it's a somewhat forced smile while welling up with tears? The implication I'm getting is that in the process of fixing the problem he's discovered another; that he's just proven that people are automata, with free will found only in the 'map', not the reality. Hence "the only thing I could".

I'm either being super-obvious or way off base, I submit the fact that /I can't tell which/ as further evidence for the notion that any fact, no matter how heavily implied, can be rendered "hidden" by the simple artifice of not explicitly stating it.
