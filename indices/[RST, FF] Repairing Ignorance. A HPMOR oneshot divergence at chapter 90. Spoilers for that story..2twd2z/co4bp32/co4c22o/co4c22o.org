Perfection. Exactly right. I wrote a little about it [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2ttdh5/repairing_ignorance_hpmor_oneshot_spoilers/co40x69][here]].

I'm not quite sure how an acausal timeless universe (as EY seems to suggest in canon) would interact with a negentropy ray though ...

Can you work out the happy ending? Assume negentropy is not a problem and Harry has time for one spell before Quirrel arrives to kill them ("too dangerous to let live").
