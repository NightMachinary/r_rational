Ahhh... fair enough.

My own chain of logic here is that

- harry expects quirrell will know when the spell is cast
- harry expects quirrell will be /very unhappy/ about such a risk being taken, and likely will try to either kill hermione or both of them because harry's actions (alongside the prophecy) prove he is a risk
- harry knows he has a very short space of time to do anything about it, and simply jumping under an invisibility cloak or using a time turner (does he have either of those on him?) will not prevent Quirrell catching them.
- harry knows he can't beat quirrell in a fair or unfair fight
