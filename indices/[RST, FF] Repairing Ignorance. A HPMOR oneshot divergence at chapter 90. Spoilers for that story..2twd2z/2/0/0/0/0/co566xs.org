Alright. Spitballing a few options here:

1) Threaten to release something more dangerous.

#+begin_quote
  For instance, summon patronus 2.0 and have it shout the truth about dementors. Quirrell hears this and realizes the dangers inherent in having no one able to fight dementors. Temporary truce.

2) Nuke

#+begin_quote
  Harry summons something that either kills only Quirrell, and threatens to release it if Q doesn't back off. Alternatively, something that kills all three of them that Q can detect from outside the door, and that Harry can use as a last ditch attack.
#+end_quote

(Harry can't win against Q, but he can make Q lose)

3) Summon Bigger Fish

#+begin_quote
  Try and bring back Merlin or Godric Gryffindor or whoever can reasonably overpower Q.
