It seems likely, in a world moderately similar to earth, that you could sell some gold easily, but the more you tried to sell the more suspicious people would get. If you have control over the form, you could make necklaces or other plausible jewlery from it. if you don't, you could claim- in a low tech world, ideally- that it came from an inheiritance from someone who expected the local currency to fail and gold to still have value. You could also claim to have found it somewhere- or claim to be a gold dowser for a mining organization, and sell them the gold you "find" in their refuse pile.

Obviously, gold bullion and dust are more suspicious and "where did you get this". with lower tech, you can travel, selling it as you go, posing as a merchant. with higher tech, this is less viable, because if people get interested, they stay interested.

Please note this is making some assumptions, but i'd think stolen gold would be something the government looks out for.
