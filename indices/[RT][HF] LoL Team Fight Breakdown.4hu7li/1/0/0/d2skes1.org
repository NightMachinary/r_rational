It can be great to watch... if you have the high level of contextual knowledge to actually appreciate what is going on - what people are doing and why they are doing it. Otherwise, it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing.

I don't link really awesome games or tournaments of DotA 2 here, even when they have really interesting stories happen in them, because I assume that the background rate of DotA 2 players on this subreddit is close to the same as anywhere else - probably less than 1 in 100 - and of that vanishingly tiny fraction who could theoretically follow what's happening without dozens of hours of study, most of those are probably subscribed to one or more of the Dota 2 subreddits and are already aware of things, making a [[/r/rational]] link totally superfluous.
