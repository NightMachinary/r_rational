Harry's intelligence is not normal, and that's a deliberate part of the plot.

Draco has had a lot of extra tutoring in a variety of fields.

Hermione is just brilliant, that's canon.

I don't recall the other children being unreasonably intelligent, although it's true that Battle Magic class pushes them beyond what other 11-year-olds might typically do.

But if you don't enjoy it, OK.
