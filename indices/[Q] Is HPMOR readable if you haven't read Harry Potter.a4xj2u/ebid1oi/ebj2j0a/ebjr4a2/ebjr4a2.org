I never said to dwell on particular sentences or to pause or to linger any longer than necessary (though I think it's natural for that to happen, to pause for a few moments when thoughts arise like "what if this happens next" or "what if he'd said this instead of that" or "what if this entire conversation played out differently," or to pause and just /think about/ what's being said).

300wpm isn't unreasonable or even especially slow, it's twice as fast as speaking speed, it's not like you're plodding along word by word sounding things out like a kid learning to read.

In fact, 500wmp is probably as fast as it's physically possible to *read* (and that's *read* and not *skim*) because physically moving your eyes, fixating on a point, and then visually processing what your eyes are fixated on can't go much faster than that. It's like in The Lost World when the guy says that the neurotoxins in the dart act faster than the nerve conduction velocity so the animal dies before it even feels the prick of the dart, you're made out of meat and the meat is only as fast as it is, there are several physical bottlenecks between the page and your brain and it isn't physically possible to circumvent any of them.

Even though 500wpm is doable, it's too fast for nuance and feeling the cadence of the words (there's a lot of comprehension being lost with the loss of cadence, especially for dialogue).

"Speed reading" isn't real reading, it's skimming, you don't get to call it "reading" when it has a comprehension rate and retention rate of less than 50%.

I only mentioned purposefully subvocalizing in the first place because I've seen two posts in the last few days from people who said they read HPMOR in its entirety in less than 24 hours, and I'm pretty sure it was a first time readthrough for both commenters. It's not physically possible to read that quickly for that length of time while maintaining an appropriate level of comprehension and retention, if your eyes are looking at that many words per minute then your brain isn't absorbing all of them, which would only be amplified after having been awake for longer than your brain wants you to be.

And no, I don't care about anyone's personal protestations to the contrary, I'm not interested in anyone commenting at me with some "well I personally read six hundred words a minute so that proves you wrong."

Many people believe that it's physically possible to multitask; some people believe that they themselves multitask, and on top of that believe that they do it competently. Those people have been proven to be mistaken. There's no such thing as multitasking, it's an illusion, you're not paying attention to multiple tasks simultaneously, you're quickly switching your attention from task to task and doing each one more poorly than you'd do if you'd just do them sequentially and you don't realize you're doing every task more poorly because every brain is stupid no matter how intelligent its owner is.

In much the same way, some people believe that their skimming is "reading quickly," and on top of that believe that their reading comprehension is just as good as it'd be if they read at a slower rate. Those people been proven to be mistaken. People who "read" in the 500wmp to 800wpm are just skimming most of the text and occasionally slowing down a bit to read the important parts; people who read over 800wpm are just straight up skimming.

People are completely wrong about their own competence /all the time/, I don't care at all whatsoever about what people have to say about their own abilities, all I care about is the *FACT* that the relevant scientists who have spent the past several decades studying cognition and attention and visual perception all agree that the brain just doesn't work that way.

If you're not reading one word at a time then you're /skimming,/ not reading. You can say "I understood just as much and got just as much out of it as I would've if I'd actually read it instead of just skimming it," but I will /never/ believe you. Not because I'm generalizing from my own personal experience of reduced comprehension at higher speeds, but because the people who have spent the last 50 years studying this crap know us better than we know ourselves. You can /not/ trust yourself to be an accurate judge of your own competence, because you're made of meat.
