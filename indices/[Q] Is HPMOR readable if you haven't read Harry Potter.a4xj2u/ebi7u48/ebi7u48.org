Considering it was written by someone who hadn't read the whole series, I'd say yeah. Won't lie, there's some stuff you aren't gonna get- the author doesn't waste time with exposition about stuff someone who's read the books would know. That said, the parts people tend to really love don't require much background knowledge at all, so I'd say go for it.
