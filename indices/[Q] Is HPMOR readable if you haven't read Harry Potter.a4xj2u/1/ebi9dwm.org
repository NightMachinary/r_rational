Readable? Yes. The most enjoyable way? No.

I would highly recommend reading the first book or watching some of the movies so you get the gist of the setting and characters. Without the background the story and mechanics is still solid, but you don't get the neat moments of understanding how EY has changed characters. Dumbledore specifically springs to mind, I don't think he would be nearly as hilarious without knowing the canon character.
