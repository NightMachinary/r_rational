as others have said, its beneficial, not mandatory. The more familiar you are with cannon, the more references you'll get and the more you'll be able to appreciate the changes that were made. Having said that a lot of people are recommending you read/watch the first book/movie, I think there's value in going beyond that. For example, demontors, patronuses and azkaban are pretty important to HPMOR but aren't introduced into harry potter until book 3.

The movies are a decent substitute for the books, so i'd recommend watching the first one for sure and if you find that you enjoyed it, maybe watch some of the others, otherwise, if you find it boring, just go straight to HPMOR.
