Don't get too familiar though, there's a point where knowledge of canon gets good enough you just start to see all the flaws it does, which makes it looks even worse and more annoying. It's part of my problem, I know HP canon sufficiently well a lot of changes that some people wouldn't care about leap out at me which makes the whole thing appear worse, particularly as it progresses they basically just start rewriting all the rules to better push their specific views of rationality as the true way. Even early bad tropes rear their heads, but ones that are completely missable with low or medium knowledge of the series.
