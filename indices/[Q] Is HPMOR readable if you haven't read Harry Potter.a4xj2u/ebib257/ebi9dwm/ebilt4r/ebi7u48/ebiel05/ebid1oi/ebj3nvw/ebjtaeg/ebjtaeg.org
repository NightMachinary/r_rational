#+begin_quote
  Worm was written before HPMoR was finished.
#+end_quote

I mean, it was /started/ like a year and a half after HPMOR was started. The first 80 chapters of HPMOR had already been released at that point, for reference.

#+begin_quote
  Labeled or self-labeled?
#+end_quote

/Probably/ self-labeled? Watching this subreddit for the last year or two, it seems like not everyone agrees on which works are or aren't considered "rational fiction," I remember noticing more than once in that period of time when a minor controversy would come up, with people disagreeing about a work that was currently being posted on a regular basis.

[[/u/LunarTulip][u/LunarTulip]] also responded to me about what I said there, and I'm bringing that over to this thread because if the conversation with them continues then it's going to continue as an argument about speed reading. If they want to chime in on /this/ conversation, I'm all ears.

What they said:

#+begin_quote
  There's plenty of rational fiction which was started by someone with no prior exposure to the rationalist community or its works, many instances of which were even written before HPMOR was started.
#+end_quote

I don't believe that many, if any, rat!fics have been written by people with literally zero exposure to the rationalist community. Some (maybe even /many/) writers were probably introduced to the idea via Worm or Luminosity or another fic which was inspired by HPMOR, and maybe they never read HPMOR before starting their own work, and perhaps still haven't. I seriously doubt that anything resembling a rat!fic was written before HPMOR, that's /the whole entire point/ of [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q79vYjHAE9KHcAjSs/rationalist-fiction][that post Yudkowsky made like 10 years ago]] wherein he only found two authors who'd done it before him.

#+begin_quote
  I agree that rational, and especially rationalist, fiction would be much rarer if not for HPMOR, but I think you're overstating your case when you say that none of the other ratfics would exist.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I probably /did/ overstate my case. I'm rewording it now to "I'm like 80% certain that at least 90% of the other works labeled "rational fiction" would've never been written were it not for HPMOR, and like 97% certain that at least 85% of the other works labeled "rational fiction" would've never been written were it not for HPMOR, and like 99.5% certain that at least 80% of the other works labeled "rational fiction" would've never been written were it not for HPMOR."
