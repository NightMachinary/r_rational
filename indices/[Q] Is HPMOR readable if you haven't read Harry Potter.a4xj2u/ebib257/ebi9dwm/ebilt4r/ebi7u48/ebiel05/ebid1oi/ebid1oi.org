It's worth reading if you enjoy rational fiction, regardless of whether or not you're a fan of Harry Potter. HPMOR spawned the genre. I'm like 90% certain that not a single one of the other works labeled "rational fiction" would've ever been written were it not for HPMOR.

You might want to at least read the first book, but don't watch the movie, that might imprint characterizations or performances too strongly in your head. At average reading speeds the book only takes like four or five hours to read, so it's a light snack compared to HPMOR which clocks in at around 40 hours (and I really would recommend handicapping your max reading speed to 250/300 wpm by subvocalizing, at least when reading a work of fiction for the first time, speed reading is for work; part of the pleasure of reading is chewing on the words in your head, and Yudkowsky really did do a better job than Rowling at writing sentences that "sound good").
