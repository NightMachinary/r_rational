My only problems with it so far is that it is incredibly dense and unfriendly to binge reading, and that all of the main characters are 11 years old, and I honestly have never met an 11 year old (or even some adults) as intelligent as these kids, if they were just a few years older, or the series spread over a few years... But it isn't and my suspension of disbelief is being stretched.
