I think you may be overgeneralizing from your own experiences, when you recommend deliberately capping one's reading speed. For my part, I find dwelling on any given sentence of a work of fiction for longer than necessary /actively unpleasant/, and have a much lower-than-baseline rate of finishing those books whose prose necessitates doing so (e.g. by having a high density of unusual words or by using particularly hard-to-follow sentence structures). It's not a hard-and-fast rule---sometimes a story is good enough to remain worth reading despite those considerations, or uses them in a deliberate artistic fashion that I enjoy (as with, for example, stream-of-consciousness narration)---but it's a pretty strong trend nonetheless.

None of this precludes enjoying good prose; I share your experience of enjoying HPMOR a lot more than canon HP on the micro-level enjoyment-of-sentences axis, and there are various other stories which I similarly enjoy on that level. I just appreciate the prose /as it flies by/ rather than pausing to dwell on it. I suspect that many people inclined towards speed-reading share my psychology in this regard.

(Also, on a more pedantic note: there's plenty of rational fiction which was started by someone with no prior exposure to the rationalist community or its works, many instances of which were even written before HPMOR was started; I agree that rational, and especially rationalist, fiction would be much /rarer/ if not for HPMOR, but I think you're overstating your case when you say that /none/ of the other ratfics would exist.)
