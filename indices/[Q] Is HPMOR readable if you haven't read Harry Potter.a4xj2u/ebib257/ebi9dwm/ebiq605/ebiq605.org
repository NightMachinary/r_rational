HPMOR is, at least to some extent, fanfiction of Harry Potter fanfiction, rather than fanfiction of Harry Potter. There are a few places where you can see that the writing was influenced more by other works of Harry Potter fanfic than the actual Harry Potter itself, and some of the commentary that any fanfic necessarily gives on the original is, here, commentary on other works of fanfic.
