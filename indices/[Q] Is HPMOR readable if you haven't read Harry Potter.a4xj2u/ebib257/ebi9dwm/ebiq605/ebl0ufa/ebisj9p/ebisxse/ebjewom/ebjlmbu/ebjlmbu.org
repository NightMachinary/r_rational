I'm going to assume you've read some fanfiction and can extrapolate what a given corpus of fanfiction is like from reading a Tvtropes page. You don't need to read any of the HP fanfiction, watch one of the movies, maybe five or six if you really want to get deep. HPMOR pointed me at a lot of fanfiction for things I hadn't watched or read, and eventually did watch or read. (E.G. I hadn't really watched Naruto more than any other non-shonen fan but I NOW do like it's rationalist fan-fiction; I think this is what got me to start Madoka, and I have a Pinkie-Pie and a Kyubei on top of my security monitor)
