Not any particular fanfics, though there are references to a lot of them. It's fanfic of the /entire genre/ of Harry Potter fanfic, or at least as much as the author had read (which I'm given to believe is a lot of them).

That is to say, any genre has its tropes, and any fanfic community will have its tropes, its fanon, its recurring characters, etc. (Blaise Zabini is one of the better-known examples.)
