I think possibly I may have introduced confusion by my use of 'speed-reading' in my post. To clarify: I'm not particularly interested in a binary distinction between speed-reading and slow careful reading; I'm interested in the gradient of faster versus slower reading and the curve of readers' utility as they move along that graph. So, to give a personal example: my default reading speed is about 320-400wpm, and if I'm reading anywhere in that space I'll probably be pretty happy with the speed. When a book's prose is sufficiently difficult that I need to go down to 300wpm to retain my usual level of absorption-of-the-material, it feels off to me. I can only think of a few works of prose fiction that I've needed to go down to 250wpm for, and my distinct recollection of those works is that I found the slow pace to be a slog actively detrimental to my reading experience.

So, sure, maybe reading at a slower speed improves comprehension. I have no quarrel with that point, and agree that the research is pretty definitive on the subject. But that point is also utterly tangential to the issue at hand, which is which reading speed will maximize a hypothetical reader's enjoyment of the work. If I were to deliberately slow my reading down to 250wpm, I'll grant that I'd probably pick up more detail on a per-sentence level, for the ten minutes I'd keep it up before giving up on the book in frustration at how slowly it's moving; but that's not a very strong argument in favor of going out of my way to read in that fashion when my goal is /enjoyment/ rather than ability to recite the book's contents in detail when quizzed.

In your original post, you made a comment to the effect that speed-reading is for work while slower reading is better for fun reading where your priority is to enjoy the work. But my experience is precisely the opposite: when I'm reading something due to an external obligation such as schoolwork, I'll read as slowly as it takes to absorb everything, in order to ensure that I retain whatever portion I need to fulfill the aforementioned obligation; but, when reading for fun, I can afford to deprioritize comprehension and prioritize /enjoyment/ instead, which means reading faster, maybe missing more details, and not taking six hours to get through a ninety-thousand-word book when I can do it in four.

More broadly, my point is that most people's hedonic sweet spots in terms of reading speed aren't necessarily going to line up with your own. You enjoy reading slowly and chewing on the individual words, and that's fine; I enjoy reading quickly and getting the higher per-second stimulation that results, at the cost of some degree of comprehension, and that's also fine; and I don't think you've presented much reason to think that I'm a bizarre psychological outlier in this regard. More likely there's a wide range of preferred reading speeds, with the two of us just sitting at different points on a larger bell curve; and my strong suspicion is that most people intuitively teach themselves to read at a speed reasonably close to the speed they enjoy most, such that if they deliberately intervene to slow their reading down it's going to move them /away/ from their optimal speed rather than towards it.
