  Some (maybe even many) writers were probably introduced to the idea via *Worm* or Luminosity *or another fic which was inspired by HPMOR*, and maybe they never read HPMOR before starting their own work, and perhaps still haven't.

Seriously reassess your assumptions; I'm fairly certain that Wildbow had never heard of HPMOR before Yudkowsky recommended Worm. He's neutral-to-negative on fanfiction as a concept and primarily thinks of Yudkowsky as "that guy who gave my reader base a big boost by recommending my work to his readers".
