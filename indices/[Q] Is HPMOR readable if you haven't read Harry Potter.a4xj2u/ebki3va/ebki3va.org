You could read it, but you'd maybe get 70% of the experience.

A lot of the humor in the fic, especially early on, comes from looking askew at just how ridiculous some parts can be of a fantasy universe created for children to be the most important actors (e.g. quidditch, the general uselessness of adults, etc.) Also the increasingly out of character ways some characters act after having been shaped by HPMOR Harry's actions. It's a parody, and reading a parody without know what's being parodied and where the author is actually being affectionate with their teasing of the setting instead of malicious and skewering is a bit like trying to join in the in-jokes of a group you're not a member of.

Harry also makes some mistakes -- BIG ones -- that aren't apparent unless you have the "meta" knowledge of who some people are and their actual motives that Harry himself does not possess. There's sort of a creeping sense of dread that comes at times from reading his interactions with certain characters you might not get if (like him) you don't know the consequences of what he's saying to them.

That said, all such things are revealed in time, and the story has more than enough notes of humor and dramatic tension that stand on their own to make the experience enjoyable.
