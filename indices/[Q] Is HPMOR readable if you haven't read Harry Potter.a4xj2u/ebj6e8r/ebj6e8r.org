It's a deconstructive work, so having some knowledge of the thing it deconstructs is going to enhance the experience a lot. Now it is of course relevant to say that EY didn't read the entire series, so you don't have to go overboard either. Also, HPMoR arguably deconstructs HP fanfiction moreso than HP itself, so eh.

If you're just there for the more preachy bits, what you might call the rationalist as opposed to rational aspects, you'll enjoy that fine regardless.

But honestly, just read the first book. It's short.
