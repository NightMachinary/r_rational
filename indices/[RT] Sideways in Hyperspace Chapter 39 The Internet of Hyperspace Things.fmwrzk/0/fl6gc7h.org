After a more than two year hiatus, Sideways in Hyperspace returns. For new readers, here is the [[https://sidewaysfiction.wordpress.com/2016/08/23/kicking-starward/][first chapter]], and here is the [[https://sidewaysfiction.wordpress.com/][index]]. Returning readers can find the previous chapter [[https://sidewaysfiction.wordpress.com/2017/12/17/the-island-of-misfit-toys/][here]].

I'm also in the process of re-editing my older chapters to improve grammar and remove errors. My goal is to have a product for y'all that's polished to a mirror shine.

I'd like to offer my sincere apologies to my readers for vanishing for so long. My life got very hectic for a while and I wasn't able to dedicate the time I needed to provide the level of content quality I strive for. I hope you can forgive me. As of this today, I'll be resuming weekly posting with Sideways In Hyperspace: Arc IV, Maginot Games. My buffer is well stocked and there's a lot of great stuff in the pipeline.

As always, if you like what you've read you can support me on [[https://www.patreon.com/Hivewired][patreon]] or vote for Sideways in Hyperspace on [[http://topwebfiction.com/vote.php?for=sideways-in-hyperspace][top web fiction]]. I also have a nonfiction blog where I talk about all sorts of things, you can find the link to that [[https://hivewired.wordpress.com/][here]].
