I like how universal the sentiment of Cat losing her entire army of superdrow somehow is. Like it's just so obvious she can't continue to have this.

Sve Noc kills them all/absorbs them or Diabolist just pulls a "my second personality wasn't under your control lol" and takes them for herself, maybe Sve Noc too who knows.

At this point I would be amazed if things work out even somewhat beneficially other than Cat really learning the Winter ropes. Hopefully Ivah lives no matter what, he's cool.
