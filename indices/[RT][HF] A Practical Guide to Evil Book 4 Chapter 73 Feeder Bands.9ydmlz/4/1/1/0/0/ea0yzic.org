That's theoretically possible but I just can't imagine Cat gaining assets as powerful as the Peerage and hundreds of Mighty without costs or weaknesses. It would create a huge imbalance of power within the narrative of the Crusade, so unless Good also gains a lot more power I think the drow are going to be nerfed before they join the wider story of Calernia.
