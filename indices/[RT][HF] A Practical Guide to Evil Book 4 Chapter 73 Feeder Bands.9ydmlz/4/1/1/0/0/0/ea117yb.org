All likely possibilities, though Cat is definitely opposed to the Dead King. She already petitioned for signatory status in the grand alliance. So she has the potential to manipulate that Story.

Methinks that whole power imbalance will only come into play once she actively declares war on the forces of Good. Remember there was no perpetual spike of power on the side of Good while the Dead King was gathering Named and consolidating his rule of Serenity and Keter all these eons.

From what we've witnessed is that Above and Below only ever react. When Black became too powerful, they crafted the White Knight specifically to be his executioner. When the Ashurans summoned their patron deity, Below answered by giving Warlock godhood for a minute or so. All of these conflicts were active in nature, whilst the Dead King is passive.

So I think so long as Cat does not get caught up in the Narrative of wanting to invade the Principate then there should be no reason why her army would get nerfed. If she afterwards follows Akua's advice and plants roots in Callow, undergoing apotheosis in truth, then she would gain the same benefits that the Dead King enjoyed Story wise. Namely that she's a god and so she's suppose to have a super strong army according to the Story.

Then she can pull an Anaxares and simply refuse to play the games of the Gods.
