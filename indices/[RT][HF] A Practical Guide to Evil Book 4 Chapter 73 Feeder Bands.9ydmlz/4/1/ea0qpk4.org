Nah, something will probably happen to either nerf them or change the use they're needed for to something that isn't suited but there's no way this ends with everything Cat did since the Battle of the Camps having no effect of the strategic situation. She left Callow to find an army, she's not going to end up without something to solve the problem of too many dead Callowans.

EDIT: I think I can see what will happen. I'm betting that the Drow will all lose their Night or have it drastically weakened after Sve Noc is defeated. That gives Cat her army without it being a big fuck you to Good that gets the hammer brought down on it.
