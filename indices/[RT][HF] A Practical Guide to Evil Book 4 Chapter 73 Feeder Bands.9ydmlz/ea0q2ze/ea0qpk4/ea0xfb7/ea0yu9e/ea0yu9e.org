This all depends on how Cat deals with Sve Noc.

"The essence of sorcery is usurpation."

Night has already been stated to have an affinity for Winter and Winter has been described as being unendingly ravenous. She also has the aid of a sorcerer that managed to create a thermodynamic engine that approaches 85% (at a conservative estimate) efficiency in real world terms.

It would not be out of left field for Cat to absorb the Night of Sve Noc into her domain, thus becoming the source of strength of the Drow in truth.

With Masego's aid, she could then in principle shove off her principle alienation onto ALL of the Drow which would mean she can finally bring Queen and King of fae level powers to bear. Something I expect she would seriously need in her fight against the Dead King.
