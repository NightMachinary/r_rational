This is true but having Cat's army nerfed to an extent where she can't beat her enemies would render this entire arc meaningless. Remember, Cat is the true protagonist of a Practical Guide to Evil and so far EE hasn't displayed the tendencies of grim dark writers that get their kicks from making the protagonist's efforts meaningless.

So I don't think EE will nerf her army; I'd think he'd just make the forces the Dead King can bring to bare more powerful. Not through Above inspired fisting, but merely revealing the Dead King was not left handed after all. That he managed to accumulate Revenants that are catered to dealing with large armies. And you know why this wouldn't be an asspull? Because he's a lower case god and the Final Evil so he SHOULD have those resources at his disposal.

TL;DR: It will not be an internal case of "can't have nice things" (cat's army gets nerfed) rather it will be an external case (the enemy is more powerful even with your army of Named and the Crusade also get a power up)
