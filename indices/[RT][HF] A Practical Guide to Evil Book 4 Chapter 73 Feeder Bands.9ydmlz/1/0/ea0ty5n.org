I'm going with Sve Noc somehow executing all Catherine's Drow at the end of the battle and taking their power. Ubua and Catherine somehow manage to extend their 'peerage' to the recently dead and create a pile of drow zombies, and let Cat use her powers without going completely mad at a level that lets her fight Sve Noc. Temporarily, anyway, because Cat Can't Have Nice Things Ever Fuck You.
