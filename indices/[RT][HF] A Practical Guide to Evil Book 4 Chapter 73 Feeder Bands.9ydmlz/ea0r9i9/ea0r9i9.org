Cat casually leading an army of a dozen Named, a hundred slightly-less-Named and forty thousand conscripts. Basically Malanza's crusader host, but with Drow instead of humans.

If Cat could have nice things, I would say that it's the first move of Dread Empress Victorious, bringing the Drow in the fold of the Dread Empire of Eastern Calernia. Cat can't have nice things though. And I have no idea where anything is going anymore.
