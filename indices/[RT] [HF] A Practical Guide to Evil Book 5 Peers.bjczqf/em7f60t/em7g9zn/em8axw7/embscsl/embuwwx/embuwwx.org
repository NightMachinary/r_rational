Well to start with perhaps the most obvious is his eyes, one rimmed red and one rimmed a verdant green that I think Black is the only character actually described has having. Cat notes he's remarkably short, though still taller than her. An uncommon trait for humans, yet one Black also has.

Cat describes his Lower Miezian as smooth and accentless, which she also interprets Black's as. This is especially incongruent as a Named from a foreign land would almost surely have some sort of regional accent Cat would find unfamiliar.

Most glaringly though, is this line which seems exactly something Black would say, even calling back to his famous speech at the Field of Streges. (emphasis here mine)
