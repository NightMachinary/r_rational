Ok, now that would be an interesting twist. The rogue sorcerer had so much less weight in his character compared to the other ones in the party that I was just considering him a redshirt. That would die at some point to mark danger, to the surprise of no one. Probably to be replaced by some other wizardlike character, like Masego or Akua.
