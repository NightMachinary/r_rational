I love how ill-fitting Black is to the world he's in. He takes to it like fish to water, but it's just a delight to see him sneer at what the Pilgrim has devoted his life to. The monologue Black gave to Cat way back when he was talking about his motivations is still probably my favorite moment in the entire series.
