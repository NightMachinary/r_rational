This is a powerset for a character who exists in superheroic universe. Their goal is basic superheroics, save people, stop criminals, whatever.

They see the world in black & white, except for one person at any given time. This person, their 'Muse', shows up in full color.

It is not obvious to the person that they are the Muse, the specialness lives in the character's eye, not out in the world. The Muse has no particular idea that anything unusual is up.

The Muse shifts unpredictably, and rarely back to the same person again. (That is, different people stand out over time, the power picks according to eldritch and unknowable criteria). It does so when the character senses people, so the Muse is always either someone they remember or someone they are currently perceiving.

The character has no superpowers when they are acting in a way unconnected to the Muse.

They have low level superpowers (Captain America strength/tough) when they are acting on behalf of the Muse, personify the power as an eye rolling DM in terms of how far it lets you stretch this criteria.

They have high level superpowers (Superman strength/tough) when they are acting on the direct orders of the Muse, but they are utterly unable to disobey those orders.

The orders of a previous Muse cease to be controlling and cease to give powers when the designation shifts.

In terms of basic munchkinning, how do you think this person would try and go about their business? What are some precautions/practices that they should adopt? Should they make their powerset known to the world at large, or try and conceal the specifics of how it operates, etc?

Another thing I'm curious about, though, call it Author-Munchkinning, can you think of any interesting complications or arcs to give this character?
