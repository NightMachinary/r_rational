Let's say I live in city X, and don't travel much.

The Muse is (virtually always) going to be someone in City X. Therefore, maintaining the peace and stability of City X maintains the peace and stability of the Muse, no matter who it is at any given moment.

I therefore put on a costume and designate myself "Captain X, protector of City X!" I have access to low-level superpowers as long as I use them to protect the city as a whole (by keeping crime rates down) and thus protect the Muse.

In a truly dangerous situation, I just have to hope that the Muse is one of the people yelling "HELP ME!" - because then I can bring a completely unexpected Superman-level smackdown on the Villain Of The Week.

--------------

I tell my secret only to a few people, close to me and highly trusted. Preferably only /after/ they've been the Muse at least once, since repeats are rare. However, there must be a few, in case someone figures it out, becomes the Muse, and controls me for their own agenda (and it's not like mind control is unknown to superheroes).

--------------

Complications:

- The current Muse moves to a different city
- The current supervillain /becomes/ the Muse mid-battle
- A threat approaches that threatens an entire continent and all superheroes need to team up to hold it back. Problem is, the continent under threat isn't the one the Muse is on...
- The Muse dies unexpectedly, and a new Muse is not immediately selected
