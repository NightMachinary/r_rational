You are an intelligent and particularly resourceful [[https://goose.game/][goose]]. Ending spoilers ahead.

You like shiny things, and the nearby town has a [[https://www.agoxen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Untitled-Goose-Game-Walkthrough-05.jpg][golden bell]] in a set location that is regularly replaced when you steal it. The humans in the town are very predictable (and a bit silly) so your intelligence makes it easy for you to give them the walk-around and regularly steal their precious bell.

Problem: In the game, the goose stores all their bells in what [[https://i.imgur.com/ur3nuPb.png][looks like a ditch]] just outside of town. Unfortunately, you are a goose, and geese are not really known for their ability to defend a position. Eventually the humans will find your ditch and take the bells back. How would you go about defending, hiding or protecting your bell horde?

*Details:*

- We will assume that you have human-level intelligence, despite being a goose.
- In the game, the humans behave extremely predictably, due to the shocking lack of GAI included in modern video games. We'll assume that they have human intelligence as well, though they have their own lives and probably aren't dedicated to 24/7 goose-hunting.
- You have the life experiences of a goose, and therefore aren't able to read, write, or honk the fibonacci sequence.

Bonus objective: Get more bells, without calling the collective wrath of humanity down on your fluffy goose head.
