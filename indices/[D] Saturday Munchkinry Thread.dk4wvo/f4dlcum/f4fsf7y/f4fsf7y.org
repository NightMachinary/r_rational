  You want to defeat them. If death just causes a revert--how?
#+end_quote

Standard anti-voldemort protocol: If the body is impervious to death, attack the mind. Hard to be more specific without knowing what resources we available, though.

- If we have access to memory wiping powers, the obvious thing to do is just pull an HPMOR and wipe the entirety of the time traveller's memory.

- Putting the time traveler into a coma is another option if you can do it without triggering the reload.

- If both of those are off the table, things get a lot darker and a lot messier. One thing to try is to capture the time traveller, keep them drugged up to the gills and hope that this prevents them from activating the reload. If so, investigate what kind of drugs you can inject them with that cause persistent changes to their personality, preferably making them more susceptible to depression or more anxious or anything else that makes them less effective as a person. If the reload preserves changes in the subjects personality (which it should), these changes will carry over to the next loop and make the time traveller progressively easier to defeat with each iteration.

- If that is also out of reach, you could go for social manipulation. Get as close as you can to them while simultaneously alienating them from their friends and loved ones, then figure out what their buttons are and subtlety steer them into darker and darker places. Convince them that their abilities are a curse, that nothing has meaning if you are stuck in a time loop, that no matter what they do they will eventually die and everything will start over again. Try to convince them to find a way out of the time loop, either by figuring out a way to break the mechanism itself or by continuously moving their save point further and further forward (this doesn't actually break the time loop, but if you can convince them to do it, it is a major victory for you).

All of this should be considered a last resort, obviously. If you can find a way to work together with the time traveller to achieve your goals (whatever they are), that is far, far better.
