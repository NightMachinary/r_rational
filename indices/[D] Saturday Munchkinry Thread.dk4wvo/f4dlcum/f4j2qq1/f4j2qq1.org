  You want to discover they are a time traveler much earlier in the timeline. How can you manipulate them into revealing their abilities to you in the past? Can you do it without them knowing you know?

To get the first part (having them do something different in the past), you'll obviously have to engineer present circumstances so that they are essentially forced to revert, preferably in such a way so that they change their actions in the past to head off an undesirable future. Most likely, you'd want to aim for some kind of relatively slow and unpleasant death, like radiation poisoning.

Next, you'd need to convince them that some action involving you will be required to prevent that slow and unpleasant death. Preferably, you'll want to make them think they need your help so they don't try to just kill you to fix whatever the problem is. Alternatively, if you can't do that, but there's some point the last five years where you would have been perfectly prepared to rapidly knock out an unwary time traveler, you could try tricking them into thinking that that would be your most vulnerable moment in the last five years.

Even so, subduing them can only last so long. Eventually, they'll wake up and revert, or they'll die and revert. Either way, it's unavoidable. The timeline can never really advance as long as they have that power. Your only hope of stopping them is to figure out how to stop that power.
