A challenge.

You know someone who can travel through time. It is as though they can reload from save points earlier in their lives. You've determined a few things:

1 : When they reload, the rest of the universe is rewound and anything that happened after the reload is undone.

2 : They reload on death automatically.

3 : They have only one save point, five years ago. They could move it forward but you know they don't want to. If they wait twenty more years, they could still revert to that one point.

You want to discover they are a time traveler much earlier in the timeline. How can you manipulate them into revealing their abilities to you in the past? Can you do it without them knowing you know?

You want to defeat them. If death just causes a revert--how?

Bonus question: how would you discover these things about their powers in the first place?
