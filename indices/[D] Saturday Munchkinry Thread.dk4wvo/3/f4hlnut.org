Challenge scenario, because I just saw the new movie.

You've just moved into a new neighborhood, and the house you bought was surprisingly inexpensive. Then you discover the reason: your neighbors are The Addams Family. They're filthy rich, are capable of Mad Science, and are happy to meet their new neighbor, but they're, well, The Addams Family and don't understand non-Addamses very well.

Being a self-respecting Munchkin, you're determined to exploit the situation to the fullest. What do you do, and how do you do it?
