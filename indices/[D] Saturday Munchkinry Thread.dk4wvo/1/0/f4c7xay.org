If the muse ordered the cape to view them as their muse forever would that work?

What if the muse orders them to do something they aren't physically capable of, like teleporting?

What would happen if the muse ordered them to kill themselves, would they be able to despite being super strong/tough due to acting in accordance with their muse's orders.

Is there anyone in the setting capable of causing temporary amnesia or something similar? If so, without being able to remember anyone, it'd be very easy to regulate who their next muse will be.

Story arc idea: The muse is someone in an abusive relationship, he tries to save them, maybe gets a bit too rough with the abuser and the muse tells them to stop, the cape freezes up and stops moving altogether, the muse figures out the rules from this (and some further testing), the muse turns out to be a shit person that orders them to do a bunch of shady and potentially traumatizing stuff.
