  You want to discover they are a time traveler much earlier in the timeline. How can you manipulate them into revealing their abilities to you in the past? Can you do it without them knowing you know?
#+end_quote

How did I find out in this timeline? Try to ensure that such a situation occurs sooner in the next timeline.

...I can think of ways to trick them into revealing their abilities once, but not to prevent them figuring out the trick, re-loading again, and not being so stupid as to fall for the same thing twice.

  You want to defeat them. If death just causes a revert--how?
#+end_quote

Freeze them in carbonite.
