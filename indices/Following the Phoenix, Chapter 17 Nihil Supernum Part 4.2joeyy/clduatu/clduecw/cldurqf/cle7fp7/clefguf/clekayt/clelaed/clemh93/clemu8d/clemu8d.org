Considering this is a community based on immorality I think my point that you are bias to view death being the biggest baddest is more than enough for people to start rationalising, so I disagree that my circlejerk comment is irrelevant.

As I've said repeatedly the whole function of a patronus involves ignoring thoughts you have, there is literally nothing better suited to not being instantly cancelled by a thought, also note it was at the same time for everyone meaning no one was distracted or had a slower thought process everyone instantly connected death and dementors in their mind. Considering all of these people have spent their lives ignoring the screaming of their family and friends dying to cast a patronus it's just so absurd to think that thought of death (would it work on a child who can't comprehend death, do these people really comprehend death if they aren't immortalists) is so special that it instantly evaporates years of hard cognitive dissonance
