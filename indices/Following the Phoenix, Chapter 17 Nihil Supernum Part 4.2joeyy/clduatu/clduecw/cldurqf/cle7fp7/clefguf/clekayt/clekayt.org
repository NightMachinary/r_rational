There's a large difference between thinking of death, having your worst memory be of death, versus knowing to specifically connect the dementor to death. The first two are things you can push out of your head by summoning a happy thought of life to banish the fear monster. Happy thoughts don't do shit against a /death monster/, unless they are a very specific, rare kind of happy thought.
