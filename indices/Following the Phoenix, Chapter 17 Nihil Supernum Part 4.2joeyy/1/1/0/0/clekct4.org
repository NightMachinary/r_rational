Ok, bad example. You're right it's muscle memory. But you know what I meant.

BTW - I've noticed that making "notes to myself" in head works for me lik 90% of the time, if I visualize myself geting the note in the future in proper circumstances, like "I will get a note that I should buy a tea when I will get out of bus after geting back from work today".
