Fix your grammar, your capitalization, your punctuation, and your spelling:

#+begin_quote
  Considering this is a community based on immor*t*ality I think my point that you are bias to view death being the biggest baddest is more than enough for people to start rationalising, so I disagree that my circlejerk comment is irrelevant.
#+end_quote

At least, I hope that was a spelling error.

Point being, speak coherently, or get removed.
