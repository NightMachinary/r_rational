  There's also the incredibly nonsense idea that no one has ever mentioned the word death in the entire history of all people using patronus ever, or thought about it (for example a lot of peoples worse memories will be of death which would mean they could never cast a patronus).

That's not necessary. If you are a historian, do you choose to point a loaded gun at your descendents, or do you lie? The idea of patronuses being death would be largely erased from history.

As for the last part, that would be true of some, but there are plenty of egocentric people for whom, well, the memory /features/ death, but what makes it their worst memory is simply that they feel bad.
