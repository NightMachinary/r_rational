  so being told that they are death stops you being able to do that, since deliberately distracting yourself is incredibly difficult

There is absolutely no way that distracting yourself from a thought is harder than distracting yourself FROM ACTUAL FEELINGS OF FEAR AND HORROR AND SCREAMS OF YOUR PARENTS DEATH, since all of those are also thoughts but + actual real physical effects.

There's also the incredibly nonsense idea that no one has ever mentioned the word death in the entire history of all people using patronus ever, or thought about it (for example a lot of peoples worse memories will be of death which would mean they could never cast a patronus).
