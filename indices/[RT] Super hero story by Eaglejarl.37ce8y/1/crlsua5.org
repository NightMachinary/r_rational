Oh. My. The horror. The horror.

Someone is mirroring my work without my permission. You terrible horrible no good very bad person, scold scold.

Well, since I can't stop you, I will say that I hope people enjoy the stories and feel a powerful desire to [[http://bit.do/books-dks][go out and buy them]], or get on the mailing list and receive all my future stuff for free, or get a [[http://bit.do/ku-free-trial][Kindle Unlimited]] account for $10 / month that will let you read my stuff and other people's at no extra charge and also pays us.

I will also comment that if you'd like a more memorable URL for the mailing list, it's [[http://bit.do/dks-list]].

Also, it's either "EagleJarl" or "eaglejarl". Both or none, please.
