I'm half way in and that isn't too bad of a description so far, 153 chapters in and the Taylor has yet to have a decisive victory, she usually comes out on top (if not in her own mind), but she always loses in some important way, and it's a way that was completely out of her control, so 'getting shit on' is a pretty apt description.

Don't get me wrong, I'm enjoying it, the Regent interlude with Shadowstalker is probably my favourite chapter, I don't think I have ever felt that mix of horror and catharsis in a single chapter.
