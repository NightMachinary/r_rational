I wouldn't particularly agree with that; if anything, Pact and Twig fit that description fairly well but Worm rarely seemed to go too badly for Taylor. It is an extremely long story with many arcs, so inevitably there are parts were things aren't going so well, but I still struggle to imagine how someone could come up with that impression.
