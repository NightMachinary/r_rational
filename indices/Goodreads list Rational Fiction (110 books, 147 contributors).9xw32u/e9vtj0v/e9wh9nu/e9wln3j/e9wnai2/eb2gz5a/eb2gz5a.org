Back after getting past arc 21 *spoilers for the ending* what you said really rings true, I reeeally like this book, but in arc 22 it just loses me, it is hard to root for a character who is so obviously doomed to fail, every single coin toss goes against her, she is just so great, but I can't watch her suffer for things not her fault. I could live with watching her suffer from her actions and choices, but no matter the foreshadowing and great reveal, a rampaging god is not her fault, and watching her face it just doesn't sound fun.
