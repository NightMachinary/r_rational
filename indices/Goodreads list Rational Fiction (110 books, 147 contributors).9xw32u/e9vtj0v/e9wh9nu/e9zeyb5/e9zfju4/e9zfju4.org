I like the worldbuilding the most out of all three Wildbow universes, particulary how it doesn't feel (to me) too much as fantasy but as a reasonably believable /what if?/ world, where instead of electricity, technology/research focused on biology thanks to having a supercharged genius (Wollostone) on the field. I liked characterization as well - was creeped out as all hell by Helen, pity and protective feelings for Jamie, etc.
