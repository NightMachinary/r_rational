I found the ranking in this list weird until I realized that it's the first big example of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting][approval voting]] that I've seen. That is a system which [[https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/aaron-hamlin-voting-reform/][some people advocate]] as a simple system which avoids strategic voting.

EDIT: Sorry I just read more and realised it's a mix of approval and ranked voting (click on the score of any book). But if most people are not aware of the ranking part (like me) and vote in a random order, then perhaps it acts more like a pure approval voting.

But is this true? If it wasn't, the books order wouldn't follow the number of people who voted for it, and vice versa. But it does, for 97/100 - so it's approval voting in practice.
