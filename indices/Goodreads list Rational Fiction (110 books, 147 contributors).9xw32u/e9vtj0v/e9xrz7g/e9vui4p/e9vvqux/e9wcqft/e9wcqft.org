I don't think it's a bad thing, but the utility of it is very specific. If you were making a list and ordering it, you would probably want to do it by "quality", and the approval voting list for a very large selection is only a weak proxy for that, on the assumption that the most well known will also be the most popular/good (a pretty suspect assumption).

One thing I'll note is that older works will tend to rank higher on such a list, because network effects and recommendation creep has had a longer time to work.
