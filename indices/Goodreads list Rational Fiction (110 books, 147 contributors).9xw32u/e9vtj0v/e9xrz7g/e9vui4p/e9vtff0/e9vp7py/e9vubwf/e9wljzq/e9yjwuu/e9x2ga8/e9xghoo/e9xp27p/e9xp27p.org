Just letting you know, while he went a bit crazy with the sex stuff in fanfiction, he made it only between characters of consensual age for his published works on Amazon.

The Daniel Black series and Perilous Waif are really good and I'd recommend them to this subreddit. Granted, there's quite a fair bit of sex, but I liked the books in spite of it.

In fact, he has a new book in the Daniel Black series, [[https://www.amazon.com/Thrall-Daniel-Black-Book-4-ebook/dp/B07JMNZ3TN][Thrall]], coming out December 1st.

EDIT - Actually, I can't remember if there were even any sex in Perilous Waif? All I can remember is some frank discussions about it, but no sex scenes.
