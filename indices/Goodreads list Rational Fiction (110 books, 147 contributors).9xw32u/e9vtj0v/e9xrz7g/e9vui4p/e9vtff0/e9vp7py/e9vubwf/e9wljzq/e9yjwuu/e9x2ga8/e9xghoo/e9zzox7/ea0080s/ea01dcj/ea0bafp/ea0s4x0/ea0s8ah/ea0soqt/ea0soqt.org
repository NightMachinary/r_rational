Interesting.

English is not my native language, as you probably guessed. Over here in The Netherlands we get quite a lot of formal English education, but I still probably leaned the majority of my vocabulary through osmosis, by simply reading a lot.

You have no idea how much if vexes me that I can apparently still get the meaning of a reasonably common English word wrong.
