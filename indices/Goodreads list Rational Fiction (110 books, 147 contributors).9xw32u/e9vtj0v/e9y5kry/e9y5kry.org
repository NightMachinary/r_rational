If you're interested in literary analysis, I can recommend the [[http://www.doofmedia.com/weve-got-worm/][We've Got Worm]] podcast (Reddit threads [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/search?q=we%27ve+got+worm+author%3Amoridinamael&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all&count=25&after=t3_6pocxt][here]]).

It's two authors, one of which hasn't read Worm yet, discussing the serial arc by arc. They are really good at noticing lots of subtle details, foreshadowing, and characterizations that I completely missed (partly because I read mostly between 11pm and 2am...).\\
It's really made me apprechiate Worm even more.
