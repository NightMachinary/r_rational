For a book to be banned, I say, it must be clear that it has no redeeming value. And this may only be ascertained by reading the whole of it. (The same may not be said of series - reading Lord of the rings may be depressing or difficult, but the whole of the Twilight trilogy is setting the bar too high.*)

*Counterexamples are welcome.
