I looked it up. Turns out I was wrong and she's officially 13 in the story. Younger then I expected, but still not 'pre teen'.

The problem with stories is that in a story age is literally just a number. I'd argue that the main characters in Time Braid consistently think and act like adults. That is also how they are treated by everyone around them. Nevermind the sex, they are literally sent on life-or-death missions by their superiors.

Given that it is very weird that the author gives her age as 13. Especially since she spends most of the story in an older body, and is also chronologically much older after a few iterations of the time loop. So I'm not sure why he uses that starting age.

It is weird. I can see where you are coming from with your objections. Though you still overstate your case. There are no preteens, and like I said, after the first few chapters she's chronologically an adult and also usually in an adult body.

/edited/ because I was apparently wrong about the meaning of the word preteen.
