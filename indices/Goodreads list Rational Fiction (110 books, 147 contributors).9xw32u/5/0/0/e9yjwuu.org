  It's really good for presenting pedophilia and sexualizing pre-teens as normal

The really surprising thing is that he's so good at writing it as normal that when I read it the first time, I completely missed that it was happening between pre-teens. Sakura really comes off as an adult so I keep unconsciously imagining her (and the people around her) doing everything in the story in an teenage to adult body. It wasn't until the second reread that I actually noticed that the age of her body was in reality 12 instead of 18 or up. It took me watching a Naruto episode before rereading Time Braid for me to realize that the characters are 12 during the chunnin exams.

Total mind screw when I realized this.

Other than that disturbing detail, it's still an amazingly well-written piece of work.
