OP Here. I'll admit Wastelands gave me a lot of inspiration. I'd just finished reading it, and I loved the idea. I knew I had drawn heavily on his ideas but I didn't realize that I was basically plagiarizing him. I looked over what I had written and realized a lot of what I had already written was very similar to the first few chapters of wastelands. I was not aiming to do that. I wanted to use a few of his ideas, but not copy his plot outright. I'm probably going to take this down and heavily re-write it.
