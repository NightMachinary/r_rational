This sentence is very hard to parse without the missing comma:

#+begin_quote
  But he had seen through her edging towards her wand, and seemed much better at intuiting intent than she was now that he wasn't as overconfident - certainly better than she was at deceiving in the first place.
#+end_quote

Another sentence got split into two:

#+begin_quote
  â€œShe did manage, sort of, to defeat a rat in magical combat, though that is only slightly more impressive than it sounds, considering. She could have just told me about it
#+end_quote
