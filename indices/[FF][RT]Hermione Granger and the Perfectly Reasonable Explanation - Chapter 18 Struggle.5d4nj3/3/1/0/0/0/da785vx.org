#+begin_quote
  If you do not read attentively, you might try parsing "she was now" at the beginning of a proposition, and fail to grasp the structure of the sentence. Since the sentence itself is unusually complex, it was enough to confuse me.
#+end_quote

Gotcha. I threw a hyphen in there instead, I think it makes more sense anyway with "now that he wasn't as overconfident" as an offset qualifier.

Thanks!
