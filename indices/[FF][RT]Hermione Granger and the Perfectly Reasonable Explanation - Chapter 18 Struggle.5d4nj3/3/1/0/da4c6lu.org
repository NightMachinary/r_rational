Where were you expecting a comma? Between "was" and "now"?

The second one is as intended. A trailing ", considering." would be read the same as ", all told.", ", all things considered.", etc., it's the informal adverbial use. Dumbledore might not use it in normal speech, but it seemed apt for flippant dream-Dumbledore.
