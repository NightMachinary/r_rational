I think they're talking about OH's concern (noted in Tempus Torqueri pt 1) that she had somehow made a Horcrux out of YH's copy of /Hogwart's, a History/ at the start of the whole misadventure.

As for the other concern - it's a dream. I'm not saying there's /nothing/ meaningful in it (what would the point of including it be, otherwise?) but as far as Hermione is concerned, how seriously one takes dreams is a matter of personal preference. I suppose in a world where magic, possession and prophecy are /actual factors/, it's a lot harder to dismiss them entirely, but it /was/ very silly...
