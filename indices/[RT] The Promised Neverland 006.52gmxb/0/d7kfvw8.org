Well, it's pretty much confirmed that the Mamas (and Papas?) are selected from top-scoring kids.

I'm going to make another guess and say that they're also chosen based on sociopathic factors, or anything that makes them value their own lives over their kids.

Cause really, raising kids over years, acting as a parental figure to them, and sending them off the be killed and eaten, all while staying constantly on guard and vigilant? You really can't do that unless you view the kids as less than human.
