I don't really like the writing of the characters. It might be due to the translation, but I suspect it comes from the set of assumptions the author makes, and how they show in the dialogues.

They feel more like people around a table roleplaying little kids in a Truman Show, than actual little kids in a Truman Show. "Now that I think about it we don't even know a thing about where in the world we are right now!" struck me as really weird and unrealistic.
