  "rationalist" (has anyone ever codified that term as meaning something other than "enthusiastic LessWrong user"?)
#+end_quote

LessWrong users (enthused or otherwise) are nominal rationalists, like churchgoers are nominally spiritual, or people who work in a University's science department are nominal scientists. (Nominal, because a good lot of the folks in any community are just there for the culture, not the ideas. See [[http://www.gwern.net/Terrorism%20is%20not%20about%20Terror][Terrorism is Not About Terror]] for another example.)

On the other hand, you can find people practicing any of those things (rationality, spiritualism, science) without even knowing that what they're doing has a name. You don't have to know what science is to make evidence-based decisions. And you don't have to know that there's a rationalism "movement" to set about debiasing yourself.

Just as there are "street-fighting" martial artists who would never think to consider themselves "martial aritsts", there are "street-fighting" rationalists who would raise an eyebrow at being called such.
