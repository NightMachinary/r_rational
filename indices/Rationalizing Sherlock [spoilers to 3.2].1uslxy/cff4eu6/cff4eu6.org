Rework it all. None of it's rational. Particularly tone down the grandstanding and fix Moffat's addiction to needless stakes-raising and set-pieces ([[#s][C.A. Magnusson climax]]? Stupid in every sense). But keep the cuteness and banter lots of banter yes please.

I feel John holds the idiot ball in places, especially in S3 when caught between Sherlock and Mary. He could be more Badass Normal; he gets damselled a bit much for my liking, considering his army training. Would suggest getting ideas from Elementary for possible alternatives for John's character development (obviously not just stealing their plot, but I do like how they branch out their Watson and set things off in interestingly different ways from the books' direction). I also feel Mycroft's intelligence is more informed than shown. The brothers banter, which is cute, but Sherlock seems to put one over on him a bit much.

And cut out the misogyny and completely rework Irene Adler, please. :) She's one of my fave badass women in literature and turning her into a [[#s][sex worker]] was not a thing I liked, to put it mildly. (Didn't 100% like Elementary's take either but it was definitely refreshingly different!)
