Sorry, it wasn't /intended/ as an /ideological rebuttal/, just as a first reaction.

For an ideological rebuttal, I would say: she (and her writing actually did come across as masculine, so I apologize for that) seems to have picked up enough wisdom to hit nihilism, but not yet [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Existentialism][climbed out of the valley to existentialism]]. It's the moral version of the Valley of Bad Rationality, and I find it surprising coming from a "rationalist" (has anyone ever codified that term as meaning something other than "enthusiastic LessWrong user"?), given that the Enlightenment points out we do actually have power in the world and thus /can/ realize our dreams and values -- once we acknowledge to ourselves what they are!
