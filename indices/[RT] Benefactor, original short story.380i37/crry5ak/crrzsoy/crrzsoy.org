I write quite a bit. I'll provide one link to my 'About the Author' page on my current project. It has links to other things. [[https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/author-info/][Set In Stone: Follower]]

That being said, most of what I write is not rational, though my current book project is.

Warning - Set In Stone: Follower (my current project) is a serial webfiction and is not complete. The rest of the stories on my about page are complete.

I have not yet gotten around to cleaning up my oldest stories - the writing quality isn't quite as good in my older works, but it's not terrible either.
