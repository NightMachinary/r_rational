This story is amazing with a very Arthur C. Clarke vibe to it. I actually teared up a little at the end when I considered what the benefcator had given up to protect homosapiens.

I do not mean to imply that the work is derivative, but it has strong echoes of Larry Niven's 'Protector' and Robert Metzger's 'Picoverse' both of which are amazing reads.
