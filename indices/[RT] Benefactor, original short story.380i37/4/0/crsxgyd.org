I just wish I had some sort of clue how to get an 'in' into the writing market. I've been doing web serial stuff, which is 100% solo. I'm leery of the agent/publisher thing because I have zero experience with it. Benefactor was actually turned down with no explanation as to why from one anthology editor. I knew it was good, and I'm glad many of you agree with my belief :)

I may just stick to self-publishing after this. It was my original plan, but one doesn't learn without trying new things. Unfortunately what I learned was that editors can be damn opaque, and rejection for no given reason is both horribly annoying and painful to the ego.
