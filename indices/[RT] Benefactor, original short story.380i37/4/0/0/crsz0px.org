If it is any consolation my experience with the magazine publishing world has been the same as yours. Although you are a better writer than I currently am.

Rather than go through years of rejection as many traditional authors have done, I have decided to keep writing off line and intend to put it up (for free) on Smashwords or Amazon when I have a novella in decent shape. What works for you may be different. Have you considered going on Patreon assuming you can commit to a web serial schedule ?
