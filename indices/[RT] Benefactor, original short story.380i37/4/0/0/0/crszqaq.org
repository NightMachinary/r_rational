I don't do schedules well :) I am fairly established as a serial webfiction writer though. The people that have been reading me for a while know I can be irregular. I have written 20k words in a day, and gone two or three weeks between chapters. I have yet to accept any income for my work. I figure that my best route will be to serially publish online, then distribute E-books. That will give people a method to donate to me (by buying e-books) and a way for people who don't know anything about me to find me (through E-books)

I might, one day, try to go the typical route to publishing, but that's for the future.
