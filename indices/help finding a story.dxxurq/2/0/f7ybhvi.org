Sounds like a similar concept, but probably not what OP is looking for. Paul never sets up a flowchart for his actions; at most he meditates and repeats each level of the hierarchy. He also doesn't seem too worried about losing his morality, but rather his sanity (at least so far from what I've read; just started it last week and the fic is fantastic so far).
