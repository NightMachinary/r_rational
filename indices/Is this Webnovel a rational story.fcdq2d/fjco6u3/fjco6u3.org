I like main character's traits. She is ruthless and rational in a dog eat dog world on the other side loves and trusts her friends, have a bottom line with a little sense of justice. But other characters are there just to be there, they have little personality and impact. I still don't understand why she is sticking with them. Story is predictable if summarized MC just steamrolls everything while carrying her teammates. This novel is still a good read to pass time.
