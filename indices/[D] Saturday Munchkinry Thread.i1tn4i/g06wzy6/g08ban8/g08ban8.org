What counts as "personally"? If a horse has already been maimed or crippled, does that count, and/or do I only get the powers of a crippled horse?

Do I get the values of an /average/ member of the species, or of that particular one? If the latter, given the finite number of megafauna species, I might want to steward my choice of meals.

What happens if the creature rots before I eat it?

A quick plan for Earth: A variety of plants and fungi for essentially-free upgrades, followed by sessile animals (Hopefully "grind up the shell and make smoothies" counts) and then some smaller chordata. As a quick power boost, kill and eat venomous snakes while a buddy holds antivenom nearby; that should give a enough of an edge to get higher on the food chain.

Unfortunately, most larger mammals are endangered, even if I could eat them; Morality and the IUCN bar me from eating Tigers, unless I can somehow convince a zoo that choking a old Tiger to death before eating it counts as Euthanasia.
