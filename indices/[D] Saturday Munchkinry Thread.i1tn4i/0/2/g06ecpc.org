Local governments would be the most immediately impacted. All those wierd laws on the books which made sense at one point, but aren't getting enforced anymore? They're in force now. Police are obligated to faithfully carry out their duties to investigate every crime they become aware of, without discretion. However, the oath to serve and protect actually starts working, so as arrests skyrocket police brutality and use of excessive force plummets. This increases police mortality rates, but probably not above the rates of, like, garbage collectors, not to mention US Presidents. The court systems collapse under the sudden massive increase in cases until new judges can be sworn in. Many state bar associations have regulations allowing the attorney general to mandate any member of the bar to perform civil defender duties if the regular civil defender system comes under too much stress, so every lawyer in the state, government employee or not, suddenly /becomes/ a government employee until some kind of equilibrium is reached.

But honestly? I expect total collapse of all government systems inside a week. Our governments were not designed to handle fae-level oathkeeping, but around ordinary human weakness. Conflicting oaths absolutely exist, and such conflicts would be suddenly magically intractable. What happens to the people sworn to a government which suddenly does not exist to any useful degree?
