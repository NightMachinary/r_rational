Oaths of office for government office and employment suddenly are unbreakable vows, things-you-just-do if you hold such a position. The president of the US is trapped into the constraints of his inaugural oath, Queen Lizzy is bound by her coronation oath, legislators, judges, military members, anyone who works for the government and takes an oath of office as an official part of their position.

No one knows this to be the case unless and until it is deduced from behavior of public officials. It just comes into effect one day and the relevant people start acting accordingly.

Feel free to consider from the point of view of a holder of a particular office or the point of view of society etc.
