I think you are too optimistic, we have a lot of laws on the books we are perfectly happy not to enforce. On the upside these laws would get fixed rapidly, and inconsistently applied laws do disproportionately harm minorities. Depending on how intense the compulsion to enforce laws is you can get a lot of bad stuff.

For example:

Federal agents invade marijuana decriminalized States, arresting citizens and state government en mass. Federal agents would also be charging millions across the country for digital piracy violations. Someone also recently pointed out that deleting cookies from "x number of free article sites before a paywall" is in fact a violation of DMCA.

The entire Army gets sent to fortify the borders beyond any cost effective point.

The IRS would suddenly be targeting the poor much more for minor filing issues, they currently slip through the cracks due to volume and low reward/cost, as they make mistakes more often and are hurt by audits more than the accountants of the rich.

National park rangers are suddenly tasked with arresting huge numbers of tourists, and would shut down large numbers of national park profiting businesses.

Edit: I'm not sure how this would work depending on specific wording, but federal agencies have truly astronomical amounts of data about everyone's internet usage given freely by businesses and obtained through subterfuge. If you MUST enforce laws to the best of your ability then depending on the legal use of that information it gets used to profile and target people at the least or charge them immediately at the worst.
