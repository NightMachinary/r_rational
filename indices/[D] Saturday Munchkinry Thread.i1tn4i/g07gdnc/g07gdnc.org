Yet another children's book power to munchkin:

You are a wish fetcher, with the ability to grant others' wishes. There are several rules:

- You can't wish for something for yourself, or for other members of your household if it would directly benefit you. (So a car you could all drive or a game system for all of you, no. A bicycle or handheld game system for a sibling, yes.)
- You can't grant wishes that are directly about harming others.
- Wishes generally work by coincidence instead of direct supernatural intervention, so nothing like wishing up obvious superpowers for people.
- You can't bring back the dead or reverse aging, though you can heal all sorts of sickness.
- To grant a wish, you must whistle down starlight and catch it in a container of some sort, then use the liquid starlight in a ritual of some sort. The more people you want to grant wishes for, the more starlight you need.
