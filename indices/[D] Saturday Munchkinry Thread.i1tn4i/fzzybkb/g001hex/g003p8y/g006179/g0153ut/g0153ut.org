I think you've missed a significant chunk of the impact of the faithful execution clause. For example, Article II section 3 of the US constitution says of the president:

#+begin_quote
  He shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; he may, on extraordinary occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in case of disagreement between them, with respect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper; he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers; *he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed*, and shall commission all the officers of the United States.
#+end_quote

This, in combination with faithful execution, means he can't intentionally allow for the failure or mismanagement of branches of the government which enforce and facilitate federal law, like the EPA, the IRS, the Federal Trade Commission, or the Department of Education. It doesn't necessarily require optimal enforcement, but it does prevent intentionally suboptimal enforcement.

All of that would be revolutionary. Suddenly, the FTC is breaking up monopolies like old times, the EPA is back in full swing, the Department of Education is functional again, and the IRS is suddenly auditing and taxing the wealthy along with the poor.
