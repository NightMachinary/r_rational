The more subjective aspects of the Oath might still give delusional people more wiggle room, unless the Oath actively actively sorts through the best range of legal interpretation and applies it novel ways...

Anyway, lets look at some Oaths:

For US president

#+begin_quote
  I do solemly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
#+end_quote

So the Oath doesn't actually directly prevent or bar much activity, the most is that "faithfully execute" implies that the President will avoid doing stuff that prevents faithfully executing the oath. But crimes that are sufficiently disconnected from the office and the constitution might still be allowable by the Oath. Also the oath requires the President to preserve/protect/defend the Constitution, but says nothing about the norms and precedents surrounding the constitution. Still, this is probably enough to curb some of the worst absolute worst excesses and violations, but a lot of the subtler stuff could still go through I think. (So not to get too political, but the Oath would only slightly get in the way of the most extreme Presidents, like Trump).

The Supreme Court Oath looks like it may have a clause that does some interesting things though:

#+begin_quote
  I, ______*/, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me as _/*_____ under the Constitution and laws of the United States; and that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.
#+end_quote

If the Oath takes a sufficiently literal interpretation of "administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich" that may actually force the supreme court judges to push policy changes to the entire legal system to correct some of the systemic issues, especially against the poor and disadvantaged. The Supreme Court gets to affirm, amend or overturn decisions made by lower courts and tribunals, so this Oath may drive them to actively chose cases that they can push through new precedents and rulings that will change some of the systemic issues in the U.S. justice system.
