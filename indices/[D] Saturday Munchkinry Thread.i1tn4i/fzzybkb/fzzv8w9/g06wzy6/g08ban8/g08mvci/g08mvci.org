  If a horse has already been maimed or crippled, does that count, and/or do I only get the powers of a crippled horse?

You get whatever the crippled horse had left in it. Only THAT particular horse, and only in a state it was before you started your work on it. If you killed a creatue and it rotted, you still can get a power boos from it, but also food poisoning.

plants and fungi do not count, only animals
