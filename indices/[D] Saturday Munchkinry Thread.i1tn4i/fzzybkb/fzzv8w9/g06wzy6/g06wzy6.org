*YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT* superpower.

Assume you exist in some kind of superhero universe (DC, Marvel, Worm etc).

Your superpower: you permanently gain the powers and abilities of the creatures you eat.

Rules:

1. You gain the strength, speed, endurance, and unique inborn abilities of the creatures you eat (this includes partial or full shapeshift into that creature if needed to use that ability. Size change is prohibited, but creature combinations are not).
2. gained abilities and stats stack on your own, but do not scale up. (Example, if you eat a cow you gain the cow's strength atop of your own, but if you eat an ant, you are not as strong as a human sized ant, but get a miniscule gain in strength atop of your normal human stat )
3. You must eat the whole creature, but does not have to be in one go. the power triggers only after you ate the whole thing though. (So, say, you can gain the strength of a cow only after many months of eating beef, and consuming the whole cow, hooves and horns included).
4. You do not get an increase in intelligence (too op) but do gain the instincts and additional modes of thinking from creatures sufficiently different from a human.
5. In order to consume the "Essence" of the creature you must kill it personally, using your own body or gained abilities, not tech, no outsourcing etc.
6. Only biological/inborn abilities can be gained (normal animals, mutants, mutates, born wizards etc ok. Cyborgs, learned wizards, not ok).
7. One type of creature only works once (ie: cannot just binge on chickens and become a god).

How do you munchkin it to godhood within your favoured universe?
