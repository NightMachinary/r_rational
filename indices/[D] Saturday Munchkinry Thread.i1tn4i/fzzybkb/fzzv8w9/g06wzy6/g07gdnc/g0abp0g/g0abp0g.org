If you ever die while your reflection is held by an object, you emerge unharmed from the reflection.\\
* The reflection must be of sufficient quality that it is immediately recognizable as 'you' and not just 'a human shape'.\\
* Cascading Reflections (Reflections of Reflections), will cause one of you to emerge from every existing reflection, so long as each reflection was of sufficient quality.

How do you use this to help yourself in the short term?\\
How does the world inevitably end in the long term?
