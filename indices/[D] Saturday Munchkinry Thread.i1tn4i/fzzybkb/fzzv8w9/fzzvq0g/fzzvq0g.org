And making a separate post with some initial munchkin ideas (because my main post was already long):

- The mental powers take the longest per person, but with the right setup and entad combos (similar to what they use in the Temple of silence) you can pack in people around meditating on it continuously.
- Mental powers also seem to be relatively rare in Aerb (they are rare in entads and only Contentment Passion Mages have access to similar power).
- Likewise, on Earth, only the telepathic/mind-reading powers accomplish an end result that is completely outside of what you could achieve with mundane means.
- Minor material manipulation and more some of the more precise telekinesis might synergize with the existing industry around the Athenaeum of Sound and Silence that uses vibration magic.
- The Athenaeum might offer a shorter program for those that attempt to only get one power that focus on the power with the most economic utility, and a longer program for those willing to roll the dice on multiple powers.
