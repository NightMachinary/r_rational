I was mentally working out some Worth the Candle meta Self-Insert scenarios and I came up with an original entad. It is similar to the Rod of Whispers in that it can permanently grant a unique magic. Similar to the Temple of Silence, it takes careful management of how people interact with it to get the most out of it. I give you the Mentalists Spoon.

The exact power granted by the spoon depends on how the would-be mage interacts with it. The spoon only grants power(s) once per person, but can grant 1-3 powers depending on the exact interaction the person uses. After being granted, the mage can gradually strengthen the power(s) with practice.

There are 3 basic ways of interacting with the spoon:

- Passively meditating on the spoon tends to result in telepathic/mind-reading/empathic/clairvoyant powers and occasionally psychometric or material analysis powers. The exact variant of meditation influences the exact power. The spoon needs to be undisturbed while the would-be mage focuses on it. With meditation practice ahead of time, it take around 24-36 hours (does not need to be continuous can be interrupted) worth of meditation while in the spoon's presence.
- Visualizing and focusing willpower on the spoon tends to result in various forms of telekinesis, occasionally minor space warping around object, occasionally metal liquefaction/melting or pyrokinesis. The exact variant of visualization influences the exact power. It generally takes around 4-6 hours of uninterrupted focus on the spoon to gain magic this way. At the end of this period of time, the power spontaneously manifests on/at the spoon all the spoon will automatically restore itself. The spoon does not need to be completely undisturbed, powers activating on it won't interrupt focus on it, but physically handling it will.
- Physically handling the spoon tends to result in a mix of a boost to dexterity, minor illusions, minor material manipulation/alteration of small objects, and rarely pseudo-Elf Luck. With practice ahead of time, physically bending spoons and performing sleight of hand with spoon it generally takes around 1-2 minutes to gain magic this way. Sleight of hand that doesn't appear to bend the spoon tends to result in more dexterity (and rarely Elf Luck), more physically bending the spoon (it resets after the power is granted) tends to result in more object manipulation, and sleight of hand focused on appearing to bend the spoon tends to result in more illusion focused power.

The exact power manifested varies with the exact variant of the method of interaction used, and there is an element of chance. Mixing variants tends to result in multiple powers that start out weaker and take longer to develop to full strength (1-2 years for a single power 3-4 years for 2-3 powers). Going for more powers also results in a bigger element of chance with the powers. To put some numbers on there is around a 90% chance of a particular variant of interaction matching to a particular power if it is a single power vs. 50-75% chance for 2 powers and only a 30-60% chance for 3 powers.

Some examples of exact powers and the variant interaction that tends to results in them:

- Periodically closing your eyes and visualizing the spoon while meditating passively on the spoon tends to result in visual clairvoyance (tens of feet initially up to hundreds of feet)

  - Focusing on the details of the spoon might make this clairvoyance more detailed focus but limit the overall area it can look at.
  - Focusing on the surrounding of the spoon might make the clairvoyance take a birds-eye view but be unable to zoom in.

- Focusing on the way the spoon reflects light results in mind reading of surface thoughts (only immediate surface thoughts, requires eye contact, induces a noticeable sensation in the person being read).
- The telekinesis tends to be overall weaker but more consistent than Passion Mage Telekinesis. A more relaxed focus/visualization of bending the spoon tends to result in smoother more controlled telekinesis. A more intense straining focus tends to result in stronger but cruder telekinesis.
- The illusions tends to be small, about spoon sized. They tend to work better when formed around small objects. Although some variants can also create them separately. They tend to be limited to arms length from the Mage.
- The minor material manipulation tends to be limited to smaller objects and includes cleaning, changing object shape, changing object color, and changes to object composition in minor ways (from one type of wood to another, from brass to bronze, from iron to steel).

In general for any power the spoon can grant there is a particular method of interaction that increases the odds you get that power.

So munchkin questions:

If you are the Athaneum of Sound and Silence and you possess this entad, how do you focus on exploiting it? (I.e. what percentage of time do you allow for the 3 overall interaction methods, given that they are mutually exclusive in time usage?)

Most economically valuable power in Aerb? (On Earth?)

Which magic would work best for canon Juniper?

Best overall way for Juniper's party to leverage this entad if they had it? (sell power granting, grant powers to allies, loan/lease to an Athenaeum, etc.)

Best synergy available for more conventional multimages (i.e. with normal learning rates and not Juniper level learning rates).

Which power would you go for in Aerb? On Earth?
