How exactly do these recursive reflections work? Like, let's say I die while two mirrors have my reflection, but not each other reflection, two of me would emerge, one from each mirror (I'm guessing). But let's say those mirrors are position in such a way that, not only they have my reflection, but they also have each other's reflections, resulting in one of those infinite reflection loops. How many of me would emerge then? Only two? Infinite? A number bigger than two, but not by much because each recursive reflection is less recognizable than the last?

My second question is, if more of one of me emerges from reflections do we have two minds as one would expect (essentially, we are clones) or are we a hive-mind? One shared consciousness between two minds?

Thirdly, what is the state of the emerged reflection? Let's say I get shot and die. Does my reflection emerge with the bullet wound still there or does it get cured? What if I die because of a brain tumor, or old age, or any other natural causes. If I lose an arm today and die tomorrow do I emerge with or without the arm? What If I get stabbed with a knife and die with the knife still in my body? Does my new self emerge with the knife still there? If not, is there a reason why the knife disappears while my clothes stay (or do the reflection emerge naked)? If the reflection does emerge with a knife on its back and subsequently die right there and then, wouldn't that mean I would be in a continuous loop of emerging and dying in front of the mirror? While that wouldn't be pleasant, it also breaks thermodynamics very easily so you could make a never-ending free energy supply that way. Actually, you could probably do that regardless.

Of course, given that the condition for the power activating is me dying I probably wouldn't use it, because how can I know if it's me that emerges from the mirror or a copy of me with my memories; the fact that two of you can emerge if there is more than one mirror present suggests the latter.
