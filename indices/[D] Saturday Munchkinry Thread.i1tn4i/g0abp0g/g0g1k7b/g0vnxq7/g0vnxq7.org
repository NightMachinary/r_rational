Your third option was the right one. The number of you that would emerge would be the number of recognizable reflections. Since perfect mirrors essentially don't exist, this can never actually be infinite, but could be quite large.

The Yous that emerge are entirely real and separate thinking beings. No loss of continuity of consciousness from their mutual memory of death. Think of it as a forking path where one life branches out into two (or more). They are not each other, but they both are the original you.

The state of emerged reflections is a strange duality that would only be discovered with experimentation. They possess memories right up to the point of emergence, but the physical condition of when the reflection was first formed. If you managed to hold a mirror on yourself in proper lighting for 1 year, then died, the you that emerged would be the same condition as the 1 Year ago You, but with current memories. This resets if the reflection is lost for even a fraction of a moment.\\

Even if it is a true death and only clones that live on, I would consider it my duty to die for the good perfect body replication could achieve. The advances that could be made in medicine alone would be phenomenal.
