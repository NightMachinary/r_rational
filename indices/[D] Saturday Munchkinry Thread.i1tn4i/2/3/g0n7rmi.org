I think the constrictor type snakes would be one of your easier to manage boosts and a good ROI. Anacondas, pythons, etc. high strength for a reasonable amount amount mass. And literally eat one of every insect and arachnid (etc.) you can. Free boosts are free boosts. Collectively, you would end up with some awesome innate chemistry abilities. Make smoothies out of crustaceans. Find small reptiles. I think lizards for at least partial limb regrowth ability would be worth it. Prioritize ever small animal that is ethical for you to eat first. Better to get all the “starter xp” instead of taking months and potentially missing some unknown amount of a larger creature. (Example: cooking meat can leave behind fat or burned pieces. What margin of error is allowed on consuming the “whole” animal? )
