The "swap the moment you enter one" is what I had in mid as problematic. Even on it's own, it's a delay and disadvantage, but more importantly you have to match all 3 axis at once, which might be much rarer especially if the ratio between your velocity along any of them is not a simple small integer.

My point with the millions of lightyears thing was that being this cheap, it'd be used in counterintuitive ways, especially if you had multiple ships, and it can't be traced. Most would revolve around having a base full of equipment much bulkier than the ship, and jumping back and forth. Example: you mentioned moving around minefields and railgun shots, but why fire those from the ship rather than from a building millions of lightyears away where it can be done much more cheaply and no ammo worries, if you're going to move it anyway? The problem of knowing the coordinates can be solved with courier ships bouncing back and forth every singe tick, reading the coordinates and transmiting them to other ships/bases on the oposite end.

Actually, why not have huge computer banks at home do all the hacking, with the ships themselves used only to collect data on coordinates and enforce mobile realtime zones? I can see combat turning out quite differently with mobile ships having limited use relative huge building complexes built wherever it is cheap and resources are accessible. There'd be a huge premium on stealth as well, given the number of planet-exploding hacks around. You are dead 1/10 of a second after your approximate location is discovered no matter what.

Guessing you might not want that, but you should come up with a good excuse preventing it.

Without any range restrictions, and stars being BIG, association with dangerous objects and phenomena needed doesn't actually seem it should limit military applications at all. Sort of like RPG summons, but of supernovas.

If I understood correctly, the reason you can't modify contents is due to them being huge and impossible to decipher, correct? That rules out MOST content edits, but finding an extremely small (infowise, probably due to homogeneity) natural sector and then doing pure trial and error on a few bits at a time should let you do SOME things.

BY delete I didn't mean as much removing the sector as overwriting it with vacuum.

Point about the reset. Hmm, could you exploit it the /other/ way around, doing a computation, transmitting the result far away, resetting, doing another computation at accelerated speed?
