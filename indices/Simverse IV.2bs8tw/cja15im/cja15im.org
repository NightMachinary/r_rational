How is the frame of reference determined? This works well but only under the assumption that you're not moving very fast relative to the grid, but if it's relative to earth that'll only be true near it, especially if it rotates with it as well. Also, even if your ship is smaller than a sector, if you are moving relative the coordinate system won't you still be spending much of the time overlapping edges and having to swap multiple sectors anyway?

It seems like, as long as there is some way to communicate updated coordinates, you can retreat back to base or some random place unknown to your opponent as easily s any nearby swap?

What happens of you swap to a /random/ coordinate, not know to correspond to anything?

It seems like it'd be eaier to use direct hack than conventional weaponry. Delete the sector your enemy is in entirely. Force them to reset back to an earlier state so that they'll repeat the same move which you now know before they notice. Swap a sector from the core of a star next to them, or containing an asteroid with absurd relative velocity. Have a nuke on your ship, duplicate and self-destruct. If you're more advanced, set the contents of a sector in the arena to a vast cube of plutonium as you swap away and watch it go instantly supercritical.
