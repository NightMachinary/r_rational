This is actually what got me to ask. I just blitzed the entire story in...24?...48?...very few hours. Really enjoyed it, and was sorry when it ran out.

Out of curiosity, do you have a reader-viewable timeline anywhere? I'm not clear on how long Juniper has been in-world, but I think it's only 2-3 weeks, even counting the downtime week they just had.
