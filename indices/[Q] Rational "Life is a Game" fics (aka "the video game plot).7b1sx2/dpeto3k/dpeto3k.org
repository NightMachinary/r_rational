I also second Log Horizon. One of the few anime titles the plot of which doesn't turn into a complete mess by the time it reaches the last several episodes.

There are also some asian webnovels that you ought to check out:

- [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/reincarnator/][/Reincarnator/]] --- “has some repeating tropes, but otherwise is well-written. Protag goes back in time to try saving humanity after a meta-verse merging event.” Unfortunately due to some translator scene drama it's temporarily unavailable.

  - [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-king-of-the-battlefield/][/King of the Battlefield/]] --- Except for the fact that it's a bit too similar to Reincarnator, it's a pretty decent read.

- [[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/ti-index/][/Terror Infinity/]] --- ”[...] is a Chinese web serial that is technically a multi-crossover fanfic. The premise of the story is how a random group of people are forced to travel from one horror \ action movie into another and try to survive each one. Among the universes the protag has to travel through are also those from the following franchises (spoilers): Resident Evil, Alien, Final Destination, Nightmare on Elm Street.”
- [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/life-mission/][/Life Mission/]] --- A virtual reality game called “Life” suddenly becomes real, transporting players to alternate dimensions (they don't know that at first), making it possible to buy items from game store and bring them into real world, enhance their body, etc. The monsters in the game are “mutants”, and the lore suggests that some virus outbreak turned all people into such mutants. Those who manage to not get infected got killed instead.
- [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/evolution-theory-of-the-hunter/][/Evolution Theory of the Hunter/]] --- Dungeons and skillbooks existing in real world; each person can only learn one skillbook.

All of these (except for maybe Log Horizon) have some penalties attached, for them to be called completely rational stories. But from all the currently available LitRPG stories that I've managed to find, these were the only ones that were more or less rational at all.
