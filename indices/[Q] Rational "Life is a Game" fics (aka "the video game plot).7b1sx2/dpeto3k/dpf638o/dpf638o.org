Thank you, that's a lot of recs.

I have had very mixed results with anime, but in this case I'm really looking more for reading than watching. Still, workout distractions are a necessity, so I'll definitely check out Log Horizon.

Reanimator's description sounds really good, so I hope it comes back. I read the first page of KotB and couldn't get past the clumsy translation, but I'm sure it's great in the original.

Evolution Theory of the Hunter has a premise that made me laugh happily. Very Nodwick, which is a good thing. The prologue was well done so I'm definitely going to keep going. Thanks very much.
