You listed some top ones already. Off the top of my head I can only think to add:

- I'm a Spider, So What (one of the legendary classics, start with the Blastron01 translation until it runs out, it bogs down after a while so don't feel obliged to keep reading)
- Evil God Average / Jashin Average, got me on the LN kick that led to GirlIntercorrupted
- [[/u/FeepingCreature]] would tell you to read The Erogamer, and I wouldn't dispute it. Tagline: "This is way more depth than I was expecting with my porn quest."

EDIT: Like The Gamer and TGWP, these are LitRPG rather than Video Game Plot.
