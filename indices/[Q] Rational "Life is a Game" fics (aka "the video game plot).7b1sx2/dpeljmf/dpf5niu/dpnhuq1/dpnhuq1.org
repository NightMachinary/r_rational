Perhaps not exactly what you're asking for in this thread (I haven't read any of the stories you've listed), but /Sufficiently Advanced Magic (Arcane Ascension Book 1)/ is a litrpg book that has been posted here before. It felt like /Azure Dreams/ for the Playstation, only with a cool crafting system and a well-developed world. I read it and found it pretty fairly rational and very enjoyable, in a junk-food/guilty-pleasure way.
