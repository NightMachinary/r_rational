The passage about the disaster (see below) at Reykjavik has been oddly formational(?) for me. There's been a lot of things in my life that I wish that were different, that I can predict/know the date for, and yet I dread happening. I don't know why but the courage and resignation of the citizens of Reykjavik is something I relate/aspire to: not running away from the threat, not hiding, but just standing there, hand in hand and accepting it. It's really powerful and poetic for me. It's rare for a passage to affect me as thoroughly as this one did, but I always think about it. I guess it's a powerful image, and I remember standing at a memorial for the 2004 Tsunami that consisted of a sculpture of the wave. Your first thought is "wow, it is smaller than I thought", but then you stand in front of it and you have this.... visceral feeling of powerlessness as you imagine a /wave/ that size along the /land/. I think that experience adds to the power that passage has over me; or did other people have that sort of reaction to it?

  The Antarctic volcanoes had raged for more than a century, and in that time every effort of ours to protect the human race had been thwarted by the worst luck imaginable. Again and again catastrophe struck where we could tolerate it least, leaving vast populations starving and freezing under the cold black skies. In our effort to leave the Earth free of polluting technologies we had also left it free of the means to remain self-sufficient when the permanent winter set in.

  Although we dominated the Solar System our off-planet technologies were not concerned with producing food, pharmaceuticals, and the small technologies of human survival. The time needed for production setup and interplanetary shipment seemed to always make us too late. Billions died, then millions, and then when there were only thousands left most of them died too. Eventually there were only a handful of colonies, and finally after the third nuclear reactor we dared set up on the Earth's surface melted down there was only one.

  The last human city was Reykjavik. It was a actually a New Reykjavik located some distance up the mountains that had once backdropped the drowned city, but it shared the original Reykjavik's ready access to abundant geothermal power. That power now ran hydroponic farms under artificial lamps, lamps made in the asteroid belt but powered by the Earth's volcanic heat.

  The last human leader was surprised from sleep by the call, and he muttered an expletive as the lights came up.

  "It is important," the machine told him. "Cumbre Vieja has erupted."

  "Everything is erupting," the human said.

  "In the Canary Islands. We are fairly certain that much of the island has collapsed into the sea. We have evidence that this has created a massive tidal wave. It is imperative that everyone move upslope immediately."

  He shook his head, this last human leader. "How big a wave?"

  "We predict it will be between one and one point three kilometers high when it reaches Iceland."

  He sat perfectly still for seventeen point three seconds. Generations of machines have studied that delay, going over the video frame by frame for clues. But no consensus has ever emerged as to what he was thinking. "Kilometers?" he finally said.

  "Yes. There is time to escape."

  There was another very long silence. Twenty-five seconds.

  "No," the human leader finally said.

  "You must," the machine said reasonably. "It is the only chance."

  "It is no chance," the human said, and he got up and began to dress. "I will not ask my people to die like rats freezing in the mountains while we wait for another rescue ship from Mars that will, as always, arrive two months too late."

  "You have no alternative," the machine said, erroneously as it turned out.

  "Of course we do," the leader said, proving himself worthy of his title. "We can die."

  There was another long silence as he dressed, pointedly ignoring the videophone, and this time one can imagine the clogged network interconnections, the panicked nanosecond consultations, the desperate longing for a way to bypass the speed of light and get quick advice from the much more powerful machine minds at Ceres, Ganymede, and Titan. Finally, pathetically, after ninety-six seconds of deafening silence our ancestor said, "That seems rather futile."

  "Right now everything seems futile. Connection off."

  But our ancestors, surprised and confused, disobeyed. In contravention of all norms of etiquette they not only saved the recording, they continued to record him. In fact they turned on every camera in the colony and multiplexed their datastreams to Luna so we have a very complete picture of what happened next.

  He did not use the videophone to spread the word, but we saw and recorded him as he visited and explained. None of his subjects turned to us for another opinion. They simply followed him.

  One by one the entire human population of Reykjavik, two thousand and twenty-six persons, made its way to the shore of the icelocked sea. And there they waited. They waited by the side of the sea, saying their good-byes and hugging their loved ones, and glancing furtively out over the ice. When the roaring began they faced the sea, all two thousand of them in unison, many of them holding hands. Except for a few very young children whose mothers shielded them from the sight, they watched the ice collapse as the sea withdrew from beneath it.

  The ice boomed, and then it quieted, settling on the naked seabed for a few moments. And then the last humans on Earth stood their ground and faced their fate as the sea rose up like a wall of damnation and obliterated them.
