Setting aside that the main premise ("rare earth") has been well and truly debunked with extrasolar planets discovered in droves since the stories were published, do you think it holds up scientifically? Why/why not?

In particular, note that the original 4 stories don't contain any FTL, but the latter stories contain FTL comms with a very slow bitrate.
