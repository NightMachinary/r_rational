  I am under the impression that Cordyceps is also quite surreal, but I haven't managed to read it yet.

Cordyceps isn't so much surreal as it is terrifying.

It's certainly exploring some unusual themes, but it does so more in a psychological horror kind of way than the other two stories you mentioned.

Edit: I don't mean that as a strike against Cordyceps, btw. It's a great story and I do recommend reading it if you can find the time (it's not that long).
