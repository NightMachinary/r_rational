A both hilarious and horrifying adventure story, basically the author wakes up from cryo in a future after a bad singularity apparently originating from several contradictory wish fulfillment systems. For unclear reasons one of the many mad gods placed a bright pink bunny girl with an empty skull contoured for his brain. As it progresses the main character, the world and presumably the author go increasingly far off the deep end.

It never goes far enough to actually be removed from Sufficient Velocity but it got surprisingly far before a mod locked the thread and banned the author for a bit. read the mod post at the end first before deciding to dive into the trainwreck:

I didn't know what I was getting in to but I read it to the end anyway, it was hilarious.

That said it does have some creative points like the time the main character's bones sprouted and I like how it tries to set a ratfic in a setting so utterly hostile to reason.
