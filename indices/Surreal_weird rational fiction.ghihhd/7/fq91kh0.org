  I'm interested as to whether it is possible to have a work of fiction that is rational while being surreal and/or weird or trippy.

That's exactly what I was thinking on reading the title. How would you go reconciling the two? I suppose it's possible if the surreality is explained (there are certainly surreal things in real life, and LSD is still a thing, so why not?), but it would take some serious writing chops to keep the tone consistent throughout a story despite it having surrealism.

You might find something similar in first-contact stories with aliens being... alien.

I suppose I'll be back to see if there are decent answers to the question.
