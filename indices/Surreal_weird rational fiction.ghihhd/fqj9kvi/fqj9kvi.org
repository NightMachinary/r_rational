The works of Gilbert and Sullivan are fond of taking ridiculous premises to their logical conclusion. For example, in /Ruddigore/, the witch's curse requires that the Baronet of Ruddigore commit a horrible crime or die in horrible agony - which, at the end, the protagonist manages to work around by declaring that to deliberately fail to commit a horrible crime under the influence of the curse would be committing suicide, which is itself a horrible crime, rendering the curse completely harmless.
