Not homestuck- it's just hosted on the same website- but Problem Sleuth, a previous work by the same guy, this one more of a real Quest (not that you'd know). I really enjoyed it, and a lot of previously established rules show up later on: it's very fun.

It's also of a reasonable, if long, length, and the characters seem a lot less obnoxious than some of the ones in homestuck, one of the reasons I could never really get into it. I suppose I might read it one day, but I heard the ending wasn't that good; I don't know.

Problem Sleuth, though, is a great self-contained absurdist story with about 70 Chekov's guns and lots of sufficiently analysed magic. I whole-heartedly recommend it.
