  That's exactly what I was thinking on reading the title. How would you go reconciling the two?

I would say it's possible if the surreality is being /explored/: the surreal world has some consistent underlying laws, vastly different from ours, the characters learn about them and utilize them to their benefit. As an example of a world with different laws, Jacek Dukaj's /Other Songs/ comes to mind. It didn't leave an impression of being /rational/ for me, but its world is interesting and thought out.
