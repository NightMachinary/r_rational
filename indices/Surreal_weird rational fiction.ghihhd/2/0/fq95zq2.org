That is a good idea ... I do like Unsong, and there are awesome parts of it, and it can be pretty weird at times. Huh. I wonder what exactly makes it rational-adjacent, and what can be done to nudge it toward the rational direction (or the surreal direction, though I think it's possible to do it by adding more strange Bible/kabbalah stuff).
