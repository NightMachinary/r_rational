Stories in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism][absursist]] genre often portray surreal situations for the sake of exploring rational themes.

One good example of that is the Mars scene with Dr. Manhattan and Laurie in the graphic novel /Watchmen/. On the surface level, that scene looks like two people getting into an argument in a desolate, red wasteland that ends with one of them smashing a glass castle. Pretty weird, no?

But it's more than that:

The entire chapter explores the idea of what exactly makes humans so special. If we discard the selfish, anthropocentric arguments, then what's left to render sentient life inherently better than inanimate nature? One answer offered in that scene is that human beings are uniquely beautiful because of their faculty to create and perceive abstract meaning in a universe which inherently lacks it.

And thus it's fitting that the final panel of that chapter is an allusion to the so-called '[[https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap990315.html][Happy Face on Mars]]' that first came about when human beings saw a pattern in the shape of light and shadow on a distant planet.
