I mainly mentioned it as an example of the themes that absurdist fiction explores, though I'd argue that the pacing of events in that scene interspersed with the backwards-flashbacks renders a fairly surreal impression in the graphic novel.

Even without the broader context of the setting, the situation is presented as absurd:

A godlike entity goes to Mars to mope about how disconnected he feels from humanity. He teleports his ex there to have an 'I'm breaking up with you' talk, but almost kills her before remembering that she needs oxygen to breathe. His version of 'the talk' involves claiming that he now values inanimate rock formations more than human beings. Meanwhile, his ex (who cheated on him for the first time just a few scenes earlier) tries to make an argument in favor of humanity while having a mental breakdown over the realization of her true father's identity. The multiple chains of thought running through that chapter overlap, conflict wildly, and eventually derail. Against all probability, Laurie manages to persuade John to have faith in humanity despite, in the process, nearly losing all faith in her own judgement of human nature.

To me, /The Man in the High Castle/ falls into a similar category of surrealism because it explores how the human desire for meaning clashes with reality.

One of the main protagonists fetishises the culture of the conquering nation, and yet he makes his living by selling so-called "authentic" pieces of his own cultural history to those conquerors. Many of those pieces turn out to be fake, and yet he scorns the real handcrafted art made by his contemporaries until one of the conquerors deigns to see more meaning in it than he did. The entire plot from start to finish plays with the idea of what is real, and whether or not the distinction matters.
