S.I. is highly surreal and attempts to be rationalist although I don't think it succeeds. Wouldn't recommend but if you feel like reducing your sanity go give it a whirl.

A better place is a webcomic. It's best if even the premise comes as a surprise so look at it, might not call it rational but it looks at some interesting concepts. I would definitely recommend.

Onwards to Providence. Brilliant worldbuilding. Could be described as an eldritch roadtrip but that doesn't really do it justice. A nice xenofiction. Even the "Terran" viewpoint characters are more alien than they seem. I especially like the worldbuilding that goes into the logical consequences of a world where souls exist, how they'd evolve that way, how it'd effect culture, how it'd effect development and so on.
