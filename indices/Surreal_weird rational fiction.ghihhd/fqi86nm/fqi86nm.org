Is very weird yet or perhaps because it has a lot of thought put into it. Lots of high concept stuff, time travel, applied infinities, stuff like that. It's broadly a HP fanfiction but the setting has had practically a complete overhaul. I strongly recommend, very strongly considering the request. A couple highlights that are relatively easy to explain are the infinite library where people go on expeditions to attractor points in whatever fractal layout it's been sorted into currently and take out books to decode new spells from, it's quite possibly deriving these spells in a more traditional way would be a supertask. Or Griffindor's Lion(I think that's it's name?), A large abstract sculpture that doesn't change in any way yet the patterns it forms are constantly shifting, the viewer can see a lion moving and roaring in a still object. Or the "train" or the MC being gifted his own perfectly accurate biography but due to the nature of information loops his brain is unable to process the words describing future events until they have happened.
