In all honestly, I think it's mostly called rational adjacent because the author is involved in the rationality sphere/movement/community/cult/whateverthehellthisthingis.

More charitable, it takes a completely absurd premise for world building and does a phenomenal job taking that premise seriously and exploring the consequences of people acting in such a world (which is a big part of why it is so great).

That said, there are still too many aspects of the worldbuilding and plot that work out much too conveniently* for me to fully call it rational fiction, so I think the term rational adjacent is a fair description.

*: Yes, I know that this convenience is explicitly part of the worldbuilding, I do not consider that a valid excuse.
