I wonder if its surreal-through-features vs surreal-through-tone. I mean, I won't be surprised if there are surreal fiction works set in the real world, and so there could be a work with a surreal tone set in a very rational world. But lots of people would very well disagree that the work continues to be rational.

As for surrealism-as-aspect - I wonder how well it's possible to handle reality-warping and stuff like that rationally.
