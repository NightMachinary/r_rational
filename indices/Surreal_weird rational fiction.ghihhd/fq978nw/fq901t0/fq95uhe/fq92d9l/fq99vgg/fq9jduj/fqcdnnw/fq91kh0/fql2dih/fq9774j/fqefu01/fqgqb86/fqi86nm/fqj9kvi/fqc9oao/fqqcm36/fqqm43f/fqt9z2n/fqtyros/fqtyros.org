I read the first couple of books of How to Avoid Death on A Daily Basis but it was too many generic isekai tropes for me to stick with. Deeper Darker has promise but I can't stand the attitude of the tech kid main character, Ubik, who despite being 1/3 main characters dominates the story. The Good Student is one I actually enjoy a good deal though.

Many people say moody's writing is hit or miss and I agree.
