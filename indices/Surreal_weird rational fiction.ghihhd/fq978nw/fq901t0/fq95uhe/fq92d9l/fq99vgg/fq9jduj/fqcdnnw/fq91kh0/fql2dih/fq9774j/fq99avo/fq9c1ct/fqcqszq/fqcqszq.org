Having read /The Man In The High Castle/, I think I can get what point you are trying to get at here. As for the ending of MITHC ... well, I'm running this all from memory, but Juliana Fink consults the oracle at the writer's house and learns that Germany and Japan indeed have lost the war. Which does make some sort of internal sense, because the victory presented is hella unrealistic, even from the point of view of the 1960s.

I suppose, then, I'm trying to look for fiction that ... I'm not sure how to explain it. Greg Egan and HPMOR and Worm meet William S. Burroughs and Philip K. Dick and Jack Kirby.
