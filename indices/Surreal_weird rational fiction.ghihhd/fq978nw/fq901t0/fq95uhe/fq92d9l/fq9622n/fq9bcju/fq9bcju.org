Dude wakes up in The Future getting resuscitated from cryo after his death only to find himself in the only body that was lying around for charity cases, that of a robotic rat skeleton (to scale). He finds himself at odds with the (strangely flexible) law system, the weird and random bodies people seem to inhabit, the lack of any personal boundaries, and starts trying to etch out his own corner of the world according to his own far outdated values (and love of crypto).
