Check out Chili and the Chocolate Factory and Unsong. (I am under the impression that Cordyceps is also quite surreal, but I haven't managed to read it yet.)

Not all are explicitly rational in their construction, but often they have authors who are clearly breaking that rationality with intent. They often have rational characters, but weird worlds, but there are definitely multiple flavours. Sometimes they're referred to as being anti-rational, but I definitely find they scratch similar sorts of itches.

I'll note that Unsong does literally have a DMT dimension in there, and the Cactus Man makes an appearance (though we don't get any mechanical elves!).
