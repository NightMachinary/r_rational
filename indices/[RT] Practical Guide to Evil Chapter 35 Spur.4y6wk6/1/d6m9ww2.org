So we have a classic Malthusian trap here. Seems traditionally the Dread Empire solved it by war or famine, either reducing their own population or expanding territory. The capture of Callow should help with that a bit, as larger agricultural base can offset famines. But ti still delays the inevitable.

Is there any way they can fix the demographic problem by slowing population growth? Magical contraceptives? I assume there are no easy non-blood magic ways to expand the arable land, and there's not much chance of an agricultural/industrial revolution anytime soon to increase their yields, given the tech level and fuedal structure.

Guess we have to find somewhere new to invade!
