I find myself wondering what keeps them from dying back to the point where starvation isn't so much of an issue--how they're able to maintain such high population numbers despite the lack of resources to support them (and how they got that high in the first place, lacking those resources).

It was nice to go back to Book 2 Chapter 16 and review how the stories were described; this can now be seen as a sort of despair, where life sucks and it's going to suck worse no matter what you do, but the people who rage at it even momentarily are the closest things to heroes you've got.
