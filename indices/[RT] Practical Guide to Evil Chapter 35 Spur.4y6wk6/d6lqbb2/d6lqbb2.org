The number one thing that bugs me about this story is the author's avoidance of the word 'said'. It feels awkward to write in, but if you're reading it just blends into the narrative. Whereas using 'graveled' and other synonyms over and over again feels really grating and amateurish. The author has been better about it lately, but it's still too much.
