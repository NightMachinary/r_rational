I've never particularly cared for that bit of writing advice. Human communication is super subtle; I'm pretty bad at capturing all of it even in the very high-bandwidth real world. Artificially limiting the amount of context you're providing readers over a very low bandwidth medium like written dialogue because it "should" be clear from other context is a silly fad sustainable only by a mutual illusion of transparency---the author imagines the reader knows exactly what voice and intonation they intended because they don't get access to readers brains, and likewise the reader never knows when they guessed somewhat wrong.

I mean, sure, usually something like outright sarcasm vs literal intentions will be clear enough from context, but /subtle/ changes in voice are much harder to express. When I hear other people read dialogue I know, for example, I'm often surprised by which words they choose to emphasize and where they place pauses. This indicates that the voice wasn't sufficiently clear to at least one of us.
