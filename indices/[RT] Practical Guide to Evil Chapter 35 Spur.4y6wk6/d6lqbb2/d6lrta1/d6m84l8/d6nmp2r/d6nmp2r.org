I think that's probably true, but I also think authors are more prone to fall into the trap of over-diversifying their use of language just for the sake of it. It's one of my personal golden rules to never say more than what needs to be said (because I find it very easy to do so). Extra words or unnecessarily precise words can distract from the /important/ words if not used purposefully.

I've never really had the need for anything more than "said", "asked", "responded", and "remarked", for general dialogue. Things like "growled", "muttered", "whispered", "spat out", or "yelled" are very context specific. They can be used to great effect when their impact on the scene is an important literary detail - 'saying' something within earshot of the enemy is very different from whispering the same phrase, for one.

How dialogue is spoken, though, is often of minor importance, or clearly indicated by previous language or by the dialogue itself. Straying from the use of "said" can, IMO, come off as redundant or unnecessarily verbose.
