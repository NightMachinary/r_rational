Yes, same here. It didn't bother me and I never really noticed. Same as the other person who had a problem with the multiple nicknames for each characters which I like... I guess we're all a bit different in things that bugs us...

For me, if the story is gripping enough, I rarely notice details of the text and just go with the flow in a state similar to dreaming. If however the story bores me or the text is unclear and pulls me out of this state, I become much less tolerant of issues and will focus on every single details.
