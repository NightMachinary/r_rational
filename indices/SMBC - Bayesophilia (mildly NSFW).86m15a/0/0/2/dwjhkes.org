I mean, it's fun, but as an argument it's pretty weak. Yeah, it sucks to be That One Person who suffers from some super-rare event. Forget muggings, someone every year dies by being hit by lightning, or falling from their bed, or maybe being buried alive and suffocated by kittens. Each of these things sucks for the victim (ok, the kittens one is also somewhat awesome) but we as society never would consider it sane to band together and spend vast amounts of resources to try to fix these problems, if those resources had to be diverted from solving vastly more dangerous problems.

Pinker's argument is very motivated. It's not just about telling that everything is nice, it's about telling that things are, after all, nicer than people tend to think they are /because people thinking otherwise is in itself a potentially incredibly dangerous thing/. So perspective matters. If our priorities become skewed, forget diverting resources from the biggest problems, we may actually cause new ones. As seen by how many people who complain about a non-existent epidemic of out of control muggings immediately go on attributing it to those damn immigrants or something. So yeah, sucks to be the guy who /does/ die in a mugging, but I don't want to die in WW3 over people being hysterical because of an imagined crime wave, so Pinker's right to say those things (at least in principle, if he then communicates them in the wrong /way/ thus not reaching those who need reaching it's another matter).
