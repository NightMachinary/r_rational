Thanks for the reply. I mean, I agree with the words in your comment. Also, this is basically the public policy version of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton's_fence][Chesterton's fence]], if you ever need a nice phrase for it.

If all that came of Pinker's work was people mentioning Chesterton's fence when discussing policy positions and progressivism, I wouldn't be worried. That's a useful warning to keep in mind while discussing policy preferences.

However, that's not the effect I see. Not only am I not optimistic about people getting the same lessons you've just expressed out of Pinker's work, but I see something more insidious: his ideas being used to stop discussing problems before even getting to the point of discussing policy. What I mean is that it's perfectly sensible to say, "Pushing for positive change is better than doing nothing, but doing nothing is better than pushing for negative change because you don't understand the problems," there is a greater danger in what I see as a more common practical application of Pinker's ideas: "Talking about some problems is better than doing nothing, but doing nothing is better than accepting the reality of social injustices that I personally don't understand."

I fully realize I'm strawmanning the shit out of this imaginary fan of Pinker, but my point is that the way of thinking that Pinker advocates is 1) useless as far as identifying which problems to focus on, 2) useful as a guard against uncareful thinking, in the form of the Chesterton's fence analogy, but 3) more likely to be used as motivation to promote the status quo and advocate against progressive policies.

Like, nobody needs a whole book or numerous media appearances to understand Chesterton's fence. Obviously we should understand problems as much as possible in order to most effectively solve them. And the rest of his ideas? Uninteresting if your goal is to improve the human condition, and just more motivation and rhetorical tricks for dismissing problems in society if you happen to be a white male.
