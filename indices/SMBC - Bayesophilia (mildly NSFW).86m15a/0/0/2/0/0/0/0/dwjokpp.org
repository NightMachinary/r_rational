The one danger I do see in Pinker's approach is that you should never extrapolate trends and take that for granted. An upward slope might as well be part of an exponential or of some unholy curve that's about to peak and plunge towards minus infinity. That much certainly needs to be understood and is a huge damper on excessively optimistic views of the world.

However, I also think that right now a lot of people want to smash fences that they don't understand anything about, or worse, build new ones for no good reason (this being both metaphorical /and/ literal, in this context...). As I said, I am separating Pinker's arguments from the way he communicates them. I am not convinced he's being very effective, in fact, like many people, he ends up preaching to the choir. Not that those outside the choir are very willing to listen anyways, being their own choir with their own preachers. Yes, what you say is a danger. Present me a single way of discussing a single thing that comes with zero danger of being misunderstood and I'll give you a cookie. But at the same time, I think it's a fallacious argument to reply to what he's saying "yeah, but what about that minority who /do/ fall victim to /insert thing here/?". Because yeah, of course we shouldn't abandon them. But we must also understand that perfect, total control over all of the accidents of humanity's actions is... just not a thing that's possible. If there's a serious rise in crime, some administrator might be to blame. If there's a small background noise of basically unpredictable crime, there comes a point where all you can blame is human nature itself. I'm not saying we shouldn't seek a solution, if it exists. I'm saying that it's a fallacy in itself to assume that a solution always exists at all - or more specifically, that it consists of just blaming someone and then removing them, and that'll fix stuff.
