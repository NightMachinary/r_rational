Well, in a way, obviously pushing for change is potentially more dangerous - it's a higher risks, higher rewards affair. But that's not what I meant. I don't think Pinker is against pushing for change /in principle/ either. I'm talking about the very specifics of the kind of pushing for change that is going on in this historical moment in many western countries.

Pushing for change isn't a single action we can all bundle together. Pushing for positive change is better than doing nothing, but doing nothing is better than pushing for negative change because you don't understand the problems. You can push for change and do harm if you have bad information or just are not very bright. Pushing for a democratic country to become a theocracy is pushing for change, it's also a terrible idea.

My point wasn't that you shouldn't push for change. Pushing for change so that we adopt renewable energy sources and mitigate climate change is awesome. Pushing for change so that we adopt potentially human rights violating anti-immigration policies to fix a crime emergency that only exists in your media-excited imagination, not so much.
