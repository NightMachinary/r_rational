We got slightly different things out of this comic. I can't remember who phrased it this way, but while it's true that, as Pinker says, the arc of history bends toward justice, what he fails to understand is that this is because of all the people throughout history doing the work of bending it. So pointing out how good things have gotten relative to the past, is about as useful as a superhero who points out how unlikely it is for you to get mugged, instead of actually helping you. This analogy does not operate on the individual level at all, as you seem to think. Income inequality still exists despite how it has changed over the years, and we care about it because of the societal trend, not because individual people happen to be poor. (Bad example, because income inequality has actually gotten worse, not better lmao.)

That all is leaving aside the real problem with Pinker, which this comic doesn't touch on, but which you seem to have bought into, and conveniently expressed very concisely: the idea that it is more dangerous to push for change than it is to do nothing. Specifically, I'm looking at when you say, and even emphasize as if it's your main point:

#+begin_quote
  it's about telling that things are, after all, nicer than people tend to think they are /because people thinking otherwise is in itself a potentially incredibly dangerous thing./
#+end_quote

This almost caused my eyebrows to hit the ceiling. I get an easy rhetorical out here, though, because so far as I can tell, the burden lies with Pinker and his fans to justify that conclusion (the bit you italicized), so for now I'm not going to bother responding to it in more detail than this: why?
