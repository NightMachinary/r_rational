Generally, I'd consider it to usually be a status quo bias. More specifically, the System Justification Bias: [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_justification]]

In an individual's case, it might also be some sort of sunk-cost justification, or even a rational gatekeeping effort (e.g. "I'm already a lawyer, and if we make it easier to become a lawyer, people might not want to pay me as much")
