It really depends on the condition. There may be a point in that argument even - if for example we're talking about passing an especially hard (but fair) exam to gain access to a specialised profession, one might indeed feel like that exam only assesses properly the skills needed to do it, and anyone who would not pass it is best left out, so be opposed to that removal.

As a general rule though I guess there's something about getting used to things that might seem weird or wrong from the outside just by living in contact with them? I'm not sure what it's called. I always associate it with a professor in a physics faculty who was talking about handling radioactive materials/experiments, and who said, about a certain substance, "oh well, it's just gamma rays anyway". Of course from his perspective that's better than an alpha or beta emitter, but everyone else in the world would be (probably rightfully) horrified at the idea of being so casual about any radioactive substance at all.
