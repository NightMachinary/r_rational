I think devaluation is not the main motivator here. They seem to just want reimbursement / justify their cost.

It'd be sunk cost related if they were still paying for it / were almost done paying. If they already paid then it's more of a fairness seeking bias (not a real bias btw). Either they'd want their money back (which is very unlikely to happen in this case) or they'd want for other people to have to pay too.

Sounds petty, and is probably shortsighted but also somehow part of human nature so maybe a cognitive bias.
