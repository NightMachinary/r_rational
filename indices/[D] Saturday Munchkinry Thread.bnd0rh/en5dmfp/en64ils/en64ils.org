Is there no limit to how much velocity change you can apply? If so... well...

There are fictional stories of people being so powerful that they are effectively walking nukes. Your power would put these people to shame, because you're a walking galaxy destroyer. Change your velocity to light-speed * (1 - 1/infinity) in the direction of the earth. It would kill you, but the nigh infinite amount of kinetic energy you inject into the Earth would also destroy it, sending fragments of the Earth out in all directions at nigh light-speed. And by fragments I don't mean just solid matter, I mean subatomic particles as well, because nigh-infinite kinetic energy will overpower the strong nuclear force with ease. These fragments will then repeat the process on everything they hit, eventually destroying the galaxy.

You may be a little short of a universe destroyer though, depending on whether the universe can expand faster than light forever.

  Lets say the velocity does not have to be applied uniformly

Oh! A safe way to apply your power. Apply a massive amount of velocity to a tiny patch of skin or hair, and it will fire off like a bullet and leave you only with the minor injury of losing some skin or hair. Don't apply too much velocity though, otherwise the above scenario happens and its not so safe for you after all. This unfortunately means very low velocities while on Earth, since you don't want your skin or hair to undergo nuclear fusion with the air surrounding you.

On the other hand, you would be unstoppable in space, being able to fire off near-light-speed projectiles safely through the vacuum of space to hit far away targets. You still can't apply near infinite amount of kinetic force without destroying the galaxy, but what you can apply safely is more than enough to destroy pretty much anything you want.

Consider using a tooth or a nail for extra lethality if this is somehow not enough.
