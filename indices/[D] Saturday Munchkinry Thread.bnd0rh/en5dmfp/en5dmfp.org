At the snap of your fingers, you can spontaneously change your velocity. You do not feel the sudden change in velocity, but you any consequences of a high velocity affect you normally (Supersonic speeds relative to air hurt, reentry speed can cause massive burns, a velocity straight down still breaks your legs, ect). Not that snapping is not instantaneous, and repeated quick snapping can be physically strenuous.

​

Lets say the velocity does not have to be applied uniformly, so that you can use your snaps to change your rotational speed, and possibly even punch harder (as long as you avoid ripping your hand from your arm.)

​

How useful is this power? Flying is difficult, requiring constant snapping, and landing is even harder. Trying to move something with can be dangerous if you accelerate to quickly while improperly holding the object.

​

How would you use this power?
