How much of what is "not you" does your power cover? If it doesn't cover you at all, then it would be very difficult to use this power wearing anything at all, since things like a watch or phone or even piercings, tooth fillings, medical devices, etc would fuck you up if you tried any fast shifts, and it'd be pretty difficult to make heavy use of.

Beyond that, something like a modified recumbent bike you can harness yourself on for optimal momentum transfer would be pretty relaxing to ride in,
