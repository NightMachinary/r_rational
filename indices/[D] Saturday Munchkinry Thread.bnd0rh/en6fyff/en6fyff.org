You have a limited mind control power. Specifically, you can persuade anyone of anything in the course of a five minute one-one-one conversation, as long as it's something that you believe and it's something that actually is true. (If you're not completely sure about something, you can't make someone else more certain than you yourself are.) If you want to get more technical, it only works on things that you have "knowledge" of, where "knowledge" has the traditional philosopher's definition of "justified true belief". Attempting to persuade someone of anything else works exactly as well as it would if you did not have this power.

How do you exploit this?
