If I could convince anyone of anything, it would be pretty stupid of me to use that power to make MIRI useless, and they'd know it. They could also just supervise me via camera to see whether the directed research I'm doing looks like I'm just making up the results. And in the end, it isn't hard to prove that I can generate knowledge in lesser trials.
