That may be true, but there are podcasts out there about two people arguing about an important topic which can convince viewers.

Even if the viewers aren't exactly the same person as your 'partner', there is likely to be a significant fraction of the audience who identify with your partner. You could even make it your gimmick. For every important topic there is to argue about, you make a series of videos talking to various individuals and the viewers simply choose the character they identify the best with.

For example, in the series 'Arguing Cryonics with...' there are videos such as 'Arguing Cryonics with a Democrat', 'Arguing Cryonics with a Republican', 'Arguing Cryonics with a Christian', 'Arguing Cryonics with a Preschooler', and so on for whatever section of the audience you want to reach.

This is assuming that you magically know the best arguments to persuade someone rather than just having them agree with you without you coming up with any arguments.

The audience won't be as well convinced, but I would assume some of the rhetorical impact would carry over.
