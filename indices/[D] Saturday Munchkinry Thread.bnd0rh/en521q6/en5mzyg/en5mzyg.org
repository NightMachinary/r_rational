This is pretty dependent on more details of how memory magic is actually used. If it's the equivalent of "anyone can learn it's just really hard" then spreading memory magic is as easy as putting memories of how to do memory magic into someone's head. Bam, you've got a temporary memory mage who can make whatever they want true then delete their memory of being a memory mage.

It'd probably see the most use as shuffling prisoners through it if they claim they'd been memory-magic'd into confessing to a crime, as a form of two year high risk parole.
