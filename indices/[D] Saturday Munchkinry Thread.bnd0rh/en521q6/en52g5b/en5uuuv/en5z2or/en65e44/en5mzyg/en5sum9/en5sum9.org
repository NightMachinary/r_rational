Memory-altering makes it trickier to enforce the law in certain scenarios, but by no means impossible. Assuming it isn't so prohibitively expensive to change or delete memories that the state cannot afford to use it occasionally, all the memories of the suspect related to the investigation of the crime and the magical area itself could be deleted, thus preventing subsequent memory altering on the part of the suspect to cover his tracks 2 years down the line. Then, a subsequent trial could be staged in the special location 2 years after the crime, with the suspect now unaware of the magical phenomenon present, and a question posed as to some significant event in the original crime scene which law enforcement thought the memory of which might have been screwed with. If the suspect failed when attempting to lie and give his false alibi or what have you, he would be exposed as guilty. You could make this as complicated as you like, of course, from convincing the suspect he was answering to God himself to convincing him he was talking to a trusted friend.

Of course, I imagine this would cost quite a bit, so it would probably only be used on the rich or those who in some manner had the resources to alter their memories. Perhaps for the poor or middle class, it would be done on a lottery to help prevent the odd conspiracy or organized crime operation. And penalties for memory alteration would have to be excessive to work as an incentive against it.

There's always the odd chance that people might try to keep this process from working on them by spending large amounts of time, and thus generating many memories, thinking about the existence of the crime investigation and/or the special location. This could be prevented with some use of "meta-memories," however. It seems trivial enough to implant a memory in someone wherein they visit their psychiatrist who describes to them that they have an obsession with thinking about a fantasy of such nature.
