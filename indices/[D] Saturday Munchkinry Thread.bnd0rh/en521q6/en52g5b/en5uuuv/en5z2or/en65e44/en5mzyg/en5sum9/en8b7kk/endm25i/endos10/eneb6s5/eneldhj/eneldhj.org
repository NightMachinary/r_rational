...Huh. You know, it didn't even occur to me, but now that you raise the question. Your ability implant a memory definitely rests on you being able to fake it and make it seem real. A non-artist very likely would /not/ be able to make a master artist think they painted a particular masterpiece, because they couldn't go through the process in their mind. It might work briefly, but as soon as the artist started thinking about those memories, he would realize something was wrong and become deeply confused about this mismatch between what he remembers doing and how well he knows his thought processes and his art.

A blind magician could make use of other people's memories to get an accurate picture of vision is like, but it would still slow them down since they would have to make more of an effort to emulate a state of mind where seeing is normal.

...This is... interesting. I will need to go through a lot of my characters and their schemes and make sure none of them are doing anything they aren't able to. I can't think of any violations right now, but there is one case where half the victim's life is just complete fabrication, so I'll have to make sure the villain is able to fake all of it.

Thank you very much. This was useful.
