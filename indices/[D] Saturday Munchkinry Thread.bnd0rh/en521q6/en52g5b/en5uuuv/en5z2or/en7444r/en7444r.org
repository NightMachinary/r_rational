  What are the logistics of the memory magic?
#+end_quote

You need physical contact. A few seconds will do if you're good at it and know exactly what you are looking for, but magic can be felt by other magic users nearby while it is being used. It can't be felt after the fact, but during the actual memory tinkering, anyone nearby is likely to sense exactly what you are doing.

Anyone who can delete or alter memories can read them as well. They can't automatically or easily detect /other/ memory altering magic, but if they can change memories, they can also read them. The more extensively you want to alter things, and the more precise and exhaustive you want to be about it, the longer it takes. Want to delete all memories of a childhood friend, now we're likely looking at hours of work if you don't want to leave conflicting memories and little moments where you mentioned them briefly while talking to someone else.

You can delete memories as specific as passwords, but it wouldn't be by trial and error, you would just seek the memory out, watch it, confirm it's the right one, and then wipe it.
