Intention can still be credibly stated in this location regardless of memory, so you still have the very valuable service of things like

- only electing politicians who can truthfully attest every month that they intend to act in service of what they believe to be the best possible world for the good of the populace
- Everyone sufficiently rich and powerful has to attest that they see no plausible futures in which they would use the memory magic short of directly protecting specific people from harm, and that in any such case they would report their usage to a given trusted authority.
- Honestly given promises

Of course all of the above can still be tainted by being based on incorrect past memories, but in the short term it's still accurate.

Other things that come to mind:

- Every single citizen of a country/employee of a corporation/etc is forced to visit this place and say a series of statements like "I harbor no intentions to commit murder", "I will never disobey the will of the Grand Emperor", etc., and everyone for whom that isn't true conveniently dies.

What are the logistics of the memory magic? How much is required for someone to use it? Some progressively more restrictive conditions:

- You can apply it to "everyone meeting condition X" without knowing who exactly that applies to
- You need only know their name
- You need visual contact
- You need physical contact
- You need prolonged access to their body for a period of several hours

Also, how much can memories be read? Like, can Powerful Person Paul delete my memories of the password to the vault even if Paul doesn't know what the password he needs to delete is? Can he delete every conversation I've had with Eve even if he doesn't know when or where I met her? Can he delete my memories of "entering a 1 on the keypad initially", see if that worked, then try deleting my memories of "entering a 2 on the keypad initially", etc., until he's extracted the password?
