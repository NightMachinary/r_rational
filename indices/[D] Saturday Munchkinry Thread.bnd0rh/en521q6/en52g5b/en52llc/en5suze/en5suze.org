If you are planning on writing about this magic, an interesting novice mistake to make is to delete the memories of an incident in question, but not to delete the memories of deleting the memories of the incident.

This one of the ideas which should be obvious if such mind magic is real, but makes the author look really smart for thinking of.

I think I read about a villain in a /Harry Potter/ fanfic who was caught because while he couldn't be Veritaserumed about something he Obliviated from his mind, he was caught anyway when he was asked if he remembered Obliviating himself of something at the same time as the crime. I don't remember where I read this though.
