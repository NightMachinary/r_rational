Go to MIRI, tell them about the power, get told about the approaches they think might work, try to convince them which ones will actually work, build on the ones that I was best at convincing them of, repeat until I can convince them the problem is solved, proceed to researching in the same way how to build an AI, do that, done.

What do you mean, I'm unsafe? You mean that I might be corrupted by power and immanetize something rather dystopic instead? That possibility would be rather obvious and taken into account in the safety research part, in order to tease out of my oracle how to rule it out. You mean that the oracle might be untrustworthy? ...if the oracle chose me to be its vessel in order to acquire the universe, it could have chosen a vessel that wouldn't listen to people trying to tell it otherwise, so yeah, if the all-knowing entity is goal-directed and hostile we were screwed from the beginning, so we might as well assume it isn't.
