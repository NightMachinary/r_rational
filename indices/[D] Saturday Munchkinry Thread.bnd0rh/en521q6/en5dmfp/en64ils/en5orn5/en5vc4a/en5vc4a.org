If you can change your momentum without being affecting by sudden changes in momentum, then you have a perpetual machine.

One straight forward way to apply it, is to stand on a spoke of a water wheel or something similar that is standing still and snap your fingers to suddenly have a large velocity. Your body will forcibly push the water wheel into moving and thus harvest the kinetic energy into a usable form.

Granted this would damage your body, but it's an example of how to extract work from your power.
