Assuming you're in a version of our world in modern times (aside from this power existing), you will probably be using this power exclusively on earth. Then, assuming you don't want to kill yourself, your biggest constraint will be limiting objects to speeds that don't vaporize you when you fire them (and also limited in range by the object vaporizing itself and dispersing all its momentum into the air before it reaches its destination?)

Small objects like flecks of skin will probably vaporize really quickly and disperse their energy and momentum into a wider range of air, and act more like a beam cannon than a bullet, while larger objects like nails might maintain their structure more. But I'm mostly speculating based on that one XKCD what-if with the baseball.

Either way, the amount of energy you can impart is unbounded as you asymptotically approach lightspeed, the only question is how deadly can you get without killing yourself.

You can probably nuke a city (or anything smaller or larger) by getting a protective suit, launching yourself into the air, firing a fleck of skin at relativistic speeds towards the city through a small opening in the suit, then flinging yourself backwards at supersonic speeds to avoid the energy heat explosion, then slowing yourself down and landing once you reach a safe distance.
