There are other ways of doing it based on how the process works. For example, I read something where there was mind control in the form of implanted memories. The way they got around this was talking to people, and the implanted memories didn't come with emotional processing - when they remembered the fake horrible things, they were outraged, but the memories did not include outrage. (They were artificially generated.)

In Inception, someone has to create the dreamscape - it can be the target, it can not be the target. The aspect I brought up never came up in Inception. If your story's process of creating the memories involves both participants (shaper + target), then this can be avoided, provided fake memories are not only produced solo. Alternatively it could take the form "what do you remember?" "I was at the bank when a short guy ran in with a gun and..." "It was a short guy not a tall guy. He was wearing a skii mask..."

I asked because if it was easy to do, then I'd want to do it for memorization and/or dream influencing purposes/attempts. 'I know what the lesson today was on, but I might not remember tomorrow, so I'm going to look in this mirror, practice saying out loud what I want to remember, and them I'm going to implant the memory, of those words voiced by Morgan Freeman.' 'I really liked that dream, but I'm going to forget it, so...' 'I want to have a dream with a swordfight/anime fight.'

If magic allowed the blind to have a memory of seeing things people would be /pretty/ interested. (In Inception, there were people who went to a place to experience dreams. The intended analogy seemed to be drugs.)

  A non-artist very likely would /not/ be able to make a master artist think they painted a particular masterpiece, because they couldn't go through the process in their mind. It might work briefly, but as soon as the artist started thinking about those memories, he would realize something was wrong and become deeply confused about this mismatch between what he remembers doing and how well he knows his thought processes and his art.

I am not a master artist. But this would probably not be hard to do to me with the magic you describe. (The hardest part right now, would be the fact that I don't do a lot of art. Memories of creating an image in photoshop - doable.)
