There's a special location where you can't knowingly speak an untruth or you die on the spot. You can, however, say something you believe is true and be wrong, or state your intentions and then change your mind, but at the moment you speak, it must not be a deliberate untruth.

Obviously that's quite useful for trials and business deals and alliances and all that jazz. /However/, it's also possible in this world to delete memories perfectly and irreversibly, as well as to temporarily suppress them or change them, or fabricate them entirely. Other than the permanent deletion, these gradually return to normal in about two years (Because souls heal brain damage because magic).

How much does the presence of memory magic take away from the power of this special location? Anyone rich and powerful has relatively easy access to the memory magic, although it is, of course, illegal, and could come back to bite you in the ass if you were locked up for the two years and then taken to the location.
