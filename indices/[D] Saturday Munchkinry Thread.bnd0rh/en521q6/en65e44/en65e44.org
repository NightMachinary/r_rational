Since memories return to normal in about two years, can't you just hold the suspect in jail for two years then test them? As for permanent deletion, that's easy enough to detect. Ask the suspect what they were doing at every moment in time that's relevant to the case. If their memories of that moment have been deleted, they wouldn't be able to say what they were doing.

But before all those issues though, I would outlaw any use of that special location. It is way way too dangerous. If you speak your intent and change your mind partway through the sentence, you die. If you misspeak and end up saying something you know is untrue, you die. If a lawyer confuses you into saying something you don't believe with double double negations, you die. It is just far too easy to die in the special location even when you have no intention of speaking untruths. What kind of horrible lie detector kills you instead of just sending some harmless signal like glowing in red when a lie is spoken?
