How this magic works and interacts with the truth-location is very strongly affected by what type of memories you allow to be affected.

Can the magic affect:

- Implicit Memory - Anything you remember unconsciously by rote or don't remember knowing. For example, if you went back to your old high school, if you can find your old math classroom even though you don't recall anything about the location, this is implicit memory.
- Procedural Memory - How to perform a task such as riding a bike, make a sandwich, or singing a song. This is considered to be a type of implicit memory.
- Explicit Memory - Information you have to work to recall such as phone numbers or addresses. The following three types all fall under explicit memory.
- Declarative Memory - Anything factual such as dates, words, faces, events, and concepts. They can be rules of a sport, capitals of the states, or someone's appearance.
- Semantic Memory - A subset of declarative memory concerning general facts such as rules of baseballs or someone's birthday.
- Episodic Memory - A subset of declarative memory concerning events such as a baseball game or birthday party.

These are all types of long term memory. Can the magic also affect short term memories (they last about one minute), working memory (information about what one is currently focusing on), or sensory memories (what you receive from your senses lasting fractions of a second)?
