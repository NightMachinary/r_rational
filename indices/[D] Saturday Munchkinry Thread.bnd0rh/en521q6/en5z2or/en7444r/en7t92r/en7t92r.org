The obvious strategy here then seems to be nighttime reads - break into someone's house while they're sleeping, read all their memories, wipe any recollection of that night, and all they'll notice the next morning (or ever) is not sleeping well. Since the default state of sleep memories is nonexistent, there's nothing to alter once you scrub their memories, so they won't know what happened two years later.
