You can affect all of these, although messing with the subject's working and sensory memory is a bit overkill, and whatever you are trying to accomplish is probably easier done through other magic. Hard to make them remember the house as an elephant when they can actively see the house.

Implicit memory is probably the hardest to make sure you delete/alter fully, and if there is reason to think someone has been messed with, here might be where it's easiest to detect that different memories don't line up. Episodic memories are the fastest to wipe - for everything else you have to spend a little time getting into the mindspace of the target. Which you can, since anyone who can alter memories can also read them, but it will take more time.

Thank you for your input!
