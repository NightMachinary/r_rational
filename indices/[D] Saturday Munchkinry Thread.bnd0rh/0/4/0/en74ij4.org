  It'd probably see the most use as shuffling prisoners through it if they claim they'd been memory-magic'd into confessing to a crime, as a form of two year high risk parole.

This is an excellent suggestion. Thank you.

Inserting memories is quite different from inserting skills, however. You can show someone video footage of how to perform surgery, but without all the surrounding medical knowledge a surgeon needs, they would still make a pretty poor surgeon. Most people /can/ learn to use it, in the same way that most people /can/ learn calculus, it's just not going to happen. It's also slightly constrained by how personality impacts magic in my world, but we are still talking more than 50% of the population being able to learn it if they try really, really hard for a long time, and learn all the lesser magic leading up to it. It's not incantations and hand movements, more like magical surgery.
