You can mess with your own memories, but it's harder, and so fewer people can do it. However, the way personality shapes magic in my world, the more secretive and scheming you are, the more likely you happen to have a talent for it.

Others do not require your permission to mess with your memories, but they need to touch you, or at least be close, and you can't hide the fact that you are using magic from other magic users nearby. If you are both magic users, basically you need to be willing, asleep or otherwise helpless.

Fabricated memories are created by you imagining yourself in the position of the target and simulating experiencing the memory, then shoving that experience into their brain, possibly in place of the original memory if there was one. So it's easier if you know them, and unless you know them /very/ well it's going to take a while if you want it to seem realistic. If you are altering an existing memory, you would usually relive the real one by reading their mind, then playing it back with changes. If you want it seem as realistic as possible, you probably have to play it back and forth several times. If you want to change all memories on a topic, you have to do them all individually. Deleting is faster and easier, but fabricating and changing takes time. If you want it to be believable. If you wanted to you could just randomly fill all their memories with menacing pink elephants standing around in the background. That would be fast, just not very believable.
