Holding someone under constant supervision for two years is pretty disruptive, and it would almost exclusively be happening to the rich and powerful. As to mistakes - people treat it with a considerable amount of veneration and respect. They don't use it casually, and are aware that it is dangerous. I don't see people in my setting abandoning use of it.
