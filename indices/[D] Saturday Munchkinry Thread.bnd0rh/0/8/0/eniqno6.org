  How many people can perform the memory magic?
#+end_quote

Maybe half the population has the raw potential for it, but not everyone gets to learn magic in the first place, and even if you /can/ learn mind magic, how easy it is, and how good you will be at it depends on your personality. About 5% of magicians end up learning enough mind magic to affect memories, and because of how magic works in my world, most of them are the type of person who become happy at the thought of being able to mess with other people's minds. That's not /strictly/ necessary, but it helps. A lot. Of course, if you wanted to learn it and use it to be the best psychiatrist/'mind healer' in town and really help people, that would work too.

#+begin_quote
  What tools or components does it take?
#+end_quote

None beyond physical contact. The more advanced the work you want to do though, the longer it takes. But if the victim is asleep, a few hours is enough to change hundreds of memories to your liking.

#+begin_quote
  How much do they know about the content of what they removed?
#+end_quote

Anyone who can alter memories can also read them. They could easily view the whole memory, then construct a near identical one with specific details changed or missing, compare the two, finetune the copy, and then replace the original with the copy. And they would be the only one who knew what the original was until ~two years later, by which time the target's soul will have finished healing the brain damage.

  Could we license them and require them to each routinely affirm (at that spot) that they have not altered a memory to conceal a crime?
#+end_quote

You could, but if they deleted their own memory of their illegal actions, you wouldn't be able to find it. There is also a location where you can't willingly lie or you die, but again, they could have just deleted the memory beforehand. If they made mistakes or just didn't take long enough to get all the details right, you might be able to confidently say that something was changed regarding xyz, but that would still not get you the original.
