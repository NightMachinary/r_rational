I do appreciate the feedback! Other people have said things similar to point 1 before, but that's just how I meme, I purposely avoid the most common ones. That does mean they land less often, but that's the risk I have to take!

Now that I'm thinking about it I've had more success using ones bragging about how smart I am, using stupid examples. They still get downvoted usually but they get much more fun replies.

2 is funny because in my mind, that's exactly what I thought would make it obvious! No one would actually have an emotional reaction to a post like this, so I thought it /was/ over the top. Crazy that it had the exact opposite effect!
