What's our engagement like? Are there any websites that can scrape subreddits and say how many accounts are active at any give time (e.g. a sliding window checking for 2 or more posts in a 2 month period, or something). Though I guess lurkers shouldn't be discounted, either (nor users who browse without accounts --- is there any way to check unique pageviews or other analytics?).

The sidebar says 89 people are currently active, though /it is/ Xmas eve haha. That's about as many usernames as I might vaguely recognize from here, personally. I'd also wonder how many “subscribers” correspond to individual posters, too (I've probably used maybe half a dozen + accounts in over a decade of posting on Reddit, all of which would be subscribed to here haha).
