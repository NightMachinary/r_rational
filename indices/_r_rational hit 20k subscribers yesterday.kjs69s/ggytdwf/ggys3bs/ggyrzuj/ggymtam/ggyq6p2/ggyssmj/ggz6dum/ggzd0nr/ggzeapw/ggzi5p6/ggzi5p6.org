Now that's the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] experience I like to see: a sharp turn from a hostile exchange to reasonable discussion once a misunderstanding is cleared up.

  No one would actually have an emotional reaction to a post like this, so I thought it was over the top

Hmm. The pattern I matched it to was people being aggressive at "clueless outsiders", which happens pretty often. Consider the following examples:

- Someone asking a question about a local topic, of the sort that you feel they really should know the answer to. (E. g., "why are you bothered by plot holes?".)

- Someone unselfconsciously expressing a weird, unpopular opinion.

- Someone being loudly enthusiastic about something perceived as irrelevant.

All of these betray not only a deviation from the in-group's shared beliefs and knowledge, but /ignorance/ of it. And if it's done publicly/visibly enough, it seems as if this /outsider/ feels /entitled/ to the in-group's attention or endorsement, despite failing to spend any time researching it or understanding what it's "about".

It's one thing when someone openly and knowingly disagrees with the tribe: this still shows they're engaging with it, invites grudging respect and counterarguments. Similarly, if someone asks a stupid question, or goes on a rant about something weird, but /shows understanding/ that the question is stupid/the rant is weird, that would often be given a pass. But an unselfconscious, public show of ignorance of the tribal norms combined with a digression from them in a weird, low-status direction? That marks one an acceptable target, invites /mockery/. And this is what it felt like you were doing: targeting someone for caring strongly (so strongly as to make an entire post about it) about something as lowly and unimportant as the number of people subscribed to this subreddit.

Looking back... Ironically, that made (in my eyes) your original comment an example of the very thing it was supposed to be punishing: it looked like you thought you were representing the will of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] in enthusiastically putting TrendingBOT down, while I knew you were totally off the mark, which made /me/ want to put /you/ down. Shame on me.
