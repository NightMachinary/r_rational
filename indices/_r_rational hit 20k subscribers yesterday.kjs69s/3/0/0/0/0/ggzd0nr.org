Ah. I did wonder about that, but decided it didn't look that way. Are you interested in improving your model of whether a joke would work? If yes, I think some constructive feedback might be helpful.

I think the reasons this one didn't work in my case (which may or may not be the reasons it didn't work for [[/u/liquidmetalcobra][u/liquidmetalcobra]] et al.) are as follows:

1. The template/pattern isn't very common. I've never seen this copypasta before, and TrendingBOT isn't a very familiar presence/annoyance to me. I imagine if you'd used something very clich√© like the Navy Seal Copypasta, or if your target was one of these spelling-correction bots, it would've worked better.

2. It wasn't over-the-top enough; it seemed too genuine. I don't see TrendingBOT very often, and so I don't expect /others/ to see it very often, which made it seem plausible that someone mistook its post for a non-bot post. And if it /was/ a non-bot post, I would've had a similar if significantly less emotional reaction ("is it really so important that we need to have a top-level post about it?"). If the copypasta expressed not mere extreme annoyance, but an overblown, melodramatic, totally implausible tale about how this post ruined your life, I think it would've worked better.

Well, take it or leave it.
