A lot, we haven't seen the last of the sun THE SUN THE SUN THE SUN

Excuse, that got the better of me all of the sudden. Anyway, i doubt it will be used against the tower itself. This battle of Callow and the tower is one of institutions and long lasting change. Merely bringing down the tower won't change anything. Praes will just rebuild.

Its more probably that it will be used vs The winter king.
