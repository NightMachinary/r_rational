I use this logic to argue that terrorism is a made up issue. ~4,000 American civilians killed by terrorists in 15 years vs 40,000 civilians killed by cars every year = you should be 150 times more scared of cars than terrorists, and we should spend 150 times more money stopping accidents than terrorists.

But we don't.
