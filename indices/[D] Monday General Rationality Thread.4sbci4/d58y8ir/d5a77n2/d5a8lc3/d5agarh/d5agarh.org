Maybe your friends feel the same concern about the police. If they also believe that children already learn to be mindful of cars from other sources (like say, school) then it makes sense that parents will tell their children to have a sense of safety around police. That's probably not taught at school, and you definitely don't want your children to learn that from social media.
