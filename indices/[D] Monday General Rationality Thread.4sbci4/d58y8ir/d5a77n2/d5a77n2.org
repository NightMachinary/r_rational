  As I am not afraid of car accidents
#+end_quote

Shouldn't you? I don't mean to say that the fear should paralyze you or keep you away from cars, but you definitely should pay very close attention to your children when they are near traffic and should definitely teach them to be mindful of cars. Just like some people tell their children to be mindful of police officers, only more so.

Accidents in general are /the/ leading cause of death among children, and traffic accidents are very common accidents.
