General Food for Thought Question: What makes people more afraid of one cause of death vs another that's more statistically probable?

Context: I was having an argument with my friends and I said that if I had a son (I'm a black male), I'm not fearful of him being shot by the police. I made the point that, logically speaking, it's more likely for him to die in a car accident than by a police shooting. Therefore my fear of him dying by cop should be less than my fear of him dying by car accident. As I am not afraid of car accidents, I choose to not be afraid of the police shooting my son.

I understand that the disenfranchisement of the black population of the USA is a very real thing. I'm not arguing that it isn't. I understand that there have been several unarmed black males shot by police. I simply said that I don't have any particular fear of my son dying in that manner because, statistically speaking, it's unlikely to happen. My friends, who are more emotional than I am, couldn't understand where I was coming from. I understand that it's easier to be afraid of a man holding a gun than a hunk of metal but is my stance so alien that none of my reasonably intelligent friends could understand it?
