Fear is pretty much unrelated to actual chance of death. Chance of death is a thing that shows up in tables of actuarial data and demographics. Fear is an emotion. Probability is math. Why are people afraid of being killed by cops, or sharks, or terrorists, when all of these are pretty rare ways to die? It's because the chance of death is just a number, and numbers aren't real in the way fear is.

Fear is walking down a dark street and shivering when you see a shadow move, even though you know ghosts aren't real. Fear is buying a gun for home defense, even though doing so increases your mortality rate due to the chance of self-injury or suicide. Fear is an invisible noose snaked around your neck. Fear whispers in your ears, promising oblivion unless you have a bunker full of food and bullets under your house. Fear shows you an image of a man who looks like you dead in the street, and tells you its anecdote trumps all data. When Fear sees you examining a table of data, it slides the image of the dead man over it, and asks you to think with your heart rather than your head.

Fear is insidious, and tugs on the heartstrings in a way that data does not.
