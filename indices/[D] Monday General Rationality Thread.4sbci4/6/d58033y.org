Yesterday I read Friendship is Optimal for the first time, I avoided it because I have never been interested in MLP: FiM, and I have trouble understanding why an AI would actually behave like that. I'm not convinced it's possible to create a Paperclipper-type AI because I have trouble comprehending why an intelligence would only ever pursue the goals it was assigned at creation. I suppose it's possible, but I seriously doubt it's inevitable since human intelligence doesn't seem to treat values that way.

Even if I'm completely wrong though, why would anyone build an AI like that? In what situation would a sane person create an self-modifying intelligence driven by a single-minded desire to fulfill a goal? I would think they could build something simpler and more controllable to accomplish the same goal. I suppose the creator could want to create a benevolent God that fulfills human values, but wouldn't it be easier to take incremental steps to utopia with that technology instead of going full optimizer?

I have read the entire Hanson-Yudkowsky Debate and sided with Hanson. Right now, I'm not interested in discussing the How of the singularity, but the Why.
