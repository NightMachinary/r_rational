  Wouldn't you say evolution imposes a kind of utility function

No, natural selection imposes a filter on what life can exist, not any requirement on how it might go about doing so. Evolution is merely the surviving random walk through this filter.

That there is no requirement is somewhat evident when you look at the variety of life around us. Some is small, transient and pervasive. Some flocks together in colonies, most creatures within entirely uninterested with passing on their lineage.

But others are fleeting, like rare, dying species or even some with self destructive tendencies - humans, perhaps. These are all valid solutions to the constraint of natural selection with t=now, and though they may not be valid solutions for t=tomorrow, that's true for all but the most unchanging of species anyway.
