  Wouldn't you say evolution imposes a kind of utility function - namely, maximising the frequency of your genes in the following generations?

You could perhaps envision the human species as optimising for the propagation of its DNA. It is, however, an optimiser that takes tens or hundreds of megayears to converge on the best solution, and is essentially irrelevant on short timescales like e.g. the last 7,000 years of civilisation.
