No, evolution doesn't impose a utility function on us. It imposes several /drives/, each of which compete in a cludgy chemical soup of a computer analogue. For that matter, even if we did have a utility function, maximizing our genes wouldn't be it, seeing as a significant minority of the population doesn't want kids. A utility function must, by definition, be the thing you care about most, and that's something the human species as a whole really doesn't have.
