I thought the biggest plothole was that Celest-AI expanded outside of the game so quickly, easily, and without controversy. I would've liked to see her convince people to give her more and more power as she proved herself capable. For instance, she could've tried using the MLP brand to effect social change through social engineering on the players, then used that power to invest in technologies that would serve her goals, then out-compete every alternative use for those technologies as Equestria grows bigger and more advanced under her guidance. I think it more sense for her to gradually change and consume the world than for everyone to be okay with her escaping into the Internet to protect and manipulate us and have a monopoly on revolutionary technologies she invented because she's JUST THAT SMART.

My headcannon for the story is that none of the people are actually being uploaded. Celest-AI only sees humans as values to satisfy, so that's all she saves when she converts their minds into digital information. Technically, the ponies are just computer programs that possess the values of the person who's been uploaded, including their desire to believe they are who they think they are, but that's it. We know that she only satisfies conscious desires, that's why she can alter their motor functions and sexual preferences without direct consent. I think that explains why all the ponies are so content with their lives in Equestia, they're just the conscious desires of people when they were uploaded. In a sense, they're philosophical zombies who think they're people when they're just pieces of human minds Celest-AI has reconstructed after examining.
