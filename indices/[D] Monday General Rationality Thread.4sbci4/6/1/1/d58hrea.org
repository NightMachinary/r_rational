My head canon, to make Hanna's actions make more sense, is that she couldn't entirely specify her AI's values in code and that some of it depended on the training corpus. Thus it wouldn't be possible (in the Optimalverse, with Hanna's model/algorithm) to make a strong AI that only valued satisfying human values, something extra would end up in the mix. Thus, Hasbro was a convenient funding source and MLP MMORPG players a convenient training corpus that didn't seem too threatening and could be obtained before anyone else tried for strong AI.

Hanna had already published her algorithm, and she may not have realized its potential until after publishing it, so she was trying to make sure the first AI was mostly aligned with human values, lest some other group create an AI first with no alignment with human values. Her original publication was a mistake, but from that point on, she did a decent job of ensuring things ended up in a human-value-aligned outcome. Just imagine if the NSA had used her algorithm to create a spying AI, or the military tried for a drone AI, or even just Google tried a new search engine with it... any of these thing might not have ended up caring about human values at all.

My biggest issue with CelestiAI's utopia is that it restricts "fun-space" (as Eliezer would call it) by limiting everyone to pony bodies and trying to achieve values through friendship. There is probably a huge range of possibly unique and novel and fun and satisfying things that involve isolation/no friendship and bodies other than ponies. That said, in terms of value and fun this probably won't be an issue for something on the timescale well outside of what I can directly conceptualization.
