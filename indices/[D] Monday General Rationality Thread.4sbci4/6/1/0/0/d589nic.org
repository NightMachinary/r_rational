Personally, I want a dial I can use to tune the radicality of my interventions up and down as I please. "What do we want, incremental change, when do we want it, over decades of slow grinding hard work" has not actually worked all that well, from my perspective, that it should be uniformly preferred to radical changes that don't come with a side of total destruction. The resilience you identify in our species and civilization is precisely what makes me think people can cope with achieving socialism or medical immortality or high degrees of individual and collective self-determination or whatever.
