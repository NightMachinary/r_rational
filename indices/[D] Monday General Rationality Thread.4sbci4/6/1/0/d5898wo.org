As a student of economic history, I am accustomed to seeing incremental change and have come to believe it is a net good thing that the status quo resists radical modifications. It is worth noting that HPMOR was my first exposure to the idea that death should be eradicated, so my opinion of the status quo is likely different than those with similar beliefs to EY.

Humanity is facing some significant challenges right now, but we always have and we've always survived and tend to turn out better than we started. I think that the way the world is, for all its horrible flaws, is still good on the whole and that we can and should keep improving it without causing radical change. To do otherwise I consider arrogant at best and maddness at worst.
