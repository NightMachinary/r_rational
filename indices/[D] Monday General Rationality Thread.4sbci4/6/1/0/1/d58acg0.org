On the other hand, individual human communities /have/ been wiped out by catastrophic events. The Romans were wiped out by outside invasion, the Easter Islanders by ecological collapse, and the Amerindians by disease, and that's just three ways. Before, when one group was wiped out, the others lived on, and the "human species" continued to exist thanks to redundancy.

There is no more redundancy. There's only one human civilization right now, seven billion strong, and if we're wiped out it's right back to the stone age for the survivors. Assuming there are any.
