My point isn't that our global civilization isn't pretty much durable enough to survive anything nature can throw at it, it's that pretty much invincible isn't the same as invincible. If any catastrophe did befall it, it could spread across every continent in short order on the global economy that gives us all our technology. Yes, we're better at dealing with disease than the Amerindians, but a) we've never had to deal with diseases on the scale that they did and b) unlike them we're playing for keeps. Even if we only have a 0.01% chance of being wiped out every time a major disaster happens, it still adds up. All things being equal, eventually we'll either become so powerful that the chance goes back down to zero or we'll all die. There is no middle ground.

I shouldn't have to point out that we've already been /almost/ wiped out a few times now. We only get so many almosts before our luck runs out.
