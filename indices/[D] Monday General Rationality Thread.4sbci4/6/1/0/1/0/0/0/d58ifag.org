A key point where we disagree is that you appear to think our globalized civilization lacks the redundancy to properly defend itself from things like diseases, but I do. I think our medical infrastructure, where we have it, is excellent at preventing and containing outbreaks. The public consciousness may not thing about it very much, and when they do it is often accompanied by panic, but we still seem to be doing better than ever in spite of all that.
