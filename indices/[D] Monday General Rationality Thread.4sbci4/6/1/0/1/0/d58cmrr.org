I fail to see how that advances the argument since humans aren't at any greater risk than we always have been. For example, nuclear warfare may put more lives in danger than ever before, but the likelihood of war breaking out is lower than at any point in history. Death by violence, disease, and lack of supplies are continuously dropping with no signs of slowing down. There's work to be done, but nothing that looks insurmountable.
