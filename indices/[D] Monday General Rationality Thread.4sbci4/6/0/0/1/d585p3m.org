  I find it implausible that an AI could escape a box when the person responsible for keeping it in the box knows the implications of it escaping.

Someone may not know the implications. Besides, what's the use of an AI that can't interact with the world, at least by answering questions?

  I do not see human intelligences make decisions based purely on utility functions so I find it implausible that an AI would.

Planes are inspired by birds but they fly using different principles because imitating the flight of birds is very hard. Human intelligence may be similarly complicated, so it makes sense that AI programmers will use something simpler, like utility functions.
