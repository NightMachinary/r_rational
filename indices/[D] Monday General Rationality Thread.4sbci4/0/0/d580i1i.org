Almost any sport or exercise is more fun with a friend, so get a gym/running buddy. That's a big help.

I workout regularly but I also walk a ton, and I enjoy the latter more when I listen to podcasts while doing so. So find a nice podcast to listen to while you walk.

Try some operant conditioning: I have a favorite chocolate (white chocolate with Oreo bits) I eat only during or after strength training. It's an extra motivation to workout.
