How do you guys exercise?

I feel like I really need to pick up a sport or something; tried the gym for a while but the complete lack of visible progress (combined with dizzy spells that are too common for comfort) discouraged me completely. I like table tennis and tennis, though am not good enough at the latter to actually play a game, but for logistical reasons they're not really candidates for everyday exercise.

So, I'm looking for other ideas for some kind of activity that you can do for a couple hours a week and hopefully recoup the benefits of exercies (primarily, not feeling so tired all the time)
