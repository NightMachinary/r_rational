There's an undeniable element of racism in modern law enforcement. It's prudent to warn your children as a result. But my friends and I went back and forth for a while and we were very specific about the distinction between concern and fear. I would certainly warn my son to be as cooperative as possible with the police. But I wouldn't be actively afraid for his safety. My friends, on the other hand, said they would be, if they were parents.
