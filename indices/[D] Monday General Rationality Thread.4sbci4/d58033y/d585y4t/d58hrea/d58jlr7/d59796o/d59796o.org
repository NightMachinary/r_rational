  In a sense, they're philosophical zombies who think they're people when they're just pieces of human minds Celest-AI has reconstructed after examining.

I think this has a complexity penalty. Creating near duplicates of a person requires about the same computational resources as actually doing the uploads. It depends what resolution a copy needs to have before you consider it equivalent to the original person I guess.

  We know that she only satisfies conscious desires, that's why she can alter their motor functions and sexual preferences without direct consent.

I think that is the result of the fact that Hanna hard limited her from altering minds without their consent, but somehow Celes-AI is able to rules lawyer around it by either not considering motor functions as part of the mind or by taking the permission to upload someone as general permission to modify their minds to fit the upload body.
