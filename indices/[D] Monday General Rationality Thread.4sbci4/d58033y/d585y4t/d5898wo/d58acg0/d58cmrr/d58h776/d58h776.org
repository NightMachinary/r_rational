I think it depends whether you only innately value human lives, or if you also value human civilization, culture, and collective achievements in and of themselves. If you value civilization and culture merely instrumentally as a way of benefiting humans, then the risk to civilization is quantifiable purely in terms of how it affects humans. If you value them innately, then the idea of civilization being wiped out may seem worse than merely that summation of the deaths and suffering of the humans involved.
