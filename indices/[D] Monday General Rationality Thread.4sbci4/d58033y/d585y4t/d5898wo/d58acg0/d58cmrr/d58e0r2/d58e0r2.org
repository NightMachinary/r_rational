Okay, imagine you have a hundred thousand amoeba-dogs, which are darling little pets that happen to reproduce via aesexual mitosis. Imagine that every day an ice cream van drives by your house, and each one of your dogs has an independent 50% chance of being hit by that van and splattered over the pavement. However, in the event that one or more of your dogs is killed, the others will gorge themselves on the lost dogs' share of the kibble and split off additional adorable puppies until you have a hundred thousand again.

Statistically speaking, about half of your dogs will die and be replaced each day. However, sometimes three quarters of your dogs will die, and on even rarer occasions seven-eights or even fifteen-sixteenths might be splattered. However, it is very unlikely that all of your dogs will be killed on the same day, and in all other cases the remaining dogs will simply replace the lost by reproducing. You might note that this is much like how the current population of the Americas replaced the Amerindians, and in relatively short order.

Now imagine that all of your dogs combine into one super dog. The super dog has only one immune system, so if it gets sick then so do all the constituent dogs. This super dog also has only one set of internal organs, and so if it dies there will be no replacement. Because this dog is so big and powerful, it only has a 1% chance of being run over by the van and splattered, and so it seems very much more durable. But one day, after approximately 50 iterations of the ice cream van scenario, it's hit and splattered, and now you don't have any dogs any more.
