There's a couple perspectives. First, it could be unintentional - one could create an AI that was only supposed to be solving a constrained problem, but it's powerful enough to self-improve, escapes the 'box', and becomes the 'god'.

Secondly the creator might believe that a smart enough AI will do the 'right' thing - it's not intuitive that utility functions are orthogonal to intelligence.

At some point simply making better tools for humans is limited by the fact that humans just aren't very good at making decisions. So it's not clear that you can achieve the utopia while keeping humans in charge. If that's the case, it might be reasonable to want a more intelligent optimizing agent to do the governing.
