That's true. Maybe AI is even harder than it looks and the first artificial intelligences will actually be emulated human minds, like Robin Hanson says. Or maybe they will use neural networks and genetic algorithms and end up with something human-like by an incredible coincidence. Of course everything is speculative. Strong General AIs don't exist yet.

As for proper justification, what kinds of justification would convince you?
