I don't think intelligence operates any particular way, though. The only examples I can give are the many examples of software that works exactly as specified even when you don't want them to. Any software developer (and most computer users) will know examples of that. Granted, AI could be better than that. Or it could be worse.

For fiction like FiO, CelestAI only has to be plausible so you can suspend disbelief a little. For real life organizations like MIRI, an unfriendly AI only has to be plausible to represent a significant risk (low probability * huge cost if it goes wrong = considerable risk).
