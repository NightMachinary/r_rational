Yes, but a plane can't self modify. If the plane was able to reason and evolve then...well, we don't actually know what we will happen because it's never been done. Our only model for how intelligence works is humans, which we still don't have a complete theory to describe, so isn't saying an AI would behave a certain way speculative? I think you're just assuming AI would work this way without proper justification.
