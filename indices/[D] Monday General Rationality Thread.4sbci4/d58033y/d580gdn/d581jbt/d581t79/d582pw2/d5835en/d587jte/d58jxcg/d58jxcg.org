Given moore's law, then slowing it down a bit because every exponential curve becomes logistic, we'll likely be able to emulate human brains to an extremely high degree of fidelity by, at most, 2065 (the optimistic estimate I found just looking at the numbers was 2045, but dunning-krueger, optimism bias, etc. etc.).

50 years may seem like a long time, and relative to any living human lifespan's it is, but if anything is accelerating at a comparable rate to computational power, it's medical advancement. Life expectancy (in wealthy countries) has increased by 7 years in the past 50 years. Your average american 20 year old can therefore expect to live until 91, before taking account any major breakthroughs we're likely to have. That is to say, your average 20 year old can expect to live until 2087. That's well past the cutoff date for brain emulation. If we don't fuck up, even without GAI, we're almost guaranteed to see it happen the "normal" way-- smart people get uploaded, computer technology improves, smart people improve computer technology even faster because they're running however much faster than your average joe, and this compounds until you have emulated brains ruling the world (or at least ruling much of its resources as they make it into computronium)

So what I'm afraid of is someone /not creating god/, because the alternative is being ruled by man, and people are dicks.
