To me, that worldview sounds the same as the idea that free will doesn't exist. You can argue it from a meta perspective, but you can't actually do through life without believing you are making decisions with some degree of independence. Maybe you can, but I certainly can't. Perhaps it's just because I'm autistic, so I have to believe I can be more than I think myself to be, but if I believed what you do I would conclude life is pointless and fall into depression.

Even if you completely reject my train of thought, you must acknowledge that many people think as I do and if you seek to accomplish your goal of creating God then you must persuade us to go along with it. Maybe you've actually overcome a bias most humans have to think they have control over themselves, but that bias was put there by evolution and you're not going to convince us to overcome it as well just by saying we're all wrong.
