I'd postulate humanity doesn't have self-determination anyway; no one's in control. Creating an intelligence capable of identifying what the thing that people should do to get what they desire, and powerful enough to either implement the change or convince people to cooperate... In a fashion it's the way that humanity can finally gain some self-determination, rather than be guided by memetic brownian motions of politics (i.e. random irrelevant facts, like who's the most charismatic politician in an election, shaping the future) .
