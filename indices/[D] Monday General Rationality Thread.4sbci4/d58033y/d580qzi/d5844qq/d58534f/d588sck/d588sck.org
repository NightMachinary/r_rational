If humans were rational agents, we would never change our utility functions.

Tautologically, the optimal action with utility function =U1= is optimal with =U1=. The optimal action with =U2= may also be optimal with =U1=, but cannot possibly be better (and could potentially be worse).

So changing from =U1= to =U2= would be guaranteed not to increase our performance with respect to =U1= but would almost certainly decrease it.

Thus a =U1= agent would always conclude that changing utility functions is either pointless or detrimental. If an agent is truly rational and appears to change utility function, its actual utility function must have been compatible with both apparent states.

This means that either (a) humans are not rational agents, or (b) humans do not know their true utility functions. Probably both.
