Ok, I'm on mobile, so I can't answer you in the length your queries deserve. In summary, I disagree that such a thing is absurd, merely artificial (meaning "almost impossible to evolve rather than design") and not necessarily convergent (in the sense that every embodied-rational agent "wants to" be mapped to a corresponding economically-rational utility maximizer, or that all possible mind-designs want to be the latter rather than the former).

But the justified details would take lots of space.
