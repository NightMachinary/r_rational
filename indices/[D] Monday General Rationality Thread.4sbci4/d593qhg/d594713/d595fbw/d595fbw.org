The gameplay as it is at the moment isn't anything to write home about. It's costing on nostalgia and novelty.

That said, I've never seen -anything- have such a massive impact on person to person interactions and behavior patterns.

Even if it only lasted a week, I'm fairly confident you could label it "The pokemon week" in relevant college texts and everyone would know exactly what you were talking about.
