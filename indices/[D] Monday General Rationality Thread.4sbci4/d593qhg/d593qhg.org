So. Is anywhere doing sociological predictions and studies on the impact of pokemonGo?

Even just around here in a fairly small town / city, it's pretty crazy. It's not unocommon for me to run into groups of 6-10 wandering around the park or graveyard at 4am.

Then there are bigger things like bars that are getting a ton of business either dropping lures or giving discounted drinks to people that do so.

This has to be some social scientists wet dream of data for something or another.
