First of all: fair enough that you don't like it. I'm completely cool with it; I write for me, not for the approval of readers.

However I'd like to contend a few points you raise: I feel you have misjudged my wiritngs. I say that without reproach.

It is not original. Plot-beat for plot-beat, virtually everything is copied from canon; occasionally expanded on and rearranged in chronology. The setting is adapted to make sense as a real planet with real places, and there's a lot of 'filler' if you will, consisting of getting from point A to point B. Where canon focuses heavily on character studies, this is more the complementary study of the world and the conflict that unfolds.

It is not Grimdark, it is Nobledark. Grim implies hopelessness and powerlessness of individuals, which I sincerely hope I haven't put on the page. Noble stories in contrast have hope and heroes who matter, this one does if I've written it right. It is dark, but a frank look at warfare is dark; that is unfortunately unavoidable.

I'd also like to say that the characters are not too cool to have emotional vulnerabilities, but they bottle them up in realistic ways, and handle setbacks like professional adults; handle trauma like fragile humans in bad situations. If the characters seem cool and detached, it is because they are hiding their fears and insecurities, and in part because I am compressing the story to fit in a little over a year rather than three or four, and have aged them up accordingly.

Thank you for giving my writings a try; I really do appreciate it. :)

PS. I think it is harsh and unwarranted criticism to say my writings are unfit "for a She-Ra story." Neither you nor even Noelle get to tell me what to write; that is just a fact of my right to express myself in fanfiction.
