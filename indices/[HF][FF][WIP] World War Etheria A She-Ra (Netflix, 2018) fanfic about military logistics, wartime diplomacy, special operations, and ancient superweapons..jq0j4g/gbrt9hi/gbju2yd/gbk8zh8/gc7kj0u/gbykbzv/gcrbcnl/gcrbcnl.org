You've taken my favorite things out of canon -- the excellent worldbuilding bits -- and developed it. This was a delight to read.

I understand why you kept the stations or canon, but I'd like to see stronger justifications of character's actions and choices that broke the suspicions of disbelief to me, most importantly

* Adora forgetting about the Light Palace for so long

* Adora giving Cathra access rights

* Not mounting any princesses-led offensive ops or even doing more collateral damage on their expeditions

* Adora not applying her brilliant mind to any kingdom logistics like Hordak does
