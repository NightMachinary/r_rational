Breedy good! Definitely more thought put into the Horde vs Magical kingdoms than original show ever tried. Not grimdark at all, its violent but more like people die when fired at, rather than something like shower of gore or guts strewn on battlefield.

Relationships are very speed up, barely any development, it is based on show knowledge and fanon rather than any character behavior in story, except Scorpia (best venom bun, too precious too good for this world).

Not terribly rational, seeing as how nobody is using magic to solve food/transport or boost the economy, nor is Hordak using advanced tech to corner the economy sector via cheap plentiful products.

Powers are reasonably well developed from original.

I read all the three installments in the series, eagerly awaiting more. Gib more.
