Because her teleportation powers works like this:

- She has a 'budget' or 'pool' which recharges at a rate proportional to proximity to the Moonstone. Overuse causes migraines and 'psychic nose bleeds.'
- Her teleportation is of the 'swap volumes' type.
- The 'costs' of teleportation are determined by three things:

  - Sum of mass transferred
  - Distance transferred
  - Severance energy; that is for 'portal cuts' she needs to pay for cutting hard materials. Fluids are basically free, solids are potentially very expensive.

- Other than that her teleportation envelope can be arbitrarily complex in shape and she can re-orient objects.
- She cannot alter momentum other than to 'cancel' falls.

Glimmer is a precision sniper rifle, not a rocket ship; although both propel projectiles by way of exothermic chemical reactions, they are extremely different in application.

This is a fic about /logistics./ Why the fuck are you asking me why people are riding horses?
