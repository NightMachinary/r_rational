And that is my point; we have different tastes, I just wanted to point out that what you described not liking was perhaps an uncharitable reading.

All respect to those who write Grimdark, characters who are in fact "too cool for emotional vulnerabilities," etc. But the framing of your comment I took at least as equating these qualities with a lack of skill at writing. I then just wanted to point out that these observed characteristics were in fact put there deliberately, and were not as superficial as it may seem.

(Remember when people said HJPEV was an unrealistic 11-year-old and then 121 chapters later Big Yud reveals that whole horocrux thing? It's like that except less obstinate.)

If this artistic choice -- of writing dark stories with characters who unhealthily present a "cool" facade in the face of traumatizing experiences -- is not to your liking then all the more power to you. Life is too short to read things you don't like.

Godspeed, and may you find the She-Ra fanfic you are looking for elsewhere.
