Oh my god I didn't realize how much I needed this until I read the title. Please be good.

EDIT: Okay, not my thing at all. This is way too grimdark for a She Ra story. Also, the structure is of the "Original story, except with guns and everybody is too cool to have emotional vulnerabilities" type, which really isn't the kind of fanfic I like.
