I found it surprisingly good. MC is 'normal smart.' That's good because she's believable and well rounded (and abnormal smart is rarely well executed). She's in an odd situation and does a pretty good job of reacting to it, though she isn't rationalist or min maxy. MC has indicators of being very special and potential to be very powerful, but it still feels pretty grounded and she clearly has major threats. It hits the emotional notes decently with her connection to the other characters being interesting and developing naturally. Action is clear and interesting, though not that tense. The power interactions are worked out well, and I haven't detected any idiot balls. Solid though not super unique world building. There's an implied 'big mystery' which I felt was pretty obvious, but that's okay since it means the set up was actually done well (and it hasn't really reached that part yet so who knows how it will be handled).
