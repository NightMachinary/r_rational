So, I gave Isskai Speedrun a shot. I like the premise and I've only read one or two other speedrunning isekais so that aspect was relatively fresh.

But, man, I'm about 70% of the way through the story and I have to drop it. The MC is just too fragrantly annoying. I think his stream-of-conscioisness one-liners are supposed to be coming from a place of nervousness but after the first 10-15 chapters there's no accompanying sense of danger or feeling of exploration to really justify them. He's just going through the motions, making weebo jokes and acting random.
