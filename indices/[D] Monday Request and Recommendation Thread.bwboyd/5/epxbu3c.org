In my search for a work that has the same appeal as Worth the Candle, I came across [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21107/isekai-speedrun][Isekai Speedrun]], a complete webnovel with 61 chapters. The premise is that the MC finds himself in a game; the twist is that the game is both grimdark and full of glitches which made it popular in the speedrunning community, of which the MC is a member.

I enjoyed the MC's efforts to apply his speedrunning knowledge to his predicament, testing out which exploits still work and taking advantage of memorised secrets like it's a time loop story. The setting is fairly original and evocative, and I liked the discussion of the video game and anime, in particular their NGE-like production history. There seems to be an intentional contrast between the bleak backstory and the goofy attempts to use glitches, and between the grim amorality of everyone native to the world and the upbeat MC. This dissonance probably won't appeal to everyone, but I found it funny.

However, it could use some editing, and the climax and revelations at the end fell flat. Partially that's due to the speedrunning conceit: it's hard to maintain tension when glitches and foreknowledge are the MC's main tools. I also found the character development to be weak; unlike WtC the effects of the MC on the other characters and vice-versa weren't explored very well.

TL;DR: If you liked the first dozen chapters of Worth the Candle, you might have fun with the first dozen chapters of [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21107/isekai-speedrun][Isekai Speedrun]]. Beyond that, it probably depends on your tolerance for the writing and whether you enjoy the asides and dissonance.
