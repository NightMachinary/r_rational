You may know most of these, and they're mostly from 2017 or earlier as I haven't really had time to look for recent gems, but I wonder if these match the non-cookie-cutter requirement:

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/91029-craft-sequence][Craft sequence]] by Max Gladstone (book 1 2012 - book 6 2017)
- [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/170872-wayfarers][Wayfarers]] by Becky Chambers (2014, 2016, 2018):
- Guy Gavriel Kay?
- [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/183152-penric-and-desdemona-publication-order][Penric & Desdemona]] series by LM Bujold

I guess most of these contain some amount of unhappy, I'm not sure if you're looking for books that don't contain any suffering or just ones where it is not all there is to the book :P
