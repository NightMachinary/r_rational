Haven't thought about this one in years but it is lots of fun. It is a good adventure novel that has challenges but doesn't needlessly make the characters miserable.

I definitely wouldn't say it matches the best of QQ in intelligence, since any story that reaches that level of meta-awareness probably eats itself or blackmails its own author into locking themself in a room to write infinite sequels shortly after being completed.

The characters value brains over brawn and make an effort to be clever to the point that they immediately declare war on mythology and start turning it upside down in entertaining ways, but it is a light adventure novel that doesn't get too complicated about breaking the system. More along the lines of basic bluffing and trickery, exploiting the modern tech that was brought along with them, and gathering useful allies.

It has two sequels based on Egyptian and Norse mythology.

Summary:

An alien pyramid has appeared on Earth, squatting in the middle of Chicago. It is growing, destroying the city as it does and nothing seems able to stop it, not even the might of the US military. Somehow, the alien device is snatching people and for unknown reasons transporting them into worlds of mythology. Dr Lukacs is one of the victims. Granted, he's an expert on mythology. But myths are not something he'd thought to encounter personally. Or wanted to! Sure, he has a couple of tough paratroopers along with him, as well as a blonde Amazon biologist and a very capable maintenance mechanic. Unfortunately, modern weapons don't work, and the Greek gods are out to kill the heroes.

Well, yes, they've got Medea and Arachne and the Sphinx on their side (both Sphinxes, actually the Greek version as well as the Egyptian). And at least some of the Egyptian gods seem friendly.
