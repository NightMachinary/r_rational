These aren't particularly rational, but some books I've enjoyed:

Super-Powereds, by Drew Hayes. This is a story in the style of Harry Potter - most of the time is spent following the main characters in their lives and classes, and now and then something happens which is relevant to a larger plot. Except instead of a wizard school, it's a superhero academy.

Into the Labyrinth, by John Bierce. Nice setting, reminiscent of Tamora Pierce's books.

Schooled in Magic, by Christopher Nuttall. This is close to being cookie-cutter, but I enjoyed it anyway.
