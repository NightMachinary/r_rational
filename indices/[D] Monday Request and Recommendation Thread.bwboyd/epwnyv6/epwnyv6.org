Are there any good, well-written, non-cookie-cutter, not-full-of-unhappy novels on Kindle these days? I was originally looking for English original light novels, but really I'll take anything that matches up to the best of SpaceBattles in enjoyability or the best of Questionable Questing in intelligence. (No Earthfic please.)

PS: I am genuinely scared of whatever is happening to the titles of the dungeon and harem books proliferating in Amazon's system. It looks like someone achieved AI-equivalent humans.
