Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. You cant just say that it looks like someone achieved AI equivalent humans and leave it at that. It would be like saying "Aliens!" and leaving it at that.

I'm glancing through the titles. Theres some pretty creative titles, but none of the titles look superhumanly creative. Did the titles suddenly and dramatically increase in creativity? But I dont know what the titles were like before, nor what the time frame for the change was, so I have no way to check this for myself. Could you please elaborate on why you think it looks like the more recent titles were generated by AI equivalent humans? (Assuming I am understanding what you said correctly). Why do you believe what you believe?
