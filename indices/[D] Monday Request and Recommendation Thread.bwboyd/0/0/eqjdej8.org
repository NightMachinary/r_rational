  The decision to make Anathema a well-off American heiress rather than the novel's coding of her as poor to middle class UK native was weird, and introduced a bunch of plot and character inconsistency for no perceptible gain.

Did it? I can't think of anything right now, while on the other hand, considering Agnes Nutter's willingness to pass on excruciatingly precise prophecies for the benefit of her descendants, it'd have been weird if she didn't give them something to become filthy rich off.

  There's also some weird editing.

I felt that happened especially in episode 5. The direction was all over the place. Still, I enjoyed it as a whole, and as you said, Tennant and Sheen as Crowley and Aziraphale are a joy to watch. Really fun.

On a related note, I guess this is as good a time as any to mention to anyone who's reading this that if they lived under a rock until now, like Pratchett-esque British humour and unusual takes on Biblical canon, well, then they really really really ought to check Scott Alexander's /Unsong/.
