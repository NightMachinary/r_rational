Compared to "normal" isekais it is more about the meta-world (empty throne, angels, souls, ...) than the destination world. The usual isekai problems also get solved pretty fast (she has plenty of guns) and things escalate quickly. There is also this cool, kind of hyper-rational side character (that one has shown interest in tech, but the story isn't there yet and idk if it will go there).
