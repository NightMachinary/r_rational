I wondered why many ratfic protagonist motivation is about the greater good. Like minimizing suffering, eliminating work (pfft), societal revolution, or even put an end to death. I just read:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][Metropolitan Man]] [8/10 match to my taste if I don't have personal dislike toward fanfic, I read it because I don't have original fic on reading backlog], a fantastic good vs evil series that's not fun to read toward the end.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10327510/1/A-Bluer-Shade-of-White][Bluer Shade of White]] [9/10, same], a thought provoking gentle God concept that reeks of AI hard-on, and

- [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][A Hero's War]] [7/10] A kingdom building with awful choice for POV characters.

I'm seeking a fiction where the protagonist has more basic motive. Something like greed, lust, or revenge. Survival also works, but I'd rather not read it if character's adversary is artificially created (like dungeon where stronger and stronger adventurer keep coming). But definitely not the greater good motive (ew). Same criteria as [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bqwp8b/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/eobhusd/][the last time I post a request]]. But this time, I'd like it if it's freely available. Thank you.
