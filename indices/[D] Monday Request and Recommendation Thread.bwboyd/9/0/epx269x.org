Most ratfic inherently hews to the Effective Altruist party line of "a rational and moral agent should try to maximize their positive impact on the world," so it's no surprise this sub is full of such things.

That said, the 3 protags of Pokemon: Origin of Species all have deeply personally-motivated goals, and while 2/3 have some sort of "greater good" in mind (ending death/general futurism and ending pokemon and human suffering respectively), they're not nearly as in-your-face about it as HJPEV. The third protag just wants to be a really good pokemon trainer.

It's also extremely well-written and very fun.
