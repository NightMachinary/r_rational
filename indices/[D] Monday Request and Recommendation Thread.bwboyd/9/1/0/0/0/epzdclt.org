I suppose MCU Thanos must be written that way so that it appeals to general movie-goer. I heard, though, that Thanos actually do what he did because he's enamoured by an incarnation of Death, the sexy one. I admit I do not look deep into the lore, but whatever altruistic reason he get along the way, his root cause is courting that Death.

But my point is we're not general public. We seek a rational protagonist who achieve his goal without abandoning his mindful rationality. Despite adversary that's more, or at least equally, competent. Despite the world that's already so established the free lunch is no longer exist. And I personally wish for a protagonist who's utterly selfish. I think, it's easier to understand that kind of character.
