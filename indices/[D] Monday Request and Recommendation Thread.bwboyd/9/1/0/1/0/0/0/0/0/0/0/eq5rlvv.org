Just watch one of them and tell me your opinion after I guess. The Godfather for instance is supposed to be an all time classic.

Oh and I thought of another one which was pretty recent. I'll spoiler it because that part isn't at all clear initially. The Favourite.

Honestly though, one could say that almost every historical movie that depicts the people in power as main characters (as opposed to the oppressed rebels fighting for freedom) has a touch of this. As do many black comedies in general.

Edit: Two more for the list with a different feel from the previous ones.

- Dream Home (Hong Kong black humor movie about a woman who /really/ wants to buy a certain appartment)

- Filth (narcissist Scotland cop on a downward spiral)
