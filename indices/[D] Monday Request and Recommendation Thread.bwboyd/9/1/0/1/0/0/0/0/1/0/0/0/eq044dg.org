I was just going by the ones on that list I've actually read. All of which had characters who did bad things, but for "good" or sympathetic reasons. Of the 4 you mention, I've only read Lolita... And I'll give you that I enjoyed the book and the character was not doing things for "good" and was not sympathetic (but I will say I enjoyed the book for it's prose and thought-provokingness and not because the character was entertaining. More like a non-fiction work.)

The other person replying to me said they wanted to read books that contained protagonists who do bad things for no morally good reason, so I was also accepting that I'm wrong on that front.

I think, for me, part of it must be that if I don't identify with a character I've probably put the work into the box of "character study" or the like. For me, if I don't identify with the character at all they themselves are definitely not /entertaining/.
