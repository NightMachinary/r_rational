Does anyone have recommendations on how to find good content? Currently my methods are this thread, asking in subreddits like [[/r/books]] or [[/r/anime]] if I have something somewhat specific I'm looking for, and just browsing the front pages of YouTube and Netflix. I feel like I could be doing much better, there're enormous amounts of content in the world to read and watch, yet I somehow have difficulty identifying content I'd like to read and watch.
