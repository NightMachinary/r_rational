Go to the fandoms of works you like Fanfiction.net and ao3. Then use these filter heuristics:

Fanfiction.net

- words - over 10k (to get ongoing stuff)\\
- updated in last six months OR complete to avoid deadfics.
- sort by follows (you want at least a hundred on any large to medium fandom, usually)\\
  *without romance/with adventureb to get a story with a plot, the opposite to get fluff

AO3

- go to the "advanced search options" page.
- use your fandom name.
- greater than ten kudos.
- no explicit content (unless you want that)\\
- no crossovers (or you'll get stories with retarded amounts of tags that are just authors exploiting AO3 to get subscribers for their vast list of oneshots)
