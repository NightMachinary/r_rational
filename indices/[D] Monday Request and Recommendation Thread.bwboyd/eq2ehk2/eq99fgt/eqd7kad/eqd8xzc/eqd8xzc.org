That and the slime one are going to be subpar in terms of writing / translation quality, if you're not used to reading that sort of thing. /Kumo desu/ is a bit better but very stream of conscious. /Wrong Hero/ is similar quality to /Daily Grind/, but it's still early days for the story itself. *Runelords* is obviously superior to all In terms of writing and editing.
