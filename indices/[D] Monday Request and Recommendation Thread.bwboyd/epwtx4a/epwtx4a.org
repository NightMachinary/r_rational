I watched Good Omens the six-part TV series that came out Friday. TL;DR review: Read the book if you haven't, miniseries is decent but not amazing.

The novel Good Omens by Gaiman and Pratchett was one of my favourites of all time, and I've read and reread it kind of a lot. Strongly recommend the novel - it is excellent, and if not exactly 'rational' it has a strongly humanist message that is certainly rational-adjacent in theme. About the end of the world as foretold in Christian eschatology, it's a witty and humorous book that ultimately has a great fast-moving plot and basically no problems or defects of any sort.

Overall, it felt like the TV series stuck to the novel very hard - possibly to the detriment of the series as a whole. They were dedicated to using most every joke and plot point from the novel, even when it didn't make sense necessarily with the medium or the updated setting. The miniseries was definitely set in the present day, i.e. ~2019ish, but the novel was grounded in the time and place of it's publication date, 1990, - so certain plot points like Crowley's tape ansaphone feel wildly out of setting / out of character for a 2019 Crowley archetypal character. I'd have prefered it if they either made it a period piece set in the early 90s, or updated the entire plot. The decision to make Anathema a well-off American heiress rather than the novel's coding of her as poor to middle class UK native was weird, and introduced a bunch of plot and character inconsistency for no perceptible gain. The narration of the story got quite heavy-handed at times, explaining things that were obvious to those paying attention, and basically ruining what could have been a couple of decent jokes by overexplaining and slowing them down too much - it was overused.

A huge amount of Good Omens novel fanfic is/was dedicated to the Crowley/Aziraphale ship, which the TV series did not make explicit but definitely hinted more heavily than the novel did, and the series focused more on them as characters than anyone else. This is probably for the best because Tenant's Crowley and Sheen's Aziraphale are the best characters and actors in the whole thing, and focusing on their relationship was definitely fun. There's a lot of stuff with Adam that got cut and it hurt the plot a bit IMO but on the other hand the children actors gave reasonably good performances for child actors, and thus were mediocre at best by the more stringent standards we'd apply to adults, so it's probably overall for the best.

There's also some weird editing. A couple of jokes still show up in the miniseries without the same setup/payoff that they had in the novel, so it feels weird and out of place to have them in there - for example, the Des Moines Elvis thing had no payoff but Elvis was still in the Des Moines scene.

I liked a lot of it, but overall the book still remains a must-read while the miniseries is more of a 'if you're bored' recommendation.
