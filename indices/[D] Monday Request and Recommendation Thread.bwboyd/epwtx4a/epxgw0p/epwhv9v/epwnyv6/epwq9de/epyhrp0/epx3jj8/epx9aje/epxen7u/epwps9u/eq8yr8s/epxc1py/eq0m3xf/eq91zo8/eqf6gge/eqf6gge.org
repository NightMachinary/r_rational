The Dungeon novels I've read do seem unusually trope-y. Which is a shame, since I genuinely like the concept of a sentient dungeon as a protagonist. Bunker Core was probably the best of them, but I'm not sure if the author is continuing the series.

(If you count Dungeon Lord that's far and away the best; but the protagonist isn't a dungeon, but a human with Sauron type powers in an RPG mechanics world)
