Bujold, and Pratchett are the strongest recs I have for "Not Dark", "Original" and "Smart". But I would be quite surprised if you had not already read those.

Graydon Saunders is very much what you are looking for, I think, but has strong objections to amazon, so is not available there (Got his works via google play, which is convenient enough)

Egan, Vinge are also good, but occasionally dark. Never oppressively so, however.

Marie Brennan, the lady Trent series.
