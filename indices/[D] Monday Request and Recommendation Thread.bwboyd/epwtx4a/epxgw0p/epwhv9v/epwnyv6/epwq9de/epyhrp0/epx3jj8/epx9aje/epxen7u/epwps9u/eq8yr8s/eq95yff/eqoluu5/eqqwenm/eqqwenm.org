  AI-Equivalent humans, that sounds like "I think a human may have gone FOOM"

That's not what he's saying. AI-Equivalent humans wouldn't be humans that have gone FOOM, because AI has not gone FOOM. Human-Equivalent AI would be an extraordinary claim; AI-Equivalent Humans are just humans that generate slightly different versions of the same repetitive content over and over again, like modern AIs do. The recent titles look like they were created by AI-like humans because they are boring and repetitive. In other words, Eliezer is being cute here, not serious.
