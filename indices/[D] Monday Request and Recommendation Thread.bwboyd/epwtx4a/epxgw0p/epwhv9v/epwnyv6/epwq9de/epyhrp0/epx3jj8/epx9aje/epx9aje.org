- I liked Martha Wells' Murderbot series. Mostly, the main character spends its time being mad about how incompetent humans are at everything.
- You might like The Engineer by Darren M. Handshaw. It's a kind of post apocalypse, but not the awful depressing kind. The main character also does realistic engineering (mostly stuff you could realistically achieve with medieval tech). I didn't finish it but I don't really remember why.
- I quite liked pretty much all of Drew Hayes' novels, they're generally enjoyable and not about depressed or depressing people.
- I also really liked Edward W. Robinson's Cycle of Arawn series - it's got a main character who grows powerful over time thanks to intelligently exploring and using his powers, and is generally an enjoyable swords and sorcery adventure.
- Similarly, Mark Lawrence's Prince of Thorns series is also quite good - bad things happen to the main character, but he doesn't let that get him down. He turns in to the bad thing that happens to other people. The whole series is very Dying Earth, too, which is fun.
