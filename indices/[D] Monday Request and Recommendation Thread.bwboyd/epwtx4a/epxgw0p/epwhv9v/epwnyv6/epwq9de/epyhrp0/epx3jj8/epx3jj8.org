I've recommended the [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/30344847][Masters and Mages]] series a few times here already, but that's because it really is good. The first part of the first book especially was a breath of fresh air for me, just a young guy with the world at his feet thinking about his situation and his prospects, working out his problems in his head. And it was interesting!

I wouldn't say it's rational(the magic system is a bit fuzzy, especially in the second book), but the author is a history buff--medieval scholar and HEMA practitioner-- and actually put some thought into the history of the world, into why politics are the way they are and how the conflicts that the story revolves around actually came about. Like I said, it's the first fantasy book in a while that felt like it broke the mold.

Another story in the vein of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsroman][Bildungsroman]] is [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44327636-the-first-step][The First Step]], this time a competently written xianxia(what a rarity!). Another story of the guy with the world at his feet, on a journey of discovery. Pretty good, and unlike in Cradle, the setting feels very chinese.
