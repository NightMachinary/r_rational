I understand if you're really busy and don't feel like this question is worth answering, but when ELIEZER YUDKOWSKY says he's scared of possiblity of AI-Equivalent humans, that sounds like "I think a human may have gone FOOM" and that can raise some alarm. So I just want to double check to make sure I'm understanding correctly, that that isn't what you meant.

Thanks!
