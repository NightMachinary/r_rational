I think that you might enjoy the work of Christopher Nuttall. He is not an explicitly "rational" author but many of the themes that he explores are closely related and his characters are generally well developed.

Nuttall is a prolific writer, so I would recommend starting with the Ark Royal series as it exemplifies much of his writing style. It is relative cheap but if you are still uncertain than you can find a large sample of the text on his website.
