That's what I was clarifying in the edit in my original post: those works all feature protagonists who are on the wrong side of whatever law-system they're in. That's what's making them "villains" What they do, they're doing for morally good purposes, basically. Otherwise it's a turn-off for the reader.

The original point of this thread was that protagonists were for 'the greater good' and villain protagonists don't really go against that, as far as I've seen.
