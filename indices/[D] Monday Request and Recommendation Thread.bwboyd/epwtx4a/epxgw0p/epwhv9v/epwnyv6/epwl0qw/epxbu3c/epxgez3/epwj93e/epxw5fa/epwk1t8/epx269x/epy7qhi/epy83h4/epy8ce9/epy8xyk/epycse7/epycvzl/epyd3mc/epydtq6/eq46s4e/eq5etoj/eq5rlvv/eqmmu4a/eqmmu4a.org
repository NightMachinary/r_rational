The appeal comes partly from hoping they'll get their redemption, or from watching them interact with the world in general.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Company][Black Company]] follows a band of ruthless mercenaries, but the book is written as the annals of the band, so a lot of their really vile shit is glossed over because the writer is a softie. I don't actually /like/ any of the characters, but they're still fun to read about for the most part.

[[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]] tells the story of a young child who is a state-sponsored terrorist in a Biopunk style world. It is his coming-of-age story, and you could argue that he's fighting /even worse/ monsters, but the truth of the matter is that he only really cares for his group of friends, and perhaps children in the abstract. Nonetheless he's a lot of fun to read.
