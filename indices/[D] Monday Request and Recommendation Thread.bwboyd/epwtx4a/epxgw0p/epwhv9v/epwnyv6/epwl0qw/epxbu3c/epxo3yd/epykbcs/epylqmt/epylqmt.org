Power fantasy and some politics. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ax82yl/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/ehsjp5j/][Here]]'s the posting I made about it after finding it a few months ago, with some discussion.

I've actually put it on hold since then so I can binge it, so the details are a little fuzzy.

But she is transported to this other world, where she uses her knowledge and tech to make things easier, with the overall goal of getting back home. she can learn (and does learn) how to use the magic that is available in this world. Plot progresses like an isekai-adventurer story mixed with a D&D campaign. Author does a great job in making the MC powerful enough that it's fun but not so powerful she doesn't face setbacks.

In the background is the story of the angels who act as reapers or Death (the soul ferrying kind). Shennanains and power plays are what we get, here, where angels oversee individual worlds/dimensions and there's the usual Heavenly Host heirarchy type of deal.

Hope that helps. Not 100% rational but a fun story.
