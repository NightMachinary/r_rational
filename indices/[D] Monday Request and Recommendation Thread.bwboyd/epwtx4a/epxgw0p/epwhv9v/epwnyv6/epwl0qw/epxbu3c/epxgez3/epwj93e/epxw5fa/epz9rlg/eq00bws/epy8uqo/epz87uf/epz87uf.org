I've got to ask why I keep seeing this recommended. I remember a few months back giving it a shot and it seemed almost anti-rational and mostly just a super angsty slice of life fic where everyone panders to the MC because she's cute and talented. I think I stopped reading because, aside from the above, she kept using her lethal poisons that kill in minutes instead of her non-lethal poisons that can incapacitate someone almost instantaneously, and the result was her nearly dying on multiple occasions.
