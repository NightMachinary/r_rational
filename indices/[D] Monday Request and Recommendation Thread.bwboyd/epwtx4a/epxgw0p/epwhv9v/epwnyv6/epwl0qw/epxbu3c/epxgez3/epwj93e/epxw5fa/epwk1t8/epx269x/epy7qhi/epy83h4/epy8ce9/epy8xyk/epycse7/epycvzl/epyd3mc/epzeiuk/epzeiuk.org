Because it's boring. In many works of fiction, everybody has their definition of good and they want to do good according to their own definition. The story usually is about conflicting definition of good, either between the protagonist and the antagonist, or between his conscience and the culture (s)he live in.

I want protagonist who seeks revenge, who's willing to sabotage to hurt their enemy the most. I want protagonist who heed their lust, who breaks family because the dude/dudette (s)he fancy is already taken. That kind of basic motive is more real. Doing good is vague. Besides, moving against widely acceptable value is a great challenge on itself. Are you not interested reading about a home wrecker so skilled the ex did not hold grudge? (Wow, that sounds so scandalous)
