Author here, I agree it's not really a rational fiction in the strict sense at all. And maybe not in the loose sense either.

MC has the social skills of an empathic toddler.

He is smart about some things that he knows well, but he isn't any kind of genius.

Story has some macguffins and arbitrary author fiat decisions.
