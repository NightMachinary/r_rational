Idk why people are mostly just recommending fanfiction and web stories to you; probably something could be said about how telling that is but w/e. If you're having difficulty finding things to enjoy, is that because you don't know what you like or is that because you don't know how to find more of what you like? In the first case, your best bet would be to just consume whatever is yknow critically acclaimed in order to see if you like it. In the second, idk, Google search has always been my friend.
