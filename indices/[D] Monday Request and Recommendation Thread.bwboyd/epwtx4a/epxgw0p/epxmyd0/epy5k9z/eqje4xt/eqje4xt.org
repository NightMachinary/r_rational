For anime I feel like there's extensive recommendation threads on [[/r/anime][r/anime]] as well as [[https://imgur.com/gallery/yPVPj9Q][a famous "find your ideal anime" flowchart]]. And if you care to share with me your MAL or just a list of shows you liked, I guess I can hazard some suggestions...

For books, maybe try to browse GoodReads? I'm not sure what's a good way, sifting through lots of crap is always almost inevitable before you find the good stuff. Usually having like-minded people to talk with about these things is your best bet, because what they liked, you will probably like too.

Oh and if you like hard sci-fi and haven't read anything by Greg Egan, read Greg Egan. There, you may have solved your problems for a little while.
