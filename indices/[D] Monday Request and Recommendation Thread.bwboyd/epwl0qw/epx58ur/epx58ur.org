The anime Re:Zero has the protagonist return to certain “checkpoints” after dying, and the problem solving involves using multiple loops to get to a good resolution. On a more limited scope, in Mo Dao Zu Shi the protagonist is a master cultivator who was killed and then ends up possssing a new body, making a new start, but maintaining his knowledge of cultivation techniques and such. I have not finished it yet, but so far it is good, and I have gotten many recommendations for it from other people.
