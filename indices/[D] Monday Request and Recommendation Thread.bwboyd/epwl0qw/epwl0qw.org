Looking for stories where the MC is able to return from and learn from death like in a video game. Whether through a timeloop or some other method. Already read or reading Mother of Learning, Time Braid, All you need is kill/Edge of tomorrow. I'm not sure about VR based stories since all of the players would have the same ability. Alternatively, if there is a reincarnation story where they end up in the past with future knowledge and skills which is good, I could try that as well. That's kind of similar because they at least learned from one death.
