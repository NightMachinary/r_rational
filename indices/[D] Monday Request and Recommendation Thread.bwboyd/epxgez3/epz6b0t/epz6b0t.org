If you like fanfiction there are some good timeloop stories.

Harry Potter: Backwards with Purpose (Always and always). There's a sequel to it as well that you should read if you read that one. Oh also this one isn't quite time loop but travelling back in time to do it over better.

Naruto: Timebraid (warning, it has lots of sex for some reason)
