Interpreting time loop on the more liberal side:

Primer (movie): my favorite movie, some engineers develop boxes that can bring them back in time, but only as far back as the box was turned on. Gambit pileup ensues.

Looper (movie): have not watched yet, but have heard it's good.

Re:Zero (anime): isekai guy returns to “checkpoints” of a sort whenever he dies, uses this power to try and achieve a good route through life.

All You Need is Kill (light novel): soldier, basically same power, returning by death, fighting alien invasion. They also made a nice live action movie adaptation.

Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (web novel): time turners get used, much more than in the Rowling novels.

Puella Magi Madoka Magica: mega spoilers, and I'm on mobile so let me know if you want to know the spoilers. It has (spoilery) time loops.

And also, here is a thread of more “classic” SF story recommendations, also asking for time loops: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/1pa4w4/looking_for_time_loop_stories_any_good/]]

Bonus anime rec: Mirai Nikki; there are not really time loops, but more seeing the future. It is not quite so “hard”, but I found it quite enjoyable.
