Have you ever heard [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21623/the-perks-of-immortality][The Perks of Immortality]]? The protagonist is always brought back to life, but he isn't told why. He do not keep unlocking similar skills, the story didn't work that way. Instead, before a reincarnation, he's offered, other than unlocking new skills, some experience to carry over. The new incarnation is not exactly similar either, there's always variation that's outside his control. Interesting world building, simplistic protagonist, increasingly challenging adversary it triggers survival motive. Not a ratfic due to the protagonist never tried to define his motivation, nevermind exclusively work toward it. He did do things efficiently, but it's due to experience, not creative thinking.
