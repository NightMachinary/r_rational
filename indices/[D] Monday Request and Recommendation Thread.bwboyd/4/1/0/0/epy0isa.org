No personal experience with the Re:Zero web novel, but I'm also loooking forward to S2. To be honest, the reliving aspect in Mo Dao Zu Shi is pretty minor, but I am greatly enjoying it as my first real experience with the xianxia (cultivation) genre. Also, I recalled the short story The Keeper, at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/creatorcorvin/comments/8f7if1/the_keeper_part_1/]] which has return by death as its central premise.

Edit: also the anime Youjo Senki has a mature person reincarnated as a child in a magical world, making use of their intelligence to become a prodigy. Secondly, and a bit more loosely fitting, Puella Magi Madoka Magica has time loops with learning from mistakes to try to find a “good route”. More details are spoilery, but it is probably my favorite anime overall, so I would definitely recommend it.
