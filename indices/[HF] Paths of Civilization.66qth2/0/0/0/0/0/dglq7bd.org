"we're making optimal choices"... heh.

More seriously though, my issue is that it's not really rational fiction since the story isn't really about the characters. There isn't really any sort of a cohesive plot, which I see as a necessary component. It's a game/simulation much more than it is a story, disqualifying it from the "rational fiction" category.

My apologies, I didn't state my point clearly at the start, and I should not have thrown in that last bit on my first post.
