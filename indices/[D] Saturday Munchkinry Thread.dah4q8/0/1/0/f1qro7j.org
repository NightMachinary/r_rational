  Looks like $100,000+ annual income's have an average of $66,451 a year of discretionary income

I'm not sure the discretionary income they mean is actually discretionary. $100k is going to mean that 66k is just after taxes, if even that much. Someone with 66k after taxes can't spend it all on having fun, unless they neither need a place to live, have kids, eat, or save for retirement. And that's just federal taxes only.
