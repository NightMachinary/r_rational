I don't think 48k a year gets you anywhere close to safely testing novel drugs. Even if you mean new designer drugs (known mechanism of action, new molecule to target it) I think you'd need far more to safely test them. I'd highly recommend not doing this, chemistry on a large scale still often fails at making known products using known methods even without the drugs possibly having harmful effects alone.

With 48k a year you could do a hell of a lot of drug tourism though! It's not illegal if you go to places where the laws a different! Much safer too, stick to the drugs we have historic experience with even though there still isn't nearly enough research. LSD and THC appear to be the highest fun/risk in my opinion.
