I'd like to put forth that there's quite a few unique sorts of psychedelic experiences that you can only have if you can afford to spend a lot of money.

For instance unlike many other psychedelics DMT doesn't rapidly build tolerance in the same way that say acid does. So if you could afford it you could potentially prepare an IV of DMT (plus some beta blockers) and trip for as many hours as you want. Given how short typical DMT visions are (not that they can't pack a whole lot into that time) this might allow your trips to become qualitatively different and may unlock all kinds of novel altered states/experiences.\\
Similarly with money you could afford your own soundproofed sensory deprivation tank to be used as much and whenever you want. So this combined with access to lots to psychedelics could allow you lots of unique experiences most psychonauts never get access to.
