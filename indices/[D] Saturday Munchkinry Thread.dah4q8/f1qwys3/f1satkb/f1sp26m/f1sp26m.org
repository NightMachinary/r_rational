Insider trading and the prestige could presumably be done with any twin regardless of the memory sync/day old clone.

When one clone sleeps, if there are two awake clones then he gets the memory of the one that slept most recently.

Information travels at light speed or if an ftl method is invented via that.

Uh lucid dreaming, I don't know how you could tell if it was synced during dreams or not. I guess if you force yourself to wake up and your clone wake up at same time. Seems okay I suppose
