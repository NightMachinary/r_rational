You wakeup one day with two clones. Memory syncs during sleep.

So divergence can only be as long as you can stay awake, and no three brains one consciousness.

How can you use this? You'd need to sleep to beat that 1 million challenge of knowing what your sibling knows with no communication

People you know don't freak out about the clones and they get a duplicate of all your possessions including birth certificate and bank accounts. You get to choose the name during your sleep before they appear
