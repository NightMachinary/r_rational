If I have a few years, "insider" trading could become pretty successful or simply engaging in corporate espionage. Magic tricks ala The Prestige could be another easy form of currency, as well as running con scenarios.

Question: does memory sync when any one clone sleeps? Or only when all three clones are all sleeping concurrently, or is there some sort of "Clone A sleeps, so his memories get stored, but Clone B doesn't get them until he sleeps" paradigm? Does the memory travel faster than light? IE if I'm in Alpha Centauri and my clone is on earth, can I get FTL communication?

What about Lucid Dreaming? Do those update in real time while we're sleeping?
