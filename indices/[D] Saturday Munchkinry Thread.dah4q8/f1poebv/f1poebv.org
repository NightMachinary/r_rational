In general, there's an Earthfic/real-world munchkinry question of what a protagonist should do once rich. Surprisingly few stories focus on this question for how large it would loom in reality; "Jumper" (the novel) is the main case that springs to my mind. I have at least two old story ideas on the backboiler that imply wealth acquisition by the protagonist.

Suppose a protagonist wants to spend an average of $1000/week on having fun. How could they spend that intelligently?
