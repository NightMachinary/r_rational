$1000/week on average, so you could pool it but even 1k a week might be enough for one person. Depending on where you live it's "only" hundreds for flights then you spend the rest on a room and food for a few days, or you could drive and camp/RV. Crossing the pond weekly isn't worthwhile (to me), it's just under a thousand for a round trip and you wouldn't fly that just for a weekend but it's easy to do for one week a month with 4k to burn.
