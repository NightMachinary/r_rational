On having fun? Well, it's a kinda obvious answer, but it seems like drugs should probably be part of that money. WHICH drugs is a highly important question, since some would lead to lower fun in the long run and thus would not be an intelligent use of the money, but it's also fairly personal to the protagonist and their drug preferences, as well as their level of risk tolerance. Certainly there are those who just don't enjoy mind altering substances whatsoever, but I think safe and fun use of mind altering substances is an area that's been underexplored in rational fiction.

If it were me, I'd spend part of that money on custom syntheses (or the equipment to do it myself) of various structurally novel psychedelics that have never been explored before. But that's a pretty personal goal, and my wish to do so is more out of a desire to explore than belief that those novel drugs would, in a manner entirely separate from that desire, also happen to provide more fun/$ and a better ratio of fun to risk (the risk is, I believe, lower than most would assume, but it's certainly higher than an already proven very safe drug like LSD).

That said, not ALL the money should be used on drugs, certainly. Drugs are, IMO, usually best used to make a fun experience way more fun, not as the only fun thing you're doing (some exceptions being drugs that offer fully immersive experiences, like DMT or salvia).
