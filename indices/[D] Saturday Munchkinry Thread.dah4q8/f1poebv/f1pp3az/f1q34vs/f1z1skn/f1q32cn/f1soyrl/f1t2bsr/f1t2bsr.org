  I don't think 48k a year gets you anywhere close to safely testing novel drugs.

Assuming we're talking about 48k a year PLUS everything needed to survive (Eliezer's post seemed to me to imply that that budget is only for fun), it depends on where you put the bar at "safely" at. I'd need to look up custom synth and identity+purity testing prices, but I'd expect it to be feasible. But if you're talking the kind of extensive testing we perform on animals for each new drug, then obviously yeah, 48k a year is nowhere NEAR enough. But I honestly don't believe that that kind of testing is likely to be necessary when we're only talking about small modifications to existing structures.

As I said, I personally think the risks are somewhat lower than you're imagining, but they're certainly higher than something proven safe like LSD. For me personally, I believe that's a risk I'd consider worthwhile for the sake of exploration if I had the money to do so. For others who don't share that desire to explore the frontiers of alterations to subjective experience, LSD will do just fine and is much safer. And there are steps in between exploring truly novel structures like Shulgin did and like I wish I could do and just using the mainstays like LSD; for example just exploring the commercially available "RCs". The various dialkyltryptamines (at least the ones that have appeared so far, and likely all the others with relatively simple alkyl substituents), for example, almost all appear to be around the safety level of DMT itself (with a few key exceptions, of course, so caution is warranted), and the same is true for their 4-hydroxy counterparts with regards to psilocin. But their effects can vary greatly compared to the parent compound. For those with lower risk tolerance than me in this regard but who still wish to explore, that appears to be a very safe and fruitful area to explore, and one that (last I checked) is in a pretty good period in terms of commercial availability (but also still has some easy areas left virtually completely unexplored, like PiPT).

Reckless exploration would be, well, reckless. But it is very possible to mitigate risk by various methods, including starting at very low doses and working upwards, picking modifications that seem likely to be safe (this gets easier as the SAR of a category becomes better understood), and ideally testing at least LD50 on animals. There will be some risk, but I value exploration even at the cost of personal risk, and this is the kind of research that can only be DONE with some degree of personal risk, at least ethically. Animal research can maybe tell us if a compound is a psychedelic (with some degree of accuracy), but the exact nature of the experience could not be learned that way.
