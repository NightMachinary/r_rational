Oh, yeah, for sure, there's plenty of opportunities for experimentation even BEFORE getting into actually novel drugs. Plus access to drugs that aren't strictly speaking new but which are rare and expensive, like 5-Br-DMT (a naturally occuring analog of DMT found in some sea sponges, but which to my knowledge has only been tried by a single person).
