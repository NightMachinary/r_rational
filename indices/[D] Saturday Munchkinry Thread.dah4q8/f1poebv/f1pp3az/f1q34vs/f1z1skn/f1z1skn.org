It depends on what you're optimizing for:

Most cost-effectively? Buy and play video games. With games like Stormworks, Kerbal Space Program, ArmA 3, Skyrim, Minecraft, Terraria, Space Engineers, Factorio, Stellaris, and Civilization (choose from IV, V, IV, or Beyond Earth), you could easily have an amazingly fun time playing for over two years as if it was your full-time job and spend no more than $1,500 on the games, expansions, computer and accessories combined over the entire timespan. Additionally, if you need to lose weight, some of these games are addictive enough that (for me at least), it is possible to be so immersed in the game as to neglect meals, making it trivially easy to perform intermittent fasting. Some of these games can also teach you skills that are useful in real-life, like programming in C# with Space Engineers or with Lua in Stormworks.

Most enjoyably? That depends on personal preferences, so there's a wide range of potential answers. It could encompass movies, games, music, books, hiking, painting, hang gliding, skydiving, surfing, dancing, drinking, fucking, partying, traveling, or even just talking with friends, among many other possibilities.

Most productively? Creative hobbies and exercise. For example, building and programming a robot can be a lot of fun, plus it has useful applications. Writing a book or designing a game which revolves around some technical subjects could be fun and drive you to do some fairly in-depth research on the topic. On the other side, exercise will keep you healthy so you don't end up spending the last few decades of your life with a body crippled by obesity, atrophied muscles, and frail bones. A healthy balance of exercise and creative hobbies seems like the most productive approach.

Of course, there's also a strong argument in favor of variety. Everything gets boring eventually. It's obviously reasonable to pick some of these choices (depending on what you're optimizing for) until you get bored of it and then switch over to something else that you enjoy, and then come back to old hobbies when they strike your interest again.
