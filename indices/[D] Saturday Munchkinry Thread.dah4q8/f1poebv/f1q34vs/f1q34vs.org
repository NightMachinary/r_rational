I'm not even sure $48,000 of frivolous spending is the kind of rich most people think of. Looks like $100,000+ annual income's have an average of $66,451 a year of discretionary income ([[https://www.marketingcharts.com/industries/financial-services-2340]]) and this gets even higher as you get to higher incomes. Here's my suggestions though:

Short term fun: Eat at fancy places, party, and travel.

Longer term fun:

Find a sport or hobby you love and spend on that. It's probably the best cost/benefit I know of. Wealthy people tend to do this naturally.

Hire a weekly: personal financial manager, personal trainer and/or physical therapist, chef, massage therapist, fashion manager, maid. I'm sure there's some kind of professional home manager, get one of those. Essentially remove all the thinking and maintenance work for everything you don't love, and let professionals handle that for you. I believe this is currently highly undervalued as evidenced by the large number of professionals who struggle with many of these topics when they should just put professionals in charge of them. Doctor's struggling with food and exercise springs to mind.

Buy: very nice quality versions of whatever you use daily. 1k a week you can get one or two super nice smaller items a week and get the entertainment of researching them if you want to.

Lease a fun car.
