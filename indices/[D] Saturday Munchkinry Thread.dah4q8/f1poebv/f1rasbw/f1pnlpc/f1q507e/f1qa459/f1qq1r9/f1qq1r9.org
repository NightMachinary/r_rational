One problem would be everything you try to push through just gets blocked by your alternate pushing the same thing through. Addressing the resulting questions of free will would be interesting.

I finished Ted Chiang's collection of short stories last week, and this is the second time one of its stories has come up here on [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. Anyway, check out "Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom" which looks at a similar question. In that world, there's one quantum change and then the two resulting timelines can communicate for a limited amount of bits (but no more matter moves).

Also the Starz series Counterpart is an interesting look at this.

Can the teleport be in space as well as timelines? Put a drain from the Pacific onto the surface of Mars?
