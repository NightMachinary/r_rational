I have a sort of anti-munchkinry question. There's an absurdly powerful device, and I want to find mundane uses for it.

You have a device that teleports you to any fictional universe that has some physical presence on Earth (more specifically defined as the planet where you first got this device). It can be a bunch of text documents on a hard drive, an artwork, a song recorded on a cassette, anything like that. Being physically present as neurons and synapses in someone's mind doesn't count.

The rules are the follows:

1. You can choose at what point in the history of the world do you arrive. You also have control over the exact place of arrival, down to a centimeter.

2. If you choose so, the device can make up a backstory for you, so you can more or less naturally blend into the story. Of course, if you look and/or act nothing like the native inhabitants of the world, your presence will still raise questions.

3. The device makes logic of the world consistent, creating explanations that make the existence of such a universe possible. For example, even you go to a world that's described as "everything's the same as Earth, but all forms of cancer are cured," not literally /everything/ will stay identical since there was an event that made the cure possible.

4. You can't bring anyone with you when teleporting. When going back, you are going to be restored to the state before the teleportation (the same body, the same clothes, etc). The device tries its best to prevent you from bringing any object from one universe to another. You keep all the memories though.

5. While you are away, the time passes on Earth (and other worlds, all relative to you); it will seem like you disappeared without a trace.

6. This device is literally one of a kind. There's no such object in any of the universes, and any attempt to replicate it will inevitably fail.

So, of course, you can hire a ghostwriter to write about a universe where everything is perfectly aligned with your hopes and dreams, and move here. You can create/choose a world that is one hundred percent like Earth, move to interesting points in time and learn the true history.

These are cool and all, but *what are simple, outright swatting-flies-with-a-sledgehammer ways to use such a device?* You can escape danger by teleporting somewhere and then popping back after a few hours, for example. What else?

Thanks in advance for answers!
