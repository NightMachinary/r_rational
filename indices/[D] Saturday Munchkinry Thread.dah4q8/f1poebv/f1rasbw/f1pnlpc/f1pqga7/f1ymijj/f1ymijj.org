Does the horror creator need to be anywhere near the horrors to keep using them? If yes, put your bunker deep inside a mountain with a single, straight tunnel leading in. Put all kinds of impressive doors and traps in, then when they enter to keep the horrors in range, dump hundreds of gallons of a saturated LSD solution into the tunnel. Your assistant will trip forever.

If no, invest in assassins. If you still have connections in the criminal world, have them spread the word that your assistant's head on a platter is worth a billion dollars to you. That should get anyone who isn't personally loyal to her to turn on her, and even personal loyalty may falter for that much money.

Better yet, your assistant /makes Eldrich Horrors./ She's a threat to humanity if left unchecked. Have a kill order placed on her, then make your bounty public.
