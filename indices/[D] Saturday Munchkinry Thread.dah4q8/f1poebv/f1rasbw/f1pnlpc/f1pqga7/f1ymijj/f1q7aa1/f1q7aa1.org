No bunker can remain if enemies have everything outside controlled. Booby traps without follow up only effectively slow enemies.

That being said, for realistic fiction:

Arbitrarily deep shaft into the ground, that you then collapse once you are inside. The time/cost of rescuing you will be the same as the time/cost of the attacker digging you up and killing you. Have all your food, water, power, and air inside with you. This also completely seals off communication unless you can leave a cable tunnel that the Eldritch can't crawl through. Or leave that tunnel and have them fight small abominations?

Fiction suggestions:

Have fun with the booby traps, explosives, spikes, darts, collapsing sections, bait etc but the attacker can create mooks so these are useless unless you get the creator. Look into fantasy traps with modern parts, and throw in some attack drones and chemicals for fun.

Make inside the bunker interesting. Overengineer it with food, air, and water recycling. Inside over the top entertainment or security measures. Maybe it's only halfway done or doesn't fully work.

Hiding from the inside: no idea for long term. Short term hide it as checking out the bunker together, touring it, or discuise it as a Uber home theater, immersion tank, or something. Maybe it's some business data center he put in since she was in a coma (look up some that are in bunkers for inspiration anyway) Having a fake bunker entryway that hides it until later might work, gets her there and occupied without realizing until it's been sealed up and the emergency supplies are needed.
