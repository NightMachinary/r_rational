Interesting approach. If you're wealthy and corrupt enough you could hire an anesthesiologist to keep her in a coma once they are secured.

If I remember right a experimental rabies treatment, the "Milwaukee Protocol" kept patients effectively comatose for days. I don't have access to the methodology anymore, but I don't recall the anesthesia being a major issue (25/26 died from the rabies)
