I have an absurdly rich fashion designer ex-Big Bad, whose wife, a damsel in distress who has recently woken up from a six-year coma, is being hunted down by his personal assistant, who can create homicidal Eldrich abominations. He has built the standard array of booby traps, but they were not enough to stop the personal assistant the last time (she probably helped), and he wants to improve them before she comes back to finish the job.

Also, I need a panic room for the wife that's as impenetrable as possible but will keep her completely in the dark to the shenanigans going on outside as much as possible.

The husband has no superpowers any more, nor mechanical or electrical engineering degrees, but has functionally unlimited money and an “ends justify the means” approach to morality. Keep in mind that any contractors he hires he also has to silence.

The married couple cannot disappear from town because Plot Reasons. The husband is reasonably sure that if he can call for help, his son the fluttery butterfly from last week can call for more heroes to save them (even if the fluttery butterfly himself is kinda useless in combat, especially in tight spaces)
