You have somehow invented a small multiverse teleporter and connected it to the second universe.

It turns out that you are exacly the same in the second universe, both universes are 100% equal (well, except the fact that one of them has initiated the connection).

So, basically there are *two universes* - universe A and universe B, and you are in both of them, and you have this between-universe-teleporter, and you can teleport small things (let's say not larger than 1 cubic inch).

You can use this teleporter for whatever you want, you can send paper to your other self, you can receive back paper from your other self, you can send money (as long as it fits in one cubic inch limit), small flash drive, etc.

*You can not:*\\
- create more teleporters\\
- connect to third universe, etc\\
- create bigger teleporter\\
- duplicate things\\
- travel trough time, etc, the time in both universes is consistent....

How would you munchkin that? I won't specify your exact goal, but it can be world domination or just world optimization, helping science progress, etc.
