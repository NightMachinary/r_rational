Maybe the second universe is instantiated when the teleporter first activates to be identical to the first, but wave function collapse or whatever quickly causes them to diverge?

Anyway, once they've been sufficiently butterflied it seems the easy solution would be to exploit asymmetrical intellectual labor. Find some successful, original animated film that exists in one universe and not the other, and then either publish it on YouTube yourself for the ad revenue or sell it to whatever big animation house is willing to pay the most. Rinse and repeat a few times and found a deep learning startup through which you can funnel live-action movies. Once the courts settle down, expand into other software & theory development and ~double your company's productivity. Then expand into other fields of inquiry, also poaching sufficiently divergent results from other companies & journals.

Once you've made a few trillion and sufficiently secured your position, consider revealing your device to the general public. Those born before the butterflies would probably be curious to exchange letters, videoed, etc. with their alternate selves, speak to deceased loved ones, etc. You could also more publicly explore what other divergences have occurred as a result of your ‘natural experiment'.

(other media could also work in the first stage --- original books would probably be easiest and least traceable --- but maybe also higher variance wrt their success. But easier to keep above board, since you could quicker contact your univers's ‘author' and confirm they've nothing similar in the works vs. doing he same with Pixar or w/e)
