Here's a thought:

Last time, the array of traps mainly protected a certain 'safe room'. This was a decoy, the real safe room was in a different city; however, all communications were routed through the decoy to preserve the illusion. (The assistant broke through to the decoy room last time, then followed the communication links from there).

The assistant will be expecting a return to this. The ex-Big Bad can subvert this in numerous ways; here are two possibilities:

- This time, he and his wife are in what was the decoy room last time. He broadcasts this fact (and the location of the decoy room) to the assistant often. She assumes that this is a decoy room again and ignores it.
- This time, they're in the same room as they were last time, and the ex-Big Bad vehemently denies that they might be in the old Decoy Room. This is true - the old Decoy Room really contains a nuclear warhead, ready to detonate when reached.
