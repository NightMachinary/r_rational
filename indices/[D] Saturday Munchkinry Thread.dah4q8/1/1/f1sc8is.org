Grocery shopping and comparing weird gallons price vs ounces price type things just got to be a lot less of a headache. When I'm tired or having an off day, I don't have to second-guess myself when someone wants to mentally do a math function that interacts with hours/minutes/seconds or is just slightly outside of my comfort level.

Otherwise? Not much. I guess I might seek out a job where strong mental math is great asset, but I can't think of a way to munchkin it terribly much assuming it's not capable of cracking crypto or doing basic computing other than math.
