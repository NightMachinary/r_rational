Nice chapter! I like that you actually showed her following up on making a mental note to look into something; so often characters will have interesting ideas worth investigating, perhaps mention "making a mental note" to investigate further, and then the idea is never mentioned again. Actually exploring those sorts of ideas is one of the strengths of rational fic for me.

Hopefully we get to see Minerva's science lesson next chapter, that should be interesting (and another instance of the sort of plot element that might be introduced and implied but not explicitly shown in a story) :)
