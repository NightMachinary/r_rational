If there's a better way, please let me know! I'm sort of winging it based off of Cho's accent in the movies. I think right now all I'm doing is long "o"/oi = ae, you = ye. I wanted it to be noticeable but not offensive/incomprehensible, but when I tried to look up transliteration strategies, I mostly found slang instead which isn't really appropriate for pure-blood Morag. :-/
