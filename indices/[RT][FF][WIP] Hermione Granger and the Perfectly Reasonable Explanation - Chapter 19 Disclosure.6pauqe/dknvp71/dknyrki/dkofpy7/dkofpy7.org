- I try to trust the new paragraph = new speaker rules to keep things straight if there are only two people involved. I know a sizeable chunk of people loathe dialogue tags in general, so anything I can do to limit them is good.

- I suppose I was thinking "again" applied only to the "act as you would have (otherwise)" part, which applies to both.

- I think you're right in general. On the other hand, I haven't really thought about it consciously before, but semicolons in dialogue feel suuuuper-weird to me. I think what's happening in this instance is that the intent is "I could've easily been killed, (so) I can't imagine what I was thinking" but with the (so) dropped because it's informal speech? I might have used "-" instead of the comma, I suppose. It's definitely intended as two directly connected thoughts, not two separate sentences.

- Her presumption that he is honest about giving her his only copy is based on a quick intuitive game-theory analysis. Assuming the existence of distributed copies, him having a personal copy gains him very little at this point, and is a slight risk if he's discovered with it, whereas him returning it to her gives him a stronger defence in the event she does try to turn him in as it argues toward "good will" and at the same time, removes the risk of inadvertent discovery.
