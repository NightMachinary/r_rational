All fair points! Like I said, all minor, mostly subjective.

Re: the first one I guess the off feeling just came from the unannounced (but, I agree, perfectly reasonable) speaker switch being juxtaposed with the "He" semi-floating pronoun. It should be fine as it is though.

I see what you're saying about the semi-colons in dialogue. Personally I agree that a dash might be a good compromise and better than a comma.

And I guess the Nott trust makes some sense, especially given her charitable disposition towards Slytherins generally. I still would have thought she'd qualify her statement of belief that it's the only copy with a "most likely" or something, but, yet again, subjective choice.

Thanks for the thorough response to my picked nits! Great work as always.
