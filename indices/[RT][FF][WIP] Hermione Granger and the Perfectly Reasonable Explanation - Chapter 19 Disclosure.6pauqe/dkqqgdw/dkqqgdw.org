Well, that was a fast update. Glad you're on a roll.

It's been --- what? --- two weeks of Hogwarts, and Hermione's already derailed canon several times over /and/ is earning a reputation as a scary person.

I suspect that if she had told Nott the truth of what had happened, he'd have decided that blackmailing her was more risk than it was worth.
