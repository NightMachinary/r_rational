I had that one mostly written already. Next chapter will be the real test to see if I can actually get back on a schedule.

Not even quite one week yet. Busy, busy. I should start some minor time-skipping eventually, once Hermione is past the current time-critical challenges in the short term.

Re: telling Nott about the trap/duel - it's possible, but I'm not sure he'd believe it. Or if he did, he could've decided maybe the notes weren't crazy after all, and given them straight to his father? Not that Hermione gets specific credit for avoiding that, since she doesn't know he's a Death Eater.
