Didn't notice any typos, but here are just a couple minor things I noticed. These are all just light suggestions; I get a little compulsive about noting things like this.

#+begin_quote
  "Is there anything I should do - or not do - in the meantime?" He contemplated this.
#+end_quote

Maybe add "she asked" after the question and "Dumbledore" instead of "he". It's immediately obvious what it means, but felt like it was missing that, to me.

#+begin_quote
  you should, again, act as you would have if I were not already aware of the situation
#+end_quote

"again"? I don't think he said anything about acting like she hadn't spoken with Dumbledore before this. He just said to try to act as if /she/ didn't know anything about the Time magic.

#+begin_quote
  I could've easily been killed, I can't imagine what I was thinking.
#+end_quote

I think a semicolon after "killed" would be more appropriate here

#+begin_quote
  He didn't even /have/ a copy of the notes anymore,
#+end_quote

I could maybe see her tentatively trusting that OTN is being honest on that score, but it seems odd that she's internally treating his narrative about honestly trying to dispose of all copies as established truth. He could easily still have copies.
