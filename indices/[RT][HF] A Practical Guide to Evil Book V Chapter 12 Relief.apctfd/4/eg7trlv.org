I'm puzzled by the granite / marble / limestone tidbit. Marble and limestone are worse materials to make weather-exposed sculptures out of, because they get dissolved by most acids (including ordinary rain) as they're mostly calcite ; while granite, being mostly quartz, doesn't dissolve. It's harder to carve too. It's usually uglier though, I'll grant you that. I'd expect granite and marble to be comparably rare and expensive to extract ; whereas limestone, which is just sedimentary, is typically the cheaper plentiful kind of rock, being common and very easy to carve.
