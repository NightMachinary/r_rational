It seems like theres a bunch of characters that are important to the plot but not important to the Plot getting killed off-screen.

Maybe unimportant is the wrong word though. they dont have the kind of Plot weight that Akua/Black/all the other Named have, and so them living or dying happens at the mercy of the Plot momentum swirling around the other characters. My guess is that Cats friends dying off is Below putting their fingers on the scales in order to try and shape Cat to their liking.
