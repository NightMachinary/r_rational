I've thought it was heading that way for a while. Why else would it keep switching to the view of some random Callowan who's a foil for Catherine? I'm not quite sure why Erratic keeps offscreen killing fairly major non-Named, and then gives a relatively unimportant character like Captain a bazillion funerary chapters.

I really hope it doesn't end with Queen Abigail though. Giving tons of power to the military is never a great idea for any civic society.
