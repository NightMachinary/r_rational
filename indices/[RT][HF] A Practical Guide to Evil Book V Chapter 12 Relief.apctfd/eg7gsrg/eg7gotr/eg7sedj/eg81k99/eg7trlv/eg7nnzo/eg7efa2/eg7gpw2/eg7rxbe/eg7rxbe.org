While I don't think Cat is a Mary Sue (you really have to do some definition stretching and be generally uncharitable towards the story to conclude that imo) the loss of Nauk needs to be put in context here. As i see it:

1) Nauk was arguably already dead or at the least was so drastically altered after the Summer Fae so as to make the loss feel less significant.

2) Transport Cat to Aerb and have Joon look into her soul. I guarantee you that Nauk is not among her top 20 values. Cat may care about Nauk but there are numerous people, events and goals that are of far higher importance to her in the story.

3) Nauk's loss is the sort of loss that has little effect in story. Is Cat's behaviour going to be strongly impacted by his death? Do Cat's political goals change? Is Cat's military strategy or value strongly impacted? I would argue not.

When people argue Cat's a Mary Sue because she walks into the Everdark with little to no plan, blunders on in ignorance yet walks out with an army of super people, increased autonomy and more individual power, then the loss of Nauk is...not a slam dunk counter. (To reiterate, I don't think Cat's a Mary Sue).
