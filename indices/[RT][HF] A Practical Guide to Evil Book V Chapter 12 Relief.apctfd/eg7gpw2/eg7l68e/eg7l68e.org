I don't really see how her friends dying confirm or deny Cat as a "Mary Sue".

It's to my understanding that a Mary Sue is someone who gets everything handed to her on a platter and can do anything and has no actual flaws. Cat clearly doesn't, even if it works out in the end for her (since she's the protagonist and there wouldn't be a story if she dies for good).
