Nauk has, as mentioned elsewhere ITT, ceased to become an important character after his first death. He's no longer a major character in the plot unlike Akua or Black or even newer characters like the Tyrant or the Sisters (and thus semi-invulnerable to sudden death).

I'm not sure what EE was going with this by killing him off a second time, and I understand people are kind of miffed on why. Seems like a dropped plot line. What was the point of his revival?
