Eh, the story is basically saying:

1. The opposition are liars
2. Most people who believe the opposition are idiots
3. Most people are unthinking morons who will repeat things they know not to be true even though they've seen otherwise with their own eyes

It's basically the story that you'd write if you wanted a fully general defense against criticism via parable, and I think that's worth pointing out, especially if that's one of the intended purposes of someone writing this story.
