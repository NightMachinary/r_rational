What?

Some fables naturally lend themselves to a political bent. I agree that the short story and the author's intent are open to intepretation, like most other great stories, and it doesn't /need/ to be shoehorned as a critique of politics. But it's not too far-fetched to say the shape of the story primes the political part of our collective consciousness.
