It's political if you go out of your way to see it as political. Conspiracies and coups are not inherently political, unless you claim Game of Thrones is a highly politicised show.

It's a rationalization of a well-known fable, in line with about two thousand other such rationalizations author has written over the years. Of course you can read whatever you want into whatever you want, but saying author definitely intended it to be a critique of politics is really disingenious.
