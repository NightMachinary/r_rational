Hmm a surface run-through might conclude:

- Bet on Vivienne/Army
- Lie to Pilgrim about surrendering
- Hidden Knife being Kairos.

​

Though if we assume she is genuinely trying to break Pilgrim's pattern of 3 trap maybe...

- Knife for Pilgrim. What does he do with a surrendering army when they need all the troops they can get to fight the Dead King? Perhaps the coldly logical 'greatest good' thing is to 'force' conscript them to fight the Dead King. (i.e. what Cat wants anyway)
- Lie to Kairos. She intends to deny him what he wants whatever it is on general principles that Kairos s a nutter.
- Bet on Vivienne/Army. Cat is assuming that Pilgrim is going to separate her from her army and require her abdication as Queen of Callow (as he demanded before) as a condition of her surrender. Thus Vivienne will be in overall command of the Callowans. Perhaps once that is done Cat will ultimately vanish with the Drow.

​

A lot of possibilities really.
