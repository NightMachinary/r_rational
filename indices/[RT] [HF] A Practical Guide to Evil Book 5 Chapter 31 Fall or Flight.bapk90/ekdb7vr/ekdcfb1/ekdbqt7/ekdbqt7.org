Can someone find the exact wording to Cat's promise to Larat? Seven crowns and one: I'm guess the one has to be her own. Once the oath is fulfilled, the Wild Hunt will be subsumed into the Night? Is that why Larat is so terrified, that he'll lose his freedom once again and be locked into a role like he used to be with Winter?

And it seems like my guess later chapter is right: Cat is going to break the pattern of three by losing to to the Pilgrim, in this case by surrendering, but not before achieving what she needs to achieve. I assume the Narrative will prevent someone as genre-savvy as Pilgrim from mistreating surrendered soldiers, especially for someone whose stated motivation is that he dislikes unnecessary suffering.

I still believe that this is going to turn into a case where all three sides team up against an Arcadia/Hell fusion breach, and that's how Cat and Kairos are going to get leverage in negotiation.
