First, to get my pointless nitpicks out of the way: - Jumba's last name is Jookiba, not Dukiba. - The mean girl's name is Myrtle, not Mildred.

Okay, now that I've satiated my inner child, this was okay. My biggest worry is that by bringing political intrigue into the story you're going to detract from the theme of the original. The changes made to Stitch make sense, though I miss Jumba's humorous eccentricity. I can't critique changes to Pleakley I haven't seen, but I also found him funny in the movie so I'd still like him to be funny here even if he isn't an idiot.

In term of writing, the biggest mistake you made was putting the exposition about Lilo's behavior after her the fact. You told us how she was thinking instead of showing it, and it broke the pacing. Put the narration in the moment so we see what character's are thinking as they act on it. That said, your explanation of Lilo's psychology is pretty good and makes a lot of sense.
