I'm not sure where this diverges from canon except for the vocabulary.

I only have a vague recollection of these scenes, but it seems to be otherwise nearly verbatim from the source.

The interesting part of this sort of story would be the different responses later on. Would the galactic federation responsible for 626 be more competent in containing him? Would he escape more easily from animal control (given they are likely not as competent as the Galactic Federation he just escaped from), or would the animal control officer identify him as not a dog? Would this superweapon be content to basically be a pet?
