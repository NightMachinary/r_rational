there's more background info that wasn't in the original, such as the war going on. also dr dukiba is no longer an evil genius strawman like he was in the original. the grand councilwoman was basically an empress so i retconned her title to be empress since that's basically what she was and everybody probably knew that. pleakly is more competent now and he's more important to the story. Lilo now has a social developmental disability, which was kinda sorta hinted at in the beginning of the original movie but was never really clear. also, i'm thinking earth would be much more significant in this story than merely a backwater wildlife preserve that no one cares about, and its significance might have something to do with the war...

in the original pleakly didn't meet dr dukiba until after the scientist was arrested and pleakly was assigned to keep watch over him. in my version they already had met, since pleakly is the one who gave dr. dukiba that research assignment. (although dukiba might have done it anyway even if it wasn't assigned to him, if he really thought it was a good idea.) and i had pleakly promoted to a special forces commander of sorts, rather than just a special agent. a mere special agent probably wouldn't have the clearance to speak to the empress of the galactic federation after all.

also, by making it more clear that Lilo is socially impaired, i managed to actually explain why lilo acted the way she did at the beginning of the movie in a way that made sense, rather than leaving it at "she's crazy and poorly behaved but has a good heart deep down."

also i changed stitch's nature a bit to make more sense. in the original movie dr dukiba said his only instinct is to "destroy everything he touches" (presumably other than himself). if that was his only instinct, i highly doubt he would really be able to learn to care for others. the way this experiment is set up is not only to create a superweapon for the empire. dukiba (as well as whoever really sent him that assignment originally) has another ulterior motive behind it, and i wont say anything else.
