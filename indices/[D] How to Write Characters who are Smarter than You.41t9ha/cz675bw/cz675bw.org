I feel like I need to stress one important aspect of algorithm you cited: it generates <problem, answer> pairs, but it does not provide you any hints about how to come up with the solution.

(The same idea applies to zero-knowledge proofs)

That means you cannot write a genius character who factors large integers without using some sort of device like "in a flash of insight, she realized that the answer is 17*23. She checked her hunch and, indeed, it was correct".

You need something much more sophisticated in order to be able to actually describe the /cognitive work/ necessary to come up with the solution, to /show/ the inside of smarted person's mind (as opposed to showing the results).
