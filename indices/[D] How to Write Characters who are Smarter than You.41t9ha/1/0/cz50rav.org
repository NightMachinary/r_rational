I'm saying something more statistically thorough. It's not obvious how to do this for 3-SAT.

edit: I'm saying that it is possible to write a story in which a character can solve computational problems that the author cannot. A reader could verify statistically that the integers are chosen uniformly and deterministically that they are factored correctly. If necessary I'll implement the algorithm myself and post the output to pastebin but I think most people will believe me that it's possible.

The reason I bring it up is because it's a counter-example to the claim that it's impossible to write a character who is smarter than the author.
