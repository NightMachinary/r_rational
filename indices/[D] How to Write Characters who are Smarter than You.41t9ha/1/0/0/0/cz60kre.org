I chose a clear well-defined example for simplicity. My point is that if you "cheat" then observant readers will notice.

I will attempt more complicated example but it's hard to articulate. Suppose you have someone who's very good at rock paper scissors. If you just make them always throw the right one and come up with an explanation afterward why they thought it was right then you're probably cheating. No matter how much their explanations make sense they won't have predictive power, and even if they do you still might be cheating by selecting opponents who behave the way your smart character thinks they will.
