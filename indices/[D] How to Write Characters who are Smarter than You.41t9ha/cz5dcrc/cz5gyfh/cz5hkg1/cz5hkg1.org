Rowling said that she'd never actually have Harry or Ron read Hogwarts: A History, because it was more useful for Hermione to exposit.

That said, Hermione /is/ shown having problems relating to other people. And even when she recites information from books, she tends to rephrase it so it sounds less like said book. She clearly /understands/ the information she's telling her friends, and still manages to sound like, well, herself.
