Since as the author you control and know everything about the world -- information, chance, events, motivations, etc, -- of course you can write someone "smarter" than you are. Someone who can look at someone and "deduce" from the way they talk and their expression and available information that they are lying, or what they are hiding, or what they are thinking, or what a situations really is, etc.

If you want you can handwave and explain this smart character's "smartness" using planted clues and stuff about biases and tells and stuff about human rationality and calculation and such. Or you could use radioactive waste or mutant spider bites. But the main thing is that for your "smart" character there aren't all the ambiguities and misinformation and mistakes and plain chance that characterize the real world when viewed (as much as we can) without human bias.

As an author you can write a wonderful fable about intelligence and human understanding triumphing through perfect information that you as author provide (the believable flaws you /think/ you put in that perfect information and the characters understanding of it are actually wildly unrealistic and are only believable because as a human you and everyone lives in a fantasy land about how much we understand). In a realistic story even the smartest character would be wrong most of the time, and afraid to act because they know this much of the rest of the time, but that wouldn't be a very good story.
