When I first read Raikoth a while back, I noticed a lot of the unexplained future tech solving problems also. I think a few of the problem solutions are interesting to read about in direct proportion to how likely they are to ever occur - e.g. the personal monitoring devices to deter crime seems like an interesting idea, if you can resolved the ways it is hopelessly open to abuse and possible to cause of a great deal of problems and drawbacks in addition to it's benefits, see e.g. Black Mirror Season 1 Episode 3, /The Entire History Of You/.

In addition, beyond the technology I thought my personal incredulity was tripped by the fact that this was a utopia that managed to fail pretty hard for no apparent reason. Seriously - it looks to be about the physical land area/size of Great Britain, with a total population less than New York City, and isn't noted as expanding or having a lot of people enter it or otherwise being particularly sucessful at growing and subsuming it's neighbours in spite of spending a huge amount of time discussing how awesome it is and how it makes perfect decisions and everyone enjoys living in it; presumably this is because of the constraints of the constructed world he was creating it within, I guess, but it still feels wrong when judged as single-author fiction - you'd think a society that is amazingly prosperous and happy and sucessful and intelligently governed would be notably powerful on the world stage? Unless it's surrounded by a bunch of other states which are all even more plausible and believable utopias, in which case one wonders why Raikoth is not more influenced by these superior outside ideas and is instead clinging to less-effective utopian ideals with all of it's stuff about effectively making utilitarian decisions?

Also, it has a long list of tech advances over our modern era but no note that the tech is still advancing or changing, but instead that everything is perfectly adapted to the tech as it is with long legal and societal adaptations to e.g. perfect personal monitors. Basically, I have a hard time really believing in any utopia in which technological and societal progress is ended - I believe that any utopia we build with the tools of today will be obsolete in fifty years time, as human understanding of everything from computing technology to our own minds to effective political structures advances.
