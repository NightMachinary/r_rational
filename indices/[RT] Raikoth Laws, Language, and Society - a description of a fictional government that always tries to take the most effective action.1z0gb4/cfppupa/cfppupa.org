It doesn't read as very rational.

It works with three magical things to make each thing work.

A magical language that it is impossible to insult people in.

Magical predictions that mean all laws work perfectly (ignoring any uncertainty).

Completely obedient citizens who allow the government to do as they wish, up to mass sterilization with untested future technologies, mass forced drug use, and imposition of a government that doesn't favor them.

This sort of stuff is an error I often see from those who want to optimize the world. They try to attack what they see as the root issues (ignoring the actual, weighty issues that plague society) with some sort of magic or scifi-technology.

They don't tend to consider that any society with their magic would be better, and they rarely consider how actual real life issues would impact their society.

  As a corollary of this principle, the intelligence of a character in rational fiction must never be an Informed Ability. We must see them being smart, not be told that they are smart. They must think of brilliant things to do which we ourselves could have realized are possible. As in a Fair Play Whodunnit, the character must make deductions that we ourselves could realistically have made. Only by solving puzzles which are, from the readers' perspective, at least slightly fair, can the character's good sense be convincingly exhibited. (Note that the ability to exhibit smart options and strategies means that this is not the same principle as a Fair Play Whodunnit; and fair-play insights may happen throughout the novel, not just in ways relevant to a mystery plot.)

That is what their powers are. Informed abilities that magically solve all of societies problems, without actually ever showing any smart options and strategies.
