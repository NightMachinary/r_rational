We can't currently recreate the Angels, though. That's the thing about communism. If you could somehow guarantee perfect rulership (Angels, perhaps), then communism, or a dictatorship, would be the perfect form of government. We're currently stuck with humans, though, and humans assign different values to different things and sometimes humans change, for the better or for the worse. In that situation, some sort of republic/democracy is for the best, since you can theoretically vote out the people who are no longer doing a good job.

I mean, take a look at the "does raising the minimum wage create more jobs or mean there will be less jobs" debate. Consider that Pennsylvania/New Jersey study when New Jersey raised their minimum wage and people polled fast food restaurants and found that the number of jobs increased. Then another group decided to not poll the restaurants but look at the payroll records of the companies involved and found that the number of jobs decreased. Then the first group looked at government data and how many people filed for unemployment, and how many new W2's were filed, etc., and found that the number of jobs increased. And since then there have been many studies by many people all of which show that the number of jobs either increases or decreases after the minimum wage is increased and people are basically free to pick whichever studies best match with their own opinion. We don't have something like the Angels, who can definitively say with no argument from anyone else, that X is better because of Y. This system of government, as great as it now is, wouldn't work for our current world.

It's a nice story, really great, had some good things to consider, but it's not practical. There's not much that we can really use today, in this world.
