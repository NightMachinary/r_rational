I don't particularly advocate personal monitoring devices to deter crime in our present society, with any of our present levels of technology or societal structure; you will note that I hedged my statement with both generalities and with a specific example of one of the many ways that such a system could be problematic from fiction.

There are certain programs involving police having manditory personal cameras on themselves that seem based on popular news stories that I have seen to be having positive results in terms of preventing police abuse of citizens, preventing unwarranted accusations of police abuse of citizens; however I have not done the stats and looked at actual studies myself, so I can't pretend to advocate for their use.

That said, I don't know where/how you jumped to behavioural control of people. I would appreciate some more explanation of how one jumps from 'voluntary self-monitoring devices that upload encrypted data to a secure store only you can access with a societal prohibition on forcing access to another's' to behavioural control - if you can unpack that connection I would be most grateful.

Finally, on the Heinlein quote - I have no idea how the quote specifically applies to the subject of my quote.

For what it's worth, I looked up a few similar quotes from Heinlein, and the nearest I could find is that 'man is a wild animal' (Expanded Universe), where he credits it as being lifted from Charles Galton Darwin in his book The Next Million Years. He writes the following:

/He cannot be tamed and remain Man; his genius is bound up in the very qualities which make him wild. With this self-knowledge, bleak, stern, and proud, goes the last hope of permanent peace on Earth; it makes world government unlikely and certainly unstable. Despite the fact that we are (as always) in a condition of marginal starvation, this fact makes all measures of population control futile-other than the ancient, grisly Four Horsemen, and even they are not effective; we finished World War III with a hundred million more people than when we started./

He also writes:

/Nor can we be "improved" by genetic breeding; it is not in our nature to accept it. Someday we may be conquered by superbeings from elsewhere, then bred according to their notions-and become dogs, rather than wolves. (I'm betting that we will put up a fight!) But, left to our own resources, improvements in our breed must come the hard way, through survival and we will still remain wild animals./

Needless to say, I find this idea that humans can't become better through their own efforts to be both faintly silly now but very normal-for-the-time anti-transhumanist. However, even from when he was writing it seemed very naive of the the idea that people might not want their offspring to have a decent shot at birth defects, etc which could by themselves constitute major genetic modifications. Also, he wrote extensively about a fictional society which did in fact improve it's own breed in one respect (longevity) - see Methuselah's Children and Time Enough for Love and all the related books (or just read Methuselah's Children because a lot of Heinlein's later books, especially e.g. To Sail Beyond The Sunset, are not particularly worth anyone's time).

Also, the quote is part of a longer piece (The Third Millenium Opens) that is factually wrong about a lot of the stuff that has any factual basis which can be examined rigorously, which is to some extent excusable in 1956 when it was written but nonetheless makes the piece extremely unpersuasive to me (he was attempting to write as if writing a piece from 2001). In the same article where he writes about this man is a wild animal idea he takes very seriously (as a given) the idea of life after death as being proven scientifically by hypnotic regression to past lives as in the Morey Bernstein (Bridey Murphy) case - while including a disclaimer later on that he didn't necessarily believe it - which ultimately makes it unclear to me how much of this stuff Heinlein actually believed, and how much he made up on the spot to make an interesting article about future perspectives.

At any rate, I have no idea how this man is a wild animal quote applies to the idea of a surveillance society specifically, and can only see a little how it applies to the behavioural control idea - considering Heinlein seemed to mostly be talking about our habit of not changing our own selves. I would appreciate your explaining your thoughts in more detail. It's quite possible the man as a feral animal quote comes from some other Heinlein source I can't remember - he wrote voluminously, after all - in which case, if you could provide the source, I would be happy to look at the surrounding context to better understand your position.
