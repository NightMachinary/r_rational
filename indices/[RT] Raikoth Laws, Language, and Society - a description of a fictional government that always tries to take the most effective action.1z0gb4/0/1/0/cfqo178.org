  I think a few of the problem solutions are interesting to read about in direct proportion to how likely they are to ever occur - e.g. the *personal monitoring devices to deter crime seems like an interesting idea,* if you can resolved the ways it is hopelessly open to abuse and possible to cause of a great deal of problems and drawbacks in addition to it's benefits, see e.g. Black Mirror Season 1 Episode 3, The Entire History Of You.

/Oh ye absent god's save us from those who would save us from others./ To paraphrase Franklin:

  You can have freedom or security, the man who wishes to give up some up some of the former for the latter will have neither and deserves it.

I wouldn't trust a saint, a genius, a committee of geniuses, a benevolent despot, a GFAI or myself with behavioral control of people. Or to quote/paraphrase again Heinlein:

  Man is a feral animal.

I look forward to reading, to see the mistakes, but things like this is why [[#s][spoiler to 3 worlds collide]]

/Edit/ Started reading. . . very foolishly idealist. The gadget for civic monitoring is well devized, but the overall concepts miss the TLDR problem of markets. Misquoting, and paraphrasing again to sum up a critical failure:

#+begin_quote
  Any society that does not follow the principle /women and children first/ is doomed to fail.
#+end_quote

This society doesn't *shut up and multiply!* If it is as happy and smart as it claims to be it should be taking over via market forces, for the good of humanity, or maybe it realizes it's no longer human . . . /shrug/ worth a read but more to illustrate idealized mistakes; I think.
