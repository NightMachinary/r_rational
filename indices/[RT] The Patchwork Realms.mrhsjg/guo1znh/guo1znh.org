I saved up a few chapters to read at once because I can't deal with just one chapter of Athos at a time. Really enjoying the way the worldbuilding is unfolding, the clever ways Athos has solved problems, and the examination of the extreme logical conclusion of Supreme Exemplar as applied to a domestic dog-- the Goodest Boy.
