Ah, I'd been wondering what had happened to this.

I see Athos is still being a good boi, and Eugene is still being... not that.

My only real note for improvement is that I'm having a hard time setting my expectations, in terms of pacing. As fun as it is to watch Athos kick ass, if there isn't a sense that it's accomplishing something that will get him home, or at least making progress towards a goal that, when completed, will let him /get back to/ getting home, there's a risk of it just feeling like the wheels are spinning. And while I don't think you're quite there yet, at eight chapters into this arc and with not one of the hazdahem even sighted, it's starting to head in that direction.
