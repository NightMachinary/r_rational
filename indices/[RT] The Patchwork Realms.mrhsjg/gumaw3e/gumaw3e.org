I can recommend this work if you're at all interested in lit rpgs/isekais but are frustrated at the extreme lack of quality writing or characterization. Athos is strong, but all he wants is to get home. He's a dog magicked into human levels of intelligence and it shows in his thought processes: he is hopelessly naive, loyal, caring, and protective. He's also rational, in that he knows what he wants and works to achieve it. Power is only useful if it can protect his people after all. All in all, Athos is a 5/7 doggo, and fuck Eugene.
