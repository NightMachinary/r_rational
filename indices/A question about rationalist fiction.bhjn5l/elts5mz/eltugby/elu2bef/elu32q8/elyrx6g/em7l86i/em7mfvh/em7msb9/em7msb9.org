  Yet people think Trump is stupid.
#+end_quote

Trump is actually a good analogy. He says and does stupid things but seems to often achieve his goals despite (because of?) that. Just like the example with the death mark.

Of course Trump had a huge advantage over Voldemort - he was born a billionaire.

  I heard [Hitler] was a bad strategist

His strengths were apparently soft skills. Not all smart people are good strategists.

  Maybe people have different talents and it's not all in a single scale stupid - genius.
#+end_quote

Of course. But even with extreme talent in a specific field you need general intelligence to choose your goals, set priorities, play politics, etc to achieve success.

So, assuming people in power to be stupid is irrational. Stupid people don't rule for long (and if they do they aren't the ones that really have power).
