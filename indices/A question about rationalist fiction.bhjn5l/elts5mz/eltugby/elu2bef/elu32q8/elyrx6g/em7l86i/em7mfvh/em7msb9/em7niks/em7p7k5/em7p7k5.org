  I'd say anyone could do more with an unresistable mind control spell. V was born a heir or Slytherin too.
#+end_quote

He wasn't born with mind control spell. He was born with capability of learning it. Like most wizards. Figuring out how to learn it and use it without being caught for a long time takes above-average intelligence, otherwise much more wizards would be abusing it.

And besides wasn't he an orphan? He was less privileged in world with magic than Trump is in world without magic, would you agree to that?

  Definitely nothing of genius category. Public demagogues have gained power by being good speakers and figuring out a message that gains popularity. It doesn't necessitate above average intelligence.
#+end_quote

I'd argue it does. At least doing so consistently. You can get lucky once, but repeating this requires correctly modelling behavior of masses of people. You have to be pretty smart to do that better than all the competitors.

  Dumbles was the most powerful wizard alive he thought, but he kept acting completely bonkers. He had no reason to think stupid or insane people can't be in power in wizarding world.

Assuming D was bonkers was another irrational move by HP. Especially in a new world where he knew he only had partial information. Especially when he knew D was around for a long time and dealt with 2 supervillians.

Then basing another vital estimate (of his main enemy V) on that shaky assumption - kinda risky.

Especially that HP already met L Malfoy and was respecting his intelligence (even if it wasn't applied to everything - see magic racism). And Malfoy respected both V and D intelligence.
