Yet people think Trump is stupid.

I don't personally know too much about Hitler, but he did achieve a lot of stuff, but I heard he was a bad strategist.

Maybe people have different talents and it's not all in a single scale stupid - genius. Maybe someone less intelligent could still do well in a field where he had talent? Maybe someone powerful, with resources, could have people working under him to do stuff he lacks understanding in?
