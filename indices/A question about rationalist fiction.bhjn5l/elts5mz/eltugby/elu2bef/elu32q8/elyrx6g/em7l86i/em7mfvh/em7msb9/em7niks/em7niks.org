  Of course Trump had a huge advantage over Voldemort - he was born a billionaire.

I'd say anyone could do more with an unresistable mind control spell. V was born a heir or Slytherin too.

  But even with extreme talent in a specific field you need general intelligence to choose your goals, set priorities, play politics, etc.

You need /some/ level of intelligence. Definitely nothing of genius category. Public demagogues have gained power by being good speakers and figuring out a message that gains popularity. It doesn't necessitate above average intelligence.

Harry thought V was stupid, but he pretty much thought everyone in wizarding world was. When we say he thought V and D to be stupid, it doesn't necessarily mean dumb as fuck. He is comparing them, or his idea of them, to himself.

Dumbles was the most powerful wizard alive he thought, but he kept acting completely bonkers. He had no reason to think stupid or insane people can't be in power in wizarding world. It's a whole new world to him and he didn't know the history and culture etc.
