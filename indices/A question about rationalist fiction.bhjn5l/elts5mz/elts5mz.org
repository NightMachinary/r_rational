The story relevant thing harry gets wrong for most of the story is his belief that voldemort was stupid which bites him in the ass.

Regarding death, harry says that his initial reaction was of excitement, that he'd get to see his grandparents again, but he is only let down.

He asks dumbledore directly, but dumbledore gives him nothing.

He asks quirrell, who he trusts to be reasonable, and quirrell says he looked into it and found nothing.

What would you have harry do? Nobody's given him anything he can falsify. Well, there actually are two things he could try. He could check out the veil, but he doesn't have access, or he could check out the resurrection stone, which he doesn't have (but does inquire to quirrell about finding).

I'll end with a question, how absurd does an opposition have to be before a rationalist gets a pass for not taking them seriously?
