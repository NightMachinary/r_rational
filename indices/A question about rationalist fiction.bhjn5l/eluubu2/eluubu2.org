Well first souls are a pretty vague concept and could mean lots of different things whith completely different consecuences.

Also of course if there were obiously souls Harry would believe in them, it's just that he feels very strongly about it and doesn't really want to be disappointed again, so hes not likely to seriously research it.

But I don't think it's that likely that he'll be proven wrong . Something that works as hardware for human minds but somehow let's their brains work like normal seems really complicated . Something that stores copies of people's minds is more likely, but then if you get brain damage(or re eaten by dementors) it will also copy that so it doesn't imply a nice afterlife for everyone.

I'f he found wizards don't get brain damage or something like that sure.

But the only evidence we have of anything soullike are animagus being able to think as cats or whatever, but that might be an special effect that works while you are transformed and not something general(after all while you are transformed your brain is not working at the same time) .

And even if there are souls, an afterlife is even more unlikely.

Of course Harry should seriously research this at some point , but asking quirrel is a decent experiment for now. He shouldn't just abandon the idea , but it's understandable that he feels really emotional about it, and it's not something he's likely to make much progress on right now.

So while it is an error to not research souls and posible afterlife more carefully it's not that big of an error.

Of course reality isn't fair, maybe that small error has really big consecuences, like if there's a nice afterlife and people that don't instantly die whith all their mental faculties intact get there whith brain damage. In wich case Harry might be wasting his time when he should be destroying the world to ensure everyone goes to the afterlife.

But well I guess he'll get arround researching it once he gets smarter.
