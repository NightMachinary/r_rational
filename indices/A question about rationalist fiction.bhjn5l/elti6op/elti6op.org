Harry is an obvious author-insert. The author, Eliezer Yudkowsky, has been known to make posts like, "don't let your political biases blind you" (paraphrasing), while also making posts like, "Trump being president will lead to the end of the world." (Also paraphrasing.)

Also, Eliezer posted on this subreddit, asking if there were any actual mistakes with the science he wrote. A lot of people responded with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2zd3x7/actual_science_flaws_in_hpmor/?st=juxvj10m&sh=6ef7c88f][scientific mistakes that were made]], but Eliezer only responded to one of them with, "This looks like an actual science error. Thank you! I will look into it and see about fixing it." with the implication that all those other comments weren't actually science errors.

I guess what I'm saying is, it's not a problem with Harry. It's a problem with Eliezer.
