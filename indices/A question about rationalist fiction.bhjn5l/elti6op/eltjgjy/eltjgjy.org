Almost all the "science errors" that people discuss regarding HPMOR were "discovered" by su3su2u1, who was found (I think by slatestarcodex?) to have faked his credentials, IIRC he claimed to have two PhDs in fields he hadn't even studied. He turned out to be a weirdo compulsive liar with an axe to grind.

I don't think HPMOR's science can be 100% correct considering EY is just a self-studied AI scientist, and there are some real reasons to criticize him, but it annoys me that people keep using that guy as evidence and have stopped doing their own research.
