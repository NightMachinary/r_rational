Regarding the apocalypse thing: it wasn't that one. I posted about it with the exact link elsewhere, but I'm on mobile right now, so I'll see if I can find the post in question later today.

For the rest of it, I just saw the post about su's sockpuppeting that Makin linked. If true (and I have no reason to suspect it's not), that shows two things: one, that Su is guilty of making up personal anecdotes and friends with degrees that support his position. And two: when it comes to the actual science, his posts are reasonably accurate, at least as far as that poster could tell.

I understand you dislike Su because of his inappropriate behavior, and I don't blame you at all for that, but you and Makin seem to be letting that dislike affect your judgement.

Even if people are just "parroting back what su said", there's nothing wrong with that if the criticisms are accurate. Some of them, I'll admit, are outside my knowledge, but others are easily verifiable (robbers cave), and others are really just common sense (harry making the n-rays mistake himself).
