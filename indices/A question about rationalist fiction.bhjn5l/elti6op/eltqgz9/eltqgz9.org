  The author, Eliezer Yudkowsky, has been known to make posts like... "Trump being president will lead to the end of the world."

Do you have a source for that claim?

  If you went back to 1996, and asked somebody what it sounded like if they imagined a future year in which the Cubs won the World Series and Donald Trump was elected US President, they would /unhesitatingly/ reply that you were describing a comic continuity in which the world was ending and those were 2 out of 7 Seals of the Apocalypse.

If that's what you're talking about, then your claim is a seriously disingenuous misrepresentation.

It's common knowledge that su3su2u1 didn't /actually/ read HPMOR, he read it /while drunk/. Reading while drunk is /not/ the same thing as reading while sober. He also read it in bad faith with the purpose of pushing an agenda (that should be common knowledge as well). And he had multiple sock puppet accounts who all claimed to have different credentials, and when he would argue with people he would have those sock puppets chime in with their "expertise" which /obviously/ corroborated his claims.

[[/u/Makin-]] isn't wrong, so I'm not sure why people have been downvoting them. Most of the alleged mistakes in the thread you linked are just people parroting back su3su2u1, not people's own original thoughts.

EDIT:

Changed "they aren't" to "they're not" because, even though it's still technically plural, it doesn't sound as plural as it did the other way.

EDIT:

Flipped the sentence around to remove the issue.
