wait, what I meant when I said "which in the end is proven right" is that Harry's reasoned belief about souls not existing ends up being correct according to the story. What you said is also correct, except that creating a magical copy of yourself like an horcrux or a portrait is intrinsically magical. Also, neither wizards nor muggles have souls (as understood by most irl religions). Remember that ghost do not learn neither do they grow as persons. What exactly is the controverted point?
