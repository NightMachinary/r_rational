It's been a while since I read HPMOR but if I remember it correctly Harry conducted a few experiment before concluding that souls actually wasn't right. If memory serves right he checked if ghost could still learn new skills and there's only room to do so many experiments in a book before it gets tedious.

As it was I think that the lesson was that even if you saw something that seemed to have an obvious explanation you should still explore alternative hypothesis.

If Harry drew the wrong conclusion and later were proved wrong it would have been a story about motivated/biased reasoning which could also have been valuable. As so far as whether Harry would have realized the truth in this case I don't know but ultimately it would have been fine for me to have the protagonist make such a mistake.
