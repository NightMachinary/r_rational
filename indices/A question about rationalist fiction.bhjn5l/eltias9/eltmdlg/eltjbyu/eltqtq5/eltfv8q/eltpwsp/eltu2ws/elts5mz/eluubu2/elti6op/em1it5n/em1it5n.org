A rational agent is simply a person or machine that starts with an initial belief and a confidence level in that belief. The confidence level is never absolute or the agent is not rational. Ideally that belief is not arbitrarily set to an extremely high confidence in something which is unwarranted.

Then, as high quality, verifiable and reproducible experiences come in - we can call them experience tuples - the agent updates their belief and confidence level. Things that confirm the belief increase confidence, things that disprove it reduce confidence. For binary beliefs at any given moment there is some probability weight for both states. (true or false) for the belief.

So anyways, even if Harry starts with a high confidence in the "no souls" side of the binary belief "no souls or souls", this doesn't mean he can't change his belief if evidence comes in supporting the other hypothesis. A rational agent would. Sure, in this story the evidence is set up the opposite way, but that's arbitrary and it could have gone the other way.
