Not born with it, but as a magical kid he was going to get the magical education anyway (). As a heir of slytherin, I'd bet he got the spell from the snake. Like a lot of other magical knowledge. He didn't know it until school, but he was definitely born into power. Not less privileged than Trump I'd say. Both are pretty high there. He could have been not evil and just gone to be one of the top dogs in the society. He was also intelligent, which would have helped with anything.

He was only less privileged before finding his heritage. Not sure how I'd value getting into the magical school.

  You have to be pretty smart to do that better than all the competitors.

Or lucky. Happen to meet right people who help getting your voice heard. Definitely all success is not just hard work or intelligence, nor are they quaranteed even with those. Notch has not been able to hit it big again.

  Assuming D was bonkers was another irrational move by HP.

The starting words of the year were nuts. Didn't he wear some mushroom hat? "this was your father's rock" etc.

Besides, didn't everyone else think D had lost his marbles too? Though I think Ron did mention it could be an act or something, can't remember exactly.

  Especially when he knew D was around for a long time and dealt with 2 supervillians.

Nobody said D was weak. They say he was the strongest. Lots of heroes in stories beat supervillains with fists. D didn't work alone either.
