Giving HPMOR a fair shake means being exactly as skeptical of all of Yudkowsky's beliefs being right in the story as you were when Rowling canonized souls and the afterlife. (Or any other author, really.) I can get not agreeing, but think about it this way - I have read hundreds, maybe thousands of books, all written by people devout enough to endorse souls in one form or another. I'm willing to let Eliezer prattle on about timeless physics or whatever he believes to be true so long as the story is intelligent and self-consistent.
