I think the general idea is there were subtle telling signs - mostly, that for someone so blatantly stupid, he still had a worrying degree of success. Dumbledore and Snape weren't idiots, and both vouched for Voldemort's cunning. Then again, the whole “Voldemort is stupid” thing mainly started to lampoon the canon, where Voldemort (and everyone else) do indeed seem stupid. Of course there needed to be a twist on that.
