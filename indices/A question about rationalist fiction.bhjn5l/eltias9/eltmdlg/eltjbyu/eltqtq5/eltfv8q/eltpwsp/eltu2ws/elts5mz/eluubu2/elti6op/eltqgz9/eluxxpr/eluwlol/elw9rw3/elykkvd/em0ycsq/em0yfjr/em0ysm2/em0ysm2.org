I guess since you are responding to this, you can ask what people think if they read these earlier comments, where a guy gives his source for a claim he makes, and then you say that somehow it doesn't reflect well on him, that doesn't make any sense, and it also makes you look self obsessed because your other comment in that chain goes "Did you know you're talking to the guy who wrote some articles for a tiny website no one cares about?"

If you are trying to build an internet personality this just makes you look like Tim Buckley
