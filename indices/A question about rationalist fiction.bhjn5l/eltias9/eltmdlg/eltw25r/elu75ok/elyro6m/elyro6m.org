  You can't have both "every human has some eternal, unchangeable essence" in the same universe as "humans grow and change" and "chemicals affect behavior".

Of course you can. Souls can just be riding the meat-bag bodies and interfacing with the brain. If the interface gets messed with substances, riding gets harder, thus chemicals affect behavior. Same as getting your head bashed doesn't affect the soul, just the brain and breaks the interface.

Growing up, your interface becomes more usable etc, it changes. Soul might also not immediately know how to use it well.
