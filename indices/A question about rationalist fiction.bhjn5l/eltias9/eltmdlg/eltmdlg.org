I'm not sure what makes you think harry's disbelief in souls is not rational given what happens in the story:

1: Brain damage exists and removes peoples' capabilities just like it does in reality.

2: Ghosts are not full entities like living people are

3: the resurrection stone brings back people that are somehow 'shadows' or also not real entities like living people are.

4: the veil seems to give incoherent whispers of something that seems like the dead.

So it seems like everything that might initially point to some kind of immortal soul doesn't really add up to that, so there really isn't any good evidence for immortal souls, so why believe it?
