This is the real problem: Rationalists typically do not have very good communication skills. They do not understand the hearts and minds of outsiders well enough to interface their own hearts and minds with those of outsiders. They do not know how to explain their ideas and concepts in terms outsiders will understand and be able to follow. And when someone cannot explain something to you in your own language, that information fails to be transmitted, and then all you can hear are words which don't mean anything to you. When a bunch of people start making a bunch of random wrong claims about you, your community, your culture and your beliefs, going through each and every wrong claim individually one by one is the wrong way to do things because that doesn't give anyone the full picture of how your counterarguments fit together and requires readers to read a huge wall of text before they can understand you and what you're saying.

No, you do not get a pass on taking the concerns of other human beings seriously. If you do not take them seriously they will definitely not take you seriously.
