While I agree with your assessment, I feel like "Rationalists typically do not have very good communication skills" is misleading. Nothing about rationalism would worsen someone's communication skills, rather, a large demographic both have poor communication skills and are attracted to rationality, biasing the sample.

I think a more precise way of phrasing it: Most rationalists do not spend enough effort to improve their communication skills.
