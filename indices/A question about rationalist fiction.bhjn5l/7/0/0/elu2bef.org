In chapter 86, Harry continues to dismiss voldemort's intelligence in spite of evidence to the contrary. Dumbledore and Snape explain that there was much more to the dark mark than initially appeared, but Harry is obstinate in spite of the fact that he "fell for" the Dark Mark's trap exactly as was intended and had this explained to him.

Failing to ask, "maybe voldemort actually had a reason for acting the way he did" was a mistake. Saying that he was right because "voldemort was just a mask and Harry's claim was that voldemort was stupid, not the person behind the mask" is just a cop-out. (I don't think Harry, after realizing how wrong he was, would disagree with me.)

("Ah, I was wrong, but actually, I was right, it's just that there was another element that I didn't have in my model!" Well yeah bro, but you're still wrong.)
