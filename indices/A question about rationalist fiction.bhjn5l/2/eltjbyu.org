at the end of HPMOR Harry realizes the extremely low standars of his rationality. His initial reaction about souls is mostly emotional but comprehensible, which in the end is proven right. But still, many of the things that Harry does end up being flaws in his reasoning that he doesn't notice because he argues himself into doing it. That's one of the lessons of HPMOR, just because you know about biases and rationality doesn't mean that you will actually reason better, you must do an actual effort to detach yourself from the instinctive biases and flinches. In the AN of chapter 1 reads "Not everything the protagonist does is a lesson in wisdom"
