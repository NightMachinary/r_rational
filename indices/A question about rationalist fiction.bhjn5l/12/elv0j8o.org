Arguably, Harry was wrong about souls not existing: the Horcrux v2 network meets most of the criteria for a definition of the soul (except that damage to the embodied mind also affects a Horcrux v2, which is contrary to how I would imagine a soul to work).

Heck, QM speculates that he could have made the Hv2 ritual work without a death, in which case I think Harry would be all for granting people "souls" left, right, and centre.
