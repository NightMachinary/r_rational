  This is very concerning to me as Harry was clearly a firm transhumanist and believed against ageing so when he found something that went against his worldview he rebelled against it and was proven right. What if he wasn't? What if souls had been objectively real? Would Harry have still been able to alter his beliefs to accept them?

When Harry discusses the matter of an afterlife with Dumbledore, he basically /pleads/ him to give him compelling evidence. This is obviously an emotionally charged issue for him (as would be, I suspect, for all of us, rationality be damned). If immortal souls exist and an afterlife is there, then death is much less of a big deal. Of course, having met magic and seen ghosts if anything his hopes about that were raised - and then crushed, when he realised that ghosts were just mental afterimages and wizards really didn't know all that much about the afterlife. I think Harry's position is pretty understandable - he'd like to believe in souls and life after death, and hence is all that much more suspicious of himself and puts any ideas in that direction under rigorous scrutiny. Because it's the one thing where he knows he could fall prey of wishful thinking, and doesn't want to.
