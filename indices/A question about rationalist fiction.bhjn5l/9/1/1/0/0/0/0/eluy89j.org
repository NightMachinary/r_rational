Thank you. +If the claims are true (and I have no reason to believe otherwise) it looks like the author is saying two things: first, Su is guilty of making up anecdotes and friends to support his positions. And second, at least on the science that the author was familiar with, Su was reasonably accurate.+

+Given this, I can't help but think you're letting your dislike of Su affect your judgement.+

Whoops, responded to the wrong person.
