It's not hard to conceptualize a magic that creates semi-stable immaterial backups of wizards' consciousness. In fact this is probably necessary for many spells we've already seen. Transforming into a cat while retaining all your memories and consciousness is not consistent with brain damage either. Nor is polyjuice.

Read Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Zombie, it handles some of this pretty well.
