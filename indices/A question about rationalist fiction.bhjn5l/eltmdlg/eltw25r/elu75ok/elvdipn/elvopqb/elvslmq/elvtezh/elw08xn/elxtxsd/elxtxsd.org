In my experience the layman's understanding of the term 'soul' is just 'me, but immortal and not requiring a body'.

Nothing about that particularly seems to be explicitly disproven by any of the evidence I've seen hear. People change and grow all the time. I don't think many Christians expect to go to Heaven and then literally remain exactly the same person for eternity because souls are 'unchanging'. The 'chemicals affect behavior' argument is pretty much dealt with the same way; I don't think many casual Christians believe they won't be able to get drunk in Heaven. This is anecdotal, but to almost everyone I've met, the 'eternal' part of the soul is far, far more important than anything about it being 'unchanging'. To the layman, I'd argue, the soul basically is just a mind-scan; only most people believe that they are the 'mind-scan', temporarily inhabiting a body, and not a 'brain that will be mind-scanned upon death'.

This conception of the soul, I think, would fit pretty nicely in the HPMOR universe. Just say that brain damage can change behavior because the soul is more indestructible than unchangeable, and what happens to be body/mind can affect it (boom! mind magic just became even more terrifying). Make Dementor's an even greater evil to defeat, because they literally eat your soul.

Honestly I was really, really surprised that didn't come up in the story. Harry spends a lot of time outraged at dementors, and yet he never thinks to himself: "Wait, people around here seem to think dementors suck out your soul; and yet the Dementor's Kiss is how we execute people? The government thinks that having your immortal soul eaten by a death demon is a suitable punishment, for anyone? What the hell?!?" The use of dementors in the Wizarding Government in canon becomes even more horrifying, once you take into account the presumable beliefs of the people employing them, and I'm surprised that never really got mentioned (that I can remember).
