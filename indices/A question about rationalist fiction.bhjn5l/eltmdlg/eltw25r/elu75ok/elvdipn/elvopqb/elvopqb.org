Mother of Learning seems to do a good jobs with the explanation for souls existing. Along with some other stuff, souls kind of act as records of a person's existence. They store information about every state the mind and body had been in since birth. Souls don't actually do any thinking on their own, they need some 'container' like a brain made of meat or magic to do it for them.

If you suffer brain damage, that damage is reflected in the soul. But since the soul stores all past states as well, it could theoretically be used as a template to restore the person or even resurrect them if they die. Problem is no mortal is that good at soul manipulation.

Souls can be observed and measured, and are known to fade away soon after a person dies. Major religions claim the souls are passing on to some kind of afterlife, and even the more cynical of soul mages seem to think that those souls go /somewhere/ and aren't just destroyed, but nobody has observed that afterlife directly.
