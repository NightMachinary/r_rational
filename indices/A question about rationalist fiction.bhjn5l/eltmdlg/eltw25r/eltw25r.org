Yeah the main problem is that souls just don't work, conceptually. You can't have both "every human has some eternal, unchangeable essence" in the same universe as "humans grow and change" and "chemicals affect behavior".

Since we obviously live in the latter universe, you end up having to compromise on the former statement, /hard/. At which point you're no longer talking about "souls", but rather something like a mind-scan or a personality initialization vector.
