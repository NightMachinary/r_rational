I don't think Harry is supposed to be a perfect rationalist. This is something so many readers miss and then complain about certain of his behaviors being irrational or unscientific.

​

He's way smarter than average and has a basic amateur scientific education - but he's not perfect! He's emotional and prone to bias like any human. He absolutely has moments of weakness, stubbornness, and irrationality. He throws temper tantrums, belittles people out of spite, and acts like a jerk just to feel clever or funny.

​

All these things are good as part of a story and characterization. They add humanity, depth, and realism. Don't expect him to always do the right thing just because he's the protagonist. He only does the best he can, given his circumstances and skills
