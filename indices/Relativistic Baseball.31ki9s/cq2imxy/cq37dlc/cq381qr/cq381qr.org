Agreed. Some questions can only be taken so seriously and the Yoda one is one of the best examples of just having fun. But once you assign non-arbitrary limitations on the power-output, you get a workable problem and he makes a sincere effort to arrive at an actual answer. That's the real take away of the book for me. (Almost) no question is beyond taking semi-seriously and making an effort to answer.
