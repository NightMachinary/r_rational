My list from last time:

- /Primer/ - two engineers invent a time machine
- /The Man From Earth/ - a college professor claims to be immortal at a going away party
- /Limitless/ - a man finds a drug that makes him smarter
- /The Prestige/ - duelling stage magicians, but fails the Idiot Ball test
- /Moneyball/ - a stats geek baseball manager uses stats to build a better team

/Limitless/ is sort of borderline, but I give it points because it's one of the few pieces of fiction that doesn't present enhanced intelligence as some terrible thing - there's no [[http://dresdencodak.com/2009/09/22/caveman-science-fiction/][Cave Man Science Fiction]] going on.

The biggest thing that films tend to fail on is the protagonist. The film can be a puzzle that you can figure out, but so often the protagonist just does the dumbest, most boneheaded things, or reacts in some animal or emotional way that's really /really/ not in their best interests.

There are also probably a ton of detective/mystery movies that I'm missing here, though it's relatively rare to get one that's a fair play whodunnit in film.
