Scribing the runes is rare because the handful of dwarves (from a different and secretive nation) that know how both want a lot of money /and/ personal favors (personal as in the person buying the runework is doing the favors) and they really hate doing the exact same work (in spirit, slightly new warehouse measurements don't count) multiple times in their career. And directly copying the work of another runesmith is even more frowned upon.

That said, once you have the rune it doesn't run out. It is rechargeable through generic ambient magic in right concentrations.

My question is if this allows for things that are /inherently/ better than what you can achieve without it in a ~16 century low-ish magic fantasy environment (Warhammer Fantasy). If there's things you can revolutionize with the freezers or heat engines or whatever other technology you use it for that a water wheel or a warehouse full of last winter's ice doesn't replicate with a much lower starting cost.
