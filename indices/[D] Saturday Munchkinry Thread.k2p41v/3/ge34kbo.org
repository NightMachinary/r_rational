You are aware of a string of magical runes which can be tattooed onto a person in order to make their body as tough as steel. The full inscription is around two dozen characters long and has no technically restrictions on size, so long as the marks remain legible and are not significantly altered or smudged. Having the runes covered by clothing (or even armour) is fine, but having someone drop an ink blotch over one of the characters or managing to damage the skin over the inscription (despite the protection) will cancel the entire effect until the change is reversed.

The 'tough as steel' effect only applies to the physical durability of the body. It does not result in increased mass, conductivity, magnetism, ductility, elasticity, brittleness, visual properties, specific heat texture or anything similar, nor does it limit the beneficiary's range of motion, flexibility, speed or ability to exercise properly. In effect, no force can damage the beneficiary except to the degree that said force would also be able to damage a volume of steel identical in size and shape to the beneficiary - if they are shot with an arrow, the arrow will only penetrate their body as deeply as it would a steel statue of their exact size and pose in the moment that the arrow struck. This will never increase the damage dealt; if you were to apply some force or chemical reaction which would do more damage to steel than it would flesh, their body is instead treated as flesh for the purposes of how badly the beneficiary is harmed. This notably does not include any resistance to being moved; blows which actually injure a beneficiary are almost always sufficient to knock them several feet back.

This technique is widely known and practiced between two rival feudal kingdoms. The runic inscription is usually applied to a soldier's upper left arm (assuming they're right handed - it's applied on the right side for southpaws) and armoured with a metal spaulder, but some forces prefer putting it on the lower back or on the back of one of the legs instead, depending on the degree to which they wish to make the inscription inaccessible to enemies vs. how easy they wish to make care for the inscription itself.

Your task is to figure out what form of martial arts (taken expansively to include everything from marksmanship to grappling to body throws to swordplay) and equipment (taken with similar expansiveness - if you have a solid reason for why every company requires a battering ram, so be it) could be usefully applied between two groups of professional soldiers who are all benefiting from the above protection.
