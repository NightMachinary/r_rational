Throw bottles of ink at the enemy. Hope a drop runs down inside the Armour over the runes.

Tie people to big rock, chuck in lake.

One person on the front line tries to loop rope around the other side, then the dozen men behind them tug on the rope, dragging the unfortunate opponent to them, and tie up or dispatch the captive. Say by pinning them down, poring ink on the runes, and then stabbing. Or just poring water in their mouth.
