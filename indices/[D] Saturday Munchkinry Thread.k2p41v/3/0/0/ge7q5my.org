The fact that the body is as durable as steel would make the appliance of two or more inscriptions far harder independent of other 'rules'. So complete all wanted inscriptions up to the second last rune. Then finish them completely. Whatever might be useful to get ink into steel-like skin I don't know. Far more force and durable needle or acid maybe.

Or maybe tattooed can also mean /paint on the skin/ here. Or scratching.
