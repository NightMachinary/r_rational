Oh, does the meta-power only consider the powers granted in isolation? Then using Chrono Trigger, I grant myself the spell Life 2 (raise recently-dead with full health), a friend the sword technique Cyclone (spinning sword attack), and another friend Robo's laser spin (it's lasers). Of those, the only one whose dark mirror I'm particularly concerned with is Life 2. But they combine to make the triple-tech Lifeline, which grants all allies an auto-revive the next time they would die. That seems like a great thing to go around spreading across the countryside.

edit: Using Chrono Trigger as a source is a bit of a gamble, given that it's a setting with significant time-travel. I don't think Life 2 is strong enough to warrant evil time travelers as a response, but I'd definitely sit down and research other systems inspired by CT before committing to a plan that brings it in.
