Will the opposing power line up to be more powerful in concept, or more powerful in execution? To give a theoretical example, say I give myself a magical power that requires some level of training in high-level mathematics to use, with the expectation that the other person will get the opposing power (requiring high-level training in, I don't know, archeaology to use). Will the other power be powerful enough that the evil person would be more powerful with no knowledge in it, even if I have large amounts of knowledge with mine? Or is it possible that I am more powerful due to my required knowledge, while the other person doesn't have it? Or will this not matter, because the opposing power will be given to someone who has knowledge in archaeology?
