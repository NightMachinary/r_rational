What happens if I take the Sith force powers instead? Would the evil person get the light sided force powers? Would they be forced to temper their emotions and personalities to use and stay within the light side, lest they fall to the dark side and become powerless because the only sith force powers are mine?

Really this question could boil down to finding things that require goodness to use, and forcing them upon the evil person. Or finding things that reverse-corrupt people so they turn good, whether they like it or not. (You would get the evil/corrupt version of the thing, but you could just, /not/ use them.)

Alternatively, you could take parts of things that don't do anything until they are combined. For example, you could take 3 dragon balls, while the evil person gets the remaining 4, which is slightly better than 3. None of the balls have any use until all 7 are combined, at which point the owner gets a wish granted. So this would end up becoming a battle between you and the evil person to gather all 7 dragon balls, and the evil person wouldn't really have an advantage.
