If you give Frodo a lightsaber Sauron gets a Deathstar: the power.

You can take objects, powers, alternate rules of physics, and entire magic systems out of published and established works of fiction. But for everything you take out, someone evil gets a slightly better object/power/magic from the same work of fiction. If the object/power/magic has a clearly evil counterpart, it will likely (with some caveats) be what they get.

By published and established it means read/watched primarily for enjoyment by at least 10,000 people.

If you use the same work of fiction several times it becomes unusable.

To give some examples: if you take out a lightsaber for yourself, someone evil will get a lightsaber and a blaster. If you give yourself light sided force powers someone else gets Sith force powers, and they are more powerful. If you take out the light side of the force as a whole, the dark side as a whole also becomes accessible and it is quicker, easier, and more seductive to learn. The powers aren't always exactly opposite, especially if you have a counter lined up or there is no clear opposite. For example, if you have the Elements of Harmony from MLP ready to purge the dark side as soon as you bring out the light side, instead some Neo-Nazis get a star destroyer. Or if you take out the Holy Grail from the Bible, you might get Satan or a literal beast from revelation or a metaphorical beast of revelation or any number of things since it lacks a clear opposite.

Super tech often comes with alternate laws of physics, making it impossible to reverse engineer, unless you bring in the alternate physics into reality as well. Seemingly reverse-engineer-able tech, like super intelligent AI will often cheat with alternate laws of physics.

You can take out fanfic variants (if the fanfic has had at least 10,000 readers), but then the evil opposite is even less predictable as it can come from any fanfic variation, not just the fanfic you used.
