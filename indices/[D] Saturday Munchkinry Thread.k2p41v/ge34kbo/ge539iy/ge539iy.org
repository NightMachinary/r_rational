Nets, bolos, lassos, pit traps, ect.

Nothing about this stops anyone from just tying you up or entangling you. Finding and messing with the inscription is a mugs game with a resisting opponent, but a martial art based on lots and lots of rope and grappling works regardless if you can find it.

Also, anyone wishing to be hardcore about this would obviously inscribe on their tongue.

Note that this means the consequences of loosing a battle will nearly always be entirely financial - the loosing side will have few-to-no casualties (mostly people drowning in mud or otherwise choking to death while restrained) but lots of prisoners taken, so ransoms all around.
