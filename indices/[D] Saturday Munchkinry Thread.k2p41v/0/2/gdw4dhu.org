Well I don't know what “1 Newton of force” is, so I would probably begin by moving progressively heavy shit. Can I move my self/bed/fridge/car? Does it cost me anything other than time (I.e calories, muscle strain, etc?)

Once I figure out the practical weight usage I'd move on to this “by focusing” thing. Can I make a feather float and then forget about it, and it stays floating? Does making heavier stuff float require more direct concentration? For instance if I can “forget” about the feather, can I “forget” about something heavier?

Once I have this stuff figured out I'd begin exercising it. Can I make it stronger? If I really can't improve it then I'd start playing a sport. I can probably make a ton of money playing golf. Or if the telekinesis is relatively “free” I would have to look into generating power. I wonder if that would be cost effective.
