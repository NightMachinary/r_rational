What is the range? Does it work through obstacles? What is the cooldown on this ability, if any?

1 Newton is pretty weak, but if you don't need line of sight, it is probably enough to kill someone by attacking their brain with telekinesis.

1 Newton is also enough to lift up a coin and move it around, which is proof of supernatural powers and so would let you win the Randi Prize.

And if you live long enough for space exploration to really take off, 1 newton telekinesis constantly applied can save a lot of rocket fuel on an interstellar journey.
