Acquire high-level D&D wizard spells. Your evil counterpart might be higher level (and possibly a druid or something), but it doesn't matter.

Because you're expecting this. You have done your reading and planning, and they have not.

In the time it'll take them to recover from the shock, figure out the extent of their abilities, wonder if they should perhaps put some defences up just in case etc., you'll have divined their location and cast an instant death spell.

This strategy works for any similarly complex and lethal powerset.
