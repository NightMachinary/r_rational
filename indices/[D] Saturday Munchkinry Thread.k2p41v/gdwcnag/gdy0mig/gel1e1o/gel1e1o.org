This wouldn't be as simple as you're making it sound. 9th-level spells are the best a player character gets access to, but there's some overpowered abilities for monsters/gods. Your counterpart always gets the better power, so you know for a fact they're getting some bullshit legendary abilities and resistances if you're getting the full repertoire of a high-level Wizard. You try to instantly kill them? You can't assume they would have few enough hit points for a Power Word to affect them, and even if you were that lucky, they have legendary resistance; they choose to have it not affect them and immediately retaliate.

You can still win with preparation (there's nothing a high-level Wizard can't defeat with sufficient preparation) but it would be time-consuming and expensive to prepare the kind of magical arsenal required to take out the "death star" counterpart to your /Wish/ spell. Assume you'd be fighting a god from D&D, rather than another player.
