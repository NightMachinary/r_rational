I think this is very easy.

Let's go with Dragon Balls example.

evil person is not silly, and most likely won't just believe that their dragon balls are really working. They also can't test them, because they won't have all 7 at once.\\
So all you need to do is summon one dragon ball (the evil one might get two of them or so), then get the evil's person ball (kill him or just steal the ball) and then repeat (if limit is 3 times, then summon two balls at once or so).

even if you wish for dragon balls detector for the second wish and the evil's one will get a better detector, then you're still at advantage because you know it works magically and evil one can have his doubts

That way you can get easily 7 dragon balls basically for free (without giving anything to evil)

the greatest power you have here is the knowledge and preparedness, not the exact magical item summoned, so you have to use your knowledge (or the evil's one lack of knowedleg) as your advantage
