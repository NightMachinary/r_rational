It could be end up either way. To use your archaeology based magic example if it ends up with a person that doesn't know archaeology, it would be easier to use, requiring relatively less knowledge of archaeology than your power requires in math. Alternatively it might end up with someone that knows lots of archaeology. Either way, the evil power ends up being slightly better in some way. This doesn't mean with enough practice and training you couldn't match or surpass it (studying more math, crowd sourcing math work, etc.) the evil power just has a head start.
