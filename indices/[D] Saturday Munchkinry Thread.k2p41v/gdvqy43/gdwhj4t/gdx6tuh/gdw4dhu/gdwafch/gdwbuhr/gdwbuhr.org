Wow so scratch most of my comment then, I'd probably play whatever dice game is at the casino for quick money. Then I'd maybe work on surgery skills, yeah. Maybe dislodging blood clots? Or identifying them. That is a really small amount. I'm not sure how to best munchkin it. Depending on range I could be really effective in space? Like a barrier to particles.

Edit: okay so something I just thought of: aren't there standards of measure for scientific stuff? I could be the most accurate 100gram measurer of all time. That could be valuable.

Does electricity have a weight? Can I munchkin this into controlling tiny electrical currents?

Edit: so electricity doesn't have weight, so that is out. But if the telekinesis is line of sight based (I would need to test this) I could handle really dangerous chemicals remotely. There's got to be some mixing or chemists (not drug dealing) out there experimenting with really dangerous shit who'd love to not have to dress their guys up in tons of PPE.
