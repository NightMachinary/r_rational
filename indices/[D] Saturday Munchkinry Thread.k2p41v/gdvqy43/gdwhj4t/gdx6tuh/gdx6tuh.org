Lift a ChipSat into orbit. If this is for a work of fiction, lockpicking and hacking might be relevant. Surgery, especially the same kinds as you'd normally need to thread a long endoscope through blood vessels and the like. Move around a camera streaming to a display I'm watching; this feedback might let me move the camera arbitrarily far away and behind obstacles, and it'd be much smaller and quieter than a quadcopter, and can be pushed through obstacles without getting tangled, etc. If evil, apply pressure to just the right part of someone's brain to impair their judgment and make them suggestible, or make them fall asleep, or fly into a rage, or whatever else would benefit you socially. DE-orbit satellites is a lot easier than getting them up into orbit. Can be used offensively or for ones that are supposed to be decommissioned. Political assassination; hide in a crowd, and use any of the myriad kill options the power fives or just use it to anonymously weld a more conventional weapon like a tiny syringe of poison. Pick up small arthropods that you might risk squishing if you used your sausage fingers. Slightly inconvenience people you hate by making them spill drinks, untying their shoelaces, toggling caps lock, wiggling loose wires, placing flies into their food, etc.
