A restriction which I didn't think to state was that there's a limit of one such inscription per person.

E: To be a bit more specific, applying the effect requires additional conditions beyond just getting the runic script correct, but each correct application overwrites and replaces any previous applications. At no point can a person have more than one valid and functioning inscription at a given time.
