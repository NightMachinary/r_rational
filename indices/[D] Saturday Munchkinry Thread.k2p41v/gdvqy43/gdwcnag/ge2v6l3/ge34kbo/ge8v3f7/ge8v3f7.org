So you have a magical rune capable of taking enough heat out of a room or compartment to transform it into a walk-in freezer and shunt said heat all into, say, a steam boat's boiler with enough efficiency that it affects how much fuel consumption it requires to keep the boat moving. And it can be expected to do so for /at least/ ten weeks in a row without needing to be recharged.

Given that the society that has this rune doesn't know about electricity and that the magical rune is rare and hard to replicate (forget mass production), what is the simplest way to create insane amounts of value?
