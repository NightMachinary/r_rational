Everyone will obey you for 10 years. They can't do physically impossible things but they can do things that seem near mentally impossible (for example if you command them to stop smoking they will act as if it's all their willpower, life and death, whatever psychological tricks are needed).

You may communicate your commands by any means, the person needs to understand them for it to work but they automatically can tell the difference between a message sent by you or sent by someone else.

You may decide what system to use to resolve conflicting commands.

What's the best and longest lasting use of this power?

How could you make a story about this and make it interesting?
