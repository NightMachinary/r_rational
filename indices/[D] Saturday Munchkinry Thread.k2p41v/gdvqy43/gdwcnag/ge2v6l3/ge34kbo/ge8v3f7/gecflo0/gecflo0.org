This depends on the specifics of what makes it rare. If there a limited but regular supply, you set up a refrigeration business - selling blocks of ice for iceboxes, and ice-cream. Before ubiquitous refrigeration, and in places that do not have it today, food spoilage is an enormous problem, so there is a lot of value in cold storage and you can extract a pretty high percentage of it.

If it is rare but irregular in supply, - it is written in the heartblood of a vampire, and hunters tend to turn up with five vials of the stuff at once, and then you do not see any for ten years, kind of thing, you cant do this, because cutting of the supply of iceblocks when people count on them would be... bad. Pitch-forks and torches.

So what you do is head to the largest, richest, city you can find, wait for high summer, and sell frozen treats until you run out.
