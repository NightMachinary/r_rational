It is very hard to beat "Better food storage". Less spoilage means you can have more non-farm workers per farmer, which is the foundation of wealth, both for farmers and cities - There will be a quite noteworthy difference between a city with an operation and one without one, the operator will be fantastically wealthy (Less so if the city has acquired more than one operation. But if it is a monopoly, the wealth of the prince of ice may be reckoned in whole percentage points of the entire city) and of course, there will be an conjoined operation exploiting the heat source. (Bathhouses. Industry, ect.).

But some more interesting variations, which will probably exist simply because they caught the attention of a dwarf for not being another warehouse.

Refrigerated ships permit the long distance export of meat in bulk. This means someplace has an opening for becoming Argentina - But an Argentina very dependent on specific ships continuing to operate.

Hot air flight: The rune is, among other things, a zero-weight source of heat. This means you can make a hot air ballon that can fly indefinitely.
