It would probably invent a slightly stronger variant and give it to an evil person.

Preparation and training would work to maximize your ability to leverage your power. If the dark side user doesn't train well, you could surpass them.

Teamwork and synergies between powers would also work. I.e. train an entire group of Force Users knowing that dark side force users can't work well together. For synergies... if the dark side is active, get the Elements of Harmony to purge it, and use your light sabers to beat down whatever dark magic comes out of MLP.

I was hoping someone would come up with a chain of different powers to draw on, using the powers from one setting to counter the evil powers from another. It would end up being a gamble, but if you could manage to get ahead of the evil powers you could snowball into arbitrary powers capable of solving global problems, making the risk worth it. The new Sith Lord might be able to beat your force powers, but can he also beat your Green Lantern Ring and Harry Potter magic (which would require you to take down a Yellow Lantern Ring, and a dark wizard but once you go the powers stay with you).
