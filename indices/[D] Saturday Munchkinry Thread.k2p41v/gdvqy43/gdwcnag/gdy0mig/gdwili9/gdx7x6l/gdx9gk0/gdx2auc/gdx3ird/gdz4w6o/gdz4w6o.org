Oh, you can take more than one thing? I thought it would just be a one-time thing, so I didn't think about chaining.

Hmm, if you take more than one thing, what about the evil person? Is it the exact same evil person getting stronger versions of your things every time? Or are there different evil people getting them? This distinction is very important.

In case 1, since it is the exact same evil person every time, you could first pick a REALLY OBVIOUS but not particularly useful thing. That would let you identify the evil person ASAP. So for example, you could pick an ordinary building from any slice-of-life modern day story, and they would get an ordinary skyscraper which is slightly better than your building. Such a skyscraper appearing out of nowhere would be blatantly obvious, yet not be particularly exploitable.

This would let you narrow down the evil person's location quickly. Repeat with more obvious items until you identify the evil person. Then you can capture them, knock them unconscious, and then you have free reign to summon pretty much anything you want, except for powers that would cause the evil person to regain consciousness or can be used unconsciously.

So case 1 is pretty much the best scenario, where it wouldn't be that difficult to gain nigh omnipotence.

In case 2, the things you take on have slightly stronger versions that can go to different evil people, but the things will always go to you. This presents an opportunity for summoning items that only work when combined, but are useless when separated.

For example, the 7 dragon balls. You can summon each ball one by one, so the evil people get one slightly stronger ball each, whereas you get all 7 so you can actually get a wish while they can't.

Of course, this runs the risk that the same evil person may be selected multiple times, or said evil people are close enough to cooperate and defeat you. So ideally, you wouldn't choose dragonballs, but rather something else that can be split into tons and tons of useless pieces.

So now the question is, what fictional thing optimizes this criteria? Could you summon a standard RPG system, then constantly summon 1 xp over and over every nanosecond? That way you would get crap tons of xp and become super high leveled, while the evil people get more xp as a whole, but the xp is divided so they only get a bunch of mid-leveled evil people that you can curbstomp? This is not quite ideal either, because the evil people become stronger than everyone that isn't you, and can do a lot of damage before you hunt them down.
