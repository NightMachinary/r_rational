What happens if you choose the most powerful thing from a given work of fiction? There's no more powerful thing to give the evil side; does the meta-power invent a stronger variant of your thing? That is, can you beat it by having already saturated your fictional source?

The only other munchkin option I can think of is to find a setting with powers that take a very large amount of preparation and training, and perform that training well in advance of actually using the meta-power to introduce the thing you're training for. Still quite a gamble.
