Entirely fair, but Wish is /really good/. Not necessarily in terms of combat, but in terms of real-world applications, which you would presumably be using it for after you +murdered in cold blood+ preemptively defended yourself from your counterpart. Really, 9th level spells in general are the ones that would be large-scale game-changers to be able to cast. Don't get me wrong, Illusory Dragon is cool and all, but being able to cast True Polymorph and turn a chunk of limestone into a /real/ dragon, permanently, would be much cooler.
