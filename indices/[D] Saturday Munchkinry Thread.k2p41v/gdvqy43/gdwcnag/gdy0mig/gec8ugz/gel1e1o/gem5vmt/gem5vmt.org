  9th-level spells are the best a player character gets access to, but there's some overpowered abilities for monsters/gods. Your counterpart always gets the better power, so you know for a fact they're getting some bullshit legendary abilities and resistances if you're getting the full repertoire of a high-level Wizard.

Hey, I don't have to go all the way to 9th and force the other guy into epic bullshit. I can stop at 8th and let the other guy get 9th.
