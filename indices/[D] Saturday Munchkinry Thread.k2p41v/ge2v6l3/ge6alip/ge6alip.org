How much control do I have over the shape and time variance? Can I display complex images on my skin and use that to communicate faster? How fast can I blink a binary/morse message? Can I emit light from my brain and tell it to emit a flash from any neuron only when it fires and get an implant that records my brain activity that way?

Other than that kind of exploit that uses it for communication, this is a relatively small amount of energy and something we can make a just plain better technological version of using LEDs sewn into a suit. I guess if you end up in combat you can act as a living flashbang without the bang.
