You have the ability to emit light from any part of your body, up to emitting light from your whole body. This light has the same spectrum as sunlight. In effect, it looks somewhat like sun on a noon with no clouds. You can only emit light, no heat is emitted. The light is only emitted in the visible spectrum, so you're not gonna be melting anything or giving people cancer. You can control the brightness from that of a 60W incandescent bulb up to the apparent brightness of the sun on a bright, clear day.

What can you do with this power?
