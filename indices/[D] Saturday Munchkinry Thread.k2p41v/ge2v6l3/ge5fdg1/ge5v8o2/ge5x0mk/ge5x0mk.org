Solar panels mostly use visible light to generate energy, so you'd be able to essentially replicate the sun for that purpose (but better, since you don't set and aren't blocked by bad weather). The main issue would be maximizing the surface area of panels with line-of-sight to you. Best bet is probably a house made of clear plastic in an enormous enclosure with an interior covered entirely in panels. Plastic and not glass so that if any of the panels or components fall on it it won't shatter.
