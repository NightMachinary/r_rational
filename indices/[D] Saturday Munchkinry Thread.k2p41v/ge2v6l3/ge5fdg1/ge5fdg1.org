Does emitting light require more calories than not, and does emitting more/brighter light require more calories than emitting less/dimmer light? If not, hooray for free energy! I contract with whatever solar company is willing to pay me the most while including a clause in the contract that some percentage of the profits they make from my energy will go to poverty alleviation.

Am I protected from my own radiation? If I make my hand sun-bright and put it on my chest, will my chest get sunburned? If my eyes are radiating, can I see? I hope the answer to the first question is "yes," because otherwise I'd have to be way more careful--it would be great to go sun-bright and have perfect darkness to sleep in while still providing energy. Otherwise I guess I can just get a glass chair and build one wall of my house out of glass, and sit with my back facing that wall while I read/play video games/whatever and use my back to power the panels.
