No extra energy required, the light emission is a supernatural ability.

No infrared heat is emitted, since the light is only in the visible spectrum. You are protected from the radiation and blinding intensity of your own light. I'm not sure how much risk there is of getting cancer from intense /visible/ light, but it shouldnt be too much.

I'm not sure how much it is, but there is a limit to how bright something could be in the visible spectrum. Any brighter and you're emitting radiation at smaller wavelengths. So I'm wondering if being used as a free energy source is all that useful when the scale is so low.
