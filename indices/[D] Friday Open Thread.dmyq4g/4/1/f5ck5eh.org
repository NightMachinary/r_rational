How much helium do you get from transfiguring a solid object? It's so light one might worry about silent low-oxygen asphyxiation where you're giddy and then you're dead (since the "oh no, I can't breathe" sensation is triggered by CO2 buildup, not lack of O2). Failing that, the helium would dissolve into your blood, proportional to the helium's partial pressure in the air you breathe (is that how that works?). So you'd have iron dust, some carbon, some paint -- dissolved into your blood.

But maybe it's the wrong question to ask how much helium gas you get. Because when it turns back, be it much or little helium, it's still going to be a filing cabinet's worth of matter. If you can fit say 3x16x20=960 humans into a smallish room, that'd be like grinding a 10%width x 10%height x 10%depth chunk of the filing cabinet into super-fine dust and mixing it into your blood (and a bit for your lungs) -- and possibly the helium may have entered into cells and interstitial fluid as well? I don't think I would care to try that.
