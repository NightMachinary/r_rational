There's a big difference between "could cause cancer" and "causes cancer." It's virtually impossible to prove that something can't cause cancer, but since evidentially the increased risk is so minimal that the FDA sets limits for this kind of stuff with safety conscious margins of error and they aren't even being reached, the scientific consensus is most probably that it's not an issue.
