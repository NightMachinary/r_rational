  But it sounds like the consensus is that the increased risk is pretty minimal.

Um, no, it doesn't. I had written off "cell phones might cause cancer" years ago as nonsense because I assumed it was the case that there was a consensus that the risk is negligible or else they wouldn't be mass manufacturing the things. But it sounds like that /isn't/ the case, based on a huge collection of people whose career is researching electromagnetic fields and non-ionizing radiation. When you say that it sounds like it /is/ the case, what are you basing that on? A quick skim of one section of one wikipedia article?

  If the risk [were] higher, you'd see news articles in the vein of "proximity to cellphone towers correlated with increased mortality rate."

I don't know that we would. Like the article says, there's been little research into the effects of 4G. I smoked half a pack of cigarettes a day for 10 years. I'm good right now, I lift weights and do cardio four days a week, but who knows, maybe twenty years from now I'll come down with a bit of lung cancer when I'm in my 50s or a spot of emphysema or bronchitis.

4G has only been around for 10 years. That's nowhere near enough time to be making definitive statements like "people who live near cell phone towers would be dropping dead by now if they were harmful." How many decades could you spend ten hours in an office building or an aeroplane without ever taking a breath that didn't contain tobacco smoke? Obviously the entire population of people who lived through the heyday of the cigarette didn't die despite the ubiquity of secondhand smoke, and obviously everybody knows somebody who's got a grandma who rocked a pack-and-a-half a day habit for multiple decades and she still lived to the ripe old age of 97.

  we'd already be seeing extremely clear population wide-trends by plotting cancer rates against rate of adoption of these technologies.
#+end_quote

I don't know that we aren't.

  ... we are seeing increases in certain types of head and neck tumors in tumor registries, which may be at least partially attributable to the proliferation of cell phone radiation. These increases are consistent with results from case-control studies of tumor risk in heavy cell phone users.

So, whatever, 5G is going to come no matter what, it's either going to be harmful or it isn't.
