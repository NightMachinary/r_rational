If they got a 5G wireless VR headset working, it would be an extremely expensive toy sold in low volumes to enthusiasts. It would indeed be useful as a prestige project, but if even a single article comes out with the headline "5G causes cancer," that would destroy faith in HTC and their headsets, even if the subtext of the article is '5G linked to increase in cancer risk...smaller than the increase caused by eating beef once a week.'
