That's just the thing. A majority of headsets sold right now started off as Qualcomm reference designs. Qualcomm is "secretly" the driving force behind VR right now, and they've already got 5G wireless headsets working. Companies are expected to start making consumer products based on the Qualcomm reference design around late summer or early fall of this year.

The 5G headsets are probably going to be in the same price range as the Oculus Quest, around $400.

Regardless, there's not much point in discussing it now, but I'm pretty sure this issue is going to be getting more public attention over the next six months to a year, so we'll just have to wait and see.
