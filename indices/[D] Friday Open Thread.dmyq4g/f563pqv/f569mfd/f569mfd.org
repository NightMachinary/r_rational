I read the article, and the author's position is also that all the other forms of cell phone radiation cause cancer as well. Given that the consensus is that exposure to other types of wireless transmission doesn't cause cancer (or at least, increase risk only extremely marginally), I'm inclined to believe the author ia misrepresenting the science and the consensus about cancer caused by 5g use. Not for malicious reasons, just out of motivated reasoning. He's been trying to prove cell phones cause cancer for a while now.
