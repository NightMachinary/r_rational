Anybody have any thoughts on this?

Yes the word "blog" is in the URL, but also "the scientists who signed this appeal arguably constitute the majority of experts on the effects of nonionizing radiation. They have published more than 2,000 papers and letters on EMF in professional journals."

I really want 5G to /not/ kill us because VR stands to benefit /massively/ from it, but as the article says, in the 10 years since the advent of 4G "we are seeing increases in certain types of head and neck tumors in tumor registries, which may be at least partially attributable to the proliferation of cell phone radiation. These increases are consistent with results from case-control studies of tumor risk in heavy cell phone users."

Patent leaks for the PlayStation 5 and PSVR2 seem to indicate a high likelihood of the console using a personal 5G transmitter to allow the PSVR2 to be wireless like the Oculus Quest but without the graphical limitations of a mobile chipset. It's likely that all of the second gen VR headsets (Rift S and Vive Cosmos and Valve Index are all still first gen headsets, fyi) are going to try to go down that 5G path, and I think I might no longer feel comfortable with the idea of wearing something like that on my face for extended periods of time.
