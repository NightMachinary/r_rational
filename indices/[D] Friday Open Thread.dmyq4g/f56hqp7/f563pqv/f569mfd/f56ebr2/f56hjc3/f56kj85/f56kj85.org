I mean, the wiki page you linked says the same thing as the article, that in 2011 the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified cell phone radiation as "possibly carcinogenic to humans." Like, given a quick browse through that wikipedia page, I don't see anything that poses a legitimate challenge to the article's assertion that the 240 EMF scientists constitute the majority of EMF experts.
