  evidentially the increased risk is so minimal that the FDA sets limits for this kind of stuff with safety conscious margins of error and they aren't even being reached

  Numerous recent scientific publications have shown that EMF affects living organisms at levels well below most international and national guidelines. Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general well-being in humans. Damage goes well beyond the human race, as there is growing evidence of harmful effects to both plant and animal life.

Those sort of contradict each other. I'm sorry, but I really can't help but feel that one of them (yours) holds a lot less weight than the other.

There were a bunch of "experts" paid by the tobacco industry to talk about how allegations of negative health effects from tobacco were just ridiculous conspiracies and fear mongering, and that went on for decades, literally as long as it was physically possible for them to keep denying the fact that tobacco causes cancer. It could very easily turn out that the neo-'30s will be just chock full of brain tumors, and people will look back like they did with tobacco and say "how did they not realize that was going to have negative health effects?"

My main concern is that The Future^{TM} hinges on widespread adoption of 5G and so people are skipping to the bottom of the paper to write "and /therefore/, 5G is nothing to worry about." Like, Google's got Stadia coming out soon, and Microsoft is working on xCloud. There's big money - /unfathomably huge money/ - invested in the future of low-latency wireless streaming, y'know?
