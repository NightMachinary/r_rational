These aren't contradictory. Virtually anything can cause cancer under the right conditions, probably including [1-5]G transmissions. But it sounds like the consensus is that the increased risk is pretty minimal. If the risk was higher, you'd see news articles in the vein of "proximity to cellphone towers correlated with increased mortality rate." I can understand the concern that special interests are suppressing more research into the subject, or even just that wishful thinking makes us want to ignore the risks. But given the rapid increase in the ubiquity of these transmissions across the developed world, and now the increase across the developing world, we'd already be seeing extremely clear population wide-trends by plotting cancer rates against rate of adoption of these technologies.
