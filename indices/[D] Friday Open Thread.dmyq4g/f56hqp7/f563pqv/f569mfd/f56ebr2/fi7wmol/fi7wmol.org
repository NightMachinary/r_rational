Not to be some type of way, but...

  Asked why the company wasn't considering a 5G streaming approach, I was told that HTC is essentially erring on the side of caution when it comes to concerns about cellular radiation and opting not to introduce a product where a 5G radio is essentially strapped to the wearer's head.

  Beyond positioning itself as a rival in one or both of the increasingly important mixed reality markets, HTC apparently doesn't want to place 5G hardware directly next to the user's head.

HTC is one of the three biggest players in VR, tied with Facebook and Qualcomm. They could make a ton of money by putting out a completely wireless headset that streams over a 5G connection, and they're not. If a major corporation is showing caution in the face of profit, I don't think it's unreasonable to be concerned about the technology.
