With regards to article one, while qualcomm does indeed provide the chips for standalone headsets, and standalone headsets have been extremely successful, there's not really a use case for wireless standalone headsets. The thing they're most likely to connect to is a 5G smartphone, except even a highe-end 5G smartphone isn't likely to be significantly more powerful than the headset itself, while also having a cost comparable to a desktop pc capable of using desktop vr. So the same kind of rich enthusiast I mentioned in my previous post is the target market here, and therefore the same concerns about bad press from 5G apply.

Meanwhile, the second article is written in a manner I find indicative of irreputability. There are naked appeals to authority ("We the undersigned, scientists and doctors," "Over 230 scientists from more than 40 countries"). There are plenty of italics thrown around, and even bolded italic passages. There are attempts to emotionally manipulate the reader by listing harmful things potentially attributable to EM radiation (e.g. "Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general well-being in humans.") without any critical analysis or comments about the relative severity and plausibility of these claims.

The article appears to be well sourced due to the prevalence of bright blue links, but of these links, the majority were

- Non-scientific sources like news articles and procedural documents, that support some tangential point but don't reinforce the central thesis that phone Em radiation causes cancer.
- Scientific sources that, from a skim of their abstracts, use emotionally charged or underspecified language that make me suspect motivated reasoning on the part of their authors.
- Scientific sources that reference thoroughly debunked topics, most notably "Electromagnatic hypersensitivity " which falls into the same class of bullshit as windmill sickness and people believing they have psychic abilities. And yes, "bullshit" is emotionally charged language on my part, to the point of being an ad-hominem. But I hope you can understand how disappointing I find the use of a syndrome of such a psychosomatic nature in what claims to be an evidence-based argument. It's entirely possible someone already predisposed to agree with the authors will read this and start feeling anxiety that they'll blame on "EM hypersensitivity," thus making this article actually harmful.
- Scientific sources that claim causation without properly eliminating correlation.

It would be a pain to list every hyperlink and categorize what kind of disreputable I found it to be, but the ones I found to be relatively reputable were as follows: [[https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2017/9218486/][1]] [[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10669-011-9307-z][2]] [[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/05/26/055699.full.pdf][3]] [[https://publications.iarc.fr/126][4]] [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5376454/][5]] [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891061815000599][6]] [[https://www.spandidos-publications.com/ijo/51/2/405][7]] [[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/05/26/055699.full.pdf][8]], so you can ask me about why any link not in this list was excluded. From these links, I see a lot of "X causes a specific kind of brain cancer in rats," and while I wouldn't dispute the science done, I would dispute the relevance. I find it entirely plausible that there is a strong correlation between EM radiation and cancer risk. But that is not the same thing as a strong effect. Model organisms like rats are good for establishing correlations, but since 1992, [[https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/brain.html][brain cancer rates have remained steady or even fallen slightly.]] Even if phones are increasing the risk of cancer rates, they aren't doing so by much. And yes, obviously cancer has a long lag time, and 5G will require higher levels of EM radiation than currently. But in effect, we've already put into practice the precautionary principle by gradually introducing higher levels of EM radiation over long periods of time, to see minimal or even nonexistent effects.

This was obviously a paper written to be catchy and eye grabbing to the layman, rather than one intended to advance a serious argument against 5G. And while it's entirely possible to have people poorly argue in favor of good points, I find it conspicuous that while this paper refers constantly to "substantial increase[s]" and statistically significant increase[s]" in a number of bad things, including the word 'risk' which is repeated 12 times, the words "percent," "proportion," "likelihood," etcetera aren't used a single time.

Hard numbers sound threatening; If I can say, "eating beef increases risk of cancer by 5%," I'm going to say it, even though it's small, because that's a definite, hard number. Especially if there's a good way to make it sound bigger than it is. Take a look at this article about the cancer risk of [[https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/21639/cancer-prevention/diet-exercise/nutrition-diet/fruit-vegetables/meat-and-cancer/][red meat]] They mention that "one in six (or 2600) new bowel cancer cases in Australia were associated with consuming too much red meat and processed meat." That's not a huge increase; if an scientifically literate person reads it, they'll think "oh, so someone who eats a lot of red meat, which is likely comorbid with other cancer-causing activities, has a ~17% higher (or less) chance of getting certain forms of cancer. But it is still pretty eye grabbing, and you can bet plenty of people have already used that statistic to argue in favor of vegetarianism or pescetarianism to their families.

In the end, I still find it likely that the benefits of 5G will massively outweigh the health drawbacks, because the economic acceleration caused by the entry of 5G will enrich everyone through knockoff effects, and the one thing almost universally correlated with better health outcomes is higher wealth. From a utilitarian perspective, a marginally increased risk of brain cancer is a small price to pay for many people to put themselves into a financial position to have better healthcare availability. And of course, the fun of wireless VR is nothing to scoff at either; quality-of-life adjusted average years of life will almost certainly still increase, even if overall years of life decreases slightly.
