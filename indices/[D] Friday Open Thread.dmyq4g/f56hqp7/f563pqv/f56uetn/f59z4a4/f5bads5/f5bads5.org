The thought has probably been mentioned somewhere, but in the HPMoR rules of transfiguration, wouldn't transfiguring noble gasses be almost entirely safe? You'd have to be working with dangerous starting materials for them to be dangerous to spread around, and the worst case for most materials would be like, iron reappearing in my lungs in very small volumes based on how much transfigured helium I'd inhaled, which probably isn't much.
