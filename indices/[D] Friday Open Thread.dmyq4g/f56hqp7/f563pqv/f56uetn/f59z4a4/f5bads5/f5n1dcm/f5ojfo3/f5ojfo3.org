I think the idea was to keep the transfiguration for long enough that we'd be talking about isolated atoms. Hm, I'm not sure what the rules are here, though... if you transfigure 1 mole of diamond into 1 mole of helium, does it reappear as perfectly aerosolized carbon atoms (and then immediately explode due to the reactivity of free carbon?). If reactions are a problem, you've got to wait for diffusion to do a /lot/ of work.
