I finally finished watching all 4 seasons of The Genius that was recommended [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/co3mgk/d_friday_open_thread/ewfxsr1/?st=k25rktx9&sh=46bb2bc1][here]] 2 months ago. Being a huge Liar Game fan, I don't know how I missed this one when I was looking for more similar content. I really enjoyed it with both its ups and downs. So thank you for [[/u/onestojan][u/onestojan]] for the recommendation!

I was planning to write my thoughts on each episode for future me to read, but it's such a bingeable show that I couldn't resist keep clicking on the next episode after finishing one. ^{Hyunmin's} ^{the} ^{best,} ^{btw.}
