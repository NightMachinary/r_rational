I could see that happening, apart from the power boost. My objection isn't that it's implausible, but that a lot of cartoons go out of their way to shield characters from responsibility. It would be more interesting in my opinion if Luna is just ... like that. One day she's depressed, another day taking over the world and overthrowing her sister seems like a wonderful idea. And then she's depressed again but letting her sister out of the sun would just be awkward so she becomes this sort of accidental evil overlord desperately in need of a therapist with no real plans.
