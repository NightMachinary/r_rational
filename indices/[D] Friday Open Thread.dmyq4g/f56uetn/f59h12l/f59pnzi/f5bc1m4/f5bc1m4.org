Here's an alternative headcanon to consider, then - think of the Tantabus, a dream creature born of Luna's guilt, designed and created to give her nightmares and bad dreams. Perhaps this was not the /first/ dream creature to be born out of Luna's dream-walking magic. Perhaps the Nightmare was a dream-creature that Princess Luna created herself, out of depression and anger and (literal) nightmares, and willingly subjected herself to - perhaps thinking it would only be a temporary power boost, or perhaps as a complicated way of trying to make /very/ sure that she wasn't forgotten.
