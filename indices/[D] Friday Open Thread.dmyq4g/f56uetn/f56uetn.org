It's surprisingly difficult to translate a godlike character's abilities into a powerset while still remaining true to who they are. I've been imagining how Nightmare Moon would fit into the Wormverse if she were just teleported there because it seems like an interesting scenario, but there's so little information on what she can actually /do/. Illusions, dreams, creation of sentient life, solar system level telekinesis---all these things are canon, but then she's also not the best combatant in canon, especially if we take her sister as a model. So she's either incredibly weak as a Worm cape, or on the level of Scion. So far I've decided that if I were going to go with this idea, I'd have her theoretically able to perfom Scion-level feats, but be limited by a supply of magic that she can sap away in small amounts from capes to keep herself sustained and perform bits of magic, and then have her overarching goal be to touch the moon, which will generate her a supply of magic from then on. If I wanted to go further I'd make her individually claim every star after that for an incremental increase in power. That way the story naturally scales up as events progress, from street level to Scion level.
