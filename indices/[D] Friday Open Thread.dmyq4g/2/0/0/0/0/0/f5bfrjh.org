If Luna made the Nightmare - as I am suggesting - then that in no way shields her from the responsibility. She made it, and it's only in control because she /gave/ it that control; all of the lines of responsibility do end at Luna, either way.

The advantage (from a storytelling sense) of having the Nightmare as a separate entity, though, is that it can then go ahead and infest /other people/ - possibly through Luna's dreamwalking abilities.
