If I were to put Nightmare Moon into the Wormverse...

--------------

It's easy to put the dreamwalking in. The illusions. The usual pegasus flight, cloudwalking. Low-level telekinesis. Beams powerful enough to knock down buildings. All of that fits in quite neatly (especially if there's a mana limit, or if her powers are somehow weakened under sunlight).

But there's another side to Nightmare Moon; she's two personalities. Princess Luna, hiding deep inside, filled with anger at the world for ignoring her and remorse at what she did to the world in the grip of that anger. And, on the outside, surrounding and encasing Luna... the Nightmare. A psychic parasite that feeds on Luna's anger and self-loathing, encouraging both, transforming some of that emotion into extra power and subsisting off the rest. Controlling the body.

And... who says that the Nightmare isn't ready to give birth? The Wormverse is, by its very nature, /full/ of the sort of personality that would fall swiftly victim to some new Nightmares...
