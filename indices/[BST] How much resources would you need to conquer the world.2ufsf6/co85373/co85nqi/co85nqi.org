That's some nice ideas. Were you going to ask the girl for nukes, or did you intend to somehow convince current nuke-holders to fire them? Because in my opinion, you need much more than 1 base full of omnicidal maniacs in some desert before major powers will decide to use nuclear weapons. Special ops surely come before that, and your provocation would probably be debunked.

I was thinking about asking the girl for an actual alien invasion or some other enemy to unite humanity against. Or perhaps some biotech to make provocation more believable?
