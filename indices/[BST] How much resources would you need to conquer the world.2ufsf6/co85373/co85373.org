A few buildings. Some loyal confederates. Guns.

Have a few confederates build a base in the desert, for show. Fake an alien invasion with a few actors in spacesuits. Have them "teleport" into the Australian outback, take over the base, and start killing everything with a pulse. Plant other agents in the first contact team and have them pretend they have some form of mental control that requires limiting of contact and communication between human and Xeno forces. Nuke the Xeno base, which, being in the outback, has limited human-death fallout.

I don't need to do much more to get humanity to start fighting aliens; The mental dominance lie allows me to ensure that all interactions with Xenos will be missile diplomacy and naught else.

Meanwhile, there was clearly some human help in building the base (My first agents, who have since appeared to have committed suicide); The aliens must have sleeper agents in the general populace!

Cue worldwide witchhunt, with myself gaining prominence as McCarthy 2.0 by browbeating agents into admitting guilt. Run off that goodwill to get into major politics and eventually the Presidency.

At that point, I'll have control of a major player in the new Human Expansion and Goodwill Effort, and therefore long term control over invasion plans.
