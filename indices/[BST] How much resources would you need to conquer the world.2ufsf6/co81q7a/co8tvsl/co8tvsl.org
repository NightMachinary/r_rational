That was my first thought as well.

Geass of Absolute Command would likely be enough. Just establish a macro that you could call "Action A" or "Action B" for quick commanding, Include within it several or all of the following:

- "Perform perfectly normally except obey any verbal command I give you prefaced with the words 'Would you kindly'?"
- "Do not harm me, or through inaction allow me to come to harm."
- "Inform me or any attempts or plans by others to harm me."

And so on. Create a good macro and use that. This is important because it is a thing that works only once per target, but lasts forever when used. The objective is to balance personal safety with retention of free will.

Then test if the Geass can be used as an Oracle (ie. Geass someone to answer P=NP. Are they forced to tell the absolute truth, the truth they know?) and any other number of edge cases.

Then, once your macro is set, just hit everyone who may be a threat to you (likely almost everyone) with your above Geass. Maybe add a number of trigger words so that it isn't so obvious to non-Geass people when you give commands [which you shouldn't need to do often, since your Geass should be coded to make them act in your best interest.

Your ideal situation is a quick ascent to power in which everyone just assumes you are that charismatic and nobody ever thinks you have any kind of special power.

This is what Lelouch /should/ have done.
