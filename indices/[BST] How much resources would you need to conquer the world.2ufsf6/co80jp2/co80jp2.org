More powerful and more precise costs more. Fine. What's the cost of my gaining ownership of most of the world's major oil wells, mineral deposits, and investment banks through a network of shell companies? I negotiate with the girl I've promptly labeled "Lyra Heartstrings" for trolling's sake to find the optimal trade-off point between getting my entry to the essential markets and having a low contract cost for her.

I figure I could even start with something small, like using cultural understanding or very minor mind-control to start bringing the mineral wealth of Afghanistan to global markets (EDIT: Can't do that in 10 years, CRAP), amassing a solid billionaire-hood for myself, with which I can plot my takeovers of the other markets and my acquisition of relevant governments.

From there I'll be able to control enough of global political opinion-leadership to push public policy in much of the world whichever way I want it. If I put in a low-enough contract cost to start with to support some evil mind-control or something, I can even use that or similar on recalcitrantly honest officials.

EDIT: Lacking the mineral wealth of Afghanistan, and assuming gaining control over Saudi Arabia is too costly, I'd negotiate for some technological Phlebotinum capable of launching the next Google-grade tech startup within 5 years to attain multi-billionaire-hood. Or I could just use Phlebotinum to replace an existing mega-billionaire who's capable of all this stuff I need.

BASICALLY: THE KOCH BROTHERS.
