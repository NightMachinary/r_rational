I've written before that the minimum for taking over the world is at least in the hundreds of billions, or it would have been done already.

With that kind of money, though, you could easily buy up all the politicians you need, and kill any that happen to refuse (haha).

Total spending on American politics runs into the billions, so that can be outbid. I don't know offhand about other countries, but I expect it isn't that much more to outspend all the relevant ones.
