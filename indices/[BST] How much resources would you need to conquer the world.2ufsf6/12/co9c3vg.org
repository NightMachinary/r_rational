Could I accept the fact that others will bid lower than me, if I can use my higher bid to root out and destroy them before they can react? Of course, I'll have to account for the fact that they may also have thought of this strategy. I'd wish for something like a slightly better version of Contessa's power in /Worm/, one capable of winning in this regress. For good measure, I would also like powers that can screw with the past, fucking up their ability to hear the message before it's even happened.
