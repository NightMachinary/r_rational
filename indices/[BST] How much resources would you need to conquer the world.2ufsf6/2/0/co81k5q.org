Do you have any evidence for or against the ability of "muggle" multi-billionaires to get complete controlof the world (enough to declare total war on different species) in 10 years? I'd say, given the amount of multi-billionaires, it's not that trivial, otherwise someone would already do that. Elon Musk is THE prime suspect here.
