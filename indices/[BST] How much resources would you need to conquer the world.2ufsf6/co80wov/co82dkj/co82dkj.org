I'd like to elaborate on your plans. Do you intend to mind control only political/business elite? Army? Full world population? First plan could go haywire when general population learns of that "interplanetar war". People would be re-elected, and even if you mind-control new leaders again, people still wouldn't like going to war. And some medical test could notice the parasytes, and that would completely derail the plan.

On the other hand, full-population mind control wouldn't go throught the tender, in my opinion.
