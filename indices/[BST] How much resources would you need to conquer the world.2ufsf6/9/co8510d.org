How much would the super power "Predict how a crowd/demographic will react to something" cost?

Because that alone will take you a long way. Being perfectly charismatic, at least on average and to crowds. Basically everything I'd look for is an oracle like that. Let me get some expensive piece of information for free on a regular basis.

If that doesn't work, then simple mind reading (surface thoughts) might.

A superman package could be fun, but I don't imagine it affecting things on that scale. Even if I'm threatening spending all of my time murdering cute animals with rare diseases, governments aren't going to cave to my demands. I just become an end-bringer.

Anyone who's watched death note would at least consider the eponymous item, and probably if they read this they'd do a better job of it.

Maybe the jesus power set? Not nearly as powerful as superman, but you can play very differently and there's a lot of people that are /very/ desperate. If I could genuinely perform miracle healing a cult following wouldn't be hard to achieve, and holy wars have a long tradition. Maybe I could reincarnate as one of the other abrahamic faith's prophets after I get killed the first time (budget permitting). See if I can rally everyone together.

In hind sight religion seems like a pretty good way to go. Nothing inspires a willingness to invade people like religion.
