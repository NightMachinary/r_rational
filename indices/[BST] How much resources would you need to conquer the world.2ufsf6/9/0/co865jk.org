I would rule massive social precog powers of sufficient accuracy/cost out because, if the girl had them, there would be no need in you.

Mind reading sounds fun, and, if power costs stack additively, it should be a part of the package. I don't know if mind-reading+billions are enough, tho.

Superman won't work imo.

Religion sounds like actually good idea. I would personally hate to go that way, but it's pretty efficient.
