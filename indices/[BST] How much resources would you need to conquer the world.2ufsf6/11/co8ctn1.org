Self replicating bacteria that upon me touching someone gestate for a certain amount of time predetermined by me, are tricky to detect, constantly spore to infect new people, are antibiotic resistant, and then after a fixed time period cause people to have severe necrosis and agony across their bodies and death. A fixed maximum number of new infectees, to limit the death toll,

I should be immune to these bacteria, and have the ability to spread a cure by touch to this disease. I should also have the ability to grant another person the ability to cure such a disease by touch, grant immunity, take away such an abilities with a touch, spead up the progression of a disease with a touch, or spread an anti plague that spreads and mass cures an area.

I also need an anonymous broadcast tech that can broadcast to lots of people around the world some sort of threatening message from this other species, or whatever is appropriate.

I'll spread this plague, causing mass death, while the broadcast software will indicate that this other species is coming and is bad. I'll establish and train prophets of my cause, supposedly 'children' of a friendly alien race (you), who can cure said disease, and unite the world behind their message of vengeance.

Assuming it's cheap, the ability to and the power to grant the ability to glow in the dark blue (photo luminescent bacteria) and the ability to grant whatever cheap augmentations are doable- muscle increase, intellect increase, charisma increase via genetically engineered viruses to woo people and to make me more durable.
