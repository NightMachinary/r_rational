This shouldn't be happening. The spell's action should be determined by whether the person was actually trying to refer to the censored person at all, not just whenever their name is spoken. If you had a censored person named after a common type of bird - let's say "Robin" - then under this ruleset, any time anyone spoke about robins, their speech would be censored.

Furthermore, what defines a name? If my name is Jim, and I get censored, will I still be censored if I start telling everyone my name is Alex? What if I start using a title, like The Grey Fox or The Blue Eagle? Will that be censored too?

The spell should rely on intention, not pure action. Otherwise you will run into the Scunthorpe Problem pretty much instantly.
