I like how you've approached this, but I feel like these powers would go down the path of least resistance. Most these powers are better explain by restrictions or compulsions than the ability to mould the universe.

  never burning microwave popcorn

Most probably, if you intentionally tried, your body would just quit you, or you'd be strongly compelled not to take actions that you know (or don't know) will cause you to burn popcorn.\\
If they are able to act on unknown knowledge, then perhaps it could be used as a communication device, or to compel the person into achieving normally implausible feats (if you don't do XYZ I will put this popcorn in the microwave for /two whole minutes,/ and it will be /all your fault/)

A coffee tasting good is dependant on the drinker, so this ability appear to affect the drinker into considering the coffee tastier than they otherwise would have.

I imagine that the ladybugs would randomly move away from the spot the magic user was trying to step at

I really like the pronunciation munchkin, I think that's totally a reasonable conclusion
