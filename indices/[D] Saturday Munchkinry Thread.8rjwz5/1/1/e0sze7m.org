  never hitting ads when channel surfing;
#+end_quote

You can harass TV stations that you don't like by surfing their channels constantly, making it impossible for them to run any ads.

#+begin_quote
  never crushing ladybirds
#+end_quote

What happens if the entire floor is covered with ladybirds? Does your weight just magically reduce so you don't crush them when you step on them? Do you start floating? Is there a magical compulsion on you to not take any steps whatsoever until the ladybirds go away?

#+begin_quote
  never burning microwave popcorn
#+end_quote

What exactly happens here? You heat it up but it doesn't burn? Can you make and weaponize ridiculously hot popcorn? Or does the excess heat just magically disappear, effectively destroying energy?

#+begin_quote
  being able to spin a lot before getting dizzy
#+end_quote

Might have potential uses in car racing and dancing. Doesn't seem particularly munchkinable because you're still limited by g forces that would tear your body apart if you spin too fast. Effectively, you can spin longer than other people, but not any faster.

#+begin_quote
  never twisting ankle;
#+end_quote

What happens if someone intentionally grabs your foot and attempts to twist your ankle? Does some magic force keep your foot in place so your ankle doesn't twist? If so, there is probably a way to harness that energy.

#+begin_quote
  never breaking fingernails;
#+end_quote

Same as with the ankle.

#+begin_quote
  somehow being able to make better coffee than someone else doing the exact same procedure
#+end_quote

Can this "better" be quantified? Does your coffee have more coffee particles in it, meaning you created mass out of nothing? If so, start construction on a gigantic coffee maker and make coffee to generate lots of mass out of nothing.

  b) if you were to be reincarnated in this world, what power would you ask for that seems similarly tiny and insignificant but will end up with you ruling the world / creating world peace / having a harem of beautiful husbands / whatever else you want?
#+end_quote

Off the top of my head? Never mispronounce anything I try to say.

At first glance, this just looks like it would make me good at communicating.

The catch is I can just start inventing my own languages and words that have to be pronounced in some precise way. Effectively, this grants me the ability to make precisely any sound I want, given some setup time to define the exact pronunciation of a new word.

This has various uses. I can impersonate other people's voices. I can use it in combat, creating deafening sounds like a flashbang, or creating sounds that sound like voices coming from other directions, distracting my enemies and hiding my true location. I can use it for mass destruction by causing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_resonance#Resonance_disaster][resonance disasters]].

This power isn't really strong enough to rule the world though, so if I was given such a chance I would probably take a year just thinking things through before deciding on what power I want.
