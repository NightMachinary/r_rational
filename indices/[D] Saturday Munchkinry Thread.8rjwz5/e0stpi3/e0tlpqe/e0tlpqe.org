Using the ladybug power to achieve world domination here is relatively simple by munchkin standards so I'm disappointed it hasn't been mentioned yet: If the ladybug power doesn't rely on some sort of telekinesis (which makes sense since otherwise the person would describe their power much differently) it's going to involve controlling probability or controlling your behavior based on information not available to you.\\
So depending on which way the power works it could be exploited in one of two ways:

- If it manipulates probability then you could build a machine hooked up to an algorithm, that would force you to step on a given area and put ladybugs there if a given desired result didn't occur. So provided you machine was decently well constructed you could use this as a powerful probability pump steering world affairs and stock market trends according to your whims.\\
  Very quickly you could become the richest person alive by far due to your ability to substantially outcompete the market, and by using the probability pump on government policies and elections you could effectively control world affairs without anyone even knowing it.

- If the power subtley manipulates your movements based on hidden knowledge then provided it goes with the path of least resistance when it comes to movement it could be exploited one of two ways. Firstly you could just hook up a machine very similar to the previous one with an algorithm controlling what would end up being the path of least resistance with regard to the power altering your movements.\\
  Secondly however you might be able to wield insane power by relying on some form of strong precommitment to make you step on ladybugs unless your body moved in such a way as to transmit certain information which could be confirmed within a few years. So then given the previous exploit still works here you could use your insane wealth to have your own researchers who would confirm and work on the information you received from the power. So while it would be obviously suicidal to try to get it to give you the source code for a FAI, you could still get it to give you enough tech that you end up being decades ahead of the rest of the world in this technology and can afford to take your time working on it until you can develop a FAI with your utility function.
