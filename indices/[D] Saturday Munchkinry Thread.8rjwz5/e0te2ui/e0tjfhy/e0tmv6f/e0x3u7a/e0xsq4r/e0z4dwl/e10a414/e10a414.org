Who said the child has to understand anything? I would think belief alone would be enough for this to work even if they didn't really understand what it was they believed.

Still even if belief is necessary it wouldn't be that hard to describe what I'm going for here. You would simply describe an entity that wants to make the world exactly as I want it to be right now (ok describing a utility function is the hardest bit), knows everything, is as smart as possible and has the power to do anything.
