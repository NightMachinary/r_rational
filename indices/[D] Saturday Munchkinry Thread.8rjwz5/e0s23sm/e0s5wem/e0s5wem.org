For circumvention, turn their name into a verb and then just convert the verb into gerund format? Bill Gates turns into Bill Gatesing, e.g. "We need Bill Gatesing to fund our rebellion", which would be analogous to "We need financing to fund our rebellion." Gerunds can function as nouns, but it's a noun referring to a verb derived from the person's name, rather than a noun for the person directly.
