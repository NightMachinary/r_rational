Use it to horrifically shame corrupt officials - Look, most of the things you could do with this just makes you look like a an evil overlord.

Maybe you are, maybe you are not - playing into that image is, regardless, a horrible idea.

But honor is important to most cultures in these kinds of settings, so what you do with it is to pile on an extra horrible penalty for crimes where execution is too lenient.

So abuse of high office, violating the rules of parley and parole*? or whatever 3 to five crimes you really, really want to deter because they are offenses against the legitimacy of government and/or the civilized conduct of war?

They carry a penalty that goes beyond death, because before you get hanged, you get tagged with your crime. So Sam becomes "Sam the oathbreaker" ever after.

*in this context parole means the custom that people who surrender give their word they will not take arms again for a given span, usually a year and a day.
