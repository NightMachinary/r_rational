You could use it for emergency unblockable communication.

Have a prisoner that only you and a certain other official know about. Whenever you need to communicate with your official, set the phrase for the prisoner to whatever information you need to send. That official will check in at scheduled intervals by attempting to say the prisoner's name.

Repeat as needed with other prisoners and officials. This gives you a very secure communication channel, with no tech needed.
