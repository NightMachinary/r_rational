I could cause everyone to refer to me by a variety of compliments: "The Best Possible Leader", "The One Who Should Be In Charge", "The Perfect General", "The Benevolent One", and so on. This is changed up once a week or so, so that people don't get used to a particular phrase and start associating it with anything unpleasant. It won't /prevent/ uprisings, but people always referring to me in terms of glowing praise would eventually start to colour their opinions.

I refuse to use it as punishment, on the basis that I can only use it on people in front of me; if I did use it as punishment, then a rebel leader who successfully evades my soldiers (probably by successfully preventing me from figuring out who he is and hiding) could use the fact that he doesn't yet have a title to signal his continued defiance and put heart to his rebels.

I will, however, give mildly pleasant but descriptive titles to everyone who works in my Palace, and hand them out like candy to those subjects who come to speak with me. This way, if there is rebel activity /of any sort/ in my Palace, I can refer to "the rebel who did this" (a noun phrase) and intentionally fail my save - I then either know who it is, or know it's not a person who has been Named yet, saving a lot of time in the ensuing investigation.
