So triggering the power depends on whether or not you intend to reference a person.

First of all, congratulations, you have categorically defined all species as 'people' or 'not people' by whether you can refer to a censored of their species. Or, if you haven't, the power is circumvented by considering an entity to not be a person using mind magic or simpler. That is, unless you're using clauses like 'they have to REALLY believe.'

Second, I'm assuming you can't name a rock after a person and just refer to that rock by name, and attribute to that rock all the actions of the censored person. Also assuming 'referring to someone' includes hand gestures, nonverbal sounds, images, symbolic tokens (I could totally see a rebellion carrying around small tokens to refer to their censored, captured leaders) etc. If not, the power is pretty terrible at achieving its original purpose.

Next, if the person can hear and understand what they're saying and don't go into some sort of trance, those assumptions aren't necessary. If they do, a second person and those prior assumptions do become necessary.

One creative use; you essentially have a permanent, instant, globally accessible computer with a magical/verbal operating system. If a person can perform basic functions in their head such as referring to person X after being instructed to do so by a phrase they were compelled to speak, they can basically access a repository of information of your choosing. If saying another person's name when compelled to do so makes you say another phrase (which it shouldn't, because you're saying a name, not intentionally referring to a person, by your definition), then have the phrases earlier in the directory use the the prior assumptions about what doesn't trigger a phrase. If those assumptions don't work, each directory level will need to have a set number of derivative branches that can assumed present. Then a person will have to try refer to someone with the name of '[their current directory]' plus '[name that always means the first/second/third/etc. derivative pathway from said directory]' which is a bit more complicated. Also, people could say things like '3+4' just fine, but if they refer to a person named '3+4' they would instead say '7'.

Logistically, you would have to make sure they couldn't accidentally access the webpage at some random point, so you would have to use unique names, which comes with it's own fun challenges. Furthermore, this would take a hell of a lot of time to set up if you went big, but you could always just keep things to daily notices and such. And if you can't teach people to refer to different people through the compelled phrases (AKA if assumptions don't apply), you would have to use the names of a famous hierarchy or something, which would shut down discussion of that hierarchy pretty hard.

Finally, to use this to your end; you basically control the only globally accessible webpage. IDK, make your name the root directory or something. You basically control Google. You win the game.

Thanks for the fun idea!

edit: the best part is that it's one way, so you can dictate to farmers who have no other access to the wider world exactly what to think and they can't discuss or debate you or anything.
