I'm working on a plot detail for a DnD campaign I may eventually run someday. Wasn't sure whether to put this here or in the Wednesday thread but whatever.

You're the immortal God-King of the known world, in a Tolkien-esque fantasy setting. Your main concern at this point is preventing uprisings against you.

You have the power to universally make people censored. This means that whenever anyone tries to refer to a censored person using a noun or noun phrase, they feel an overwhelming (DC 25 Charisma save) desire to instead use a pre-determined phrase of your own choosing.

To make a person censored, you need to perform a 10 minute long uninterrupted ritual in which the person is present. You can perform the ritual on yourself. To change the phrase associated with that person you must perform the ritual again.

What do you do with this power?

(Bonus points, how would you circumvent it?)
