I'm not too familiar with the DnD system, but don't spells get cast when certain words are said? You could censor someone's name to make people have an overwhelming desire to cast a specific spell of your choosing whenever they try to refer to the censored person.

The next question is: are there suicide spells? For example, a spell that creates a massive explosion that engulfs and kills its caster, or a spell that drains all the life force from its caster? If so, you can commit mass genocide by censoring people that are commonly referred to with phrases that cast suicide spells. Killing everyone guarantees that there won't be any uprisings against you, since there's no one left to revolt.
