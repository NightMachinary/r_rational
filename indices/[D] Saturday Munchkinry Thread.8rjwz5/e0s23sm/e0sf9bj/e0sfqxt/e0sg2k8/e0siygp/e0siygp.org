  Can you choose a ridiculously long phrase that has to be said all at once so people suffocate to death trying to say it in one breath?
#+end_quote

The person is compelled to complete the phrase. If they suffocate to death, they cannot complete the phrase, therefore they are allowed to take a breath if needed.

  Can you choose a phrase that requires such a loud volume that people break their vocal cords trying to say it?
#+end_quote

The person speaks the phrase at the same volume they intended to use to refer to the censored person.

  Can you choose a phrase that requires someone to literally bite their tongue off in order to correctly pronounce?
#+end_quote

Hmm, I'm going to say theoretically possible, but tricky to pull off, on account of

- Needing to speak the phrase as part of the ritual
- Needing to say /other/ things as part of the ritual (requiring a tongue)
- Needing to genuinely believe that the phrase is a coherent sentence with an actual meaning

#+begin_quote
  Can you choose a phrase that refers to another censored person, and thus cause any speaker to get trapped in an endless loop of phrase speaking?
#+end_quote

Just for fun, I'm going to allow this and/or use it as a trap to spring on my PCs.

Also, if you're taking the goal I set out literally, you could just ignore the censoring altogether, and step down from being God-King. Can't have an uprising against /you/ if you're not in charge any more ;)
