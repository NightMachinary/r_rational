Aww... I wanted to create world wide suicide explosions. Guess I'll have to settle for a more mundane way of killing everyone.

What are the limits on the pre-determined phrase you choose? Can you choose a ridiculously long phrase that has to be said all at once so people suffocate to death trying to say it in one breath? Can you choose a phrase that requires such a loud volume that people break their vocal cords trying to say it? Can you choose a phrase that requires someone to literally bite their tongue off in order to correctly pronounce? Can you choose a phrase that refers to another censored person, and thus cause any speaker to get trapped in an endless loop of phrase speaking?
