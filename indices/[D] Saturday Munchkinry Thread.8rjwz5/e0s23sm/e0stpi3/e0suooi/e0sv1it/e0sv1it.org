@of course that's a thing

  on the other hand if the origami design is made with opaque paper, and you can't see the folds inside it, then maybe you can use that

I mean, Origami is usually done with opaque paper, so that's good. But I'd imagine that because it would theoretically be possible to have an origami animal be, say, a turtle on one side and a beaver on the other side just by folding the sides differently, that "looking at it" would have to involve picking it up and having a 3D investigation of all angles, but no unfolding?

Then again, you can get away from that by putting a complicated thing on the "inside" of the origami. But then if you have, say, a standard crane and you somehow fold a little boat into the /inside/ of the box in the crane's back that is invisible from the outside, is it reasonable to expect that a power that lets you copy origami by looking at it would also let you somehow know that there's a secret boat folded inside the crane's body so you can copy that too? I'm sure there's origami designs that people have made that have "surprises" of those types in them.

Also, whatever NP-thing you have to do would have to be physically possible to fold (the old chestnut about not being able to fold paper in half more than 7 times, while not exactly true, is definitely relevant here).

Still, it could potentially let you solve the Riemann hypothesis or travelling salesperson problem or something, which is kind of neat and not at all what I expected from origami. So I have still learned something really interesting and greatly appreciate your comment! Thank you.
