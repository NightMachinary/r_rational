(a) I don't know how to munchkin them. But I can see how to create them.

- Never hitting ads - Find and predict the model for how long ad breaks are. Develop a good internal clock.
- Never crushing ladybugs - Coat your shoes in a pheromone that smells like something that eats ladybugs.
- Never burning popcorn - Practice twisting the dial on the microwave the perfect amount
- Spinning a lot before getting dizzy - Reduce your sensitivity to dizziness (genetic tampering may be required)
- Untwistable ankle - Very flexible ankle ligaments allow your ankle a stupendous range of motion without being twisted
- Better coffee using the same procedure - Be extremely good looking and rely on the Halo effect
- Never breaking fingernails - Genetic engineering again. But also be careful.
- Copying origami on sight - Okay, this one's hard, but it's a lot easier when you consider that this guy can simply create any origami shape that looks sufficiently similar to the provided example.

(b) Some form of probability control or short-term prescience might be good. Being able to correctly predict winning lottery scratch tickets on sight (before scratching them) would at least give me a steady source of income.
