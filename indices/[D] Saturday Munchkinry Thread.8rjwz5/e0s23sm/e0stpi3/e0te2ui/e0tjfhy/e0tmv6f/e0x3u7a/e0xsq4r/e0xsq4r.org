Well that makes things more difficult however you could still probably get this plan to work by finding religious people who might conceivably accept "it wasn't god's plan" as excuse.\\
However whether that worked would really be dependant on whether it created your conception of the god being used as an excuse or the other person's. Since in the latter case you'd have some obvious problems since their god has to actually be compatible in personality with the world looking exactly like it actually does since they actually believe in it.

Alternatively you could just find some small child who was really gullible and basically use whatever excuses you wanted on them.
