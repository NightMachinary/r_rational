  The entities' disposition towards him depends on how he described them, and they are aware he created them. (For example, as a kid he lied about losing money he spent on gumballs because an older kid beat him up, so the kid kicks him in the leg and steals his wallet, while his created family members are still friendly towards him.)

Given the created entities can physically interact with him if he were a rationalist he could take over the world with this power in either a day or a few minutes depending on interpretation. Basically it never says the excuses have to make sense or anything so you could find some context to use "it's not my fault it's the fault of a maximally powerful and intelligent FAI whose utility function is to satisfy my current utility function" then immediately run to go to your backyard while the other party stands there confused.

So then when you open the way to this special realm either you get a godlike being which nearly instantly reshapes the universe according to your utility function, by reshaping your body so you have a godlike being with a copy of its mind attached to you that can escape back to reality when you leave.

Or alternatively if it can only alter your body in ways compatible with the physics of the outside world (or at least only those changes will carry over) then it would just reshape your body your body into a vast thing made of nanites which would begin spreading everywhere as soon as you reentered reality.\\
In this latter scenario if negative mass is possible then it could potentially spread across all of existence making it pretty close to godlike power, but even if it can't get FTL it can still pretty easily generate arbitrarily much energy/matter letting you perfectly reshape your future light cone.
