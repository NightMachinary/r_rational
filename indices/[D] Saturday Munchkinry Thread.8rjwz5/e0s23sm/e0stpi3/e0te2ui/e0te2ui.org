So there's a short story I read a while ago and I'm interested to see how the setting could be munchkined.

- The protagonist discovers that every excuse he's ever given involving a living entity causes the living entity to come to life in a separate realm. (e.g. saying "My uncle broke his leg and I had to visit him in the hospital" creates a new uncle with a broken leg.)
- He can enter the realm by sticking his hand in a hole in his backyard and turning a gumball machine handle in said hole. (It's basically symbolic of his first lie.)
- The realm is a blank space with furniture as required for injured entities, although if he forms an intention to find someone he can.
- The entities' disposition towards him depends on how he described them, and they are aware he created them. (For example, as a kid he lied about losing money he spent on gumballs because an older kid beat him up, so the kid kicks him in the leg and steals his wallet, while his created family members are still friendly towards him.)
- He eventually discovers that at least one of his coworkers' lies also come to life in the realm.
- He can bring someone with him into the realm if they're holding hands.
- He can't bring anything out of the realm that he didn't bring in, but whenever he leaves he'll find a gumball or similarly sized toy in his hand to prove it happened.
