So, everyone in the world has small magic as dictated by this image: [[https://i.imgur.com/EVfY3eF.png]] (screen-readable original tumblr post: [[http://iwillmindfuckyou.tumblr.com/post/132544976015/akai-kaede-nilesymon-i-wonder-if-magic-is]] )

a) how would you munchkin powers given in the text? (never hitting ads when channel surfing; never crushing ladybirds; never burning microwave popcorn; being able to spin a lot before getting dizzy; never twisting ankle; somehow being able to make better coffee than someone else doing the exact same procedure; never breaking fingernails; copying origami from sight)

b) if you were to be reincarnated in this world, what power would you ask for that seems similarly tiny and insignificant but will end up with you ruling the world / creating world peace / having a harem of beautiful husbands / whatever else you want?

c) if anyone else posts their strategy, you are of course encouraged to post your method of breaking that strategy
