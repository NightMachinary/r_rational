There's Schlock Mercenary, where the protagonists have read the [[http://schlockmercenary.wikia.com/wiki/The_Seventy_Maxims_of_Maximally_Effective_Mercenaries][Seventy Maxims of Maximally Effective Mercenaries]].

Beware archive panic, though. It's a webcomic which has updated every day since the late 90's.
