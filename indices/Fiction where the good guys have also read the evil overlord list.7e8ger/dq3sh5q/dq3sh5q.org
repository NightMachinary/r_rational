Another option frequently posted on here is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126]["Worth the Candle,"]] which very much involves a genre-savvy protagonist (as the fantasy world he finds himself seems to be an amalgam of a bunch of his old tabletop campaigns). I generally dislike self-insert fantasy world fics, but this one is amazingly entertaining.
