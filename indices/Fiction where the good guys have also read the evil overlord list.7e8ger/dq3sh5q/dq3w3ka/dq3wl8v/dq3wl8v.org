Erfworld is where a wargamer nerd has been put into a world based on war gaming rules. The actual world has hexes and move points and all that. Everyone works by the same rules. But the protagonist is a munchkin of the highest degree, and quickly learns to exploit the system.

Juniper Smith (the MC from Worth the Candle) is (was?) a long-time DM for D&D, thrust into a world partially of his own making. But it is a real world, not a game world. Most people in the world don't operate by the game rules, they're just doing their own thing. Learning to swordfight by practising and hard work. JS, on the other hand, unlocks new skills and achievements with a progression similar to that of other computer RPGs. He is the only one he knows that can "level up" where he gets magically healed and his stats go up.
