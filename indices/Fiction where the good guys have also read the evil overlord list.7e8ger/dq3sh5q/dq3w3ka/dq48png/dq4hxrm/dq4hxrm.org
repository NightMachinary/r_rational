Hmm, I can feel what you mean.

Problem is, the story got very complicated, it's being told in several time points at once, every groups' interests keep uncovering, and pace grind to a halt.

Also the site became community-centric, leaving casual readers a little bit alone.

I visit the page ~once per month or so, so it's more interesting this way.
