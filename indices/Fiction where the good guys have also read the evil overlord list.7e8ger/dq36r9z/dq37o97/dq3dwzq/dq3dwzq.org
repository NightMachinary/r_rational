  I'm kind of wondering if there's any actual good guys in it.

A central conflict in the story is that Good and Evil don't always mean "moral" and "immoral." You'll encounter Good characters who are not what we'd consider "good," and you'll grow to root for "Evil" characters who aren't always "evil." It often depends on where they're sitting in a conflict, and if you're considering the ethics on a personal level or a broader level. For example, it is "bad" to kill a person in general, but could be considered "good" if their death prevents a war that would end up killing thousands.

Hope that's not too much of a spoiler, and that you enjoy the series!
