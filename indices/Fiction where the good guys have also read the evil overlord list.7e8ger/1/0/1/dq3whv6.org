Sadly I can't help you there; I've heard of Erfworld but never read it myself... sorry!

I felt like WTC was kind of a slow start; I've read some really bad "You're in a fantasy world that's like a game!" stuff before and was willing to give it a shot even when the beginning didn't immediately impress me. I'm glad I did; it got better and better as it went on, and some of the chapters in the 50s really got me thinking (the story gets very "meta"). I also liked how the protagonist would have flashbacks to his tabletop games and old life. It's like there are two stories unfolding simultaneously - his new life in the fantasy world, and his old life as we slowly figure out what happened to himself and his tabletop friends. It was a pretty unique perspective.
