/Actually/, he's not the only one. Which is one thing that makes the story so good. Our protagonist got amazingly lucky (and/or his powers are related to his origin), but he doesn't have powers that are unprecedented or impossible within the framework of this world. Other members of his D&D group who were inserted into the same world have similar powers, there are entities known as gods who either have similar powers or powers that work totally differently but are at a similar tier.

(if our protagonist lives to that point in the RPG, he'll probably have powers comparable to the gods and be given quests to slay the ones he doesn't like)
