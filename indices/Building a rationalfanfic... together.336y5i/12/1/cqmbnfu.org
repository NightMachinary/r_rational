Keeping in mind though, that these apes in a political Dark ages, have a repressive religious order that intentionally keeps knowledge secret ruling the world, and a caste based heirarchical society, and (though canon didn't touch on this) may well have irreconcilable psychological differences which might make interacting with them difficult for humans. There might be several good reasons for even a more reasonable version of Taylor to hate them.

Also, it would be fun to explore the different psychologies of the uplifted ape species. We have orangutangs, gorillas, chimpanzees/bonobos (canon was written at a time when that distinction wasn't made). Canon implies that the current ape caste system has orangutangs as rulers, gorillas are military, and chimps are everyone else. The apes have to deal with a diversity of sentient species that cannot interbreed, which is more diversity than we as humans have had to deal with. This sets a nice precedent for human-ape relations actually, since adding humans to the caste tree shouldn't be that hard.

Other questions: Is the ape technology re-discovered, or did they take human tech and gradually decline from there? Clearly they /have/ scientists, so they shouldn't decline that far, but are they really as smart as humans were on average, and are they smart in the same /directions/?)
