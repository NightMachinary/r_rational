Are we able to justify putting them in cryosleep?

Maybe the proof of concept was a long-distance journey, testing several systems before designs for a generation ship were finalized. The ship goes out, then comes back in, and... human civilization has fallen apart.

The ship's AI decides (there are several possible reasons) that the fall of human civilization is cause to keep the astronauts in cryo. Waiting for the situation to improve, perhaps. So it orbits for centuries until it becomes to fall into disrepair. The AI decides it can't wait any longer and descends, but in the process the damage which it has suffered is magnified and the AI is in no shape to explain much, if anything.

Perhaps try to come up with a reason for them to conclude, at first, that they are on a colony planet or something?

But really, they're /astronauts/. How do they not look up at the sky and see the constellations?

/not sure how we can keep that element of the movie, after all...
