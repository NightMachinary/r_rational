The original village was made up of only gorillas, chimps, and orangutans. Let's keep the original village this way, but if the astronauts explore, they'll find villages with bonobos or villages made up of only one ape race. Different villages and nations will have different customs. Maybe one village has semi-sentient gibbons as slaves/pets instead of humans.
