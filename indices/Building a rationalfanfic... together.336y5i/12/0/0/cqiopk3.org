Ok, I've mostly come up with questions but not solutions for stuff to change:

- The space ship: the ship should be a colony ship or have some explanation of it's purpose. The vessel in question is a small ship with four people in suspended animation: three males and one female, who dies while in transit. Taylor (the captain and sole surviving crew member after the other men are killed by the apes) says that the woman, Stuart, was supposed to be their "New Eve." Now this is probably just a case of Taylor being scuzzy again, because if they were actually a colony ship, then they should have more than just one female. Also, the ship arrives on a planet 2,000 years in Earth's future, thanks to relativity. With that kind of time gap any science vessel would be obsolete by the time it could send information back, never mind that the people on board aren't scientists. So the ship isn't a colony ship and it isn't a science ship, what other reason could NASA have for sending them out there?

- Let's go with the remake's reason that the apes can speak and humans can't: Alzheimers cure gone horribly wrong. Will the engineered virus still be around to endanger our heroes? I'll go with no.

- The apes speak English. While that's OK for Hollywood, It doesn't make much sense. Languages change over 2000 years unless they are dead and kept around for some reason. If the apes didn't speak English, then there wouldn't be the farce of Taylor being shot in the neck to prevent him from talking to the apes until the opportune moment. I would probably have my apes speak Old English or archaic German as an approximation of how their language would differ from that of the astronauts. I think that this is a more realistic communication obstacle.

- I'd kind of like to see it be a "Connecticut Yanky in King Arthur's Court" sort of story with informed tech and science sweeping through the ape's society, but it has to be done in a satisfying way. Namely the humans can't curb-stomp the apes and take over their culture. Looking forward to optimizing ape society would probably be the end state or epilog.

- I would want to go deeper in the talks with Zira, Cornelius, and Dr. Zaius about who and what counts as a person, better proof of reasoning skills, the concept of philosophical zombies, the treatment of lab animals, and other topics that the movie only hinted at.
