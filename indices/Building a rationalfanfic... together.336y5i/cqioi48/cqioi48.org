Anyone who isn't op and other writers could help by making a timeline and plot points. Argue over all the rational and 'science'. You could argue over the specifics and rewrite and edit it as you go. Maybe set up a wikia page or whatever for all that stuff. If you're worried about dwindling interest just stick to short stories.
