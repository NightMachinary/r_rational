[[/u/alexanderwales]], [[/u/DaystarEld]], [[/u/Wertifloke]], "FanFicBias" on FFN (don't know zirs Reddit name), and that's just off the top of my head -- there's a bunch more that I'm not thinking of at the moment.

That said:

If you want it, I suggest writing it yourself. Writing by committee is hard for everyone, and we'd all like to read something new.

If you're going to do this, I vote Firefly. I love Firefly.
