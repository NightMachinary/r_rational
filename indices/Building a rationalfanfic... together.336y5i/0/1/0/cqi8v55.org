My point was simply that, if you're willing to be the writer, then be the writer. If you've got the chops to write a story then you've got the chops to do the worldbuilding.

Relying on a committee will just slow down and complicate the process. If you want help with early-on brainstorming and then you take it and run with it, that's one thing. If you want to have a group of people determining various things (physics? character traits?) along the way, then you're talking about an RPG thread, not a story per se. RPG threads are cool, but be aware of which you're doing.
