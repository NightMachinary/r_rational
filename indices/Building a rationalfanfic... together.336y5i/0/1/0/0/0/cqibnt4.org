It would be an interesting thing to do and I think I would enjoy it. I've also done enough [DG]Ming that I think I could do something fun.

Unfortunately I can't have too many non-paying projects right now -- I'm trying to live on my writing. If a bunch of people were willing to throw some bucks at my Patreon I could do it, but otherwise I'm afraid I need to focus on salable stuff.
