These all seem sensible changes so far. Any idea what the Dark one's policy towards Rand will be? And what the motivations of Egwene, Nynaeve, Perrin and Mat would be in following Moiraine out of the Two Rivers? Now Moiraine is not uncertain of who the Dragon is among the 3 of them.

How in depth do you intend to go with how the one power and weaving actually works? That sounds very interesting, but potentially also very hard to do.
