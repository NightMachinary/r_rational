I'm partial to a Star Trek: DS-9 rational fic, though I currently have no plans to write one nor do I have much time to collaborate. Feel free to use ideas, of course.

Advantages of DS-9 include a strong setting, lots of dynamic galactic events, and a wormhole that could lead quickly to parts unknown if the story isn't about that sort of thing, or it needs a brand new setting for something.

Some possible points of interest:

- The opportunity for a non-Starfleet Vulcan main character

  - Because who else is the MC in a rational Trek fic?
  - Vulcans later get heavily involved in plot events and almost start a shooting war with the Bajorans, so they are around and interested in the wormhole.
  - They are also limited psychics and have a great spiritual-system-as-religion that /almost/ seems to work as advertised.

- The chance to poke at the oddities of non-human humanoid species

  - It is obvious, for example, that every other species has, at some point, done at least some level of bioengineering for intelligence, longevity, and physical strength.
  - *Everyone* is stronger than humans, for example.
  - Vulcans are just better across the board.
  - And the Trill? We know from the plot that they are playing bioethical games.
  - Also, why so few cybernetic enhancements and replacements?
  - The Earth and their post-Eugenics war stuff might explain humanity not doing post-human bioengineering, but do Vulcans really not have the medical tech to do so? Or maybe they do, and don't use it because of religious reasons.

- The hows and whys of colonization in the /almost/ post physical scarcity culture of the Federation.

  - If someone just wants to round up a few thousand people and head off to settle down somewhere, what kind of forces would come into play?
  - The Federation isn't expansionist, because they don't have to be. They don't appear to need more planets full of people, or filled with weird metals or strange crystals. That sort of thing only comes into play in shows because they're usually so far away from supply bases.
  - How much does the Federation help citizens who want to strike out?
  - And what if someone wants to /leave/ the Federation with a pile of stuff and a few tens of thousands of people? Is that going to be a big deal, or does it happen all the time?

- Issues regarding robots and even weak AI: why isn't it everywhere?

  - This could get dark, fast.
  - Or it could be a simple explanation given in passing: /"AI is hard and illegal. It's easier to bioengineer a brain than program one--which is also illegal. Superhuman AIs are almost impossible. Even the Borg aren't superhuman, just very distributed. Data is an example of the best a single mad scientist can do at current (very stagnant) tech levels. Anything research more organized usually gets stepped on, fast. Time-travel-experiments fast."/
  - But why so few robots, even remote controlled ones? That's odd.
  - Maybe the Vulcan robots make people /really/ insecure, so they don't show them off. Vulcan ships might be stuffed full of the things, for all we know.

If I were going to write a rational DS-9 story, I'd write about a Vulcan bioengineer heading a group people who want to strike out into the wormhole territory to build an independent scientific research colony. Sort of a free port for those blocked from research by Federation cultural mores and laws, plus a jumping off point to exploring the secrets the new sector holds. Throw in all possible seasteading and sci-fi libertarian tropes for maximum fun.

Her personal goal is a functional suite of protocols for pan-species physical immortality, something Vulcan religions frowns on and most of the Federation publically bans for precautionary principle reasons--more secretly, this is really done for population control reasons. All of this is, obviously, /most illogical/. Biological organisms are fragile and can easily be made much less so. To her, the cost versus reward on doing so for intelligent life easily justifies the expense and effort.

The story opens when our Vulcan arrives on DS-9 and starts collecting materials, buying extra ships, arranging supply agreements, and recruiting last minute specialist personnel. All of the show's big names get involved or approached, of course. Everything has to be ready by the time the fleet arrives, a looming event she keeps referring to, much to the confusion of everyone else. Initially, because of her private and secretive ways, they think she's part of some sort of tiny Vulcan religious cult. They couldn't be more wrong.

First half of the story will be her bouncing off the confused Federation and station personnel and other major actors.

The Cardassians show up and argue that this is a sign of illegal Federation expansionism--they are confused when she shits all over the Federation in true bash-fic fashion and explains how they are actually leaving the "protection" of the Federation.

The Bajorans are faintly bemused by the whole idea, being themselves uninterested in colonization. They have spiritual issues with the whole thing and want endless meetings, but in the end are intellectually intrigued by the idea of unaligned people exploring past the wormhole and the economic possibilities involved. And in sticking it to the Cardassians, of course.

At some point, Starfleet mooks start poking around, trying to find any excuse to shut it down. This brings up all sorts of freedom and personal rights issues that should be interesting to explore in the Trek 'verse. Starfleet and the conservative factions trying to thwart the colony are the main antagonists. Personal drama is high, physical threats are low. Getting traction against the way the Federation works is the conflict that drives this part of the story.

This would end climatically when the "wagon train" fleet finally shows up, with tens of thousands of Vulcans and other humanoid scientists ready to set out. Before, people on DS-9 didn't really emotionally grasp what the fleet was. It looks like an invasion, with hundreds of huge ships from a mix of Federation worlds. All armed "illegally" to the teeth by their Ferengi investors, who we know from canon are much better armed and armored than the Federation usually is. They push through all opposition and transition through the wormhole.

That's the end of the first novel-length story (eight to ten chapters, about 60k words).

--------------

The second half of the story would have to do with the growing danger and climatic events related to the previously unknown threat of the Dominion. Also, some small town politics and radical libertarian cultural friction stuff while setting up the colony. Everything gets off to a rocky start, but eventually settles down as they get their power plants and replicators online.

Once the shit hits the fan, a strong feature would be how actually intelligent people prepare for ruthless interstellar war, and how dangerous it /should be/ to warp anywhere near a technologically modern planet's defense grid. Wolf 359 and later events showed how lacking the Federation is in that respect. Even DS-9 could do better, with shitty thrown-together automated mines. Siege warfare should be very, very costly in space.

The show's main characters can make appearances at various times, but I'd suggest focusing on mostly OCs with maybe only a couple of "defectors". I'd choose *Julian Bashir*, for obvious reasons.

Yes. Okay. OC/Bashir is in the cards. I'm not saying /pon farr/ happens, but I'm not saying it /doesn't/. And it would be illogical for such a predictable event to go unplanned for by the main character--we already know that cross isn't very fecund. Being pregnant would be awkward, so it makes sense. My ship has weapons armed and shields at maximum. You get the idea.

In any case, I think it would work to have Bashir sympathetic to the idea of the colony while flirting with the cold but pretty Vulcan scientist. He agrees with their goals, Starfleet mooks retaliate by making a big deal of his bioengineered past while questioning his loyalty, so he quits Starfleet and joins the science colony. He can then continue to talk to Sisko and the others, and be a link between canon and the AU-ness by making trips back and forth. At some point, the Dominion-lead Cardassians retake DS-9 and some of the main cast flees to the science free-port colony. Flavor with canon to taste.

The Dominion is huge but fights stupid, and is in general rather technologically decadent. It should still be a threat worthy of a single world full of rational actors. The Founders are the Death Star in this story--a foe not swayed by rationality or human goals, unreachable and unattackable. They want nothing less than complete order and total safety for their static, ingrown, xenophobic, fundamentalist culture. That means cutting the heads off tall dandelions, like the science free-port, as well as destroying the Federation and other nations on the other side of the wormhole.

The end game is the Federation eventually adopting the hard won techniques and minor technological refinements developed on the other side of the wormhole to fight the Dominion to a standstill and, after major cultural changes are forced on the Federation by their near destruction, the final victory of a more free-thinking and rational Federation. None of that War of the Worlds-esque, last minute, Hail Mary biotech solution nonsense that let the Federation win in canon.

That's the end of the second novel-length fanfic. Call it 80k words and ten to twelve chapters.

And then, of course, the Borg show up again. Or they are asked to assisting in figuring out a way to help the lost Starfleet ship /Voyager/. Or the Changelings start an insurrection. Or someone discovers an immortality planet, and they send a mission to study it. Or Lore gets loose again. Lots to work with. Could probably do a trilogy or longer series set in and around the science free-port. Just, for dog's sake, no time travel.
