One technique that would be interesting: readers are randomly split into two groups representing in-universe factions and a game master carefully controls the flow of information between them until the end. That way you don't have to deal with the very difficult task of deciding whether you would have thought of a solution after seeing it / hindsight bias / etc. For phase one everyone does public brainstorming.

It would still be possible to cheat just by having two online identities of course, but it would prevent "accidental" cheating.

I suggest a superpower fic that isn't fanfiction. Everyone brainstorms superpowers then the GM hands them out and everyone does a massive online collaborative RP thing.
