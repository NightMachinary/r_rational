Welll what if it's not a fanfic? Or, a loose fanfic - one thought that had popped into my head was trying to retell HPMOR as "original" fiction.

At that point, however, it almost starts turning into an RPG instead, as you'd want different people responsible for the story than the physics, so that the story can investigate the physics...
