I'd have to say star wars or FMA(shameless self plug). In my limited memory of those threads, most of the others didn't get further than general world-building (feel free to correct me on this).

The three main protagonists suggested for R!FMA were: * Winry * postDublinth!Al * someone in the future

These three would be radically different. Al would probably start with him munchkining his new circle-less transmutation and then pretty much skipping to the boss battle with father. The random future person would just be a worldbuilding short.

rat!Percy Jackson is still an option, but I'm not a big fan of the whole "mortals are p-zombies" bit
