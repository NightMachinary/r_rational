To be fair, we are still seeing new promising fics pop up, like, well, The Reckoning :)

But this sounds fun too. I'm always happy to throw more ideas out there, it's just hard to commit to anything while still keeping to getting my own story's chapters out.

For what it's worth, Fullmetal Alchemist or Star Wars (that r!Anakin scenario sounded amazing) would be my votes.
