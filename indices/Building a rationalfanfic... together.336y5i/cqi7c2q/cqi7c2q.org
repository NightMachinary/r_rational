One idea I've been mulling over is a rational [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes_%281968_film%29][Planet of the Apes (the original 1968 one)]]. I've recently watched it for a second time and was struck by just how pessimistic and idiotic Taylor was. I want the stranded astronauts to be scientists (something not too far fetched) that can actually figure out what to do and how to negotiate instead of cuss at the apes until they get their hands on a gun and ride off into the sunset with their mute +sex slave+ love interest.

One of the main themes of the movie was institutional restriction of science; shown through Dr. Zaius, an orangutan who is both a religious leader and the scientific head-honcho, who is our main villain as the protagonists try to find out the truth. But the movie also argues for the restriction of knowledge by the reveal that [[#s][Really lame spoiler that's spoiled by the promotional posters]] I think this theme can be expanded upon and made more nuanced.

But mostly I just want to see an intelligent, rational person deal with being captured by apes that somehow have a reason to speak English 2,000 years in the future.

(Also the source material is only one hour and a half long move, so you don't have to watch a 15 season long anime or deal with extended universes or anything.)
