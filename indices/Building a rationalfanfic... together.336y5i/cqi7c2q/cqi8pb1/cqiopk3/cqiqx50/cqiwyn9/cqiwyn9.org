So the ship could be a proof of concept but was supposed to only travel for 10 years or so and some how ended up going for 2,000. Maybe it got too close to a weird anomaly that sped it up to a much higher fraction of the speed of light?

The criteria for the ship's function/malfunction:

- Journey takes 2,000 years (or however long it takes to form an ape civilization, if we want to change that number)

- Arrive back at Earth with sufficient ambiguity on whether it is Earth or not. This includes the ability to land on a planet even if it was not the original destination. (The ambiguity is maybe not necessary, but let's keep with the spirit of the original.)

- 

  - If the mission was supposed to go to a different planet, there has to be at least some attempt at an explanation for why they are on Earth.

- Crash land in such a way that the ship can't fly but our heroes survive. (To put the astronauts on equal footing when they first encounter the apes.)

So something went wrong, but not /horribly/ wrong with the ship... unless the mission was to time travel to the future to re-seed the earth after a nuclear war. (But in that case there is no ambiguity about their location.)
