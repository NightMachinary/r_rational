The MCU is already pretty unwieldy, with multiple films/year and three TV shows already.

Why not the X-men filmverse?

You'd need to find an excuse why Professor X isn't unbeatable; but other than that the canon is pretty clear-cut. Unlike the comics, there's no magic or anything else weird but "mutation", and there's no sliding timescale nonsense - the filmmakers took the excuse to clear up most of the issues with the original when adapting it.

But what really makes me think this could work is Rogue as a rational protagonist.

Rogue's powers are clear-cut and ripe for munchkinning, with their drawbacks and strict rules. But most importantly, they let her /steal other people's powers/. In a rational!rogue, you have an excuse to play with /every power in the films/ - while still not being too broken, because she loses them again.
