*Daredevil*, a street-level heroes show, and *Agent Carter*, an (excellent) prequel show are both a full season in already. And I understand they're planning to do a martial-arts "Iron Fist" tv show soon, and there's some sort of Luke Cage show in the pipeline.

Agent Carter wouldn't matter as much, but both AoS and Daredevil feature a /lot/ of supers and worldbuildy stuff, even background info for the movies. (Apparently. I haven't kept up with them.)
