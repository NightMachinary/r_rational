Mmmm. Dunno if there's much room for more flashbacks in the main story, but I wonder if that could be a good spinoff idea.

(BTW: that opening segment was sort of similar/inspired to a fanfic I wrote years ago in Italian which was instead about Hinata Hyuuga, from Naruto, suddenly awakening up her Byakugan and having no control over it)
