I'm actually not sure it's wrong either way. "There are more of you" feels more proper, but is the opposite, treating "more" as a sort of collective noun, even considered wrong at this point? Use changes the rules... I'm half resigned at this point that one day I'll have to write "it's" as a possessive /and it will be correct/.
