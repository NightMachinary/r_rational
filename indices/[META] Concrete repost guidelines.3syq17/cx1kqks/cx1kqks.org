I doubt we're ever going to give firm reposting guidelines. The only time I have ever removed reposts is if they're so close that they're on the front page at the same time (in other words, a result of someone not checking whether the thing was already up somewhere). The voting system can moderate everything else.

Part of the reason that I wouldn't want to give concrete guidelines is that people have different reasons for reposting things. Sometimes you'd want to repost because it's suddenly relevant again, or other times because you just recently read it and want to have some discussion.

The other mods can chime in, but I'm in favor of leaving it laissez faire.
