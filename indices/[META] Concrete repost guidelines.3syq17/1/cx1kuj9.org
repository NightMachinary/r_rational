Pegging a rule to the rate of growth is a bad idea. I believe it's better to keep reposting guidelines vague than to tie it to something unpredictable like that. The reasonableness of a repost does not change with the total population of a sub. Even if all the same people are here a year from now, it is a good idea to allow rehashing old content, because people miss posts, ignore or disregard their presentation, or simply forget about them or their names and sources. People can come at things from different perspectives across long periods of time, because what they know and feel has changed. And then there are whatever viewers of this sub are there without subscribing, either regularly because they don't have an account or don't feel like subscribing, or incidental. To an extent, all activity is good activity. Discussion can bring up new points. The total subscriber count is not representative of new subscribers, either, as people are able to leave.
