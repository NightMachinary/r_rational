Does the author mention any plans on wrapping up this fic? It's very fun to read, but I've erroneously expected it to be finished when I'd started on the 2350 pages long pdf file. Hitting the end was an unpleasant surprise after building up the excitement for several days (yeah, my fault completely, should've checked the status before). Now I wonder if there are rough estimates for when the finale will come out, like for Mother of Learning. Or maybe it's meant to be continued indefinitely.
