  Awareness flooded back into me. I was Catherine Foundling, daughter of no one and nothing. I'd fought people for gold once, but earned only silver. I'd taken lives, and justice had come for me with a sword that cried like a grieving man. I was apprenticed to a monster but dreamed of making a world without them. A traitor to all causes but my own, and my path had brought me to this moment: bleeding out on the floor, surrounded by fire.

  The other claimants were all dead, and I was the Squire.
