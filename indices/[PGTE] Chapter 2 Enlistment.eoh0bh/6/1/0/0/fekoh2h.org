It seems that, for free as part of the process, a Named gets to know their Name(-tag) label, which the Gods chose rather than the Named themselves; and their Aspects and a broad outline of what their Aspects can do, which may just amount to knowing the definition of the Aspect's label word.

So PGtE to some extent averts the “experiment with my powers to figure out what I can do” trope (though Cat and Amadeus and a few others are presented as highly experimental) and definitely “pick a superhero name for myself” trope.

As the Scorched Apostate discovered, they /don't/ know which specific God(s) (have any individual Gods ever been mentioned?) granted the Name or necessarily what their “marching orders” are except as implied by Name and Aspects.

Suppose someone comes into the example Name of Winged Fury. According to my model above they know that Name, and they know their Aspects: *Fly*, *Seize*, and *Rend*. Presumably *Fly* happened at their “moment of truth”, maybe they took a leap of faith off a cliff. They manifest wings and inherently know how to operate those wings, but not necessarily exactly how fast they can fly, how high, what happens if they fall or crash-land, etc. They are aware that they can manifest talons with which to *Seize* but do not necessarily know their weight limit to lift or how that affects their flight speed and maneouverability. They do not know what types of armour or hard objects they can *Rend* through.
