Objectively speaking, the kid saved thousands of lives by sacrificing about a hundred. Given that he couldn't make them listen (and what village elder will listen to a petulent child?), he did do the right thing.

But he can never know that. To know that his atrocity was the best he could have done, given the circumstance, would lead him into the same trap Tariq has fallen into: that of thinking such atrocities are always justified. Only unlike Tariq, the Scorched Apostate will never have the whispers of the Ophanim to moderate that conviction.

And so, he will become another Catherine, rather than another Tariq. He will continue to make hard choices, continue to do what will turn out for the best, but he will always have that little ball of doubt in the back of his mind. He will always wonder if it could have been done better, if only a better person, a better tool for the job, had been there. He will always wonder if fewer had to die, had fate seen fit to send a finer tool than him. But he will never see that musing such counterfactuals is pointless, for the world he lives in is the one where he, with his gifts, was sent. He /must/ never see that, lest he become convinced that his way is always right.

That way lies the Throne of the Dread Empire.
