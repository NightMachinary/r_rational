I'm willing to help with scientific knowledge, particularly mathematics and computer science since I'm majoring in computer science and minoring in math. I don't know how well I can help with being a rational reader though. I've mostly read LessWrong sequences on How to Actually Change Your Mind and a lot of rational fiction and have some limited experience in being a Wise Reader.
