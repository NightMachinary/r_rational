Dragon from Worm (or some unchained version from fanfic) sounds pretty good, although she is still bound by entropy...

Unfreed Genie from Aladdin could work, depending on how far into indirection those three rules of his reach. Phenomenal cosmic power with compulsion to obey included.

Or, if I actually had this power/device, I would make sure I find some work which includes an FAI. Someone must have written a few paragraphs of story about it, and to hell with "doesn't make for interesting stories". At the very least someone must have asked OP's question before, and someone like me did the following:

"We managed to create an omnipotent FAI. The end."
