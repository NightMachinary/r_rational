Perhaps Jane from /Children of the Mind/, if you've read that much Ender. She hasn't figured out immortality yet, but that's mostly due to being written in the 80s, before people were really clued into what was possible with an FAI. Being able to interface with human brains, sufficiently advanced plants, /and/ computers, as well as her instant communication across the universe and her teleportation abilities makes her one of the more broken depictions of an FAI I know of.
