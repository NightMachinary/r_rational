The first problem there is that you are imposing your values on everyone else in existence, which is morally reprehensible.

The second problem is if your value function isn't quite what you think it is. There are lots of things that we want to want, and it's easy to tell ourselves that we actually want them. Having something show you your true value function might be decidedly unpleasant.
