  The first problem there is that you are imposing your values on everyone else in existence, which is morally reprehensible.

Only if your values are really weird.

Most people's values are hard to put into words, but center around things like, make other people happy, which isn't terribly morally reprehensible.

However, if one of your values is "Make sure everyone is serving my idea of god x" or "destroy all members of outgroup y" or "I don't care about anyone else, just make me super-powerful," then yes, imposing your values would be pretty terrible.
