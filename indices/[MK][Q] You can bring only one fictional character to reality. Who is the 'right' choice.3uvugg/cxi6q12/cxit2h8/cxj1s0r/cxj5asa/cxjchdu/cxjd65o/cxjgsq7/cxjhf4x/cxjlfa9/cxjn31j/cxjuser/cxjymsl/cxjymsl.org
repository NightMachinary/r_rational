There's not much to be gained here from scolding and downvoting me. If you can't even respectfully have /this/ conversation, I don't like your odds of converting anyone genuinely hostile to you, to your point of view.

I think it's common ground that the courteous thing to do is to begin conflict resolution with attempts to reason with them, and appeal to their sense of moral reciprocity. Pretending that I argued for "jumping straight to mindrape" is strawmanning, and that doesn't count as reason, nor is it emotionally appealing to me, so you strike out twice there. Also murder's been "on the table" since well before our ancestors lost their tails; murder /not/ being on the table is a relatively novel concept.

But let's go on for a bit. What if they /are/ actively harming others? What if they're not interested in reasoning--they try to straw-man you, or something--and their emotional appeal range is pretty much limited to whiny scolding? (Also there's no authority over the two of you for you to appeal to, or perhaps the authority is neutral between you.) Whats your preferred method for resolving values conflicts in these categories?
