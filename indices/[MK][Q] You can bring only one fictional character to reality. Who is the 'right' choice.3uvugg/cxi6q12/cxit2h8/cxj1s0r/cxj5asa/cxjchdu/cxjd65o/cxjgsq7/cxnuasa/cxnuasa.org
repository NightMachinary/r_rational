To go along with [[/u/aschenkarnos][u/aschenkarnos]]'s post, if I could wave a wand and forcibly give every person on the planet who is on the sociopathy spectrum empathy, part of me wouldn't hesitate to do so because sociopathy is reprehensible to me. Part of me would also consider that wrong, but the former side is probably stronger simply due to fear of what someone with zero compassion for other humans could do in a position of power, both political or technological. Would it be wrong for the genie to mindrape all sociopaths in accordance with my base-level fear, against my higher ideals?

For that matter, what happens if the genie takes into account the lower, more instinctual levels of your brain and not just your conscious desires? Hint: Why does absolute power corrupt?
