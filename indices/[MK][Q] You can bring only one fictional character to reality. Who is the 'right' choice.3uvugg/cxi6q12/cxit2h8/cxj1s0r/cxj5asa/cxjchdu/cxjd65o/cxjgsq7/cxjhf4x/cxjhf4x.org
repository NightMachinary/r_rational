IMO if a principle really is a /moral value/, one /would/ compulsorily apply them over the top of other people's personally preferred ideas. For example, if I could wave my wand and cause /all/ other people to become curious, compassionate, courteous and cooperative, or at least more often to behave like that, then I would do so without a second's hesitation.

I don't value the opinions of incurious, cruel, rude and selfish people on the subject of whether or not they should behave that way. It's /clearly better/ that people be internally driven to educate and improve themselves, that they/we empathetically consider the effects of their actions on others, and that they/we fairly divide both the necessary work and the rewards for it.

If you're not comfortable imposing your values on others, then that in my view--a value I would impose--is an indication that you need to refine and clarify your values. If you're not living up to your own values, because it's become impossible for you, then that's an indication that you need to relax them and make them more realistic; as such, they're not even suitable for being imposed on /you/, let alone others.
