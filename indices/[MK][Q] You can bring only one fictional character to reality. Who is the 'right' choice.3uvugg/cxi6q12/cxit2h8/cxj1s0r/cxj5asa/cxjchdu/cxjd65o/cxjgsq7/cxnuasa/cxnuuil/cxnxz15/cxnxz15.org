Agreed, which is why I thought:

#+begin_quote
  "Genie, change the world state so it's perfectly aligned with my utility function"
#+end_quote

Is actually a terrible wish. Literally the first thing I thought of is the genie optimally fulfilling your wants...but your food/sex/sleep wants rather than your actual professed wants (which may be self-deceived, roundabout instrumental goals for the wishmaker's biological drives).

What is good/utility? It's somewhat amorphous, and the genie could claim too much so to craft a coherent wish. But what is satiety? /That/ is much more concrete.

Edit: I know you didn't post that, I'm just keeping it in mind as the primary topic.
