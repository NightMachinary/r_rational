  I guess we only have until the heat death of the universe then. Oh well. As to the second objection, not finding things interesting correlates more with the observer's depression than with the inherent interestingness of the things.

Are you saying that when I've heard the same song for the 100th time and I no longer find it interesting, is it that the song makes me depressed, rather than my brain having already figured out the patterns, and no longer gets a dopamine boost from it?

  Paralysis is not a compassionate response. That would be a failure to be compassionate; perhaps understandable and excusable, as self-compassion might conclude, but still a failure.
#+end_quote

You seem to be defining compassion weirdly. It seems to be the sames as "doing the right thing," which isn't really how compassion is used. Compassion is normally defined as sympathy and concern for another person's well-being, not as acting optimally to ensure another person's well-being.

Compassion can lead to "This problem is so bad that we have to do something now!" reasoning, even when the "something now" won't help, or would even make the problem worse.

I agree that compassion is generally good, but I wouldn't want to increase it for everyone, without qualification.

  Also I don't hold "rationality" as a higher value than compassion: it might become "rational" for me to kill you and take your stuff.
#+end_quote

In very few situations is it more rational to kill someone than to not kill them....

Aside from that, it shouldn't be an issue of which concept you hold above another. Surely that would depend on the scenario. Would you rather have a compassionate witch doctor, who will "heal" your wounds with spit and dirt, or an uncompasionate MD, only doing it for the money, who will use antiseptic and bandages.

  Lack of courteousness creates resentment, which is far more corrosive to efficiency.
#+end_quote

It's not an either-or situation. You opted to increase courteousness in everyone, even those who are already hyper-courteous. There is a happy medium.

  (Immature INTJs very rarely achieve anything that justifies putting up with their bullshit.)

That personality classification [[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/the-myers-briggs-personality-test-is-pretty-much-meaningless-9359770/?no-ist][isn't really all that useful.]]

  If they did, it'd come from compassion.

I'd hate to see a bunch of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pibge7dXYN8][ABE]]'s cooperating out of their compassion for humans.
