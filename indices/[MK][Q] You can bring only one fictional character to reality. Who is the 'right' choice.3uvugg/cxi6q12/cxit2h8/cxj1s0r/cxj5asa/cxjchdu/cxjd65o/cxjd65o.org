  Only if your values are really weird.

Not necessarily. For example, I put little to no value on professional sports, yet there are people who do, and have lives centered around it -- either as their profession or as their primary leisure activity. Likewise, I think that religion is (for the most part) awful, yet there are people who have built their life around it. What right do I have to forcibly rip those peoples' lives away from them? Try to convince them? Absolutely, that's a good thing for me to do, but not by force. I hesitate to use the word because it's so loaded, but what we're talking about is mindrape -- ripping someone's brain apart and replacing it with something that is more to your (or, in this case, my) liking. There is no violation greater than that.
