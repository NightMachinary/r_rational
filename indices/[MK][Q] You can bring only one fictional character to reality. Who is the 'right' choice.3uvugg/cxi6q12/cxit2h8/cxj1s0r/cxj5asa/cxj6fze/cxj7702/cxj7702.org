You're missing my point. Taking actions like "talk to people to convince them of my beliefs" is perfectly reasonable and honorable. "Use magic to transform everyone in the universe's mind-state so that it matches my values" is not. That's exactly what you're asking for here -- you want everything to align to your values, which means every/one/ must align to your values. You are killing every other person in existence and replacing them with someone that looks like them but thinks like you.

Unless "respect for the lives and rights of others" is not part of your value system, this wish literally cannot be fulfilled.
