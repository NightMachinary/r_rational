Well, yes. My value function prefers universes that seem to contain other people with value functions that are being filled. By contrast, a universe with history where everybody's mental state was invasively overwritten by my own would not quite satisfy my own values. Your value function almost certainly has similar properties, judging by how violently you reacted to the idea. Of course, for the sake of making this post less than 10 kilowords I've had to use terms like like "containing other people" and "history" and those are notoriously flimsy ideas around here, but I think that the post should work.
