For the sake of not writing a novel, I simplified. But yes...ish.

I'm sure I have some values, which, after gaining more intelligence, would change (mostly changes in their weights, I'd assume), but as it turns out, making a single wish which allows for the changing of those values without changing things I'd like to preserve is non-trivial, and would resemble something more like a legal contract mixed with programming instructions, rather than a wish.
