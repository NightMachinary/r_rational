I'm pretty sure that when Aladdin wished to become a prince, he wasn't concretely imagining =Strong as ten regular men definitely.= =He's got seventy-five golden camels.= =Purple peacocks he's got fifty-three!= =A zoo of exotic-type mammals.= =He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys.= =He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies.=

Wait, *slaves*? Oh my. But we are talking about Islam, so maybe Genie is pro-slavery, or maybe Aladdin is too, and WAS thinking about that.

=Proud to work for him- They bow to his whim- Love serving him!=

Created mindslaved sentients. It's the house elf thing all over again.

Of course Genie also does a /really/ shoddy job of it, because /Jafar dispels it/ somehow. Aladdin didn't wish to look the part, to play the part - was that concept of deception held strongly in his mind and does it override the literal wording? - He wished to /be/ a prince. Somewhere, there is now caused to be a sovereign nation he is royalty of. Stripping him of all his parade floats doesn't undo that. You can't "reveal him" to actually be a street rat - and if you can reveal him to have once been a street rat that doesn't matter legally because he's a prince /now/.

So... uh... WTF, Genie?
