  Maybe my definition of utility function is off.

No. They're defined perfectly well by the VNM axioms. You just don't have one built into your brain. If you want to construct one, you need to invent the appropriate construction for your cognitive architecture, show how it's a unique or universal construction, and then use the output of that construction. This may not work according to your preconceptions, and requires knowing a good deal more about how the mind works than you or I actually know.

You can't wish for things you don't understand in principle.
