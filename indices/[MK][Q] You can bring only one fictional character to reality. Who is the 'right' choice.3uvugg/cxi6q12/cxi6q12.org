My primary criteria are probably:

- Extremely powerful
- Aligned with my values

To that end, I would probably select some sufficiently advanced AI that's known to be good. A Culture Mind is probably my best bet, since the entire Culture is essentially contained within one, which means that I (and everyone else) would rapidly gain access to all that nifty culture tech.

Assuming that magic still works if I bring in a fantasy character ... I'd probably go looking at a registry of gods, but I imagine that it would be difficult to find one that actually shares my values.

You said that he/she/it is under no compulsion to obey me, but does that mean no /additional/ compulsion? Because if they still have all their regular restrictions, I think I might take Genie from Aladdin, who would be compelled to grant me three wishes (probably enough to get to godhood).
