Gnostic Jesus, or maybe whichever Gospel had the nicest depiction of Jesus? Provided that he doesn't decide that Revelation is the instruction manual for what he should do next, and instead does that thing where he goes around healing everyone and resurrecting the dead and telling people to be nice and yelling at hypocrites. He seems like he'd be remarkably frustrating to get answers out of ("Lord, what is your opinion on the space program?" "The Kingdom of God is like unto a whale, who grows slowly and gets metacancer..."), but Jesus in the gospels rebuked the Disciples who wanted to smite their enemies with Balefire, which seems like quite the step up from Revelations Grim Reaper.

Of course, he openly favored Israelites and only healed Gentiles who jumped through lots of faith-hoops. I wonder if just having him around would make that "faith as small as a mustardseed can move mountains" thing work? The implications are a bit concerning.

One can only imagine what he would say to the Pope. Or MIRI. "Jesus, how to we insure an AI will be friendly?" "The children of God are like unto multitudes of wasps..."

I would hope that GNOSTIC!Jesus or GOSPEL!Jesus would be rational enough to update given actual omniscience over this world. I'd expect him to remain wishy-washy and vague and to speak in riddles and to never actually get around to that whole saving the world thing unless he gets himself executed, but he would probably be a net improvement. (I can't help but feel like my first question would be "Would it have been better had I summoned the Genie from Disney's Aladdin instead? Or maybe the Ellimist or a Namekian?")
