Honestly, I don't consider that AI unfriendly. It's unable(unwilling) to meddle with the brain, to harm the user, and it grants you whatever you want. It's not /best/, but certainly much better than no AI. Lack of suicide option is a problem, but well, it's possible to circumvent(with request brain manipulation).

In other words, that AI is definitively friendlier than bare Universe.
