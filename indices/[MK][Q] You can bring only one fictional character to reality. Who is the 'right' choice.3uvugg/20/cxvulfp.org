I have a character within my novel setting that is pretty nearly omnipotent. I made sure to build a clause into his character that he'd recognize me as his creator and give me his service if we're ever in the same universe. You know, just in case.

I also built root access codes into my universe that no one within the story itself will ever figure out, expressly for the purpose of my own use if I somehow end up in there.

It's not going to come up, of course, but I spend enough time on world building that giving myself a godmode clause wasn't exactly a chore. =D
