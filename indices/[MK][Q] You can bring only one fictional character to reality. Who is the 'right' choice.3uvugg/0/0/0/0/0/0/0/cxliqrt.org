  Not quite as bad as that, but stranger. Falling... used a consenting human as its avatar. And while it was that avatar, the avatar got into all sorts of kinky predicaments. It kept the host's personality running while doing all these things. And then when Falling... was done with the body, Falling... wiped the host's memories and left him standing on the docks, missing a month of memories and having gained a number of interesting scars, tattoos, illnesses and bandages.

Actually, he got healed too. And those "kinky predicaments" included actual physical torture, like breaking his fingers. It was still torture even if the memory was wiped afterwards.
