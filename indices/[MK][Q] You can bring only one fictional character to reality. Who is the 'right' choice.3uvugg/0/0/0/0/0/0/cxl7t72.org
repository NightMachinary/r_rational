  Falling Outside The Normal Moral Constraints has been known to torture people for amusement, relying on the fact that it can wipe memories and repair damage perfectly so it has plausible deniability.
#+end_quote

Not quite as bad as that, but stranger. /Falling.../ used a consenting human as its avatar. And while it was that avatar, the avatar got into all sorts of kinky predicaments. It kept the host's personality running while doing all these things. And then when /Falling.../ was done with the body, /Falling.../ wiped the host's memories and left him standing on the docks, missing a month of memories and having gained a number of interesting scars, tattoos, illnesses and bandages.

  He looked cadaverous, hollow-cheeked. Dark eyes with no whites, two ridges instead of eyebrows, a flat nose and mid-dark skin, scarred in places. He was only medium tall but his height was emphasised by his thinness. If his physiology was the same as a Sichultian's then the slight bagginess about his face implied the weight loss had been recent and rapid. His clothes were dark, perhaps black: skinny trews and a tight-fitting shirt or jacket, partially closed at the neck by a thumb-sized, blood-red glittering jewel on a loosened choker.

That's /Surface Detail/'s protagonist's first impression of Demeisen.

#+begin_quote
  Lededje saw him look at her right hand and so put it out to him. His hand clasped her hand, fingers with too many joints closing around like a bony cage. His touch felt very warm, almost feverish, though perfectly dry, like paper. She saw him wince and noticed that two of his fingers were crudely splinted together with a small piece of wood or plastic and what looked like a piece of knotted rag. Somehow the wince didn't travel all the way to his face, which regarded her without obvious expression.

  There was a small gold tube in front of him which Lededje had assumed was the mouthpiece of an under-table chill or water pipe -- there were several other mouthpieces lying or cradled on the table -- but which proved to be a stick with a glowing end, un -attached to anything else. Demeisen put it to his lips and sucked hard. The golden tube crackled, shortened and left a fiery glowing tip beneath a lofting of silky grey smoke.

  Demeisen saw her looking and offered the stick to her. “A drug. From Sudalle. Called narthaque. The effect is similar to /winnow/, though harsher, less pleasant. The hangover can be severe.”

  “‘Winnow'?” Lededje asked. She got the impression she'd been expected to know what this was.

  He smiled more broadly and ground the yellow-red glowing tip of the stick into the open palm of his other hand. There was a distinct sizzling noise. Again, his body seemed to flinch, though his face remained serene.

  “What, this?” he said, looking down at the ash-dark burn on his skin as Lededje stared at it, openly aghast. “Don't worry; I don't feel a thing.” He laughed. “The idiot inside here does though.” He tapped the side of his head, smiled again. “Poor fool won some sort of competition to replace a ship's avatar for a hundred days or a year or something similar. No control over either body or ship whatsoever, obviously, but the full experience in other respects -- sensations, for example. I'm told he practically came in his pants when he learned an up-to-date warship had volunteered to accept his offer of body host.” The smile became broader, more of a grin. “Obviously not the most zealous student of ship psychology, then. So,” Demeisen said, holding up his hand with the splinted finger and studying it, “I torment the poor fool.” He put his other hand to the one with the splinted fingers, waggled them. His body shuddered as he did so. Lededje found herself wincing with vicarious pain. “See? Powerless to stop me,” Demeisen said cheerily. “He suffers his pain and learns his lesson while I... well, I gain some small amusement.”

  He looked at Jolicci and Lededje. “Jolicci,” he said with obviously feigned concern, “you look offended.” He nodded, creased his eyes. “It's a good look, trust me. Sour opprobrium: suits you.”

  Jolicci said nothing.

  Wheloube and Emmis resumed their seats. Standing there, Demeisen put out both hands and stroked the hair of one and the shaved head of the other, then cradled the finely chiselled chin of the one with the shaved head using his unsplinted hand. “And fascinatingly, the fellow” -- he used his splinted fingers to tap the side of his head again, hard -- “is quite defiantly heterosexual, with a fear of bodily violation that borders on outright homophobia.” He looked round the table of young men, winking at one of them, then gazed radiantly at Jolicci and Lededje.

For reference, Jolicci is the avatar of a General Contact Mind, which falls somewhere between First Contact and Diplomacy As Usual

  Jolicci shrugged. “The Abominator class of General Offensive Unit, to which our friend belongs, is not known for its mildness or sociability. Probably specced when the Culture was going through one of its periods of feeling that nobody was taking it seriously because it was somehow too nice. Even amongst those, though, that particular ship is known as something of an outlier. Most SC ships conceal their claws and keep the psychopathy switched to Full Off except when it's judged to be absolutely necessary.”

Later, Falling... leaves the body. Attending are Lededje, Jolicci, and Sensia. Sensia is the General Systems Vehicle hosting Jolicci, Jolicci's ship, and Lededge, but not Falling..., whose ship body left on a different course.

#+begin_quote
  “I did leave earlier, my gracious hostess. I am currently some eighty years or so distant on an acutely divergent course, and travelling only slightly more rapidly than your good self, though still just about within real-time control range, at least for something as intrinsically slow-reacting as a human host. All of which I would hope you're well aware of.”

  “You're abandoning your puppet here then?” Jolicci said.

  “I am,” Demeisen agreed. “I thought now would be as appropriate an occasion as any other to return the fucker to the wild.”

  “I have heard some disturbing reports regarding your treatment of this human you're using, ship,” Sensia said. Lededje looked at the GSV's avatar. For a small, frail-looking lady with frizzy blonde hair she seemed suddenly invested with a steeliness Lededje found herself glad was not directed at her.

  Demeisen turned to Sensia. “All above board, dear thing. I have the relevant releases signed by his own fair hand. In blood, admittedly, but signed. What was I to use -- engine oil?” He looked puzzled and turned to Jolicci. “Do we even have engine oil? I don't think we do, do we?”

  “Enough,” Jolicci said.

  “Say goodbye and release your hold now before I do it for you,” Sensia said levelly.

  “That would be impolite,” Demeisen said, pretending shock.

  “I'll suffer the injury to my reputation,” the GSV's avatar said coolly.

  The cadaverous humanoid rolled his eyes before turning to Lededje and smiling broadly. “My every best wish for your journey, Ms. Y'breq,” he said. “I hope I did not alarm you unduly with my little display last night. I get into character sometimes, find it hard to know when I'm causing distress. My apologies, if any are required. If not, then please accept them in any event, on account, to be banked against any future transgressions. So. Perhaps we shall meet again. Until then, farewell.”

  He bowed deeply. When he came upright he looked quite changed; his face was set differently and his body language had altered subtly too. He blinked, looked around, then stared blankly at Lededje and then at the others. “Is that it?” he said. He stared at the ship in front of him. “Where is this? Is that the ship there?”

  “Demeisen?” Jolicci said, moving closer to the man, who was looking down at himself and feeling his neck under his chin.

  “I've lost weight...” he muttered. Then he looked at Jolicci. “What?” He looked at Sensia and Lededje. “Has it happened yet? Have I been the avatar?”

  Sensia smiled reassuringly and took him by the arm. “Yes, sir, I believe you have.” She began to lead him towards the traveltube and made a begging-your-leave gesture to Jolicci and Lededje before turning away.

  “But I can't remember anything...”

  “Really? Oh dear. However, that may be a blessing.”

  “But I wanted memories! Something to remember!”

  “Well...” Lededje heard Sensia say, before the doors of the traveltube capsule closed.

Until /Falling.../ encounters Lededje again:

#+begin_quote
  “Why are you here, if only apparently?”

  “To make you an offer.”

  “What? To be your next abused avatar?”

  He grimaced again. “Oh, that was all just to upset Jolicci. You saw the guy I was... inhabiting; I released him in front of you. He was fine. I'd even fixed his fingers and everything. Didn't you notice, this morning?”

  She hadn't.

  “And anyway he did agree to everything. Not that I really abused him in the first place. Did he say anything? When I released him; did he? I didn't bother to send any surveillance back-up and I haven't asked the SAMWAF, so I honestly don't know what happened after I pulled out. Did he? Make any allegations?”

  “He couldn't remember anything at all. He wasn't even sure he'd been an avatar; he thought maybe it was about to happen.” Demeisen waved his arms. “Well, there you are!”

  “There you are what? That proves nothing.”

  “Yes it does; if I'd really been sneaky I'd have left the dumb fuck with a batch of implanted false memories full of whatever Contact-wank fantasies he'd been imagining before he took the gig in the first place.” He waved one hand in a blur of too-long fingers. “Anyway, we're getting off the point here. You need to hear my offer.”

What /Falling Outside The Normal Moral Contraints/' offer was to Lededje, you will have to find out by reading the book yourself.
