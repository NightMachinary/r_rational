Not to mention that a Culture ship can literally digitize you and spit you back out in a body of your choice without you noticing the transitions. If you could find a Mind which would cheerfully upgrade anyone who asked to at least a Culture-human body, that'd be a great start. One who was happy to circle the globe and do it for any injured/sick/aged person would be fantastic.
