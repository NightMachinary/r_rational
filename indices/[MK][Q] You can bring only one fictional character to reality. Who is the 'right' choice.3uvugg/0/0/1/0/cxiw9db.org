Yeah, any other choice would have to have a pretty convincing explanation to choose over a Culture Mind.

Specifically, I'd choose the System-class GSV /Empiricist/, from /The Hydrogen Sonata/. Noted for it's exceptional size even for a GSV, and a complement of seven(!) Minds rather than the normal three. Seems happy to focus on civilian pursuits. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spacecraft_in_the_Culture_series][Here's a list]] of others.
