Yes. But some have internal sources of power. And it's harder to tell where the Culture powers (as an individual) end and their universe powers begin.

For example, drop some sort of super-soldier on Earth and it's presumed that he cannot make new superweapons, only keep what he has. If the superweapon depends on or works on things not found here then they're shit out of luck? But what about a magician? What about a magician that depends on a very clearly bound source of magic (it clearly works in one area or on one person)

With the Culture is the Grid like the superweapon or like magic?
