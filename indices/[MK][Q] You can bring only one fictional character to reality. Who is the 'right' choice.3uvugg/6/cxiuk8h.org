Can I suggest a more specific version of this question, that's more interesting to me?

  You can bring one /simulacrum/ of a fictional character into being in this reality. Their personality will be synthesized from any sources you specify, ala TNG's Moriarty. They will possess no special powers beyond being able to think in an interesting fashion.

  A robot body will be constructed for them, containing a CPU on which a low-level emulation of the synthesized synaptic architecture will be run at a roughly "real-time" speed. They will not think "faster" than a human in any meaningful sense, though they might have a higher IQ than one for synaptic-connectivity reasons.

  The construct will know nothing of the technology used in its construction that the fictional character was not themselves aware of, and the robot body will be tamper-proof and will explode if x-rayed/ultrasounded/MRIed/etc. (Basically, treat the robot as a black box.)

In short---what fictional character would be capable of doing the most good for our world, purely by doing some "merely human" thinking?
