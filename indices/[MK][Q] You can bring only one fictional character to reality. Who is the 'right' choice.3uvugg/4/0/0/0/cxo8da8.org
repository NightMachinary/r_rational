ACHEM.

Bringing Lordgenome doesn't let me pierce/create the heavens and get Simon.

Bringing Simon /does/ let me pierce/create the heavens and get Lordgenome. And whoever the fuck else we want from any other universe. We just go and get them.

I didn't pick Simon for power or intelligence. I picked him because he has /the key to let us out of the box/.
