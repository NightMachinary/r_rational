Is Simon the more-powerful user? I don't know how I feel about the comparison. LordGenome ate that whole Big Bang when it would've destroyed the Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, and summoned his Ganmen, but Simon manifested the drill directly on his arm at the end of the second movie.

I think the reason I want LordGenome is because he's the stronger leader and he has more experience with Spiral Energy than Simon, even if Simon is the more-powerful user. Didn't the Anti-Spiral say that unbounded Spiral energy would destroy the universe?
