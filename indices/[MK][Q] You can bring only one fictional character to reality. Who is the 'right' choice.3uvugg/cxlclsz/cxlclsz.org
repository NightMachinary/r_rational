I liked all the responses here. Honestly all my options were characters that would probably bring more trouble than good so how about this?

1) Bring over Aladdin's Genie.

2) Wish for a Culture's Mind and get yourself Sublimated.

Then as [[/u/literal-hitler]] wrote:

3) A wish that will allow you to craft a near optimal second wish. Depending on the type of genie that might be knowledge of the rules, an intelligence boost, or something else.

4) Wish for near optimal wish granting you as close to omnipotence as is allowed.
