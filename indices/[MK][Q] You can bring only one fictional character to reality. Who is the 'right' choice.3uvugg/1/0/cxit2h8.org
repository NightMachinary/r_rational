  I think I might take Genie from Aladdin, who would be compelled to grant me three wishes (probably enough to get to godhood).

1. A wish that will allow you to craft a near optimal second wish. Depending on the type of genie that might be [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4637439/chapters/10575111][knowledge of the rules,]] an intelligence boost, or something else.

2. Wish for near optimal wish granting you as close to omnipotence as is allowed.

3. Free the genie or something, you can now probably do anything you can wish for yourself.
