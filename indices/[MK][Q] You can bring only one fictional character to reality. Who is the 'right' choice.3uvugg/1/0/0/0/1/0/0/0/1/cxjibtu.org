  For example, if I could wave my wand and cause all other people to become curious, compassionate, courteous and cooperative, or at least more often to behave like that, then I would do so without a second's hesitation.

I'd advice against that.

Curious: Would get bored when they ran out of things to discover, or when new discoveries weren't interesting.

Compassionate: This can be paralyzing when bad things happen, disallowing you from helping, and also increases the impact of emotional appeals, which could overshadow rational ones.

Courteous: Courteousness can kill efficiency.

Cooperative: It's goodness depends on whether you agree with what they are cooperating on. I'd much prefer for bad people to defect against each other.

This is the problem with using unspecific Kantian values, rather than thinking through exactly /why/ you value those things. Generally, these things all boil down to some measure of happiness.

  If you're not living up to your own values, because it's become impossible for you, then that's an indication that you need to relax them and make them more realistic; as such, they're not even suitable for being imposed on you, let alone others.

Realistic is not really an issue for a genie :P
