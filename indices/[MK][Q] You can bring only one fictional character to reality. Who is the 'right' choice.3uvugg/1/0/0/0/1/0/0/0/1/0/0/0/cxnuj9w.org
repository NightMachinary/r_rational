A little nitpick: Raising the global level of courteousness would still be a net gain if people lacked consideration of other's emotional states more than they lacked consideration of efficacy, or if optimal efficacy was either not critically important, less important than courteousness, or not correlated with a drop in efficacy in most situations.

The former none of us are really sure of, but the latter I think could be argued to be true.
