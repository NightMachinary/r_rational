  Curious: Would get bored when they ran out of things to discover, or when new discoveries weren't interesting.
#+end_quote

I guess we only have until the heat death of the universe then. Oh well. As to the second objection, not finding things interesting correlates more with the observer's depression than with the inherent interestingness of the things.

  Compassionate: This can be paralyzing when bad things happen, disallowing you from helping, and also increases the impact of emotional appeals, which could overshadow rational ones.
#+end_quote

Paralysis is not a compassionate response. That would be a failure to be compassionate; perhaps understandable and excusable, as self-compassion might conclude, but still a failure. Also I don't hold "rationality" as a higher value than compassion: it might become "rational" for me to kill you and take your stuff.

  Courteous: Courteousness can kill efficiency.
#+end_quote

Lack of courteousness creates resentment, which is /far/ more corrosive to efficiency. To dismiss the effect of others' feelings on one's goal pursuit is a /huge/ error, all the bigger for being commonly made. (Immature INTJs very rarely achieve anything that justifies putting up with their bullshit.)

  Cooperative: It's goodness depends on whether you agree with what they are cooperating on. I'd much prefer for bad people to defect against each other.
#+end_quote

If they did, it'd come from compassion.
