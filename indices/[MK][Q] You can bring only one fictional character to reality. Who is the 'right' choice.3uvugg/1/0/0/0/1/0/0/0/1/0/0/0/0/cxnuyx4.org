Agreed. In fact, all of those things together would probably be a net gain, (which is to say, given a yes or no option, I'd most likely give my approval) but a /net/ gain isn't all that we should be after. With a genie, we'd want an /optimal/ gain, and not just in one domain, but in virtually all of them together. Done correctly, it would be unthinkably better.
