Is it supposed to be a surprise to me that other people feel differently? That's the whole point of values conflicts. We'll have to work it out, I guess, the same way humans have been working it out for hundreds of thousands of years. Reason with them, emotionally appeal to them, out-compete them, and/or kill them. Whatever works. Or if it doesn't work, and they win, then they won, and so be it. Memetic evolution in action.

How do you feel about the concept of values conflict? How would you resolve it? What would you do if the opponent won't go along with your preferred methods?
