  To go along with [[/u/aschenkarnos][u/aschenkarnos]][1] 's post, if I could wave a wand and forcibly give every person on the planet who is on the sociopathy spectrum empathy, part of me wouldn't hesitate to do so because sociopathy is reprehensible to me. Part of me would also consider that wrong, but the former side is probably stronger simply due to fear of what someone with zero compassion for other humans could do in a position of power, both political or technological. Would it be wrong for the genie to mindrape all sociopaths in accordance with my base-level fear, against my higher ideals?

I guess that the answer to that question would depend on if the rational version of you, given the option, would want to go through with that. If you would, then there isn't a problem. If you wouldn't, then you'd have to find out a way to make sure it doesn't happen.

One of the many difficult parts about crafting an optimal wish would be to define "I" in a way that your wish will actually come out how you would want it to come out.
