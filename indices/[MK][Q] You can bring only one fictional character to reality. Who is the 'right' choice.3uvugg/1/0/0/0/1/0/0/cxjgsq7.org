  For example, I put little to no value on professional sports, yet there are people who do, and have lives centered around it -- either as their profession or as their primary leisure activity.

You have multiple values, and "sports are stupid and nobody should watch them," is probably very low on your list of priorities. Ranked much higher are things like "People should be able to watch sports if they really want to" as a subcatagory of "If they aren't harming anyone, people should be able to do what they want to do."

  Try to convince them? Absolutely, that's a good thing for me to do, but not by force. I hesitate to use the word because it's so loaded, but what we're talking about is mindrape -- ripping someone's brain apart and replacing it with something that is more to your (or, in this case, my) liking. There is no violation greater than that.

You just contradicted yourself. Is it a good thing for you to do, or is there no violation greater than that? If you believe the latter, then a scenario in which that happens /wouldn't align with your utility function, and therefore wouldn't be included in the wish./

Everybody has contradicting values. Give me two non-identical values, and I can find a scenario in which they contradict.

So, going back to the utility function, your "don't mindrape people" value would have a higher coefficient than your "no sports" coefficient.

Maximization doesn't mean maximization of every value (because they negatively coorelate with each other), it means maximization of the entire function. For a simple example, remember that maximization of profit is almost never at the point where revenue is maximized, nor where cost is minimized, even though profit is equal to revenue minus cost.
