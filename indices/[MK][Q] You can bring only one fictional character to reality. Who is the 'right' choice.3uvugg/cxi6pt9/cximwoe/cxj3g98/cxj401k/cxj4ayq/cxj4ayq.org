If you're going to exclude things like hyperspace and the grid... that is, you're limiting them to known physics... then that eliminates all magical abilities, all soft-SF abilities, and even a lot of diamond-hard SF (like, we don't /know/ that there are algorithms that would allow something like Neko-AI to function).
