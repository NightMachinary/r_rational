1. Sit down and re-read the Culture series. All of it.

2. Pick the Culture Ship most likely to be well-intentioned towards our little blue dot. Perhaps /Arbitrary/ (oh, hey, I know you think you left here a few decades ago, well you're back and the entire hominid population of this galaxy is this planet ... wanna lend a hand?), or maybe /Sense Amidst Madness, Wit Amidst Folley/?

Seriously, if you're going to find a friendly ASI in literature, I can't think of a better place.
