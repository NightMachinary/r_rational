These are always the best names for boats. When I was a pirate captain in a play, my ship was the /Unreliable Witness/.

There's the /Mistake Not My Current State Of Joshing Gentle Peevishness For The Awesome And Terrible Majesty Of The Towering Seas Of Ire That Are Themselves The Milquetoast Shallows Fringing My Vast Oceans Of Wrath/ and /Very Little Gravitas Indeed/, the /Unacceptable Behaviour/ and the Rapid Offensive Unit /Shoot Them Later/, the Gangster-class ROU /Heavy Messing/, the Offensive Unit /All Through With This Niceness And Negotiation Stuff/ and the GSV /Experiencing A Significant Gravitas Shortfall/. Plus the /Pure Big Mad Boat Man/ and /Transient Atmospheric Phenomenon/, the /But Who's Counting?/ and the /Me, I'm Counting/, and the non-Culture ship /Strategic Outreach Element CH2OH.(CHOH)4.CHO/
