I mean, as our minds currently are now, there's tons of "data" that we're losing all the time. Outside of, possibly, those of us with eidetic memories (and I'm still not fully clear on how THEY work), we're taking in so much data that we just throw away. So you can have a finite mind that could function for an infinitely long amount of time, in my opinion. You would just keep having to discard data as you progressed. We already do this naturally. I'm sure there were things you knew at age 5 (such as where your stuffed bear liked to sit, or what part of your room you kept your hot wheels set in) that you will have completely forgotten by the time you're age 50.
