Reminds me of what the Prime Intellect in Roger Williams' novel. It gives everyone their own "infinite" and virtual sandbox. People can't enter without your permission and any direct assault is prohibited unless specifically allowed. And even then, if you die, Prime Intellect will just bring you back into your default, unharmed state (he saves live backups of all of humanity's brains)
