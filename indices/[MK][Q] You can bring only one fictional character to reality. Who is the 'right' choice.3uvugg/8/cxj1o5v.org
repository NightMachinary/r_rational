I think I know how to sidestep the 'created before I knew I could do it'. Simply use Library of Babel implementation and find /perfect/ book here. With prefectly_friendly_FAI_which_can_do_literally_everything. Well, it doesn't even need to be able to do everything. It just needs to give us infinite amount of memory, endless source of computing power and safety. About safety, it just needs to upload us, and also maybe Earth, into VR. Then put each person into their own VR sandbox. Provide API for safe inter-sandbox implementation, and it would be perfect.
