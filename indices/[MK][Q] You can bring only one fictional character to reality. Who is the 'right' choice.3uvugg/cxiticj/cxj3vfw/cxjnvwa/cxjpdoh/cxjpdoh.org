  should just go on pretending they're not a thing, not horribly graft them onto your universe and mutilate the universe in the process. Like lightspeed limits, intelligence explosions are just one of those things you're allowed to ignore by convention in science fiction.

Isn't "horribly grafting them onto your universe" or "ignoring them entirely" basically how SF authors handle lightspeed limits, too? They've just established better technobabble. I'll agree that subliming is a pretty awful way to add intellectual faster-than-light to your setting without breaking it, but I think that (in the same way that you can graft on FTL by adding wormholes) it wouldn't be too hard to add either reason intelligence explosions didn't happen or why they do happen and just aren't obvious.
