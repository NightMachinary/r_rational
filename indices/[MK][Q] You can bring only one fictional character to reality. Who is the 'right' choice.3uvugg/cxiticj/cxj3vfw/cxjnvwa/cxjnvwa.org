There's a BIG difference between living for a googolplex years and living Graham's Number years and living infinity years. Going past a googolplex without repeating yourself requires more than being able to move from one universe to another, it requires that you be able to make causally contiguous physical systems that are vastly larger than a Hubble volume. If Banks explicitly implied full immortality or even Grahamortality, it wasn't in the admittedly few Culture books I read.

Also, god I hate the whole "Subliming" thing. If you didn't realize intelligence explosions were a thing when you were creating your universe, and Banks clearly didn't, then you should just go on pretending they're not a thing, not horribly graft them onto your universe and mutilate the universe in the process. Like lightspeed limits, intelligence explosions are just one of those things you're allowed to ignore by convention in science fiction.
