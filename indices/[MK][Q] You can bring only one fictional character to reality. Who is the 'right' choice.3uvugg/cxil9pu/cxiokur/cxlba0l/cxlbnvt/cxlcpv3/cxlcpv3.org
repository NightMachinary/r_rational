Well it depends how ruthless you are willing to be. If you are smart with your wordings you can lead to something that may even be better than Madoka's wish at the end but at the cost of potentially hundreds of deaths.

But given the conditions of OP's post there're a lot of better options to bring to life. Also I don't think Madokami or Homucifer will do any good to this world given that one is a disembodied concept unable of action and with no role here as there're no witches (and thinking of her existential agony at being brought to a world unnecessarily gives me the creeps) and the other is a mad chaos god that also has no reason to be here and will probably be very angry...
