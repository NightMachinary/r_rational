Yep, that's exactly how it should be.

But Prime Intellect didn't give infinite sandboxes. AFAIK it discovered that accessible memory space is finite. And haven't tried to check if there is anything outside, due to risk involved(angering possible sentient beings outside which control our sandbox Universe, or shutting our Universe down accidentally due to stepping on the bug)
