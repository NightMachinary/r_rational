Zelretch maybe, Aozaki Aoko only knows destructive magic though so unless you have someone or something you want to blow up you're better off with Aozaki Touko.

Touko is pretty selfish and ruthless so it may also go badly...

Honestly most members of the Nasuverse seem pretty dangerous unless you got an ability to stop them. Even Zelretch probably won't help unless you have something to interest him.
