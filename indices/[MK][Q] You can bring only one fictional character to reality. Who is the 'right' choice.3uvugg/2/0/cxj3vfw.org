  I'm not sure whether the Culture qualifies along these lines (drawing on Grid energies inside this universe might not get you to the Graham's Number level of emortality as Permutation City would allow).

It's pretty strongly implied that Subliming basically turns a civilization (or other sufficiently powerful organism/organization like a Culture mind) into a version of Permutation City that's still capable of some kind of contact with the base reality. Most Sublimed species don't really stay Involved even with any remnants who decided to stay behind. There's oddball cases like the Chelgrians, where most of the species seems to have stayed behind and only join the Sublimed when their bodies die. The Culture is kind of an oddball too, because it's powerful and peaceful enough that it doesn't feel the need to sublime because it's got all the time in the Universe to go through with it.
