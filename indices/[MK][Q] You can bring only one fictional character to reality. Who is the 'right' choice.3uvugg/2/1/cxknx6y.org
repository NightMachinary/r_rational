  literally infinite computing power
#+end_quote

No such thing as a completed infinity of computing power: if you've got N levels of Turing Oracle, you can construct a machine whose Halting Problem is unsolvable without N+1 levels. Even if we use various of the "sideways" attacks on the Halting Problem to get a "good enough" de facto Turing Oracle, /there will still be more levels we can't access yet without more effort/.

And frankly, I'd bet some good money that /we want it this way/, as it ensures a /properly/ infinite supply of fresh, unlearned/unentangled/algorithmically-random information from which to generate Fun over time.

Completed infinities eliminate Fun; only incomplete infinities are desirable.
