  LordGenome's redemption arc is a thing of beauty, and where Simon ends the show being able to cast the Patronus 2.0, LordGenome is able to cast both the Patronus 2.0 and the Killing Curse 2.0. This is the power to rule.

Shimon is the more powerful Spiral user, and it's the Spiral power I want. Hell, I'm kinda just wondering if summoning him will make Spiral power work for all Spiral-type life-forms in our world, thus allowing me to wield it on my own.

I mean, hell, the Spiral Nemesis is dangerous, but in the /long/ run, you're waaaaaay better off having Spiral power than not having it. In the long run, you're going to need the mass-energy.
