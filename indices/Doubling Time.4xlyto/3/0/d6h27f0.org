Good catch. I realized after I had published it that I meant to say "thirty fold" (2^{5} = 32). I will fix the typo. The results are correct, I think. (2^{5} x 60e6 ~ 1900e6) (2^{10} x 60e6 ~ 60e9)

Elder God status is due to return on investment from the spell that requires drain of all of the Dark Wizard's reserve, which he gets back many fold by subsequent bloodiness. Wizard's in this world are long-lived but not immortal by default. Sorry if that wasn't clear.

It's entirely possible (even likely) that technological breakthroughs will foil Koschei's plans.

Why did Koschei return to his secret lair? It's supposed to be in the middle of a forest, with no nearby settlements. He had stepped out to take a leak, when Vern crashed in. Perhaps Koschei didn't fancy fleeing without provisions...
