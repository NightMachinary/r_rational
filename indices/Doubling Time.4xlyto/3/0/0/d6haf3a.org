Oh, him stepping in at that point was coincidence, I thought it was some ward alerting him, that Vern failed to account for because he thought Koschei wasn't there, and he only figured out Koschei has no power when he saw the bracelet say nothing.

I got that Elder God status comes from that, but it also would come from him investing half his total mana, and he would still get half of a billion, which is the same thing for all practical purposes. Unless he can't get proportional deathspring reward from lesser investment... yea that's probably it.
