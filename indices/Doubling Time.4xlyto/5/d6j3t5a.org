Depending how the spell works exactly, there are possible counters to prevent Koschei from becoming a deathless god-emperor (assuming he can't be killed for the time being).

Since the main logic of the story seems to be that /overpopulation/ causes the deaths (as opposed to "being born", which is dubious -- the credit might then go to the parents instead, for example), a competing dark wizard could get around it by straight up murdering the population with lots of death spells at a time while plenty of carrying capacity remains (ensuring that no deaths are attributable to overpopulation on the grounds that they are all caused by being murdered). Alternately, they might try ensuring that overpopulation never happens via population control measures, or by expanding the world's carrying capacity.

For population control, one might try creating engineered humans who tend to be sterile when they are crowded by some measure (less than a certain amount of food, more than a certain number of neighbors, etc.). These engineered humans might be given a gene-drive like magical effect that makes sure the trait is passed on to all children. Or you could make them more fertile than baseline humans, e.g. faster maturation rates. They could also be selectively more fertile when interbreeding with baseline humans.

Another approach to population control would be a stasis spell that kicks in when people are too crowded or hungry. If it has a side effect of invulnerability, this could be helpful in preventing Koschei from getting credit, but that depends on whether he gets credit for you being killed due to someone murdering you while you are in stasis (since the death is now not something that /necessarily/ follows from overpopulation).

Finally, the option of expanding carrying capacity should be considered from the perspective of the world's mechanics. Does it have an unlimited number of planes, dimensions, pocket worlds, and so forth? If so, you could invest anywhere under 20 years creating new unpopulated planes without ever running out.

If the world is a planet in a solar system like ours, a considerable increase in carrying capacity (enough to buy several centuries of doubling time) would follow from developing its resources. Given that Koschei is vulnerable until enough people die to boost his power reserves substantially, adding a finite but large number of death-free replications might be enough to thwart him.
