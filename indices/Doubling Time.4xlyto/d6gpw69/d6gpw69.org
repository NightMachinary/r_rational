I love it when people remember slavic folk heroes and/or villains)

That said, I highly doubt that "social forces" Koschei set in motion will keep fertility high. They are so unpredictable it's quite impossible to plan even for a decade forvard, forget about a sentury.

And yes, there is quite a few ways to deal with a wizard who has no power and whose only save is a bomb on a deadman switch. You can evacuate everyone in the blast radius, you can try to build a barrier around the blast and try to tank it. Or you can do a dangerous, evil and pragmatic move: imprison him, sedate and put on a mana drain, fueling some kind of great spell (welcome to immortality, bitch). Leaving him alone. on the other hand, is out of question: even if fertility rates will stabilize, he would still wield unmatching power and immortality, and the chance that one day he'll just go crazy and decide to wipe out humanity is just too big.
