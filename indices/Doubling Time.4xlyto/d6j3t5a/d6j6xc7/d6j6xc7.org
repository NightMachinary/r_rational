Interesting points. Thank you for thinking it through. What constitutes "responsibility" is deliberately not well-defined (as you and [[/u/fljared]] have pointed out). There are no known continents, or worlds reachable by realistic technology projections. However, magic IS technology. So, can't be ruled out. The funny thing about exponential growth (albeit unreasonable) is that addition of any bounded space capacity merely offsets the doom by a short period.
