Interesting. Depending on how the spell interprets "killed" (Given that it allows for indirect means) you could:

- Make a spell that kills the germs in water, then replaces them with 5-50% clones of the dead germs, cleaning it while still giving you deaths by pestilence.

- Figure out how to cure various plagues, then withhold the cure

- Encourage the widespread practice of euthanasia in order to prevent suffering the last moments of the person's life, thus claiming their death
