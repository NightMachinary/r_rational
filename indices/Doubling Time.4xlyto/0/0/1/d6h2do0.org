That was basically my point. It's very hard to convince a lot of people to bear immediate & asymmetrical costs (evacuating & permanently submerging farmland, etc.) in order to mitigate a fuzzily perceived threat a century or two down the line. This is a medieval society that hasn't experience exponential growth long enough to understand it.
