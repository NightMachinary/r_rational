  What I really wanted was a level up, to feel that golden taste, to be refreshed in body and spirit. They didn't remove every affliction, and I was skeptical that they would take care of something as drastic as using my own bones for fuel, but just to feel it again, if only for a moment ... wasn't this a major quest? Didn't I deserve it?
