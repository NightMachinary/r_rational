If you sign up for an AO3 account you can get email updates, I believe. The one thing I don't like about AO3 is that they have a lot of features I consider necessary that are still in development, like RSS for individual stories, but it's the most author friendly platform. If I could automate it I would put it on a schedule, but chapters are just posted when I finish them. I worry doing otherwise would make me want to go back and revise, which would slow down the pace of updates.
