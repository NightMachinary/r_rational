Send help, I'm addicted. I went in with the lowest expectations 'cause self-insert and litRPG tags scare me, and now I can't even decide on my favorite part. Maybe the always pithy flashbacks mediating between the past and Joon's current situation. Or rational characters with a high ratio of real talk. Or the meta-mindfuckery of Joon's situation. I don't know. Just more please.

To celebrate, I'm going on a recommendation spree. Also I noticed that the summary might be a bottleneck to new readers who aren't sure what they're getting into - especially if they're wary of SI/litRPG stories like me. I whipped up a short summary for a submission to [[http://webfictionguide.com/][Web Fiction Guide]] so everyone can start voting. More votes, more readers!

  A self-insert litRPG portal fantasy.

  A young man (the SI) suddenly finds himself falling off a plane into a new fantasy world. Being an old hand at D&D, some things seem disconcertingly familiar... but there's no time to ponder the similarities to the campaigns he used to run because there's a character sheet attached to his soul and this "game" is getting lethal real fast.

Any suggestions for improvements? Or maybe someone can come up with a better summary!
