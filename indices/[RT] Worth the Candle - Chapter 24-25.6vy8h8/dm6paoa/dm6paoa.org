What I don't like is that it's becoming increasingly clear that game engine have some (possibly rudimentary) personality, instead of being ruled by some comprehensible logic/laws. So the story line is effectively going into direction of some deranged and/or immature overmind playing with protagonist in the "I have no mouth ..." stile. Such settings are good for short story bit less so for long novel, because it force non-natural character development, where protagonist shouldn't become smarter or mature but instead conform more and more to this overmind personality.

PS From the other hand "1984", that could be valid plot.
