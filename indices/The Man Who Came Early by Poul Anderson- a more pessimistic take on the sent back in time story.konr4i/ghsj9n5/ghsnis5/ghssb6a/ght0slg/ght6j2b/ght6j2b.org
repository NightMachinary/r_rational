Chopping wood is expensive (in labor). You'd lose far more manpower in harvesting the lumber than you could make up with any plausible application of the steam engine.

There's nothing wrong with charcoal, but any situation where you have to chop down trees for fuel is one where you're better off with muscle power than steam.
