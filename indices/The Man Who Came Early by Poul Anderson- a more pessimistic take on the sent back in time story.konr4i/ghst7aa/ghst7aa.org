Realistic. Most past humans were farmers or hunters. Most modern knowledge isn't useful for either.

The common knowledge we do have that is useful to them, like crop rotation or boiling bandages, isn't easy to prove worthwhile in a hurry.

"Trust me, three years from now your crops will be better!" Not much of a sales pitch, is it?

If you get sent back in time, you want to get to a city or a royal court, where things like math, astronomy and world maps will have value. (Medieval Iceland, of course, had neither cities nor royalty.)
