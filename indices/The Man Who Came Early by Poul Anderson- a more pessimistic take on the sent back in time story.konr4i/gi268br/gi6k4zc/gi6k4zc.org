It goes both ways really. Our pathogens are dangerous to them and theirs are dangerous to us.

We are vaccinated against a few things, but the strains of those same diseases from a few hundred years ago would most likely be too different for the vaccine to work. People get the flu every year because it changes fast enough that last years antibodies stop working.

This is something that is never addressed in fiction most likely because it wouldn't be much of a story when everyone dies in a few days.
