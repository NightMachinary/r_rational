*Cross-Time Engineer by Leo Frankowski*

A high-testosterone, old school isekai of a 1990s engineer being time-stranded in 1200s Europe, and realising that in 12 years the Mongols will come and slaughter his new friends.

He then goes on a berserk industrial-upgrade rampage to prepare Medieval Poland and Hungary to fend off the Mongols.
