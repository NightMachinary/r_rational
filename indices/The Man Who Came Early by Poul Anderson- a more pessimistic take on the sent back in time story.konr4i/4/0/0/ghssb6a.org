Steam engines aren't useful without cheap coal.

The first steam engine shows up around 100 BC - the aeolipile of Heron of Alexandria in Roman Egypt. It's a toy, basically. Nobody can afford to throw enough fuel into those things to do work.

What changes around 1700? The British are mining coal, lots of it, and their mines are flooding with water. So you can burn coal in the mines, to heat the water in the mines, to drive a steam engine to clear water from the mines.

TBF, if you could bring back a modern machine shop, you could build a steam engine that was efficient even without a whole coal mine's worth of coal to work with. You'd still need coal, not wood, to make it worthwhile; but there are places with surface coal deposits.
