They make a nice thematically coherent triad. It's good that they have costs. It's interesting that the physical invulnerability's cost is immediate and clear, while the others are more vague long term terminal menaces.

What is the power level here? Invulnerable to scratches or bullets? A vague sense of emotions when facing someone, or detailed info on everyone around? Can you mix powers?
