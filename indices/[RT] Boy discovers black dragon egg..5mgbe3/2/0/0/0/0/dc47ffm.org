If this is the definition of rational fiction

  The main character uses (or tries to use) rationalist and scientific methods to demystify seemingly mysterious phenomena.

Then yes, there are many elements. Here's an excerpt.

#+begin_quote
  Forte considered his options. He didn't need to kill the hill giants, he merely had to relocate them. And thus, he needed to find out what was keeping them in this particular valley. He called upon his pirate companions for reconnaissance and consultation.

  They began to investigate the area. He noticed that the hill giants slept on the grass, and spent their time herding a flock of lambs. The lambs were the majority of the hill giant's food. Forte watched as the hill giants casually knocked away wolves and the occasional raptor that tried to poach a lamb. At night, a single hill giant kept the lambs safe from predators.

  His pirates reported that the giants did in fact speak the same language as them, but a very slow version. Plans started forming in Forte's head.

  He considered looking for toxic berries and poisoning their livestock, but the quantity of toxin was barely enough to kill a small animal, much less a towering hill giant. He had a better plan.
