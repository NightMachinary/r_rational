Thanks for the remarks. The first and second ones are very interesting, especially the first.

I remember reading Harry Potter or Eragon for the first time, and getting completely engrossed in the sheer amount of visual detail and description, but in the grind of writing forgot about that. It's hard writing detail while also varying words so it doesn't seem like I'm repeating the same words over and over.

I have a fairly extensive vocabulary compared to most people, but "fairly extensive" just doesn't cut it when writing a novel.

For example, simply describing Forte cast a fire spell is difficult to do, because the wording has to be different every single time.
