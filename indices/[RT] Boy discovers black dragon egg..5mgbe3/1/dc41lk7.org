@h20masta, if this is your story - Serious props for writing as much as you have. Seriously! I cannot give you enough credit for that. Sorry if I put you off, I am... kinda critical.

Edit: Ah, do you want criticism? I think I have some very constructive comments for you. I skipped around in your story a bunch trying to get more of an idea as to your progression as a writer.
