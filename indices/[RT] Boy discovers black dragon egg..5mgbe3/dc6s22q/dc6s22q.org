I've read most of the story (through chapter 26) and intend to read the rest of it. I like the attention you've given to worldbuilding and I'm interested to see where the story goes.

I think you already possess the most important writing skill: work ethic. You've shown real dedication to your craft, and your story by writing so much. Continuing to write prolifically is the best way not only to complete projects, but to improve your skills. I'm also happy to see that you've been receptive to criticism, since that's probably the second-most-important thing.

Since you've been looking for critique, I have a few suggestions:

- The story would really benefit from a *stronger feeling of direction and urgency.* Forte has some long-term goals, but it's not until many chapters in that he really lays them out; up until then, it mostly it feels like he's just meandering and reacting to the situations he happens upon. It's important to for the reader to feel that Forte is always actively moving toward a goal that's important to him. One of the times I felt most engaged with the story was when Forte coveted that slaver's fancy sword enough to risk his life for it--even though it was a petty want, it was a sincere and motivating one. It's that sense that the hero really /wants/ to succeed that gets the audience invested in that success. So I think it would make your story more gripping if you really emphasized Forte's desire to achieve a specific and significant goal (e.g. his desire to rule a city, although I worry that that dream is too distant to feel urgent), and clearly showed that desire driving his actions throughout the story.

- *I find it hard to emotionally engage with most of the characters, and I especially find it hard to root for Forte.* With the other characters it's just because they're not very developed; like the other commenter said, it would be good to practice fleshing out characters other than the point-of-view guy (this will help you improve at conveying information about a character without the advantage of the reader being inside their head). With Forte, however, the main issue is that he's just not a sympathetic character. He feels a lot like someone playing an RPG--just going around killing people and taking their stuff (those poor dwarves ;_;), caring only about getting more money and raising his stats. It doesn't really feel like Forte is invested in anything or anyone around him, so how can I be invested in him? Now, it's fine for Forte to be kind of a dick; there's nothing wrong with writing a self-interested protagonist. But there are a few things you could do to help the reader emotionally engage with him in spite of his not being a traditionally "good" hero.

  1. Giving him a well-defined *moral code* would help. That code can be anything you want, as long as it's consistent. (Don't have him internally monologue a description of his code or anything like that, just show it through his actions--show where he draws the line.) Right now he pretty much just takes what he wants, and although we see him judging the immoral behavior of others, it doesn't seem like he imposes any moral boundaries on himself. He needs some kind of a moral center, however villainous, to flesh him out.
  2. *Give him one or two things he really cares about*, and /show/ how much those things matter to him. For example, in the current version of the story, I don't really feel like he cares about Nightmare--he's affectionate toward him when they're together, but during the chapters when Nightmare was missing, Forte didn't seem to care at all apart from being mildly concerned about not having his protection. Those chapters are a great opportunity for you to get the reader invested in Forte's concern for his dragon companion. You can also show him caring deeply about achieving his goal--right now, he'll sort of idly consider how he can achieve things he wants, but I don't really /feel/ his emotional investment in his dream of ruling a city.

  *Number 2 is critical*, because having your character /care/ about something both makes them more relatable to the reader, and gives you opportunities to build tension and pathos by threatening the thing they care about. Think of this "caring" as a bond that ties your character into the story and raises the stakes. (One of my favorite stories has a protagonist who is probably a clinical sociopath, and could easily have been totally unsympathetic and boring...but because he had just /one/ friend he sincerely cared about, I was able to relate to him and become invested in his story. Nightmare could easily play that role for Forte.)

- There's a lot of *unnecessary detail* you could cut. I'm thinking in particular of the meticulous tracking of how many silvers each character possesses at different points throughout the story. Readers don't need the exact numbers, just a general idea of the practical implications of the character's current wealth (e.g. whether they're desperately in need of money for basic survival, vs being basically OK, vs having plenty to spare). When you're considering whether to include a detail, ask yourself, "What does including this detail accomplish in the story? Is it important to the plot? Is it important for fleshing out a character or location? Is it important for foreshadowing" If the detail doesn't have any such utility, then it may be important for you to know it as the author, but it doesn't need to go on the page.

- *There are often things you "tell" that would be more compelling if "shown."* This is one of those things that just takes practice to develop an eye for.

- Sometimes Forte wins/survives dangerous encounters because of his clever tactics; sometimes because of a deus ex machina (I'm thinking in particular of the glowy eyes magic super saiyan thing with the raptors). *The former is more satisfying,* so I would recommend sticking with that as much as possible. I do like that Forte experiences both victories /and/ defeats.

- *Try not to resolve setbacks /too/ quickly,* as it can feel unsatisfying. For example, I was a little disappointed when Forte's encounter with the orcs went immediately from them beating him unconscious and tying him up, to "let's be friends." It didn't feel like a real setback, since Forte didn't have to struggle to get out of it. Most of the tension in stories comes from the protagonist struggling against setbacks, so it's important not to let them fizzle out!

- I'd love to see *more significant female characters.* Right now it's pretty much just the princess, who hasn't had any direct involvement in the plot and comes across more as a caricature than a person.

- Forte is so young that it's sometimes hard for me to suspend my disbelief when it comes to his combat prowess, as well as how seriously the adult characters take him. *I would suggest maybe aging him up a few years,* unless there's something about the plot that absolutely requires him to start his journey as a ten-year-old. A really competent and clever young teenager is much more believable than a really competent and clever preteen. (Edit: After reading a bit more, I saw that he's 15 now, which surprised me--it definitely didn't feel like 5 years had passed in the story).

I also want to add that, when I talk about showing that Forte cares about goals/people/things, I'm not saying that you have to make him really emotionally demonstrative. Even undemonstrative characters can be shown to feel strong emotions; the outward signs are just more subtle. A brief, closed-lipped smile can mean mild satisfaction for one character and elation for another. It's up to you how you want Forte to convey his emotions, as long as the reader can tell when something really matters to him.

That's all I can think of for now. I hope you will find this useful and not too discouraging! After all, I wouldn't have read so far or written all of this if I didn't think you were off to a good start. Keep it up!
