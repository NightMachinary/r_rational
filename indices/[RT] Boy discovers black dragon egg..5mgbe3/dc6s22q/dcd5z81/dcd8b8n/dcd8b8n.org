I'd love to recommend it since it's great, but before I do--are you okay with going into it already knowing that one of the characters is a sociopath? It's kind of a slow burn in the actual story--it's not exactly a /twist,/ more of a gradual process of little things adding up until you come to understand that that's what his deal is. Knowing it from the start might change your experience, though there's plenty to enjoy about the story aside from that. Is that okay?

I'll put the link behind a spoiler so that it's here if you want it: [[#s][Link here]]
