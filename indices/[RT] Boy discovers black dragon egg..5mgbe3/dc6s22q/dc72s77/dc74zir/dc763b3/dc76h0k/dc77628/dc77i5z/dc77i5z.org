No problem! If you'd like to go that route, I'd suggest laying the groundwork by having Forte and Vaun experience some minor conflict or tension during the early part where they're working together, to establish the contrast in their worldviews. That way it won't come out of nowhere when the adversary turns out to be Vaun (and will feel a lot more organic than having both characters basically announce "I feel like we're destined to meet again for significant events" like they do now).
