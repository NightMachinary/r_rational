I love this idea

  On the opposite end of the spectrum, you could have some unknown person thwarting Forte's goals, and he eventually discovers it was Vaun the whole time (and that he created his own adversary by helping Vaun get his start). It's totally up to you how you want to play it.

And will be planning on using it.

Again, thanks for the help. I'm glad you enjoy the story as much as I enjoy writing it :)
