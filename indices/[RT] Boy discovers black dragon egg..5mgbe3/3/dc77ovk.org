I'm interested in the worldbuilding, but the way this is written is...simplistic. There's a lot of telling, and not much showing. The prose comes across as Forte did this, someone said that, and then Forte decided to do something else instead. Or Forte beat them up and took their money. Nightmare's interesting, but he's not got much character - he's half of the dynamic duo here, and all I know about him after reading all the chapters is that he's good-looking, breathes a lot of fire, has mysterious magical ability and eats a ton of meat. Overall, I feel like there's been a lot of emphasis on the world and the magic system but the story needs to have the characters and prose fleshed out to sell it.
