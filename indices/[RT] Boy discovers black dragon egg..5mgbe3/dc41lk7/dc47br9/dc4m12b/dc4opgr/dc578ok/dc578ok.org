I mean, yeah, but you don't have to do it every time. Describe it the first time, and then any time the description is significant. The first time you describe a fireball, we don't know what it's like, that's why you're telling us. The second time? We know; you can skip it, mostly - you may want to keep some of it for the poetry. It's also like conversations between characters; you set up tempo and voices by using many different ways to say "they said" (spoke, yelled, mumbled....) but at some point you've established the character's voices and can just alternate quotes, and the reader can follow along.

I'm worried that you didn't mention the Bechtel Test. Statistically, stories that pass the test do better*. Another way to look at it is that the exercise of passing it has high information quotient for you as an author - because it's the most different from what you're familiar with, it can teach you way more than anything else. Yet another way to look at it is the information quotient for the story - again, since it's the most different, it'll cover a part of the world and story you otherwise wouldn't explore.

- Specifically, movies that pass have better box office numbers: [[http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/]]
