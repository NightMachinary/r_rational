Fantastic! Note that I may have missed something from jumping around, rather than reading straight through.

You're extremely high on detail, and seem to be tracking the world very precisely. This is a good thing.

You are very low on description, and other characters have weak "voices".

I think you can "most improve" if you deliberately go after these two things. These are my recommendations:

1) The next time Forte visits somewhere new, describe the place in lavish detail. Use outlandish vocabulary, lots of punctuation; don't just tell us what it looks like, tell us what it /feels/ like. Seriously, go overboard - then sleep on it, and cut out /at least/ half the word count.

2) Write a chapter/installment from the perspective of a recurring, non-main character. This person should have their own name and be a different kind of character than Forte, but still be capable and intelligent. Ideally, have them participate in a significant event that will later effect the main story.

Finally: 3) The next opportunity you have to pass the Bechtel Test, /do it/. (Two named female characters having a conversation about something other than a man).

These are not intended to /directly/ improve your story; they're what I think will min/max your skill growth as a writer (which in turn, would improve your story).

Keep it up, dude!
