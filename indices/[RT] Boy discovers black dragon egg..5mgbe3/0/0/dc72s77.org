Alright, just read your critique, and I agree with everything you said.

1. Urgency or direction: I am formally introducing the "big bad" (think Voldemort, galbatorix, Sauron) next chapter in the form of Nightmare's warning about Ismas, a dark tyrant whose rise again was prophesied. He was briefly mentioned by the elf Leif in the elven city. My introduction of him is kind of weak though. It's literally just Nightmare telling Forte about him sensing that Ismas was rising again, and that Ismas had control of the king. And is it too late in the story to introduce him? If so, I'll have to go back and write this in.

2. Emotional engagement with characters, particularly between Forte and Nightmare. The shortcoming here was both a product of my inexperience in writing as well as the rush of releases between chapters 13-19. I think this might be the weakest point of the story, since I currently just can't think of how to make Forte a sympathetic main character.

3. Female characters. I simply find it difficult to write female characters in a story where so far most characters have been swinging maces and swords around. I might fit them in as supportive characters such as magicians, or shopkeepers, so that it makes sense.

4. The age/money issue. This is going to take some serious rewriting that I sort of dread. But I am already rewriting the prologue, so we'll see how it goes.

Here is the draft of Chapter 36 by the way.

--------------

The italics got lost. But when Nightmare speaks, it should be in italics.

Chapter 36:

The miners surrounded Forte and Nightmare as if they were heroes.

“I heard stories about hunters fighting wyverns, but to see it with my own eyes...”

“Incredible. Simply incredible. I'll tell my grandchildren about this battle. A lone man, against a fearsome wyvern!”

Nightmare snorted loudly.

Disperse this rabble, Forte. I need to speak with you in private.

Forte nodded.

“And your dragon too. So majestic!”

We may let them stay a while longer.

Forte laughed at Nightmare's vanity. The miners continued to clamor until Forte silenced them with his hand.

“The wyvern has been defeated. Tomorrow, we celebrate! But for now, let me rest, and let my dragon rest,” said Forte.

Frank Strongarm stepped forward and began speaking. “He sure as hell deserves the rest. Forte the wyvern slayer. Let's call it a night, men.”

The miners dispersed, and a weary Forte walked back to his stone house with Nightmare. Nightmare slept outside, but they could still communicate through their dragon and master bond.

“So what did you need to tell me?” Forte asked Nightmare.

The dragon stayed silent for a while, and then began to speak.

These are dangerous times. I feel the presence of the dark tyrant Ismas of the Storm spreading throughout the lands. He may not have a physical form yet, but you must not underestimate the dark tyrant---his tendrils of influence have already spread through Varia. The Rottheim king has been corrupted. This, I know. “King Richard? The one who ordered the death of my family?” Forte asked, suddenly intent. Thunder cracked, and it began to rain outside.

One and the same. King Richard has fallen into the dark tyrant's grasps. How, I know not. The dark tyrant's rise has been foretold. We must tread carefully to escape his gaze. We are not ready to face his wrath.

“How do you know all this about Ismas?”

How I know is beyond your comprehension.

Forte mused over the thought as he drifted into sleep, exhausted.

Vaun rang the bell, and then waited patiently outside a large, stately manor with a sign prominently displaying the words Property of the Leblancs hanging from the door. He was delivering the potion of eternal sleep to his client, an affluent aristocrat who was rumored to have a beautiful daughter.

“Who is it?” a sweet voice asked from the manor.

“Delivery for mister Leblanc,” he replied, eager to rid his pockets of the forbidden potion, the draught of eternal sleep.

The door opened, and a girl with long blond locks stood in the doorway.

“Come in, and wait in the guest room. I'll fetch my pa,” she said pleasantly.

Vaun was enamored, but he remembered his mission and walked inside.

Game of chess, slip into his wine.
