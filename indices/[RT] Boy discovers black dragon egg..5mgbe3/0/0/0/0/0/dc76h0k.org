I genuinely love that idea for Vaun! It sounds like he will make a great foil to Forte. Maybe, instead of cutting to interludes about Vaun, you could have them cross paths repeatedly during the story. Not only would you be keeping Vaun in the picture, you'd be building up the dynamic between the two of them, which will pay off when they come into conflict.

Depending on how much of a presence you want that dynamic to have in the story, you could even remove the part where they split up in the first place and have them continue working together, up until the point when their incompatible morals get in the way. On the opposite end of the spectrum, you could have some unknown person thwarting Forte's goals, and he eventually discovers it was Vaun the whole time (and that he created his own adversary by helping Vaun get his start). It's totally up to you how you want to play it.

I'm excited to see the rewritten prologue! I'll read it over lunch and let you know what I think.
