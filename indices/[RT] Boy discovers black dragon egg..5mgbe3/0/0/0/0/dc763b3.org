  Is the implication that the oncoming storm we've been hearing about is a manifestation of Ismas? You could emphasize early on that the storm is unnatural--perhaps a storm that size should never have arisen in this climate, or it's moving in ways that don't make sense for a natural storm, or contact has been totally lost with outposts that the storm has reached. Perhaps there are fragmentary historical records of storms like this being associated with cataclysms. Allusions to Ismas could appear in the magic-related books and locations Forte has been seeking out.

That's exactly what it is. I did mention it briefly in the elf chapter, but details tend to get lost when they are mentioned only once, and briefly. I'm actually in the process of rewriting the early chapters bit by bit, and will be correcting for foreshadowing.

  The age/money rewrites are probably gonna be tedious, yeah, but the plus side is that they won't require you to tear any plot stuff up by the roots. That should pretty much just be a matter of editing the descriptions in those parts. Don't be intimidated!

You're right. I'll probably do that as I rewrite.

  Your latest chapter draft reminded me that I also had a comment on the Vaun interludes. I think they often feel out of place and like they aren't necessary for the story. You've been establishing that Vaun is building his fortune, but you can easily just have that be something Forte discovers the next time they encounter each other (or just hears through the grapevine, if Vaun is going to be making big waves before the next time they meet), without interrupting the flow of the story.

The truth is that I intend Vaun to be an exceedingly important side character, and yet haven't worked out how yet. His is kind of just there for the sake of being relevant for now, which is bad story writing on my part. My general plan with him is that he has a stronger sense of morals than Forte, and somehow that will pit him against Forte in the future.

Also just uploaded the rewritten prologue. Cut out a lot of unnecessary stuff.
