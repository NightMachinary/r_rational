Don't despair about the challenge making Forte sympathetic! The reader is automatically inclined to sympathize with the POV character, so you shouldn't need to dramatically change his characterization to accomplish that. I think that emphasizing his bond with Nightmare would be a huge step in the right direction. Giving him moments of emotional vulnerability will also help a lot.

I would definitely agree that you should lay the groundwork for the rise of Ismas much earlier on. It will feel a lot more natural to have Forte become aware of him as a threat organically, rather than having Nightmare do an exposition dump many chapters in.

Is the implication that the oncoming storm we've been hearing about is a manifestation of Ismas? You could emphasize early on that the storm is unnatural--perhaps a storm that size should never have arisen in this climate, or it's moving in ways that don't make sense for a natural storm, or contact has been totally lost with outposts that the storm has reached. Perhaps there are fragmentary historical records of storms like this being associated with cataclysms. Allusions to Ismas could appear in the magic-related books and locations Forte has been seeking out.

Regarding the corruption of the king, Forte has good reason to keep tabs on what the guy who murdered his parents is up to, so he could find evidence throughout the early chapters that the king's behavior has become erratic (the mithril thing is a good start there). Or whatever you think would work best to lay the foundation that this king is going to be an agent of the Big Bad.

Re: female characters, it /is/ okay to write women characters who fight with melee weapons. It won't make the story unrealistic. Although women don't build as much muscle mass as men do, using swords is still possible; swordfighting women have existed historically, and there are still women who practice swordfighting today. There are also many other types of weapons your female characters can use that don't depend as much on physical strength, which would have the side benefit of adding variety to the action scenes.

Having said that, don't be afraid to include major characters who drive the plot without being directly involved in combat! There are a lot of ways that major characters can contribute (or antagonize) that don't require personally beating stuff up. In fact, you've already shown Vaun using his business acumen, rather than combat skill, to build up his status and start driving the plot (I assume the Leblanc thing is going to be important).

Just as a few examples, you could have women as: leaders, scouts, spies, diplomats, tradespeople, craftspeople, bureaucrats, healers, assassins, survivalists, scholars, wise old magic ladies, etc. The project of building up a city is going to require a lot more than just combat skills--as you've already demonstrated by having Forte use both combat and non-combat methods to get his outpost up and running.

The age/money rewrites are probably gonna be tedious, yeah, but the plus side is that they won't require you to tear any plot stuff up by the roots. That should pretty much just be a matter of editing the descriptions in those parts. Don't be intimidated!

Your latest chapter draft reminded me that I also had a comment on the Vaun interludes. I think they often feel out of place and like they aren't necessary for the story. You've been establishing that Vaun is building his fortune, but you can easily just have that be something Forte discovers the next time they encounter each other (or just hears through the grapevine, if Vaun is going to be making big waves before the next time they meet), without interrupting the flow of the story.
