We will probably do another episode on this at a later date, perhaps down the road once either more has been written, or when /Worth the Candle/ has reached its conclusion (same goes for /Pokemon: Origin of Species/).

Is there anything you'd like for us to talk about in a future episode about /Worth the Candle/? Things you wish that we'd touched on in this one? Questions about writing (or the writing process) would be especially appreciated.

(Incidentally, we haven't done a Mail Bag episode, and I kind of want to at some point.)
