We don't have transcripts. They're requested fairly often, but super time and labor intensive to produce. I've played around a bit with machine transcription, but the free stuff didn't really give satisfactory results, and the paid stuff costs money (imagine that!).

The best solution would probably be to have a free machine transcription that's then edited through crowd-sourcing.

If someone has a counter-recommendation, or some (amateur) expertise in the area, let me know; part of the problem is that I'm not well-versed in machine transcription, so a lot of time is spent on research and trying to figure things out. If it were as simple as "press a button to get a translation" we'd probably have those up already. (Same goes for uploading the back-catalog to Youtube, which I need to take some time to figure out how to do.)
