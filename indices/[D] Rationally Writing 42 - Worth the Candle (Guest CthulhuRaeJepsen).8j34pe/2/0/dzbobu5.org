Just wanted to comment on something you brought up in the podcast -- you mentioned that you're concerned that the characters may spend too much time talking about what they're going to do. I really like that we get to see how they think about things, and I think the rhythm it gives the story is a good one. Where Worm and Twig are exhausting because there's very little time out of crisis, and Mother of Learning for a while felt like there was no pressure, Worth the Candle maintains a sense of need for forward motion while still having moments of an adventuring party's equivalent of domesticity. Relationship development can serve the same purpose, but that can be just as fraught as actual combat, as demonstrated by the last few chapters. Having room to breathe makes it even more intense to have the wind knocked out of you, and it's great!

There are tons of other things you do well, and I love your writing in general. Just thought you might appreciate feedback on this specific thing. As always, can't wait for the next chapter!
