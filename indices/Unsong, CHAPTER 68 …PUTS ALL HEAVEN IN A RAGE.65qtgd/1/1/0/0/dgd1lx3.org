I thought so initially, but the conversation as laid out would be a little confusing:

  For an hour and forty minutes, they lay there on the bed. They held each other. They talked about Nathanda, and Caelius, and Jinxiang, and Sohu. They talked about the time they met, in the dining room of the palace, and how confused Father Ellis had been when Jalaketu asked him to officiate their wedding.

  Finally, Robin said: “Promise me.”

  And Jalaketu said: “I promise.”

Also, I don't think she really needs to extract that promise from him. The point of her going to hell is that it will be sufficient motivation on its own. If she expected him to give up it would be a pretty poor plan that wouldn't be significantly improved by the promise.
