I'm not following. Whatever Robin traded for was /her idea/. So anything that Thamiel suggested, such as forcing her to have sex with him, couldn't have been what she traded for. Robin didn't go into it planning to create Malia Ngo because she wasn't planning for Thamiel's addition to his end of the deal.
