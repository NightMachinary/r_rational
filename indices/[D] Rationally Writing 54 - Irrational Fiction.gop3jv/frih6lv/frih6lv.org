The discussion toward the end (where both hosts talked about appreciating film more for its craft than the rationality of its plot) reminded me of a previous discussion on this subreddit about [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ai2xuc/when_the_needs_of_the_medium_outweigh_the_needs/][when the needs of the medium outweigh the needs of the rational]].

An example of this can be see in /Murder, She Wrote/, where Cabot Cove, despite being a small town with a population of only a few thousand people, somehow has enough murders for Angela Lansbury to solve a new murder mystery every week -- and since the series ran for over 200 episodes, the murder rate per capita is by far the highest in the world. The worldbuilding implications of this are never discussed, for reasons that should be fairly obvious. (Similarly, there are lots of cartoon/comic characters who have stayed the same age for decades, without ever attempting to have some in-world explanation for why this is the case.)

There's a certain amount of "genre-savvy" that media tends to expect from its viewers. On a certain level, the audience understands that when there's yet another murder in Cabot Cove, this has more to do with the fact that we're watching a procedural crime show, rather than any of the socioeconomic factors we'd normally associate with violent crime. Likewise, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JlySl0Z6cQ][there's a twist in a scene near the end of Captain America Winter Soldier]] that "works" mainly because we know this is a spy thriller movie, and characters having perfect disguises that allow them to infiltrate organizations is just the kind of thing that happens in spy movies. The movie doesn't really need to go to great lengths to establish that this disguise technology exists or how it works because movies like Mission Impossible already exist in the cultural consciousness. Ditto for anything that invokes "zombies" or "vampires": we already take it for granted that vampires drink blood (and might have a certain susceptibility to holy water and crucifixes) without having to be given a rational explanation for why this is the case. (Some vampire stories will give us some backstory or mythos about Cain and Abel or whatever to explain why things are the way they are, but plenty are willing to just skip to the part where our heroes attempt to dispatch a vampire using one of the routinely-accepted methods.)

On a more general level, "laws of scriptwriting" are generally more salient than laws of physics. Solving conflicts in a way that meshes with the themes of the story being told often leaves us more satisfied than if every conflict is resolved simply by having the characters think their way to a solution. It's cool that in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQcFJ2KYjmU][at the end of Guardians of the Galaxy vol 1]], the Guardians win against the bad guy by standing next to each other hand holding hands, because what more thematically-appropriate way to end a story about the power of friendship? The fact that this "works" is established not through some carefully-constructed worldbuilding, but through the visual language of cinema (the scene does a great job of showing that the power of the stone, while too much for Starlord to handle alone, can be spread between multiple people who are willing to join hands) and the fact that, on a certain subconscious level, everything leading up to this moment in the film has primed us to expect a climax where the Guardians defeat the bad guy by standing together as one, and when that happens in the most literal way possible, it just feels /right/.
