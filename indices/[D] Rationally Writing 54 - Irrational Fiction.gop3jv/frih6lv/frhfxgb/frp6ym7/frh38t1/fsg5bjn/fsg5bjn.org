Narrative mindset is about constructing meaningful frameworks/value-oriented contexts for events in order to derive meaning from them. You explain not only what is happening, but why, how, what it means and *why it matters*. Narrative mindset focuses only on the stuff that is actually *relevant* to what the story's readers care about, in order to share valuable lessons and perspectives through usually-hypothetical experiences.

Its opposite is Deconstruction mindset, which breaks stories down and finds the holes in them.

Using both mindsets together allows you to create the impression that an answer exists to every nitty gritty question in your setting without needing to go into detail about the ones that aren't relevant to the plot or characters, which lets you create stories that are richer and more engaging while still standing up to scrutiny.

Stories which use lots of Narrative but no Deconstruction are the ones we generally think of as the most irrational.
