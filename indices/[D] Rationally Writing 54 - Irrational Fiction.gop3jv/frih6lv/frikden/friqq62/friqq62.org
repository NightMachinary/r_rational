Apropos the latest Chili chapters, I'm inclined to think of it as a case of "simple minds in a complex world", or to twist your phrase - "the needs of the /average/ outweigh the needs of the rational."

According to one view, stories "[[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/11/the-psychological-comforts-of-storytelling/381964/][allow people to see patterns where there is chaos, meaning where there is randomness]]." As such, you could say storytelling is the subjective signalling of order from chaos; it follows that the simpler the signal, the more likely it will reach its target. So irrationality would just be a side effect of toning down the signal to more effectively penetrate the collection of heuristics that people are comprised of. Yet no two signals penetrate the same way. So counterintuitively, for the detail-oriented audience with many running heuristics, the signal turns into a lock and key metaphor: it needs to preemptively account for all the filters that scrutinize or distort the signal. The hard part then is optimally tuning the signal so it feels /right/ to the maximum amount of people (by definition, the middle of the bell curve). Thus some people will always be left out, victims of standard deviation.
