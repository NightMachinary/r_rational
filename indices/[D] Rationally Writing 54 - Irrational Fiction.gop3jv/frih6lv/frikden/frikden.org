  An example of this can be see in /Murder, She Wrote,/ where Cabot Cove, despite being a small town with a population of only a few thousand people, somehow has enough murders for Angela Lansbury to solve a new murder mystery every week -- and since the series ran for over 200 episodes, the murder rate per capita is by far the highest in the world.

And, even when Jessica Fletcher travels away from Cabot Cove, the murders seem to follow her.

My personal headcanon is that she's some kind of underworld cleaner, who protects her "friends" by coercing other potential suspects into confessing to the crimes her associates have committed.

That said, I don't disagree with the theory of the post in general; there's certain sacrifices to realism that you can make in the name of dramatization, like "sound in space" or "helmets that illuminate a pilot's face" or Iron Man being able to slam into the ground in a superhero pose at terminal velocity, with his suit somehow protecting him from it.

At the same time, I think that you have to use unrealistic tropes carefully, even if they're common within a genre, because they can undermine what you're trying to do. If your character is able to walk off being shot, and 99.9% of the bullets aimed at them aren't hitting the character anyway, then, when you try to add tension by putting your character under fire, you don't get the same sense of tension that you would in a story where the good guys can actually get hit and killed by bullets.
