/Monk/ at least set its stories in a city with a large enough population to actually have a lot of murders, although he can't seem to travel anywhere without finding a murder there, too. Sharona spends an episode saying he must be jinxed, but at the end decides it's the other way around: fate brings him places where murders are going to happen so they won't go unsolved.

Even Agatha Christie got asked how there could be so many murders in the unnamed small town Miss Marple lived in, and she answered something along the lines of "Don't underestimate how much evil can be lurking in small towns."
