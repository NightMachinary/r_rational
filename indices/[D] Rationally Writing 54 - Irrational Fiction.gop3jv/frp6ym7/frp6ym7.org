I just want to say that I disagree that cinemasins has gotten worse.

Edit:\\
I find the Rational gerne is ultimately about maintaining stakes.\\
It's about making sure the object level is taken care of, so that the stakes can be maintained.

The fact that a reader wont be punished for thinking about details and what would otherwise be handwaving. Means that they never leave the secondary world of the fiction, and as such their experience is maintained.

Playing "fair" with everything in the story, means that the stakes will never suffer from a reader noticing contraindications. As the promise of the medium means that if someone notices something like that, they can simply wait for the story to resolve.

A contrasting example would be The Dark Knight Rises.\\
The movie goes to lengths to isolate Gotham from the rest of the world, the take everything from Batman, and then abducts him and places him on the other side of the world in the middle of nowhere.

After Bruce gets out of the pit, the movie considers the challenge overcome, and if you are invested in the rest of what the movie has set up, then you will be punished for caring.
