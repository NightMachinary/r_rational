Definitely a good podcast (and handy for me on the rather long drives I have to make semi-often; there's just so much there!). Brandon Sanderson has three laws of magic, the first of which you can find [[http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/][here]] (and he first originated them in the podcast), that I find very helpful when creating a magic system.
