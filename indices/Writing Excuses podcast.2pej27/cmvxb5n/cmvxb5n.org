As I know a few of us here try our hand at writing from time to time, I wanted to share this podcast. It's short and pretty dense. Part handy information, and part inspiration/motivation. I generally want to go and write whenever I'm done listening to an episode. It's hosted by Brandon Sanderson, author of the Mistborn trilogy (among a number of others).
