Yeah, it's very /One Punch Man/.

"I am the ultimate champion prophesied by my millenia-old civilization. I have spent /decades/ slowly accumulating power, making plans and secretly buying legendary artefacts to enact our fallen god's revenge. Tremble, for my ritual has already started, and my power is doubling every minute I stand! After a lifetime of training, victory is our due, and we will get what should have been ours for a thousand years!"

"Ugh, I hate Mondays."
