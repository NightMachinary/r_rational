I actually read MoL first, before WtC.

It was interesting and gripping in its own certain, maybe clinical way, but I didn't engage with it. I didn't care for the characters much, nor did I find myself caring much about the world around them. The time looping nature of the story reseting any character development doesn't help.

It did walk me through the paces of what rational fiction is, though.
