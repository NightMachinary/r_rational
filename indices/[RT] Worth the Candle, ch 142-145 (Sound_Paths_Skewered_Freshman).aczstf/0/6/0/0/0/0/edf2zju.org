You may like the [[http://daystareld.com/podcasts/rationally-writing/][Rationally Writing]] podcast by Alexander Wales (writer of WtC) and Daystar Eld (writer of Pokemon: Origin of Species). You know, two behemoths of this sub. :)

I probably should listen to it more, however there are a few episodes which I think you might like. You should listen to episodes 6 & 7, Magic Systems, where they talk about exactly what you just mentioned. And by exact, I mean exact. How sci-fi and fantasy end up very similar, having their own magic system that can be hard or soft. Really, just go listen to it. :)
