I get the appeal of MoL, I really do. It's a neat idea and works in a lot of ways.

The more I think about it, the more MoL sounds to me like a "hard" Sci-Fi story. It's built solely around a neat concept and the author sees where he can take it, within its rigid ruleset. It's just set in a fantasy setting incidentally.

And man, hard Sci-Fi despises characters. Mostly because they get in the way of the big idea.
