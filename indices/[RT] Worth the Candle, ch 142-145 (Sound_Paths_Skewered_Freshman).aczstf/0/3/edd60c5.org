I went through basically exactly the same series of events except my first series was Mother of learning, which is every bit as good as WTC, it boggles my mind that work of this quality isn't getting published, especially with MoL because it is so well suited for that format, I have been reading webnovel for years (initially translated ones of the Chinese variety) and understand the pressures that doing something like this for a living put on an author, though obviously not all authors do, and the differences in quality and continuity that this format of ten produces, bit some of the novels I have found since I found [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and topwebfiction.com are so good that it boggles my mind, to the point that they are some of the best series I have read. Worth the Candle, Mother of Learning, WORM, and A Practical Guide to Evil are those novels, and I can't imagine not having read them at this point.
