Yes, absolutely, the first chapters are years old, my tolerance bar for bad english is really high (a symptom from reading machine translated Chinese webnovels) so I'm not always the best judge, but it definitely get better quality as it goes. I started to see the difference between proper published novels and web novels as the difference between a recorded album and a live concert performance, one is edited and corrected to perfection while the other is more raw and rough cut, but no less impressive, and more so in some cases, they both have their appeal, if a few rough chapters of grammar aren't your cup of tea then stick to the published novels.
