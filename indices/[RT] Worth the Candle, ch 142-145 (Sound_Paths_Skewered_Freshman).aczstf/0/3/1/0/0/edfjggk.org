mol has significantly worse prose. i wouldn't say /bad/, per se, but def mediocre. the lower end of what i would expect if i were to go to a bookstore and pick up a random novel. wtc is comparatively much cleaner.

looking at the first few paragraphs of each from the perspective of some hypothetical editor, this is pretty obvious:

#+begin_quote
  Zorian's eyes abruptly shot open as a sharp pain erupted from his stomach. His whole body convulsed, buckling against the object that fell on him, and suddenly he was wide awake, not a trace of drowsiness in his mind.

  "Good morning, brother!" an annoyingly cheerful voice sounded right on top of him. "Morning, morning, MORNING!"
#+end_quote

even aside from the trying-too-hard "zorian", there's some pretty flagrant overuse of adverbs, the prosody is at odds with the content, etc. this is text that i can read without discomfort (we won't, at least, find a mistake in grammar until the fourth paragraph), but i certainly won't enjoy it.

#+begin_quote
  I strained against the collar that held my neck in place, trying to get a better look around. My hands and feet were both cuffed, with thick metal bars connecting the cuffs to each other, resulting in no give at all. I had a gag in my mouth as well, but that was a little bit looser.

  Five seconds ago, I had been passing notes in fifth period English.
#+end_quote

this isn't stand-out prose by any metric, but it's certainly competent. the only major complaint i have is with "but that was a little bit looser", which is awkward, but it's also clearly necessary to maintain the sentence pacing. i don't immediately know what to do to improve it, which to me is a good sign. the scene-setting is inoffensive, the punchline is punchy, and in all this prose smoothly conveys me to the parts of the work that i'm interested in.

as an aside, i'm surprised that [[/u/Namlis1]] says that they have a distaste for fanfic; ime the general quality of writing for fanfic is miles higher than that for original webfiction. the only webfic authors i've been able to tolerate have been wildbow and aw, despite what probably are more than a hundred attempts at reading other popular web serials. by comparison maybe one in twenty stories on sv have prose i find tolerable.

i suppose the difference in our experiences is probably due to fandom and platform; the average pmmm fic is miles better than the average worm fic is lightyears better than the average hp fic, and likewise for ao3 vs. ffn or whatever
