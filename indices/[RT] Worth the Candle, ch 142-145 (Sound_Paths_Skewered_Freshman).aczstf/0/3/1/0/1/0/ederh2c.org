I don't read ratfic looking for world-class prose, but if it's actually /incompetent/ then I won't be able to get through it, regardless of how interesting the ideas are. Prose /always/ matters. It am being many much problem-style at times at which prose isn't not being ungoodly.

I really wouldn't say /Name of the Wind/ had great prose, either. Competent, but not amazing, and there were some stylistic choices I thought were cringe-inducing, like the part that's repeated at the beginning of each book (or at the beginning and end of the first book? I don't remember). The parts I liked were the world-building and the sense that Rothfuss was carefully and deliberately setting up mysteries with actual answers (we'll see later how much of that is J.J. Abrams-style illusion). Not to mention the dopamine rush from Kvothe powering up.

As for Frances Hardinge, I might have to give her a try. I'll try not to judge her prose based on the hat I saw when I googled her...
