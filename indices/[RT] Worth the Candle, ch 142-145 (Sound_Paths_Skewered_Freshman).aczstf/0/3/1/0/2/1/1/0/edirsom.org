The biggest one was the inherent inconsistency in the premise of being in another world. In the first few chapters, the main character repeatedly makes statements that imply a strong familiarity with the world - even taking into account the subconscious "other" following her. It ended up just feeling like a poorly fleshed-out excuse for a self-insert.

That being said, I think I'm jumping off the train now. I was interested with the trope subversion of being a low-powered nobody, especially since the rest of the story seemed to be trying as hard as possible to be a Mary Sue setup. It seemed possible that she would start to leverage engineering and science, but then the story took an easy out and went full Mary Sue ("What's this? I was wrong all along! Your powers are amazing and rare!").

It is also comically cringey at times, which is not at all helped by poor writing:

  "I want to be the one to heal you if that ever happens." Elvia intoned solemnly, "I'll never let either of you die!"

  Gwen's throat became swollen as her eyes welled with moisture; her heart throbbed with maternal love and boundless affection.

  "... and we'll protect you too, always," Yue solemnly declared.

  "Aye," Gwen concurred, her hazel eyes full of conviction.

  There was nothing else to be said. The girls smiled as one, happy in their naive promise.

  â€œBlast Bolt!"

  The smell of hot ozone filled the air, mixing with the unstable Positive Energy. A shunt of electricity split the air.

  'Crack!'

  A flash, followed by a thunderous 'crack' filled the field with light and sound.

  Lightning! The crowd gasped. The power of the Gods themselves! The purest form of absolute destruction.

  A cloud of dust rose into the air, obscuring all sight.

  WHO COULD SURVIVE THE FIST OF HEAVEN ITSELF? The crowd cooed. SUCH POWER.

These aren't really taken out of context, either. The whole story reads like this.
