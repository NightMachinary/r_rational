Yeah, 5-10K is about what I peg it at. The story has close to 4K kudos on AO3, which would be consistent with about half the readers taking the time to click that little button, about what I expect as far as engagement for readers. Reddit somewhat recently removed the ability to see hits on posts, but when had that, threads like these were between 2K-3K, which again, is about what I expect for engagement (i.e. most people just read the work and none of the discussion). Tracking hits from just before a chapter is posted to roughly a week after is probably one of the most accurate ways of getting numbers, and by that metric it's ~7K.
