HPMOR was the fanfic that helped me realize "fan-fiction doesn't actually have to be bad, there's just a lot more of it that /is/ bad." That said, I found parts of it to be grating (even though most of the time I found it extremely funny/engaging), and personally prefer /Pok√©mon: on the Origin of Species/.
