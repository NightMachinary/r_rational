  Even if you were arguing it's an useless word, I find it useful to know whether something is say a Naruto fic before reading it, because then I know I have to have watched or read some Naruto in order to get the most out of it

I'm not sure I agree with this point, I never read a few fictions that some of my favorite fanfictions were based on and I didn't feel anything was missing.

One of my marks for a good fanfiction is that it's capable of standing alone without needing the reader to know the source material.
