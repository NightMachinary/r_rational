Fanfiction doesn't exist. There is only fiction, some good and some bad. The whole concept of fanfiction as a distinct and separate category was arbitrarily created by big business interests which killed the public domain and then brought about the cultural stigmatization of any works that build on an idea or concept which someone else is already profiting off of -- works which would have otherwise entered the public domain ages ago, especially if you account for accelerating cultural change as a sort of "inflation" on how quickly a work becomes cemented in common culture and the public consciousness.

I could write an entire novel by myself, but if it builds off of or references any ideas or concepts that somebody else is making money off of, then that person owns my novel in full, even though they did not write my novel. Luminosity by Alicorn is what Twilight could have been if its author were more intelligent and sensible and better at writing. And yet Twilight gets to be shared on platforms where the generally public will actually be able to see it, in bookstores and libraries, while the much higher quality and thought provoking "fanfiction" is forced to be relegated to obscurity, and thus censored. Stephanie Meyer has a virtual monopoly on novels which build on or remix Twilight, and any such works exist only as long as she permits them to, even though some of those works are significantly better than the original Twilight.

Sturgeons law 90 percent of everything is crap, but "original" fiction has access to gatekeepers in the publishing industry who clean up all the crap through editors and rejections.

"Fanfiction" is barred access to those gatekeepers, and so readers have to wade through heaps of garbage to find the gems. This reinforces the stereotypes about "fanfiction" and thus prevents people from caring about the death of the public domain because they dont know what they've lost in the process.
