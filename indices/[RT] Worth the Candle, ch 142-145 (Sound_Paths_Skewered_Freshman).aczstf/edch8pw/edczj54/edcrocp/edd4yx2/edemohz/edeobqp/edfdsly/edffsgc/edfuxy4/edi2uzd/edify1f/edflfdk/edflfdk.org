I'm totally not. I'm telling things exactly as they are. Do you really think Scott Alexander wrote Unsong because he was a fan of the Bible? Or that Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote HPMOR because he liked the original Harry Potter series? "fanfiction" isn't always written by people who are fans of the "original" work. Prequels, sequels and "missing scenes" written by fans of the "original" work is such a tiny fraction of the overall space of possible "fanfiction".

â€‹

Yet because people think that's what "fanfiction" is supposed to be, that's almost exclusively what you'll find on websites which host "fanfiction". Meanwhile, entire alternate universe retellings and remixes are in the tiny minority, even though they have a lot more room for innovation. Depart too far from "canon" and hardly anyone wants to read your work. Because if you do something that's too original, making an entirely new canon of your own, well, they could easily get that from non "fanfiction" works which are higher status.

An example: Reading the original Harry Potter series is not necessary to understand or appreciate [[https://hpmor.com][HPMOR]]. However, reading HPMOR is necessary to understand and appreciate [[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html][Significant Digits]].
