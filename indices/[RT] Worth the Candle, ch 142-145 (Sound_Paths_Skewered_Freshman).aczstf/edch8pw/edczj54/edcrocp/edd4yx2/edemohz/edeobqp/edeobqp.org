I don't imagine I could have made "fan-fiction" not a dirty word to me without reading /HPMOR/. I think "fan-fiction other than /HPMOR/" is still pretty much a dirty word to me...

It probably makes more sense after reading /Harry Potter/, but I didn't think that series was very good, so I don't know if I'd recommend that. You definitely don't have to read other web serials referenced by /HPMOR/; I didn't (unless I missed a /Worm/ reference), so I didn't get some of the jokes (unless I saw them pointed out somewhere), but none of it was significant enough to matter.

There is a great /Puppet Pals/ reference, though (which I also didn't know about until someone pointed out the reference).
