I have read fanfictions for stuff I have never read, but I still have to sometimes google physical appearances and stuff. I haven't read anything yet where I didn't have to at least google something once.

I see your point regardless, but I will say that even if you can't tell or feel anything was missing that doesn't mean there isn't. I guess theoretically speaking there might be such a thing as a perfect work that just explains everything in the same amount of detail as the original, but I doubt that was the kind of argument Sailor_Vulcan was trying to make.
