Fanfiction literally means fiction written by fans of a work, mainly using concepts from that work. It exists, and the name is fitting.

Even if you were arguing it's an useless word, I find it useful to know whether something is say a Naruto fic before reading it, because then I know (/edit: for the vast majority of fanfics/) I have to have watched or read some Naruto in order to get the most out of it. It's a good thing that fanfics aren't expected to reintroduce every single basic concept and character, and that can only happen if you're told you're expected to experience the original work (which obviously means that's also valuable. Yes, even Twilight).

I think what you're actually saying is that IP law is too restrictive, and I wholeheartedly agree, but you're choosing the worst way to express that.
