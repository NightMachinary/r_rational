Fair enough. It definitely feels more like a story later -- for example, the foreshadowing in the first chapter ("/Beneath the moonlight glints a tiny fragment of silver, a fraction of a line.../") means something by the end, at which point it feels a little more like a mystery novel because /why didn't I see all that coming?/

But I agree that, along with the pacing, the "textbook"-like exposition is one of the book's problems. Sadly he has no financial incentive to ever give the book a proper edit.
