Self-publishing on Amazon is pretty easy... In theory.

I used to think that the publishing industry was pointless, just a middleman taking a cut from the authors but no longer necessary in the days of Amazon and Lulu. Now that I've published a few things I realize that a publishing house is extremely valuable, because it's a one-stop shop for editing, cover creation, and marketing. Those are things that you can either do yourself or pay for individually, but there is definitely value in having someone else do it.

Still, getting your work out to the public for sale is not difficult.
