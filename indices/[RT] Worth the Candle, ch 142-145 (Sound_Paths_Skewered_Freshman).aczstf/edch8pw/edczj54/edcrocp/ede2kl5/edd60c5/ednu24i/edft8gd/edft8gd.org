  let alone patiently waiting around for someone to read it on some god-forsaken fanfiction archive without asking for money upfront.

I think you very much underestimate the reader base of sites like fanfiction.net, archiveofourown.org, etc. And to a lesser degree, a subreddit like this one.

I suspect there are five to ten thousand people reading this serial. I can't even guess how many people were reading Worm as it was written. If you want to compare to published authors with tens of millions of readers I guess that's small potatoes, but the average published novel only sells something like 5000 copies in its lifetime, and might gather some multiple of that in readers from used sales and libraries and such. Compared to that, stories here are not at all "god-forsaken".
