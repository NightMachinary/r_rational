It's really close to finishing. Probably just a few more chapters left. (Since the story is about a time loop, and they just left the time loop, now they just need to resolve everything. There's a lot of plot threads though.)

The author updates regularly every three weeks and have been doing so since he started (~2011 I think), though occasionally he says he's going to have to postpone a week. So technically it might be a few months until the absolute conclusion, but the progress is very steady.

If you don't want to repeatedly F5, you can make a fictionpress account, which you quickly do with a Google account, which emails on an update. The story is also split into three parts, so you can read the first two and wait until this sub explodes that it's done sometime before the end of the year. No need to compulsively update.

I also read a ton of fanfiction, so I just compulsively check my email instead for update alerts.
