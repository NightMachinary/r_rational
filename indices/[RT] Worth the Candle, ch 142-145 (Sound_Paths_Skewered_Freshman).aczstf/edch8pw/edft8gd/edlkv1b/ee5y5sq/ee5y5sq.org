  about half the readers taking the time to click that little button, about what I expect as far as engagement for readers.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture][I would expect more like 10%.]]). Granted, a kudos is even lower effort than a comment, but still. Hell, I don't think most readers even have much awareness of kudos; it's not as prominent as upvote buttons.

(I happen to read WTC on an app that doesn't have kudos functionality. Though I certainly don't kudos / upvote most stories I read, even on a browser, since it's an extra step and I'm lazy. And I'm in the minority of people who bothered to create an account.)
