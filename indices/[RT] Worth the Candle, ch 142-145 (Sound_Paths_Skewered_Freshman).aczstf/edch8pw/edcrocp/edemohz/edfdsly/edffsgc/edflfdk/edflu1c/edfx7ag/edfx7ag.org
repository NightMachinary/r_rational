In much the same way that reading The Lord of the Rings trilogy was necessary to write the Dungeons and Dragons roleplaying game franchise, as well as to begin the entire modern fantasy genre. Reading the Lord of the Rings is necessary to write whichever fantasy genre works descended from it, which in turn was necessary to write fantasy genre works descended from /them/. In the same vein, the author of HPMOR did NOT read the original HPMOR. he watched the first movie and read a bunch of HP "fanfiction", absorbing the original work's storyline by cultural osmosis.
