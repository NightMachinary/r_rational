Short answer:

#+begin_quote
  *Aches and Plains* - Perhaps farming might seem an innocuous thing to evoke the exclusionary principle, but given the time and attention brought to it by a billion minds, it was inevitable that someone would breach its deeper secrets. The land of Pai Shep is now guarded by a single warrior-farmer, his fields impeccable, his power absolute.

You're right that the average combat-minded Aerbian would never dedicate precious time to Woodworking because they simply /don't know/ the secrets of reality. But it's different for Joon or any PC with a GUI because they have the knowledge that there is a worthwhile (for a certain /worth/) virtue at the end.

I think the Woodworking 100 reveal was an intentional tease. There's guaranteed to be limitations, but it's a wink from the DM that even worthless-sounding skills can have a huge payoff. Yet Joon isn't likely to achieve 100 in any skill naturally and will probably never find out all the virtues. The morals are (1) choose wisely for those 40 skill slots and (2) soul magic is OP.
