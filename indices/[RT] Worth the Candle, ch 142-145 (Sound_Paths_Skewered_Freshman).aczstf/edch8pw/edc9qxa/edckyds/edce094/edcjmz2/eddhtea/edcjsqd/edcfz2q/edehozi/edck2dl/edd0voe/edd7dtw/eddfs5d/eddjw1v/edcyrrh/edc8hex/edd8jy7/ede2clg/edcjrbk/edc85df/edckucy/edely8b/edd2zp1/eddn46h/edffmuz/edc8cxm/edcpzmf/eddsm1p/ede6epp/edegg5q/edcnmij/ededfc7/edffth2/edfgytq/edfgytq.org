Oh wow, this is a long one. Here's my stream-of-thought, on second read:

#+begin_quote
  When the counter-imperialists failed to seize power for themselves, as everyone thought they would
#+end_quote

- Everyone thought that they'd seize power, or that they'd fail to seize power?

#+begin_quote
  “Not sure,” replied Pallida. “Ransomed it off, maybe, but that's always partnered with its own problems, because naturally, people don't want to give you money, they want you dead and their stuff back.”

  True to her word, Pallida left us behind when we got to the campus proper, insisting that she was going to ‘do her own thing' and would meet up with us later
#+end_quote

- I'm getting strong "Fenn's new PC" vibes from Pallida. Similar humor, similar background, showed up a little before Fenn died...

- Also, she's totally going to get a warrant on her head before this arc is over.

#+begin_quote
  “Helps me think,” he said, frowning at me.

  “I know,” I replied. I designed the he'lesh. “It's my understanding that it's not considered rude to ask which you just took?”

  “Indignation,” replied the bursar, narrowing his eyes at me. “You want to skip not one line, but two.”
#+end_quote

- So this species needs to take drugs to feel specific emotions or mindsets? That's an interesting concept.

#+begin_quote
  "No, no, I told him that I could arrange it, but I never said that it would be completely without caveats, and because there's no money changing hands, my hands, are, eh, tied."
#+end_quote

- That seems like a really easy to solve. How expensive can it be to bribe a unique-in-the-world academic institution that's powerful enough to control its own city-state and.. yeah, okay, I see why it might be too expensive.

#+begin_quote
  You must take classes, at least for long enough that you can have four instructors sign off.
#+end_quote

- Uuuuugh. So it's not just a sidequest, it's an /open-world/ sidequest, where you have to win over multiple NPCs each with their own problems and agenda. The DM /really/ liked his "Return to school" level.

#+begin_quote
  but it would be better to not have it come to light that the bursar was using his discretion in such a manner.
#+end_quote

- Well that doesn't look like a Chekov's gun at all, especially since you're the second person to mention this.

#+begin_quote
  Things started clicking into place. “I was,” I said. I shrugged. “Trial by adversity.”
#+end_quote

- Juniper is being very smooth about this. I'd have probably given the game away at that point.

#+begin_quote
  The first night they had slept together, he had been hesitant, but she had removed his clothes with deft fingers and pressed her skin against his own.
#+end_quote

- So we're leaving the "this is something the other characters told Joon later on" framing device, uh?

#+begin_quote
  She had thought she could manipulate people before.
#+end_quote

- Dew it!

#+begin_quote
  “They're about a young orphan who becomes a wizard. Would you like to read them?”
#+end_quote

- This whole Harry Potter thing reminds me of a passage from Glimwarden:

#+begin_quote
  (It was with some dismay that Melanie realized Eden's Waltz was an overly sugared coming-of-age story mired in its own unreality. The author of The Cafard's Contradiction was using the book to say something subtly unkind about Odessa's naivete.)

  “She has the Dagger of Dreamspeech,” said Amaryllis. “She can look into our dreams.”
#+end_quote

- Well Bethel keeps getting creepier.

#+begin_quote
  “Speak like that inside me again, and I'll kill you all.” She began ripping Tiff apart, limb by limb, moving with furious calm.
#+end_quote

- At some point, Joon needs to have a serious conversation with Bethel about the appropriateness of death threats in a functional relationship. They're treating it all as a joke when I feel this should really be more of a dealbreaker, given how easy killing seems to be for her.

#+begin_quote
  “So send Tiff a fucking letter then, asshole!” asked Reimer.
#+end_quote

- In retrospect, "Not checking up on your previous identity's relatives and telling them what happened" is a decision that makes perfect sense as a PC, and makes you look like a complete scumbag as a human being. Joon is essentially treating the Aerb version of his friends as completely disposable and not worth the time to interact with them. I mean, obviously there are opsec concerns there, and it's not like Joon has the free time to rebuild his relationship with them... but on the other hand, they're probably the people in Aerb most able to understand what Joon is going through, and they probably /do/ have intelligence that Mary could conceivably use.

#+begin_quote
  “You're weak,” Raven replied. “You were also impaired, but beyond that, you were weak. I'm not at the peak of my power anymore, and even then, the fight we had, it was like you were one of the enemies I sometimes had to deal with on my own, not trivial, but not strong. The kind that Uther could kill by the handful as a prelude to the real battle. The kind of enemy that I would fight one-on-one while the real battle was happening elsewhere.”
#+end_quote

- What the hells was Uther fighting by the end of his reign, and how the hells was he fighting them? Raven is making it sound like a succession of DBZ fights, but realistically, I'd expect these kind of fights to end much quicker than in DBZ, because whoever is stronger would likely be an order-of-magnitude stronger, and probably experienced and pragmatic enough to go for the throat from the get go.

#+begin_quote
  "Maybe he would have, if she hadn't tried so hard to force women on him."
#+end_quote

- That does sound a little odd. I mean, I can totally buy Uther wanting to stay faithful, but this feels a little bit forced. Plus it still feels like an un-fired Chekov's gun. Although maybe Zona just /really/ wanted him to be happy.

#+begin_quote
  There was something off about the wine we were drinking, and when we opened the keg ... I still have trouble with wine sometimes.”
#+end_quote

- For the record, I'm imagining a race of evil wine-spiders that lay magic eggs in wine that burrow in your veins and transform your body into a cocoon when you drink it.

- Wait, no, she was /drowned/ in the wine? What the... why?

#+begin_quote
  I took me a moment to realize that she was talking about Reimer, who had been toiling away in the other room. I got up, took one last look at Bethel's impassive face, then went to go join him.
#+end_quote

- I don't know why, I keep imagining Bethel as Moira from Overwatch. Probably the stern personality and affinity for murder.

#+begin_quote
  “I want more,” I said. “Everything that you can remember. Everything.”

  “I'd be here all night,” Reimer complained.
#+end_quote

- All things considered, Reimer is being a pretty good sport about this. The money probably helps, but he could probably poke a lot of holes in Joon's cover story if he didn't feel like playing along. I know if /my/ long-lost friend showed up, claimed to have amnesia, and instead of asking about our home life, wanted a complete description of our tabletop games... I'd probably be way more frustrated than Reimer.

#+begin_quote
  He'd been reticent to let them in, but Valencia had taken the reins, and from there, it hadn't taken her too much to get him to open up. My dad, the real one back on Earth, never opened up, except a few times when he was drunk. [...] After a search of his house, which he'd for some reason consented to, they had gone to my mom's house, which had produced nothing worthwhile, then over to speak with a few of the fake versions of my friends, none of which produced any fruit.
#+end_quote

- That seems surprisingly smooth. Nobody question an heavily armed squad coming in from nowhere and asking questions about Joon?

- The way Joon keeps insisting that Aerb's versions of his friends are fake is a little sad. I'm kind of hoping that we get so see them interact with the cast (especially Mary and Grak, since Fenn... well, she's dead).
