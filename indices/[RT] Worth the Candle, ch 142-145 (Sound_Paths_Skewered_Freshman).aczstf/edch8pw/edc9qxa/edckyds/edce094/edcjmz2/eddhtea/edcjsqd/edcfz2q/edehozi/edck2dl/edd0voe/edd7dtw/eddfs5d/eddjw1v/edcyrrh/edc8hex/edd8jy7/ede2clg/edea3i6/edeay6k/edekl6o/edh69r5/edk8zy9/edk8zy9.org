Yes, but the trolley problem isn't just about people being killed, it's about people being killed in a specific way and the listener having to make a choice about who dies. The intent is forcing a person to confront the dissonance between social morals that say "do not kill" vs the bystander effect vs utilitarianism. I don't see how wandering trolls have any such philosophical weight.
