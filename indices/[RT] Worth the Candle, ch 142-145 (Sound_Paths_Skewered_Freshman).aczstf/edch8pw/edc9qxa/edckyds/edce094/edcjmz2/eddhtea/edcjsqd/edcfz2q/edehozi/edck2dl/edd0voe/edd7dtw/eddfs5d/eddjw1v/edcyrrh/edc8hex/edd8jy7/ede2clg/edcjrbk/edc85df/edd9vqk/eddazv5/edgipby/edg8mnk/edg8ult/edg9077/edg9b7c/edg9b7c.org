The answer is no, it is not always like that. Not even mostly like that. In fact, it's pretty much confined to the earliest few chapters. Which, if you think about it, the first chapter is just about the least optimal chapter to be the worst chapter, because it turns off a bunch of people right out the gate. Thankfully it's short. Still, the author /really/ needs to correct it, and I think they might have for the ebook version.

All the same, the rest of it is still extremely enjoyable. I currently support the author on Patreon, that's how much I like it. The only other authors I support are D.D. Webb and Wildbow.
