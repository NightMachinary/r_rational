Crazy theory: maybe Earth!Juniper actually is fictional. The Dungeon Master witnessed Aerb!Juniper's bizarro rules system and decided it would be funny to alter reality to run on those rules; then he created an alternate personality for Aerb!Juniper so that he wouldn't have too much of an advantage when playing the game.

​

Consider: Juniper believes that, when he lived on Earth, his hometown was a city called "Bumblefuck, Kansas".

​

...Since we have clear evidence that Aerb is a simulation, and this could imply that Earth is a simulation as well, I'm not sure if it's actually meaningful to talk about "real" in this context. Still, though.
