For some reason this update feels shorter even though it doesn't have less words than previous ones. Was it the long wait (I know, I know, Christmas)? Or that we're again on the brink of Happeningsâ„¢? Next update can't come soon enough.

Incidentally, even though as far as I can count Raven was the 7th person to get the companion status, do you think that Fenn getting completely removed from the GUI means it's possible that we'll be picking up another companion here? If so, hopefully that's Reimer (or even Tiff) rather than Lisi as I'm with Reimer on her being kind of threatening and we already have Bethel to fill that role. Though I'm afraid that the No Longer Dice Guy would probably find it amusing to hoist a (excuse the weeb terms) kuudere vs. yandere tug of war on our dear Juniper.

Also, I do have another fanart, this time of our dearly departed Fenn back from her "meet cute (with zombies!)" routine. I'm not sure if I'm satisfied with it (I dun goof'd on the scars for one and it's generally not as nice as Mary turned out), but here you go none the less --- [[https://i.imgur.com/tHvt28k.jpg]].
