Great story as usual

I am a little confused about the beard and cleanliness thing. What's unclean about a beard? You wouldn't tell someone to shave their head to get over something because hair is unclean, seems strange to say it about a beard. Is there some cultural dwarf stuff I'm missing?

Edit: Also I love Reimar, munchkinning everything, being an honest dick. He's my favourite character
