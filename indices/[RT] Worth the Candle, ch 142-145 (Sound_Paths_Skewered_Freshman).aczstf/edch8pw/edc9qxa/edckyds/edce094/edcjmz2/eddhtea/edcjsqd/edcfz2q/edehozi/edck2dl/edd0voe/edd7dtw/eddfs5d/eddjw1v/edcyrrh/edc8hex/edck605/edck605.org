/Based on what we knew before/, Grak's whole section in 143 has pronoun-use problems, both on da nad own part and when da thinks about other dwarves like the police-folk. It's plausible that it's Juniper-as-Narrator being his usual chauvinistic self in his 3rd-person-omniscient insights into Grak's thoughts, or even that this is a /deliberate/ demonstration that Grak has internalised the Imperial perspective on the issue, given the other insights the chapter offers into Grak's self-image issues. But on the off-chance it's just an oversight, better to point it out than not.
