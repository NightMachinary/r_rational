Not sure if it's just me but the diacretic dotted ṇ doesn't show up on EPUB format on my phone.

  “And if I just pay the fees instead to skip all that?” I asked.

  “At least a month,” said the bursar, shaking his head.
#+end_quote

Couldn't make sense of this. Bursar seemed to be heavily implying that greasing his palms would make things faster. But the /donation/ line is a month, so the Special Returning line is definitely shorter. Assuming Joon is asking to combine the two, wouldn't it be shorter, not longer?

  “Did you bring any of your game stuff with to S&S?”

  “Me too,” replied the girl with a curt nod in my direction. She was keeping her eyes on our instructor, but she held out a dainty hand, and I shook it. “Is this your first?” she asked.

  “A tree with flowers,” she replied as she took my hand and shook it. “Lisi,” she said. Her hand was limp and a bit cold. “Are you?” she asked.
#+end_quote

Two handshakes.

  “Yeah, I did,” I said as I pushed out a set of double doors and into the midday light. “Didn't I say you'd be better off not getting involved in any of this?”

  “Like I was ever going to listen,” said Reimer. “You're trying to push me out of this like I'm some NPC.”
#+end_quote

Probably should be "Didn't you say you'd be better off..." / "Like I was ever going to [ignore this?]" since it was Reimer who said he didn't want to be involved.
