Late to the party, but is Magus Oberlin, the combat magic instructor from chapter 144, inspired by [[http://www.pathguy.com/]] ?

Clues:

- Pathguy is XYY, which is mentioned in chapter 145.
- Pathguy has a page about the buzz cut, which is specifically called out about the Magus
- Magus Oberlin's method is extremely matter of fact, as is Pathguy's
- Pathguy is super into worldbuilding and it's likely that the author has read his stuff. See [[http://www.pathguy.com/planes.html]]
