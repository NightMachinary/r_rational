The Wandering Inn is fantastic. It's nowhere even in the same zip code as being a rational fic, but it's incredibly evocative of various emotions---most notably awe and mystery. The writer just has a knack. It's kind of similar to WTC in that things /seem/ kind of cliche and inconsistent at first, but there are hidden depths to the worldbuilding.
