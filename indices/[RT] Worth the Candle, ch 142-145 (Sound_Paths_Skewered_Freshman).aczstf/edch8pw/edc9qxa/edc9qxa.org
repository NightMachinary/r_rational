Did you know that I have a subreddit, [[/r/alexanderwales]]? When /Worth the Candle/ inevitably ends, which will be sometime closer to now than to the heat death of the universe, that will probably be the place to talk about either other stuff that I've written, announcements for future stuff that I might write, or other stuff. Consider subscribing! Also, for a limited time only, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/alexanderwales/comments/aczz31/its_2019_ask_me_anything/?][ask me anything]].

Apologies for the long wait on this one, but it's 36K words, which is almost half a normal paperback novel, so I'm not /that/ sorry.

Thanks to all [[https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales][my patrons]], who have considerably increased my quality of life.
