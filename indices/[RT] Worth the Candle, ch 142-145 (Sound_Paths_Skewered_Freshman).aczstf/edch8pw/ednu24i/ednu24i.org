Can I just piggyback off your comment to rant and rave about how intelligent /Worth the Candle/ is?

For example, when they are discussing the Demonblooded Festival, Juniper remarks on the injustice of executing someone just because of how they were born, and Grak mentions that the Demonblooded is supposed to be a criminal. The second I read that, before I read the next paragraph, I was thinking "wait, that doesn't make any sense. Assuming this festival is held once a year, isn't it an astounding coincidence that they always have a condemned Demonblooded on hand for execution? How many Demonblooded are there in this city, and how many murders or whatever can they commit?" Then I read on and I was gratified to see Juniper echoes the exact same thoughts I had, because that's the /obvious/ thing for an intelligent man to wonder when he hears that.

Another example, when asked why she wants to become a combat mage, Lisi casually replies that it's her comparative advantage. She doesn't even have to explain the concept; Alexander Wales /expects/ his audience to be familiar with the idea of comparative advantage, or willing to research it, and he's justified in that assumption. And yet again when Oberlin mentions talking to Finch securely using one-time pads, without bothering to explain what they are or how they can provide secure communications in a society without computers.

You don't /see/ this shit outside of rational fiction and maybe hard science fiction (Greg Egan is the only professional author I can think of who writes like this). I'm guessing if you tried this with a professionally published work, some editor would slap you down and tell you to stop alienating normies. And for all I know he would be right, and a book without these things would sell better. But, dammit, I /want/ fiction aimed at people like me!

/Worth the Candle/ is smart fiction with smart characters written by a smart author for smart people. I can't tell you how /refreshing/ that is.
