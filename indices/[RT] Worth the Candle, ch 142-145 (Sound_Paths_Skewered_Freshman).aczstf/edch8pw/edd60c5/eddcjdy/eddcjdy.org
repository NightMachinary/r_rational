Publishers are slowly catching on to the potential of publishing webfiction in hard copies because it's a conservative industry. With american comics nowhere near as popular as manga, comparatively, publishers don't already have a habit of publishing cheaply made, niche works.

What /would/ need to happen for the english-language publishing business to thrive on publishing webfiction would be to drop the prices on both books and ebooks by quite a bit, reduce editorial oversight of YA books, and introduce more works targeting towards young boys (think shonen and younger seinen age), because young boys currently read at rates far less than girls. But in the english language market, Amazon's monthly kindle offering is already sort of the beacon for publishing polished webfiction, and with its exclusivity contract, publishers can't pick up books by authors on the platform, so they can't see the promise of webfiction because it'd already out of their reach, for the most part.
