I personally rather enjoy Metaworld Chronicles, it's not rational by any means, but it is rather fun, it's prose and grammar are its biggest fault, it is bad at perspective and can get somewhat confusing because of it, but it's a fun story, I might be biased a little as an Aussie, but the characters are charming and the world building very well executes, it comes across as much as an alternate history story as a self insert one, give it another shot, it isn't quite as blaringly bad as your first impression.
