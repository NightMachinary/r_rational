Can I take a moment to rant and rave about WTC for a bit?

I've been on this manga/isekai kick for around a year, searching for whatever scraps of escapism I could get. In my search for a Light Novel translation that I could stomach, somehow I ended up on [[/r/rational]].

"Huh. Worth the Candle: Self-Insert, LitRPG, Alternative Universe - Fantasy. On this weird subreddit about that one "what if Harry Potter made sense" fan fiction(eww) that gets posted as a reddit curiosity every quarter."

At this point I got blindsided by this fully loaded Australian road train of a story.

I don't even know where to start. I don't even have the dictionary to express the ways I enjoyed this web serial. I don't understand how a work of such scale and quality can exist in the first place, let alone patiently waiting around for someone to read it on some god-forsaken fanfiction archive without asking for money upfront.

There's the infinitely tessellated grid of Aerbs to get lost in, the complicated cast of companions following Joon, some frankly bizarre plotlines, the narrative dissecting itself and every other story I've ever seen, played or read along with it, the examination of what kind of person could actually enjoy getting Isekai'd, just quality fantasy schlock in general, transhumanist dreams and nightmares, the fact that there's seemingly no big bad to the story, apart from the story itself...

And that's just a fraction of what WTC has on offer. And then it's all kept in check by the [[/r/rational]] brand of magic sauce of "having the story make sense". I'm sold on the concept.

I don't know if I'm just showing how poorly read I am - and the fact that WTC takes time to explore this with Valencia sperging out over Harry Potter just makes my head spin - but this is special. Capital S life changing kind of Special.

Can I now think about anything that isn't this cursed text, please? It's been almost a month. Absolutely outstanding work.
