While I agree with this assessment in general, I find that The Wandering Inn, when it gets up a good head of steam, is just masterful at sweeping me up along in it. That's really the thing I look for in any sort of art or story.

Nothing's perfect and no story is going to have the same appeal for everyone. Is the prose the best? No. Could it use an editor? For Christ's sake, it's a story which often produces just shy of 40,000 words /per week./ That's batshit insane. Of course it could use an editor. But as a freeform work, I find it immensely enjoyable despite its flaws.
