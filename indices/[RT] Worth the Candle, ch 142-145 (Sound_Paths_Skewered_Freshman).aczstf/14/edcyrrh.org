so we got an ominous line during valencia's point of view: that she's tried to manipulate people before (implied: it went poorly). obvious allusion to fenn. she came off as somewhat addicted to using devils.

we also got a few more chekhovs. it is probable that juniper will eventually interact with fake tiff, fake other friends, fake parents, in descending order of likelihood. it also seems reasonable that the next arc after the athaenium will involve the penndraigs.

finally there was the thrown away line from the instructor about walking a path made by others. this is, of course, exactly what juniper is doing, so it could either be a reference to uther, a reference to the dm, or a new subplot.

i am still waiting for a dmpc reveal or similar. none of juniper's close companions have tried to stab him in the back yet; it's unlikely none of them ever will.
