oh yeah meant to include that. it reminded me heavily of something i can't place. had sort of a “he loved big brother” vibe but that's not it.

it's also an odd line to write, because grak's warding makes him an essential member of any team like juniper's, all the time. he is useful basically every chapter... but /narratively/ this often gets skated over. (they entered. grak set up wards. the others began talking while grak sat silently.)

i wonder if the author is deliberately highlighting a difference between normal usefulness (setting up wards) and narrative usefulness (advancing the plot by getting info). grak is keenly aware of what happens to narratively-irrelevant characters.

so it may mean more than just his declining mental health. i don't think it makes sense viewed through that lens, because if grak values himself only in terms of helping juniper, he knows his value lies far more in warding than in intelligence collection. in my opinion the line only makes sense narratively.
