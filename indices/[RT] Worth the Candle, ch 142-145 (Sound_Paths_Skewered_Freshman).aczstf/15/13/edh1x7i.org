me good -> my good

Also, the Grak quest update in chapter 106 doesn't use the dwarf pronouns, despite using them before and after that specific update, and the game layer seemingly always using them. (ctrl+f "when he's amassed")

Another long running goof is that Quest Complete and Quest Complete*d* are used arbitrarily throughout the story, too many chapters to list.

And finally, in what might be one of those issues only CRJ can fix, the quest "We're Going To Need Books, Lots of Books" was never completed despite the fact it really should have. I suggest completing it right after Raven gives the new date of the apocalypse in chapter 131 (ctrl+f one hundred twenty left) or at least mentioning its lack of completion somewhere.
