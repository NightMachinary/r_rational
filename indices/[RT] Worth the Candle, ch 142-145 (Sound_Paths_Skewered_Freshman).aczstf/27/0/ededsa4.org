Either he doesn't care because it's not a priority compared to the secrets of the universe (manual of his home game) or it's an extension of his attitude towards his past life. He doesn't want to know anything about his doppelganger's parallel life because of all those awkward interpersonal issues.

Though Joon's situation is really fun food for thought: if you were sent to a parallel alternate universe where you replaced "yourself," what would that be like? You meet your friends, whose mannerisms match perfectly but share a set of experiences just different enough that you're always aware of the transposition. Even without the falling-out and drama, I'm not sure if I'd ever be able to feign memory loss and integrate back into that uncanny valley.

Maybe Arthur went through a similar experience, at one remove. Unlike Joon, all the familiar faces and characters he met only resembled his past on the surface or metaphorically. I could see where he started treating everyone as NPCs, as -without the tug of a goal like Joon has with The Lost King- his whole life is a divine joke.
