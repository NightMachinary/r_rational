Time to let y'all know what we've been busy with over on *[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Worth_the_Candle_Wiki][the /Worth the Candle/ wiki]]*...

Summaries are complete for chapters 7-10, courtesy of Daniel111111222222 on the Discord: "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Twenty_Questions][Twenty Questions]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Diamond_and_Iron][Diamond and Iron]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Making_Magic][Making Magic]]", and "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Sewer_Rat][Sewer Rat]]".

[[/u/Makin-][u/Makin-]]'s been hard at work on pages for the story's main cast: [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Juniper%20Smith][Juniper Smith]], [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Amaryllis_Penndraig][Amaryllis Penndraig]], [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Fenn_Greenglass][Fenn Greenglass]], [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Grakhuil_Leadbraids][Grakhuil Leadbraids]], [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Oorang_Solace][Oorang Solace]] (and the [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Six-Eyed_Doe][Six-Eyed Doe]]), [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Valencia_the_Red][Valencia the Red]], [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Bethel][Bethel]], [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Pallida_Sade][Pallida Sade]], [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Raven_Masters][Raven Masters]], [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Arthur_Blum][Arthur Blum]] and the new friend.............. [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Lisianthus_Penndraig][LISI]].

He's also compiled a [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Skills][list of skills]], a [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_entads][list of entads]] and a [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline][timeline]].

Jaczac's contributed a page for [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Still_magic][still magic]], which is particularly relevant for this update, and one for the [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Anyblade][Anyblade]].

I've been occasionally throwing stuff onto the page for [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Earth][Earth]], which basically tries to collect everything Juniper's ever said about Earth and its locations in the story.

In terms of new templates, I've thrown together a couple of disambiguation notices to put at the top of future pages: [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Disambig2][Disambig2]] (for two similarly-named pages) and [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Disambig3][Disambig3]] (for when three or more might be confused). The new [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Flashback][Flashback]] template can be used to mark a character who only appeared in a flashback in a summary's cast page. Oh, and maybe check out [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Fanart][Category:Fanart]] - a place where I'm looking to collect any and all unofficial art that gets produced for the story.

Finally, I've also tried to give something of an overhaul to [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorthTheCandle][the TVTropes page]] for the story. /Worth the Candle/ should interest TVTropes users, but the story has very few crosswicks there and I can't imagine it gets much traffic from the site as things stand. If general wiki editing isn't your thing, but you know a few relevant tropes, maybe throw them up - and don't forget to link to the story from the trope pages themselves.

My thanks go out to everyone that's contributed over the last month, even just in the form of pulling out key information from the text for others. If you want to show your support for the story by helping out, just say hi in the wtc-wiki channel of the Discord server (linked at the end of the last chapter) - *no experience necessary.*
