  a species that could only tolerate about four hours of sunlight a day and fed on shadows in a form of reverse photosynthesis

- Wait, how does that happen? Do they get stronger when they're in a cave? Or do they need to be next to a light source projecting a strong shadow on them?

  “The Penndraig reforms were extensive,” said Ermaretor. [...] He meditated in the temple himself, and picked up an understanding of the art over the years, some of which he used, in his fashion, to revolutionize the field
#+end_quote

- I wonder how many students in the room are rolling their eyes and thinking "Ugh, another institution that thinks they're special because Uther revolutionized their entire reality and made them discover ways of doing things nobody had ever thought of. Give me a break."

#+begin_quote
  “I'm explain then,” said Ermaretor. “It would suffice to say that my signature on your papers is contingent upon a private meeting.”
#+end_quote

- I knew it! I knew they were all going to have their own little subquest before Joon can get the damn powerup! Soon he'll find himself chasing after a amulet to trade for a flying carpet to trade for the Dark Heliconia to trade for a book shipment to trade for the damn stamp.

  Amaryllis had been poring over the notes that Reimer had left, [...] but I was a little leery of that, especially since it wasn't clear how much the two systems might have diverged from each other. Reimer's notes indicated that the system got constant updates and revisions, sometimes without any actual notice.
#+end_quote

- Seems defeatist. Even if the info isn't perfect, it's probably more accurate than what they have.

  and a criios girl hooked up to a tank, presumably to keep her temperature down.
#+end_quote

- And now I want a side-story about the Criios' lives, culture and civilization.

  She looked vaguely familiar to me, though I couldn't place her;

- Subplot alert! Subplot alert! Abort mission, abort mission!

  M. Leister joked that he wasn't going to bombard us with a whole bunch of equations and terms we'd have to memorize on our first day, but it felt like that was what he was doing anyway.
#+end_quote

- Yup, that's college all right.

#+begin_quote
  His voice was sharp and loud, and didn't seem to be carried by any sort of magic. It was a smaller room, but still, that was a little bit intimidating.
#+end_quote

- I like that description. Like, the guy doesn't /need/ party tricks to be heard. Very military-like.

- I'm getting a very strong "HPMoR Quirrell" vibe from his "gun speech". Also, I love how he just casually shows a highly illegal weapon to his students in his introductory course. That guy doesn't fuck around.

- Also, I really like the implication that the vast majority of students came here for a self-defense class or just for academic credits and end up studying next to the kind of people who say "I've killed people before and I will probably have to do it again in the course of my job".

#+begin_quote
  To my surprise, Lisi raised her hand too, not casually, but like she was straining to make sure it was noticed.
#+end_quote

- She /does/ have a Hermionne Granger vibe (except evil). Oh my, we really /are/ doing the Harry Potter arc.

#+begin_quote
  If you are a combat mage, you will likely be working for either the Third Empire or one of its member polities at the behest of Sound and Silence. That employment often comes with political and mission constraints, which might limit lethality. To give one example, hostage taking has been an effective aspect of warfare since the dawn of time. More insidiously, sometimes the powers-that-be wish to limit casualties because of how it would appear to the public, even if that requires risking a mage's life.
#+end_quote

- Oh wow. I don't know if this is because Anglecynn is a seriously militaristic country, because combat mages are special forces and expected to act like it, or just because he personally had a rough career, but this guy /doesn't fuck around/. I'm a little intimidated. I mean, what about regular police operations? There's a large range of situation where overwhelming force is useful but you don't necessarily want to kill your targets, right?

#+begin_quote
  “And I'm, what, some unconnected person who you know is clean?” I asked. Gods, how many times had I used that line as a DM?
#+end_quote

- Ooh, that's a good one. I'll be sure to steal it.

- Also, careful, you're getting native with the swearing here.

#+begin_quote
  Oberlin gave me a skeptical look. “No,” he said. “Are you the kind of idealist that thinks soul mages aren't out there, manipulating things as best they can from beneath the screenings that the Third Empire does? Do you think the Third Empire doesn't have tame soul mages of its own to rip their way through captured prisoners?”
#+end_quote

- Oh my god, I love this guy.

#+begin_quote
  “Like I was ever going to listen,” said Reimer. “You're trying to push me out of this like I'm some NPC.”
#+end_quote

- I mean, PCs are the guys who have to double-check every conversation they have at the grocery shop to make sure they're not about to get ambushed and murder. Are you sure you've thought this through.

#+begin_quote
  "It's a trite Utherian observation that everyone is the hero of their own story"
#+end_quote

- I love these worldbuilding bits. They feel so... digested. Like the world is made of a consistent culture, that has been exposed to the worldbuilding for centuries, and developed it own relation to it, including philosophy and litterature and clichés that everybody's tired of.

#+begin_quote
  The first concrete action that the Second Empire took was to topple the troll kings and institute leadership of their own, administrators who would oversee what was only barely a government and institute the particular type of planned economy that was in vogue at the time. They dealt with the inevitable problems that follow from that sort of thing, which the Second Empire would become well-acquainted with over the years, dissident populations, asymmetric warfare, worker strikes, and the general problems that come with governance by force rather than governance by consent
#+end_quote

- In general, I love the concept of the Second Empire, and it's definitely something I'm going to steal in future fantasy stories. It's not especially original (evil empire with general Nazi parallels), but the execution feels like something I've never seen elsewhere (except a little bit in /Shadows of the Limelight/). The Empire isn't just evil, it's broken, and that broken-ness defines everything it does, how it operates, how it fails to operates, and how entire civilizations saw themselves even centuries after its destruction.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe I should have mentioned this before, but our instructor was demonblooded.
#+end_quote

- What /is/ the demonblooded's deal? I mean, obviously, people who have an ancestor who's a demon, but how does that even happen? How shitty is their parent's life? I honestly pretty curious.

#+begin_quote
  Most of you aren't here because you really want to be. [...] This course is required for anyone going into combat or biological tracks, and for many, it will seem like a burden. [...] You will be transformed such that the ethical mode of thought is your default.”
#+end_quote

- I can /taste/ the sound of students thinking "Okay, that's cool and all, but is any of this going to be in the exam?"

#+begin_quote
  Less obviously, the solution was to teach people to be ethical, which was to be done early in the education process for people who were going to find themselves in a fair bit of power. I couldn't tell whether this was laughably idealistic thinking, or simple virtue signaling, but I was leaning toward the latter.

  “The class is mandatory, as I mentioned,” she replied with a shake of her head. “There are some significant pressures in place for instructors not to outright fail someone, and the class sizes are large enough that what I'm attempting to do, which is to shape minds, can't really be done effectively.”
#+end_quote

- Yup, that's college.

#+begin_quote
  If you'd like, I can give you some outside instruction
#+end_quote

- I really hope Juniper ends up talking to her and Professor Quirrell again. Maybe set up mail correspondence. They're really cool and interesting so far.

#+begin_quote
  The rhannu reproduced via mitosis, like cells did. When that happened, each would get a portion of the skills and memories of the original, and my guess was that this worked via the soul somehow. They would die if they didn't split every thirty or forty years, and each half had to spend some time building back up into a whole person again, mostly mentally rather than physically. Now that she mentioned it, I could clearly see how Sound and Silence might have to have some kind of provision for her species.
#+end_quote

- Wow wow wow, they reproduce by multiplying? How old is that species? Because unless a lot of them die before reproducing, I'm surprised the world isn't covered in them.

  “Perhaps storming across campus to confront him was a mistake,” replied the masked woman with a monotone that I couldn't help but think was a little sarcastic.
#+end_quote

- These people are way out of their depth. They're acting like they know what's going on, but it's pretty clear they just student syndicate representatives and they were clearly expecting a "my dad bribed the headmaster" situation, not an undercover imperial agent.
