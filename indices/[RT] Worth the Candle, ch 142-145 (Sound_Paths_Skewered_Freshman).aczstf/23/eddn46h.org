  had taken the extradimensional glove with her as well

It's not the same Sable without Fenn. 🙁

Then:

  “Never call an athenaeum a university,” said Amaryllis.
#+end_quote

Now:

#+begin_quote
  “Don't call the athenaeum a college,” said Amaryllis.
#+end_quote

Soon? "Don't call the athenaeum. No contact in any way."

  Raven: “Grak wanted to go visit, and Solace said she would accompany them.”
#+end_quote

Raven's pronoun approach.

  I looked at her, seeing the look on her face as she explained things. “Mary, are you ... offering exposition about me?”
#+end_quote

I'm laughing.

  Quest Updated: They Say You Can't Go Home Again - He had a life, before you came, one with parallels to your own. The man you met is not Reimer. The girl you will meet is not Tiff. But they're close enough, for our purposes.
#+end_quote

Which is weird, because, e.g. we already have Raven, so... Maddie???

[ETA: and it's already covered in this update, a bit]

If there's a Maddie/anti-Maddie particle reaction I'm not sure what face I'm going to make.

  everything the gold mages had done to his people
#+end_quote

Oh?

But then...

#+begin_quote
  The gold hadn't ended up staying in Darili Irid
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  “Or the demongraphics, if you prefer.”
#+end_quote

😊 Amaryllis did ask for better jokes.

  I'm an endling, last of my kind.
