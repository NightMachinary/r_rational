Well, in a more general sense, actual Nazis are also this. “Final solution” not originally meaning “extermination” is one example, but also, well... nationalism (in the sense of “states should be built around nations”, like a certain modern democracy that shall not be named) being /the/ idea of the new age, every European intellectual thinking eugenics is the hottest idea ever 'til they actually tried it (/cf./ communism, not in the US-politics sense, but in the original one), generally researchers doing what they thought best with the same abandon they always had but now with state resources and direction (thankfully Heisenberg was shit at project planning, but Sakharov still had to learn the lesson the hard way later, and Teller never did). Nuremberg looking long and hard at the 19th-century idea that allegiance to your country is in itself a virtue and deciding to raze it and salt the ashes was also a big, big change at the time (still is for some in the US, or at least so it looks from the outside). Nazi leaders don't fall into this pattern, and I wouldn't call it the main one, but it's certainly there.
