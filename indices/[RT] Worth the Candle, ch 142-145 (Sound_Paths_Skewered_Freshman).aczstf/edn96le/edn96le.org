Alas, I'm late to the party. A few thoughts of my own:

- What if one sidequest is Joon reconciling with all of his friends - each has a substantial slice of his quests? It would be worthwhile to ask if Aumann was a quest for them, et cetera. That would make for a surreal experience for fake-friends, as their fantasies become reality in a strange way.
- I always wondered what the DM said to Joon. I guess we know one of them now: most likely, that Joon got an offer to be taken out of his world and placed in a simpler one without the hells and grimdark of his current world. Less likely, but the last two redactions become obvious now too

  “I'll do it,” I said. “Can I ... what happens to me, when I leave Earth? I'd like to leave a note or something.” /If I was really here, was Earth even real?/ “I don't want to hurt anyone.”

  “An alternate Juniper from another world takes your place,” he replied.

  “Oh,” I replied. “Okay, I guess that works. Unless I win and become God?”

  “Then you can do whatever you want, if you feel like it,” he replied.

  “And that's the whole deal?” I asked. “I go through to this place, Aerb, I play the part of a hero, I fix everything there forever, if I can, and in return ... I don't have to worry about Earth?”

- What if Joon decides that he wants to go home and make amends, and the final boss is other-joon who has been questing back at home? Winner gets to go home, loser is dead. This doesn't make a ton of sense, since there's less questing to do on earth, and Arthur is a better final boss, but it's also a fun idea.
- On another note, the combination of the Void and Sable has not been adequately explored. If the void effect goes through "six inches of flesh and bone, half an inch of steel, or five hundred feet of air", then you can apply directionality to the void effect by simply wrapping it in a cube of steel at least 1.1 inches on a side (well, only the base is flat, the other sides can be a sphere to save on mass). Remove a cone from this cube to define the direction in which the void propogation will happen, and design the object so that it triggers instantly upon being exposed to light. Activate them in an extremely dark place, with known orientation, and suck them all up with sable. The next time you're in trouble, and OK with an indiscriminate destruction, unleash a bunch of those puppies in the direction of your foe. You can now stand in one place, your allies all behind you, and blow away your enemy with ease. Unleashing several at once would allow you to destroy the intervening air before it can be sucked in from the sides-this would improve range.

  - I'm sure that all of this will raise the ire of the Void Beast
