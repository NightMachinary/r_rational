I just think it reads awkwardly. There's currently a note at the end of ch 137 which reads:

#+begin_quote
  Special note: If you'd like a version of this first half of this chapter which uses non-gendered Groglir pronouns, it's available here. This is more true to Grak's internal understanding of da-self, but it gets in the way of the story (in my opinion).
#+end_quote

And then links to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16690513][this]], which is the first half of that chapter, from Grak's POV, with Groglir pronouns. I haven't really found any solutions that I like for the problem (and I've tested all the obvious ones, like writing around it, using singular they, etc.). Probably means that Grak will get fewer POVs in the future, because it's going to bug people no matter what.
