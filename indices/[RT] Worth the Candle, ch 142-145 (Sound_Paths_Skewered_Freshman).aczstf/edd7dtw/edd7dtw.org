Am I the only one who got the feeling we are about to see a WtC send up of Harry Potter when we had a scene with 3 students in a school for wizards suddenly forming a friend group (MC, girl and boy), and a combat magic class while a teacher gives a speech that had a certain number of parallels to Quirrel's intro from HPMOR?

Likely just a coincidence or nod given the style of WtC isn't generally to reference things like that for plotlines, but Harry Potter IS already relevant to the story and it would definitely be entertaining in a Juniper-exasperated-by-the-game-world way...
