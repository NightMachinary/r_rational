I think that's the joke. Without knowing /ex ante/ what the virtues are going to be for any given skill, who would ever actually dedicate time to Woodworking in a game/world where you need fighting and magic to get anything worthwhile done? Same thing for Accounting, as mentioned in the chapter, and probably several other seemingly useless skills.
