Lisi feels like Amaryllis' nerdier sister. I assume they even studied together at some point, if Amaryllis spent 5 years there. Lisi seems to be further along already, so maybe that 6 std means she's actually smarter than Mary?

I'm noting that the power scaling of Blood Magic feels pretty weak. Mary's quite smart and 5 years only left her with a finger flame and enhanced punch. Maybe the scaling of practical use is quicker once you slog past the theory?
