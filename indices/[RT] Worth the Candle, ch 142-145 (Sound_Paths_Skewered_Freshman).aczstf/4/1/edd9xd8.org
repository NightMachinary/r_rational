He's been /living/ in his fantasy world, having an adventure, almost as therapy so that he can slowly process the shit that was wrong in his life. This quest asks him to talk with people who look like everyone he cared about, about things approximately equivalent to the shit he did.

Maybe he'd be able to handle it if he'd leveled SOC a bit more? I definitely think confronting it will be a good thing, but he still can't just go back to his doppelganger's home town; the world's ending like a dozen different ways and there's a lot of exclusion zones to dungeon crawl through.
