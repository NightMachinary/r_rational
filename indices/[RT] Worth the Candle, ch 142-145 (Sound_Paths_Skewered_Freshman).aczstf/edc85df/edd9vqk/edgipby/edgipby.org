TWI does the variety/slice of life thing very well, it's got a wide range of mostly likable and interesting characters doing different things in ways that often rebound off each other.

But the quality of the prose and moment-to-moment plotting is...not great. It's super tropey, in particular the constant "I can't believe [main character] is so amazingly [good/strong/unusual but charming]" kind of grates on me.
