Trust me, I had the same reaction. I thought it was gonna be cheap dime-store isekai genre schlock. Needs a hard edit, that first chapter does. But it was mostly done in an experimental sort of style/narrative voice that isn't in the rest of the story. Stick with it for a few more chapters and you'll see what I mean.

I mean, in fairness, I also gave the hard side-eye to the premise and first few chapters of Worth the Candle, and I sure as hell don't regret withholding judgement for a while on that one either.
