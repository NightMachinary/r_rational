Odds are good that you are working under the normal definition of interesting, and not the mathematical one. The mathematical one is basically "I can make a statement about this" because really very few number are interesting to any sane person.

So, if you started taking all the "patterns" that do not provide full coverage of the number spectrum some numbers get hit more than others, and some will simply be missed. The ones that are missed were considered "Boring numbers". which is just "Numbers that do not show up on any other lists". But, one you make a list of numbers that are not on a list, those numbers are now on a list, which causes a lot of nerds to get excited because it has a "mathematical paradox" in a very niche group.
