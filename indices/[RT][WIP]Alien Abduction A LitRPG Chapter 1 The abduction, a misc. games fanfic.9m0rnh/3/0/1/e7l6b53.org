That's a good explanation, and it exposes a little plot hole. Mathematically interesting isn't the same thing as "interesting enough to justify investigation", so there's no reason for the dalek to prioritize it over other worthy pursuits. I would have found the story more amusing if the dalek had said "Correct, that is ineresting" and continued killing.
