I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel like I was calling you dumb for not getting a reference. Perhaps it would have been better for me to say that if you were familiar with the source material, it was far more likely that you would recognize the character's beliefs than that you would recognize her name.

Having said that, you do need to relax. You managed to turn a general comment into a personal attack on you, which was not at all the intention of my comment. You're being over-sensitive about this.

And yes, it's Kreia. Nerra backwards is Arren, and there's a fan-theory that Arren Kae, the mother of the Handmaiden, is in fact Kreia herself.

EDIT: I wasn't familiar with the Star Wars Rebels plot, though. Do you happen to know which episode it was?

EDIT 2: Gosh, I wonder who downvoted me. /s
