I mean, I think I figured out it with some Wookieepedia searches, but I want to take this moment to engage in an unrelated and likely unproductive rant.

Your comment represents everything I hate about [[/r/rational]] - perhaps it wasn't your intention, but it very strongly reads as a self-aggrandizing and boasting account of your knowledge, while also belittling those who do not have it, while at the same time not actually including the answer to your "riddle". Despite not at all recognizing the character initially, I in theory fall under the froup of "anybody who would recognize the character", due to having played KOTOR II, and yet I didn't realize that's who that was until after investigating.

For posterity, I'm fairly certain the holocron is of Kreia, aka Darth Traya, which would make sense given the similar plot at the time in Star Wars Rebels
