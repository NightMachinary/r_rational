You don't have [entire] control over this.

  you brake safely because you were already driving slowly in case someone darted out from between two cars.

No, you weren't. A person can dart out arbitrarily close to you. There is no speed at which you can drive that ensures you can stop before hitting a person that darts out. 10mph is "too fast", and cars in that situation are expected to drive 20-30mph in regular conditions.
