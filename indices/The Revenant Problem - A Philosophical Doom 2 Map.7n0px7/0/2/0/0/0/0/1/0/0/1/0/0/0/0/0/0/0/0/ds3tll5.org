I have to agree with you here. The absolutely key point is "could not have avoided it by taking other actions before."

A lot of conversation I've heard along these lines seems to presuppose that the car was driving in an unsafe manner beforehand. Your vehicle won't ever get impatient when it's driving itself, so why would it not have realized that some event has occurred which will limit its ability to react and acted to reduce the danger ahead of time?

It only seems to make sense if a human drove recklessly for some time then randomly remanded control to the autopilot seconds before some untenable situation.

Just like I learned in Driver's Ed anyway, the answer is almost always to hit the brakes. Reducing the amount of energy in the system as quickly as possible will reduce the amount of damage done to every party involved.
