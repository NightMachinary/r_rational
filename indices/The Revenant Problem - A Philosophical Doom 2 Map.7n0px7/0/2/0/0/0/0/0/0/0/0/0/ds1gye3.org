If it can't avoid the child by changing lanes, /and there is a trolley problem situation/, there is only one lane going each way and thus no passing traffic. If there are two lanes then it has all along been ensuring that it is not driving next to another vehicle and thus it is safe to change lanes.

If there are cars passing it in the face of oncoming traffic it will already have pulled over to let them pass until the traffic is clear. This might annoy some human drivers, but (a) it's less annoying than being behind a school bus, and (b) by the time AV are sophisticated enough to being /even potentially/ able to do something useful with a "howmanypeoplewillIkill()" function there will be very few remaining human drivers.

Coming up with a situation where a sufficiently advanced AV would potentially have to evaluate a "howmanypeoplewillIkill()" function is really really hard, and probably involves deliberate malfeasance by a human. virtually all realistic cases for /properly programmed advanced AVs/ the only rational option for black-swan events is "brakeasfastaspossible()".
