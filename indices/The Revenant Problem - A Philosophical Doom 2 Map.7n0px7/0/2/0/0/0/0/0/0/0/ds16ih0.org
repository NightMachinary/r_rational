If the sidewalk is occluded (say by parked cars) so it could not be expected to have already been tracking pedestrians before it ran onto the street (and thus slowed down as soon as it became aware of them), and the car is driving too fast to safely stop when the child runs out into the road, and there is enough oncoming traffic that it would not be able to safely swerve into the oncoming lane, then /it was driving too fast for the street/. It should have been driving slowly enough that it could stop safely for any pedestrian that might dart out from a location it was not able to observe.

This is not a trolley problem (even if there's a 90 year old man dying of cancer on a bicycle that it would hit if it had to swerve to avoid the child), this is a negligence on the part of the manufacturer problem.

I mean even if you force it into a classic trolley problem situation, it should have slowed down when the old man was detected. He might fall off his bike into the path of the autonomous vehicle!

Yes, this means narrow parking streets and other byways with limited visibility would effectively limit AV to about 5MPH. /That's OK./
