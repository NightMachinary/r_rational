  No, you weren't. A person can dart out arbitrarily close to you. There is no speed at which you can drive that ensures you can stop before hitting a person that darts out. 10mph is "too fast", and cars in that situation are expected to drive 20-30mph in regular conditions.

Probably 5 MPH, car-park speed. Slow enough that a collision is unlikely to cause injury. /Properly programmed/ AV should generally avoid situations like that and route around them, except for the "final stretch" where they mosey on in.
