No, it is because the self driving car solution to "I am in a bad situation that might kill someone" is almost always going to be "hit the breaks, and stop the car as fast as possible".

And if your software ever "thinks" that it is in a bad situation where the solution is NOT "hit the breaks", then your software is almost certainly wrong, and is in some sort of false positive situation.

Emergency car response is a problem of looking for horses, not zebras. And in this kind of situation, programming in a zebra detection algorithm will almost certainly cause more deaths than it saves in 99% of situations.
