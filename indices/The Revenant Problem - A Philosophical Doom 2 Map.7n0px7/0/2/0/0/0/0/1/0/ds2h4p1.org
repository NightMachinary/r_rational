??!?!?

Do you realize that situations where a vehicle is physically unable to stop before colliding with something are entirely normal? Not /common/, but in no way ignorable. The most obvious example if if there is a collision in front of you, putting vehicles (or other objects) that you could already see into positions or with velocities that you couldn't have predicted based on what you could see. Then there's the possibility of the brakes going out. Or a person falls out of a vehicle ahead of you in traffic. Or...

These are situations that /seem/ impossibly rare to any individual driver or car, but happen /every day/ if you consider every car on the road.
