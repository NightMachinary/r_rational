They aren't ignorable. What I am saying is, that even in those situations, the solution 99% of the time is 'still' hit the breaks. And if you try to do something fancy that is not "hit the breaks and slow down as fast as possible" you are will probably just increase the chance of something bad happening.

Complexity kills. It leads to false positives.

Or better yet, don't get in those situations to begin with. IE, if it is possible for you to crash into something that you didn't see, then the car is moving to fast to begin with.

It should not be normal to ever be in a situation where the car can't slow down fast enough. Just never drive dangerously like that.

If the collision if front of you means that you can't slow down in time, then the car hasn't given enough space. If there is a blind spot, go slowly around the blindspot.
