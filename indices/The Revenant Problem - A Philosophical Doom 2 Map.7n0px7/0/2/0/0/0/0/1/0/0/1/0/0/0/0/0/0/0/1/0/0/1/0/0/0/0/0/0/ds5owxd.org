If more than a tiny fraction of their commute is down residential parking streets, sucks for them. I don't think that's going to be an issue for most people. Most people spend most of their commute at least on multi-lane surface streets, or dual carriageways and limited access freeways and tollways... and those are so easy for AV that even Tesla's misnamed "Autopilot" can handle them.

The main pitch for self driving cars, though, is not "saving time", it's "not wasting the time you spend on your commute". You can read, work, watch TV, and pretty soon you're not caring so much how long it takes.
