Ahh. I was imagining it (from the article) in the form of it being a given that one would be one the track, but not knowing which track beforehand, thus shifting direct self-interest into more generalised self-interest which could be seen as a more utilitarian/ethical decision process.

If you're instead comparing the state of 'choosing a switch while on an unknown track' to 'choosing a switch while not on a track', then being on a track could be argued to be pushing people to sacrifice their own ethical system in favor of self-interest (which here has similar results to utilitarianism, even if the chooser would not normally espouse a utilitarian ethical system).

...now I'm thinking again about the relationship between 'willing to die rather than harm others' and 'willing to stain one's own hands with blood in order to save others from harm'... a matter of what one protects, whether it's one's life (kill rather than die), others, others including oneself, or one's own pride/self-image/conscience...

For the rich/poor, I'm particularly thinking of quoted cases where richer people have said 'Well, if /I/ were born poor then I would just (easily/efficiently) climb my way up by making use of {lots of things requiring foreknowledge of their existence which one would in practice never have the opportunity to even know about the existence of}'. The person thinks that life is nothing but toil for those on their track, and feather-beds for those on another track, so out of self-interest wanting to make them about equal, by improving their own and worsening the other, even if they haven't guessed that they're actually just improving things for themselves.

...or for a non-wealth instance, certain groups said to think that they're underprivileged while others are overprivileged (despite objective observations by the majority strongly suggesting the exact opposite) trying to make the tracks equal by adding privileged to the 'underprivileged' actually-overprivileged track and stripping privilege from the 'overprivileged' actually-underprivileged track... (and again running into the issues/conflicts of what different 'final-state ideal world's look like according to the valuer.)
