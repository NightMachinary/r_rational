The '[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance][Veil of Ignorance]]' concept mentioned sounds curious.

If you poll people when they have established social positions, then even if you temporarily shroud their self-knowledge, they will be left with the self-serving prejudices (for their own group and against the other groups) that are inextricably(?) tied up in their understanding of social systems.

If you erase enough of their understanding of social systems such that they don't have prejudices, or likewise poll them (as high-fluid-intelligence low-crystallised-intelligence minds as though created-from-scratch AIs, rather than nearly-thought-incapable newborns of embryos) before they've lived/studied/learned and gathered knowledge/understanding about social systems, what capability do they have to make meaningful choices between options presented to them?

This seems to suggest a need for a means to either break through (and destroy) already-formed prejudices, to prevent the formation of prejudices while learning, or ideally both. After that, a veil of ignorance would be helpful in preventing people from deliberately making immoral choices for personal benefit, in contrast with making thought-to-be moral choices which are for personal benefit.

(An example that comes most quickly to mind is an actually-rich person who feels that financial support make poor people lazy and unproductive, or an actually-poor person who feels that keeping any money over certain thresholds would make rich people lazy and unproductive... though I'm leery of mentioning any examples at all, both due to (the risk of prompting an irrelevant digression) and (my own acknowledged unfamiliarity with the issues actually involved in any such example).)

...Hmm, that is to say, I'm questioning how many self-serving votes are people deliberately making unjust choices (addressable by a veil of ignorance) and how many are them making sincere choices from the perspective of a biased worldview. Though it does sound as though a veil of ignorance would only help, rather than harm (other than the specific instances of 'harm' that the voter afterwards realises they themself agreed to).

...beyond that, the concept of an analysis method that everyone can get behind... or, if not utility-function-equalising, at least accurate models of outcomes... though then we have the interesting issue of if, say, high-income people tended to end up deontological ('to watch as someone starves is tragic, to steal to prevent starvation is sin') and low-income people utilitarian ('a stolen loaf of bread to prevent starvation better than an extra loaf of bread held by one who has plenty'). Without people's ethical systems themselves being changeable, can people reach policy consensus? What new information(?), distinct from self-interest, could convince people with disparate ethical systems to unify them?

[[https://smbc-comics.com/comic/evil-ethics][Something that I sometimes ruminate on.]] ...Come to think of it, I think I've been using the term 'utility function' even when contrasting utilitarianism with other ethical systems, so I think I need a better phrase. Particularly, is there something one can call goal-directed-behaviour within an (arbitrary(/arbitrarily-designatable)) ethical framework?
