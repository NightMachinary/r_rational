It is so unlikely that you are far more likely to be in a situation that is a false positive than you are actually in a real "trolley problem" scenario.

Like, the case that the other poster in this thread put forward, with someone falling out of a car in front of you and the only alternatives are to run them over or sideswipe the vehicle next to you.

First of all, identifying a human that is not upright is a hard problem. The thing that fell out of the car may be a laundry bag or a dog or it's actually a lost tire from the car in front of them.

Second, You're in heavy enough traffic that your ongoing efforts to avoid getting boxed in have failed. Sideswiping the vehicle next to you is almost certainly going to involve several other cars.

Third, you're in heavy enough traffic so the vehicle behind you is probably going to run over the obstruction anyway.

So - high false positive rate, and poor odds for a positive solution. Put cases in there to sideswipe cars to avoid running over people on the road and you're likely to /cause/ more accidents and loss of life than if you just teach it to brake and hope.
