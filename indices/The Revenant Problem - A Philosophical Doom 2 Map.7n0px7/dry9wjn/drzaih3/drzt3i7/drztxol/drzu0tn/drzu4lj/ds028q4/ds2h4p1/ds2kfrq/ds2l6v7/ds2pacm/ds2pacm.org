  Unfortunately our society has agreed that driving a certain degree of dangerously is not only acceptable but necessary.
#+end_quote

For humans, because humans actively seek a level of risk that "feels safe". AV do not have this bug.

#+begin_quote
  Consider the case of the car ahead of you experiencing a head-on collision, such that it stops instantly. Always leaving enough room for this unlikely situation will halve the throughput of a road/highway, which we won't tolerate.
#+end_quote

There are better alternatives to this, for example proper car spacing means that the AV is /always/ able to switch to an open lane in the case of an incident ahead because it's /never/ driving next to another vehicle. And in the absence of human drivers head-on collisions become black swan events.

And, again, we're not just talking about collisions, we're talking about situations where the an incident occurs too quickly to avoid, without any lead-in, /and/ safely changing lanes is not an option, /and/ braking would cause a greater loss of life than an unsafe swerve, /and/ it's plausible that the moral and ethical calculations are still potentially something an AV can be expected to know. /AND/ there is no possibility of false positives.

That's what it takes for "the trolley problem" to be relevant. It's ludicrous. You haven't even /tried/ to come up with a situation that fits.
