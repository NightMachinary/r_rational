I've seen videos of what AIs "see" and even humans standing upright flicker in and out of "visibility". A human lying on the road would likely be treated as an obstruction.

If you are in a four lane boulevard you change lanes safely because you were already ensuring that there was no vehicle next to you. If you are in a two lane road, you swerve into the shoulder. If you're in a two lane road with parked cars, you brake safely because you were already driving slowly in case someone darted out from between two cars.

If Waymo is not following this protocol, they will after a few accidents, just as Tesla has had to add restrictions to their advanced cruise control. The only reason reason for an AV to drive anything but extremely conservatively is marketing, and that's not good enough for the law.
