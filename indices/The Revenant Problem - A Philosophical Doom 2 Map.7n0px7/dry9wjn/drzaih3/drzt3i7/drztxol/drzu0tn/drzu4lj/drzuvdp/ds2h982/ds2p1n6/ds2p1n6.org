Most situations where a collision happens in front of you, you theoretically have the ability to avoid it if you're totally aware and on task. AV will do that, and even current partially autonomous vehicles have demonstrated this ability.

And, again, we're not talking about "are AV immune to crashes", we're talking about "do AV have to have the ability to solve the trolley problem". We're not talking about just being involved in a collision, we're talking about ones where the incident requires the AV to make a decision about who to injure or kill.

My claim is that the probability of a situation that is /so out of control/ that there are no safe actions that don't involve injury, but the AV is enough in control to meaningfully make such a decision, is so low that any resources spent on it are better spent on preventing the situation in the first place.

In addition, as [[/u/stale2000]] pointed out, attempts to force some kind of "trolley problem handler" are much more likely to suffer from false positives. You suggested that it might save three lives a year? I doubt it would do that well /across the whole AV population/, let alone a single vehicle, and false triggers would cause more loss of life than that.
