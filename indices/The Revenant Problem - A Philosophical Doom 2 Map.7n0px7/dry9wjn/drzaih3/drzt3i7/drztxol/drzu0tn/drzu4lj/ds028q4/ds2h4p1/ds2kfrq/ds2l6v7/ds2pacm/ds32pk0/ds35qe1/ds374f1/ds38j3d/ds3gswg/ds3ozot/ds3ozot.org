  Waymo hasn't disclosed how much territory its cars will cover or what kind of hours they will run, whether it will charge passengers for rides, or the timeline for announcing or figuring out any of that.

  Starting in Arizona lets Waymo dodge some of these questions, at least for now. The weather is good, the roads aren't too crazy or complicated

I've been to Phoenix. The city is a pure grid, except for one monolith-like mountain, and the residential areas all have wide streets, little or no street parking, and large yards that are not conducive to small children playing on them because they're all rocks and cactuses. The grid makes routing around schools and play areas trivial.

They picked a whole city that's "safe streets" and they're not disclosing how much of the city they're allowing the vehicles to use. They also don't mention how fast they're going to drive in obstructed areas.

The idea that they're not pre-selecting the range of the cars to avoid dodgy areas is ludicrous.
