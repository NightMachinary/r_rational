Even assuming the AV recognizes the obstacle as a human, the probability of the rare situation where /two/ asshole humans decide to box you in /at the exact moment/ someone "falls out of a car"* in front of you /and/ there is light enough traffic that the car behind you isn't going to run them over anyway, is basically so close to zero that it's ignorable. It's a black swan, or as [[/u/stale2000]] called it, a zebra. Any code that's designed to deal with situations like this is more likely to cause crashes through false positives than save lives.

EVERY actual "trolley problem" scenario anyone has EVER presented me is just total bullshit like this.

^{* And how often does /that/ happen? I've been driving for 35 years and I've yet to encounter it}
