I did not suggest "brake instantly in a dangerous situation". Where did you even get that from? We're talking about a /specific/ situation where there is an obstruction on the road ahead (that the omniscient creator of the scenario has declared is a human) and you are boxed in so you can't steer around it. The person who created the situation was trying to create a situation where the trolley problem applies. I'm saying that in any such situation, where options other than "brake as fast as you can safely" are going to lead to a collision, then "brake as fast as you can safely" is the right thing to do even if that may still lead to a collision.

Obviously in any actual situation the AV will automatically be working to ensure they're not boxed in, because they /can/ safely switch lanes in situations that would be risky for a human. That's why he added the restriction that my hypothetical AV couldn't do that by specifying that it was boxed in.

If you don't like the scenario, that's fine, neither do I. Why don't you try and come up with a better one?
