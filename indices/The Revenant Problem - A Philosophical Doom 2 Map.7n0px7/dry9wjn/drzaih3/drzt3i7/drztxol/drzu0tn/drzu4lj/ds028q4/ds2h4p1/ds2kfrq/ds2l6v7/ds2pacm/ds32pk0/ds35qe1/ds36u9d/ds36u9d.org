  We're talking about a world where the cars themselves have the potential capability of making moral judgements about the worth of potential victims. That's decades in the future. It's certainly not going to happen in my lifetime.

It's happening /right now/. Watch any of the publicly released tech talks on Google's self driving cars, which can identify pedestrians as a separate class of obstacle from cyclists, trees, cars, etc. Those cars /already/ have to decide whether to go straight and hit two pedestrians or swerve and hit one cyclist; they just aren't very good at it yet.

Self driving cars /today/ are smarter than most people think they will be 10-20 years from now. They are already safer than humans in clear weather. This is an industry where the state of the art is advancing so fast that it's years to decades ahead of where normal people think it is.
