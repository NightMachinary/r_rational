This whole discussion is about /a problem that doesn't exist/.

We're talking about the /trolley problem/. We're talking about a world where the cars themselves have the potential capability of making moral judgements about the worth of potential victims. That's decades in the future. It's certainly not going to happen in my lifetime.

Obviously while human drivers are common AV will be limited to things like limited access highways, low-speed pedestrian plazas, major streets without parking, and other places where it's plausible to predict what the fuck those crazy meatbags will do.
