  It should not be normal to ever be in a situation where the car can't slow down fast enough. Just never drive dangerously like that.

  If the collision if front of you means that you can't slow down in time, then the car hasn't given enough space.

Unfortunately our society has agreed that driving a certain degree of dangerously is not only acceptable but necessary.

Drivers, and self driving cars, are trained to follow at a safe distance assuming the car ahead might hit its brakes.

Consider the case of the car ahead of you experiencing a head-on collision, such that it stops instantly. Always leaving enough room for this unlikely situation will halve the throughput of a road/highway, which we won't tolerate.
