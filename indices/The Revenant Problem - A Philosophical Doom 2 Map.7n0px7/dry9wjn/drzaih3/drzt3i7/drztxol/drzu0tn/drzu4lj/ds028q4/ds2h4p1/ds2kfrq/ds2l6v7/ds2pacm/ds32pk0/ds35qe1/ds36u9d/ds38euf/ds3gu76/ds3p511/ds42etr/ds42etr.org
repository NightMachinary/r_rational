Clear lane ahead of you. Cars to your left and right, and to the left and right ahead of you. A human falls out of one of the cars ahead of you into traffic. Do you hit that human, or do you swerve into an adjacent car? Of course^{*} you start braking immediately regardless, but you're still going to hit the human if you don't swerve.

^{* actually you might not brake if you're going to swerve. That's a complicated question. Let's just assume you do.}
