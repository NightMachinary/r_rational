There's an interesting minor philosophical thought experiment in it, but it has been so overdone that people are jamming it in places where it has absolutely no applicability, to the point that it has basically no pedagogical use left.

The only people who still care about it are the people who are so defensive about philosophy they're creating a veil of ignorance where you pretend you don't know if you've heard of the trolley problem before or not, and the people who are so stupid they think a Tesla should have a literal "howmanypeoplewillIkill()" function in it.
