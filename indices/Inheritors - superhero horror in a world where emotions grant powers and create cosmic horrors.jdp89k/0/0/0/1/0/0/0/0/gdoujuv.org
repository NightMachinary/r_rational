So I think the way you described worm, while being accurate, is a bit of a stretch, in the same way that describing the avengers as 'a giant steals a magic necklace from a wizard' is accurate but doesn't really point in the right direction.

all the stuff you said about interdimensional horrors is cosmic horror, but the meat and bones of worm is superhero drama, and that is where most of the fic spends its time, with super powered people doing stuff and having feelings.

in my mind cosmic horror is, yes, about interdimensional beings that don't relate strongly to what we understand to be life, though i think it is even more about searing enigmas and unknowable truths that drive people insane, but more than that it is about the horror aesthetic communicated through writing, which I have a hard time describing but outside of the cosmic horror genre I would relate it to the tone of the novel 'the haunting of hill house'

but i'm no expert, i'm not looking to get real deep into this, i just thought i should try to flesh out my point a bit
