Well, even in that case, most of the agents, especially the Titans from /Ward/ would apply. I mean, an entire extradimensional space that cracks into reality, from which spawn gigantic figures often with eyes everywhere but where they should be is definitely an "eldritch" demeanor, as are characters like Crawler and Cryptid.

But cosmic horror is more than just tentacles, old books, and people in robes, at least IMHO.
