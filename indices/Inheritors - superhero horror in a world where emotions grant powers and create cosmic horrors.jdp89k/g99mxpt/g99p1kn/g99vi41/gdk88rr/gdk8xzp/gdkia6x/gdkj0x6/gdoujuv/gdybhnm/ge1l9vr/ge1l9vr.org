Man, I really wish I liked wildbows writing more than i do. I got through a decent portion of worm, the last stuff i remember is a bank robbery or maybe one of those giants attacking and flooding a city, but reading it always felt kind of like work. From what I've gleaned about the deeper plot from comments on here it does sound cool.
