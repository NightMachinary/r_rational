The genre's not *horror*, no matter how much grotesque pregnancy stuff occasionally appears, nor how true it is that there are inhuman entities largely beyond our power. Different works can share common elements and be entirely different things depending on how those elements are used.

And the cosmically mighty space worms just aren't used the same way they would be, in, e.g., Lovecraft, nor to achieve disgust, horror, terror, fear, revulsion, alienation, isolation, dread of the unknown or unknowable, or anything adjacent. That's just not what Worm is about, as an experience or thematically or in a big picture narrative level. As Taylor says, it wasn't ever about [the space worm], it was always about /us/.
