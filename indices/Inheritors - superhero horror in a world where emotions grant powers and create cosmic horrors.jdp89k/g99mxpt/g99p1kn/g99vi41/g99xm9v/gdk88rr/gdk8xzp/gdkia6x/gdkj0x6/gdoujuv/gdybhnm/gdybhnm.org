Well, to be fair, I only stated that specifically the agents (or as the person I responded to described them, "the invisible space brain worms"), "a major element of the setting," are classic cosmic horror.

I never said that the entire story was. Mostly it's a rational, morally gray, and increasingly grim superhero story -- but one with a cosmic horror background setting that comes to the fore on a handful of occasions.
