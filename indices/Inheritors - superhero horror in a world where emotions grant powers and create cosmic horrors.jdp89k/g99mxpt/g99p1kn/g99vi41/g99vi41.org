I mean, that's kind of a major element of the setting, and it's classic comic horror. Extra-dimensional beings go about their inhuman design, largely uninterested in the insignificant lives that crawl about the Earth. When they take interest to further their designs, it is through the lens of madness and trauma, and their regard varies between indifference and malice, with rare exceptions. Humanity is largely powerless to do anything about it except to try to use the scraps of power that fall of their table to turn against its origins.

If people dressed up in robes instead of spandex and if more people than the Fallen had a worshipful attitude that was less "KKK faux-Christianity," it'd be more obvious, but the trappings of the superhero genre obscure it.
