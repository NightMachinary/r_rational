Yeah, I don't think that any plan for having a secret organization that starts with "First, we give all the people in the organization a set sign/countersign method that they all use and recognize together without variation such that anyone who learns it could successfully impersonate a member of the organization." seems good. One wonders what the purpose of such recognitions would be - the more people each individual knows in the org, the more they can betray if they are a traitor from their initial recruit or later become compromised.

Basically, any particular set shibboleth for the entire group is likely to be more problematic than it's worth, IMO.

If you were really dedicated to this idea of having to have a set piece of ID, which I think is not a positive approach, one thing not mentioned elsewhere in these comments is that in the modern day world you could probably seriously write software to use modern cell-phones wi-fi comm features to make a handshaking software specific to your society that is provably secure to most things; in this day and age two or more people in the same crowded room glancing at their smartphones seems unlikely to specifically attract attention. It would be basically impossible to have this method triggered by accident, but it would leave physical evidence on your phone that might be detectable if you don't have the whole thing encrypted (though if people are taking apart your cell phone drive they might very well apply lead-pipe decryption methods to your person, of course).
