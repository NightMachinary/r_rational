I read once where they use Morse code and a ring. Twirl the ring clockwise for dots and counterclockwise for dashes, have a short ID phrase to spell out. Easy enough to disguise as a nervous habit, and needs no special equipment beyond any common ring. It could still be eavesdropped, if somebody is aware it's a communication method, but it can also be used to send more complex messages discretely.
