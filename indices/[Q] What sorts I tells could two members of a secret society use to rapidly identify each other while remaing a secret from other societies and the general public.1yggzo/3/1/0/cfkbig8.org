Call it preliminary ID then. I signal you one letter, you reply with the correct counter letter, we each know the other is at least possibly a member. You can then move to a more secure area for further identification before discussing anything important. Do it while having a completely innocent conversation about something entirely unrelated. In the story it was used in just such a way for a wide spread, compartmentalized group.
