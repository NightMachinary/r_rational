Pretty good, but not fast enough. Each letter of the alphabet would be around two or three turns, which means spelling out a set of initials or something would take well over six or even seven seconds while still being discreet (would look a little suspicious to have a guy twisting his ring really fast, and could even harm the agent).

Maybe plain secret hand signals are best.
