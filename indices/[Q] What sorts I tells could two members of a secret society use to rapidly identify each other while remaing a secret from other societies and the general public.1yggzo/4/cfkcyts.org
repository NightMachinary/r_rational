Have two separate tells, each which can contain a short "message"; the passcode is gotten by XORing them.

Some kind of design that can be assembled but it takes time/information; a specific colour-combination of clothes, a faked birthmark from makup.

Behaviors that can be turned on and of instantly but you can ell when someone who's trying to mimic them doesn't have much practice. An accent, a pace of walking, or a facial expression.

Non-literal and padded passphrases; not telling a specific joke, but any joke on a specific subject followed by any joke on another specific subject. Or simply take the first letter of each noun.
