It doesn't have to be obvious at all. It's unusual to hold total eye contact with someone, you tend to break and look to the side relatively frequently. It would be easy to work a simple code into an introduction such as blink - look down - blink - look back - hold - look left - look back - hold - blink twice. If you actually watch people they do do all this stuff. The only difficulty is learning to perform and recognise the code accurately.
