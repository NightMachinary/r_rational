Make an argument containing a single, subtle complex logical flaw and several correct complex arguments and emotional red flags. Use a different argument each time. Only someone possessing the /actual skill/ of ignoring emotional red flags and zeroing in on the one mistaken part of the complex argument will be able to object to the correct part of your statement, identifying them as a co-conspirator. Likewise only a conspirator would be able to construct a complex multi-part argument containing exactly one real flaw.
