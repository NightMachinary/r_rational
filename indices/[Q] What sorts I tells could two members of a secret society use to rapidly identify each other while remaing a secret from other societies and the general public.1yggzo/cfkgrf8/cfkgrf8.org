There's no need to reinvent the wheel. Just look at what Freemasons did for years when the Catholic church made it illegal, or back after the Lindbergh baby was kidnapped and crazy people were blaming it on Freemasons and people didn't feel like they could be as open as they are now. "Do you like to travel?" "Every month." My wife has a little dog about this high." "Oh? How do you spell its name?" "No, I've talked enough, you begin, how's life treating you?" Call and response -- they're things that normal people would say to each other, but the responses and the pattern of the conversation and what's asked next along with casual hand gestures made at the same time make it obvious what's going on to someone who knows, while appearing perfectly innocent to someone who doesn't know.

There is no "rapid" identification, however, unless you go with some sort of fairly obvious thing, like a red ribbon pinned to a hat during the French revolution or something like that. Even then, you run the risk of someone thinking that it looks fashionable and copying it, so you're going to have to maintain some sort of call and response check just to see if the obvious signal really is signaling what you think it's signaling.

Usually, throughout history, when you have an obvious signal for quick identification, it's fairly well known among "certain people" and some of those certain people who feel opposite may choose to wear an opposing signal, like a blue ribbon, for instance.
