I think most of the things mentioned so far haven't been particularly discreet. Off the top of my head I would go for a call and response involving specific sequences of blinking and looking side-to-side / up and down. To observe this you'd have to have direct line of sight to a person's eyes - so to observe the whole exchange you'd need multiple vantage points, or to be right next to them. It's also pretty subtle, people blink and look around all the time.
