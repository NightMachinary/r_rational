See if you can talk your way into a corporate boardroom. Looking to the side in a personal conversation between two "high-social" individuals means that you basically acknowledge the other person as socially superior, unless you're deliberately breaking eye contact because your peripheral vision saw something that you want to call attention to. You don't have to look directly at the eyes, you can look around at a person's face, but you can't look off to the side, or away from their face, especially frequently -- the social rules say that this means you're politely saying that the conversation is uninteresting or otherwise isn't holding your full concentration for whatever reason. :)
