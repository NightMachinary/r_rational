Emergency coms. Suppose Agent X is not yet outed, but believes he is under suspicion, and cut off from his usual contacts Agent W and Agent Y. If he has a way to identify Agent Q, who is somewhere in the general population, but not known to him, X can secure the assistance of Agent Q, and through him Agents P and R.

If placed under duress, Agent X can only ID Agents W and Y, and an ID signal, or if your group is smart, a FAKE id signal that lets Agent Q know that X is compromised without revealing the ID of X, or Q. Then the loss of X can be passed through the entire org structure using normal coms.
