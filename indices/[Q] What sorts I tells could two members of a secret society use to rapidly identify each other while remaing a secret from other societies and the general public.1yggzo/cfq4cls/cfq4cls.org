Three layer multi system identification. First is appearance. Have three or four tells. Blue necklace silver ring on left middle finger (and only that finger on that hand). Hold your right hand so your thumb is under the middle and pointer finger, causing those two fingers to be offset. (In case you are undercover or have lost your other identifying marks) A symbol displayed, pin, necklace, ring, tattoo, shirt, whatever.

Second is verbal. Question and answer.

Q: I like your hair. A The left side is a little long. Q: I'm looking for a nearby restaurant, any suggestions? A: I'm not hungry right now, sorry. Q: what time is it? A: what is your name?

The third is a code based on names. Say "my name is X," and they respond with "my name is Y, nice to meet you."

X=mark, Y=Edward. X= Timmy, Y=Lamont. Etc etc.
