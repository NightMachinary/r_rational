Have a physical object that keys into a codeword generation algorithm. As a simple example, we will both wear a special lapel pin that is either red, green, or blue. When you meet me, you say a two word phrase. The first word starts with R, G, or B (matching the color of my lapel pin) and the second word starts with R, G, or B and matches the color of +my+ your lapel pin.

Therefor you need to both have a special object and know the method of code generation - simply eavesdropping won't work, because I can change the color of my lapel pin at will.
