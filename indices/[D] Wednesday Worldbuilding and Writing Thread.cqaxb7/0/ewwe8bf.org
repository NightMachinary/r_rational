repost from last week's thread because i timed it wrong and posted on friday and as a result i only got one reply ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/cn6yfq/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_and_writing_thread/eww5y3c/][which was, granted, amazingly well-thought-out]]).

--------------

hi yall, i'm writing a crossover fanfic between [[https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Worm_Wiki][wildbow's worm]] and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Earth]['long earth' series by pratchett and baxter]]. i'm posting here to harness the collective intelligence of this subreddit for two things:

- *brainstorming:* what are the short and medium term economic, political, and social consequences of parallel universes (the vast majority uninhabited, but some inhabited, but separated by long distances) being accessible by ordinary people, and how can different rational agents (corporate and government) adapt to this new landscape? who are the winners and losers? (i've been exhaustively thinking through this for the past month and i'll list the most important things i've thought of just to get the ball rolling).

- 'long earth' canon is really, really vague in some areas (i will discuss these below). *my scientific and technical knowledge is limited and i'm not sure how to fill in the gaps in a way that's both specific and narratively satisfying.*

*the background:*

- in the long earth, 'steppers' are lightweight held-held boxes that can be assembled from components you can find in any electronic hobbyist store. they require a potato or a tuber as a power source.

- they move the user in one of two directions (east and west) into a parallel universe. nearby universes are identical except modern humans (and their close relatives) never evolved.

- special constraints: *1.* in order to use a stepper, you need to have been involved in the final stage of the assembly of a stepper (any stepper, not necessarily the one you're using. it's basically just twisting some wires around, nothing too hard). *2.* you cannot move iron (iron compounds like haemoglobin can be moved, but not alloys, etc. - /this is an area of vagueness/) between worlds. *3.* their use causes very intense, debilitating nausea that lasts for about five minutes - multiple uses in succession make it much worse (there is an effective rate-limit on their use). *4.* clothes and things you carry are moved across, but not just anything you happen to be in contact with, but you can step two people across sometimes - /this is another area of vagueness/. *5* you can't step into a solid object - air is okay, i don't know if water is.

- about one in a thousand people can step without a stepper (natural steppers). they don't experience any nausea and can step at a rate of around once every 3 seconds. conversely, for about one in ten people, stepping is lethal (phobics).

in worm's canon, we're made aware of two earths: earth bet (the main setting) and earth aleph.

- earth aleph is nearly identical to our world. earth bet isn't, because it diverged from ours around 1982, and the butterfly effect has created several big differences (for instance, in earth bet, china is the 'chinese imperial union' and is ruled by an emperor. different administrations, different borders, and so on.)

- aleph is generally preferable to bet (it's richer, has less parahumans/supervillains, and doesn't have cataclysmic terror-monsters - have a look through worm's wiki if you're interested in the specifics).

- if you're born before 1982, there will be a copy of you.

- earth aleph is located in the 'centre' of the multiverse, earth bet is located on east 27. as a general rule, it takes 4.5 minutes for a natural stepper to go from A to B, and maybe a good part of a day for a normal person. the schematics for building steppers became public in 2016, the current year is 2020.

- there are other inhabited universes further away, but the closest is east 1013 and kinda impractical to visit. it's very weird and probably implausible and diverged in the late 1930s. if anyone is interested in it, i'll sketch it out in another comment and history nerds can help me either steelman it or tear it to shreds (i don't mind).

- stepper schematics were uploaded to the internet in early 2015, the current year is 2020.

what are the...

- economic implications

- political implications

- religious, social, religious, legal, technological etc. implications?

of having two similar parallel worlds within reach of one another, that would intersect with the general story (outlined below)?

--------------

*so, here's what i've thought of*. i might be completely off the mark, so you may not want to read it to avoid polluting your own thinking. i would recommend thinking things through beforehand and then reading what i've written.

*implications i've thought about*

- obvious stuff, but stuff that still opens up a lot of questions.

1. *safe areas are no longer safe.* you can step east, walk a while, step west, and end up in fort knox, or the white house. therefore: movement of valuables underground for protection, increased security costs for protecting adjacent worlds, location secrecy has a higher priority. in the short term, crime, terrorism, and prison breakouts jump. it's harder to keep people in prison once they're in there, and harder to arrest people.

2. *land and mineral prices collapse.* farmers tend to their fields in universes adjacent to them. there's some depopulation, but the only people who move to live in an uninhabited universe permanently are generally people who are okay with not using any technology with iron in it forming the first wave. i.e are you okay with being a hunter-gatherer? the second wave would be in the process of unfolding right now, as basic infrastructure gets set up in uninhabited universes & they become more desirable (especially in population-dense areas in third-world nations). there's probably a long-term decrease in inter-ethnic and inter-religious conflict, following a short-term burst.

3. *muddled property & criminal law, difficulty collecting taxes, bureaucratic headbutting, and competing organisational jurisdictions hobble governments and other administrative entities.* supply-chains for the very general and widespread electronic components used to build steppers are probably too global for national governments to prevent people from building steppers entirely.

- preventing movement of people and goods becomes very difficult to enforce in practice - so that has implications for border controls, drug trafficking, and so on. my thought are that the dynamic would be something like: governments and corporations would initially nearly bankrupt themselves trying to dramatically scale up and gain a first-mover advantage, and then over time would begin to delegate and decentralise to local organisations & operations - mafia-type groups who enforce property lines and collect taxes, roving white supremacist groups who patrol borders, etc.. interdimensional regulatory agencies would emerge but bet-aleph cooperation would still be in its nascent stages after five years - there would likely be police cooperation and information-sharing, i think.

stuff that isn't immediately obvious:

- i've assumed that some corporate lawyers found loopholes in aleph and bet's merger laws, and that there is nothing stopping 'identical' corporations operating in bet & aleph (say, general motors) from merging. *so, there's an initial glut of intellectual property since bet and aleph won't have invented exactly the same things, and a burst of innovation from technological synergies.* i imagine the winners would be tertiary-sector / infotech companies that can effectively leverage operational synergies whose business models are based around intangible goods, or in general benefit more from economies of scale. heavy industry, and fixed capital-heavy 'immobile' industry loses out (i think).

- there's probably going to be some currency fuckery happening as well. if my gut sense is right, there'll probably be a trend of convergence over time as more people find areas for arbitrage and the market self-corrects.

maybe this is too open-ended but there are creative people here who have very deep and domain-specific knowledge, what do you think would happen?

for the vague areas i talked about, what do you think would work in a narrative sense?

--------------

/the following isn't strictly necessary to read/

this is really, really general question, so i'll narrow the search-space to things that would shape the narrative if it helps (i don't mind if it's relevant or not, though): in the fic, the main character (taylor hebert) lives on earth bet, in brockton bay (a hollowed-out, high-crime, post-industrial city in the north-west united states - at least, it was before the invention of steppers, i don't know how the city would change in response).

she works at a convenience store owned by her aunt that mainly now services people who step regularly. she gains a 'tinker' power focused on body self-modification using the creation of advanced interdimensional technology from mundane components (not the main focus here, i think i'll do a future thread), one invention she makes allows her to step at a supranormal rate - up to twenty times a second.

she moonlights at a 'grey logistics' company (a kind of black market amazon, transporting anonymous [probably illegal] goods and data from A to B).

eventually she falls on the wrong side of the law, has her arm twisted, and agrees to set off on an eastward voyage by airship (sponsored by both aleph and bet) with other parahumans. there are a multiplicity of interests behind the mission broadly is: symbolic force-projection, making diplomatic contact with inhabited worlds, cataloguing worlds and gathering knowledge before anyone else can, and finding trading opportunities. the original long earth got boring & i'm trying to create a more compelling narrative.
