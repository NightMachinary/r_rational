I recommend that you read the worm fanfic called Amelia, it tackles some of the political issues with multiple dimensions.

I think that the safety against steppers are going to be somewhat silly. You essentially just hang a ton of transparent soft plastic pieces within any room you want to secure. Any material that is considered solid but is soft or bendy enough to only be a minor nuisance can be used. That said I do think that there'll be change to the justice system and I imagine that the death penalty or a continency measure will have to be implemented(i.e. a collar that inject something if it doesn't receive signal from a localized transmitter).

The terrorism is fairly political so I'm spoilering it: Terrorism is a non-issue. According to ADL out of the 387 people that were killed by extremists in 2017 only 3% were Islamic, the rest were left or right wing extremists. And frankly when more people die of autoerotic asphyxiation, it's really not worth the attention it's getting and is an obvious votemilking by politicians and powergrap by government.

The prompt says that people can only bring what they are carrying but your prompt about food and mineral prices seems to imply that people can bring across significant quantities in containers that aren't iron. Assuming that moving mass quantities isn't an issue I would expect that our world becomes much cleaner as we dump all our waste, including nuclear waste, unto other worlds.

Expect a plummet in people without work as companies will be looking to hire people to explore new dimensions/ harvest useful minerals. Expect the stock market to crash due to unexpectant loss of mass money, having ripple effects that may or may not be mitigated by new economy. Expect wars to happen as countries start fighting over territory.
