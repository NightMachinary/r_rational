Is there any Lobsang equivalent? I assume the voyage Taylor goes on is sponsored by a Black corporation equivalent? Just curious, the twains are pretty influential on the Long Earth setting.

Also, have you read the entire Long Earth series? Don't want to spoil anything.

I would expect additional Shaker triggers and more powers that function like Nilbog's where they encourage the user to develop their own territory. I'm also curious if the entities planned or expected this. If they didn't, I'd expect some really funky stepping based powers.

The Simurgh would probably step. Don't know about the other Endbringers, also probably depends on what Eidolon does. Maybe they'd go mostly dormant if he feels sufficiently challenged.

Oh, and Aleph would probably start getting more and better powers because of an increase in conflict and conflict diversity, unless the entities specifically didn't want to as an experiment.
