What consequences do you imagine from the following prompt: Classical fantasy gameish world suddenly get 'invaded' by players from our world who consider their world to be a video game? Assume that players grow in power faster than natives, respawn if killed, and can log out.

I imagine that the powers that be will realize that players should be catered to early to foster loyalty, that players make excellent scouts since they respawn and can log out to ask other players on gameboards about information. You can't punish players in the traditional sense since they respawn, so punishment largely consist of long term containment. I am uncertain whether we would see any significant numbers of players in armies, yes players are powerful but also unreliable. I also imagine that players would be willing to take quests for cheaper than usual because for many players it's less about the monetary reward and more about the XP/adventure.

My predictions following that is that you see a rapid decrease for natives in jobs related to escort, gathering resources in high risk areas, killing entities. I imagine that you would see some decrease within the guard and a shift towards a bounty hunter system. Since players aren't that reliable you might also see adventuring guilds popping up to work as a central for players to find tasks. You would see a lot of secrets come to the surface due to offline sharing. You would see religious justifications to why players go back to life.

As a result of that I imagine that you would see groupings of resentment towards players due to the loss of jobs. You would also see a decrease in monster/human population as players usually murder a ton of shit very quickly.
