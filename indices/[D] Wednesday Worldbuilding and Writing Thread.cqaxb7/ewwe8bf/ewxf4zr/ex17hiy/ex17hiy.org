There's a character in Naruto who has special eyes. They let him see anyone else's techniques and instantly and perfectly copy them. This got me thinking; what if this concept was expanded to encompass nearly the entirety of an entire magic system?

Instead of finding the Golden Rod of Truth, now you see someone spewing Golden Truth Rods out of their eyeballs and can suddenly do the same. Not to the same instant degree as in the example, but the principle holds. Of course, letting others duplicate magic by seeing it would just lead to a utopia in short order, and we can't have that. There needs to be an incentive for everyone to jealously hoard magic. Given that, I'm thinking there will be three types of memetic locks.

Type 1---Cantrips\\
Operates on the /monkey see, monkey do/ principle. Small, minor magics like the equivalent of a mage hand or conjuring a bit of flame. One could even spread knowledge of cantrips by describing them in sufficient detail in a book.

Type 2---Hidden Component\\
Like with cantrips, seeing a spell that requires a hidden component or having it described in detail is necessary, but there's also something else needed for casting. Maybe it eats a drop of blood from your body with each use, or it requires a certain emotional state to cast, or you have to use it when you /know/ you're about to die. Once you know that second, hidden requirement, the memetic lock is open.

Type 3---Interdict of Merlin\\
As in HPMOR, this memetic lock isn't just in knowing it can be done, but in being given /permission/ by someone who already knows. Not explicit permission, mind you; just being told face to face how the spell works will do it. Many mages have tried to get past this requirement, but magic itself has some level of sapience and foils every attempt.

To make things a bit more interesting, someone can also bind a spell to an inanimate object. It's not an enchantment, but the actual ability to cast the spell. This is technically a sacrificial ritual and thus dark magic since anyone who does this can no longer relearn that same spell, ever. Since the object isn't (normally) a living mind, it can't teach anyone anything under this world's version of the Interdict even if they know exactly how to perform the spell.
