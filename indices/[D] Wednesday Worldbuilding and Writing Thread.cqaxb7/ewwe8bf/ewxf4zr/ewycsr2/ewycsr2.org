If there aren't many players, the powers that be might try to set players up with native party members that can keep them sympathetic to their native sponsor and pointed at their sponsor's enemies.

The powers might come to realise the importance of novelty in motivating the players. How do you make defeating yet another bandit group interesting enough for immortals that can go elsewhere if they get bored? What can you do to ensure massacres grow stale for a rampaging murderer?

Does a development team exist, and if so, what will their role be?

It might also be worth thinking about the equilibrium situation that would develop once the truth of the situation gets out, especially the economics:

If a script is developed to allow the natives to access the internet, possibly via an idle player, they can perform Mechanical Turk jobs and trade in intellectual property between their worlds, in addition to providing tourism. Is there an in-game store that can be used to convert currency from our world into theirs?

Depending on the 'realism' of the world, there might be an uplift situation of innovations from Earth being adopted. One export could be the results of clinical trials performed on players, who can respawn safely. If game mechanics or fantasy magic mean that development beyond Earth is possible, the world's main export could instead be the results of supercomputation.
