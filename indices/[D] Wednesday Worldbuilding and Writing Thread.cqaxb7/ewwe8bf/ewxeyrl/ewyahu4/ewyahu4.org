Have you read Ward, the Worm sequel? Interdimensional portals feature more heavily than in Worm.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bkm1pn/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/emhx2i0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][This thread]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bgvpq8/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_and_writing_thread/elo9q2x?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][this thread]] discuss very similar scenarios. In particular, how do steppers interact with moving reference frames?

Carrying cargo between dimensions is a job with extremely minimal requirements, and this job can't be automated. I think this would have a significant impact on unemployment and the minimum wage, and in turn on the crime rate and gang situation.

Because of the economics of steppers, I think the Dockworker's Union will be ascendant in this situation by providing a population of vetted employees to use the steppers. Becoming a de facto stepper's union seems likely, too. How will this affect Danny, and his relationship with Taylor? He would have a better excuse for throwing himself into his work following Annette's death and he'd be able to achieve significant successes there. Perhaps this would increase his alienation with Taylor, hence her working with her aunt instead?

If it only takes a day for an ordinary person with a stepper to get from Bet to Aleph, that's a lot easier than most refugee journeys. Perhaps the main flows of people would be from Bet to Aleph rather than between different countries in Bet.

In terms of cape culture, steppers would have a big effect on the unwritten rules and the idea of cops and robbers. Having a fourth spatial direction to attack from makes defending even harder, so capes might come down harder on those who attack off-limits targets. This also means that breakouts from prisons would be easier, so perhaps captivity would fall out of favour as a punishment and be replaced by unmasking, tracking anklets, tattooing with details of the crime, and other penalties that can't be stepped away from.

Steppers make it easy to escape a losing situation. Each step, you've got a 50% chance to lose your pursuer if you choose randomly between up and down. With sequences of steps, it becomes like the probability of two random walks intercepting. Containment foam would probably not have nearly the same prominence, or at least it would be used in conjunction with a method to disable steppers.

The PRT might add an additional rating specifically for stepping capabilities, or perhaps fold it in under Mover. Cape teams would have to keep in mind the need for countermeasures to stepping, such as members on the natural side of the stepping scale for pursuit, tools to disable the electronics or tag the opponents for subsequent tracking, or choosing locations where the environment on either side prevents stepping away.

The Endbringers would likely lose some of their impact due to the existence of steppers causing the population to become more dispersed between different Earths, as well as people evacuating more easily with steppers during Endbringer fights. What about if the Endbringers exist on every dimension at once, so they'd be in the same place making the same motions on every world? That would make the fights unique, as steppers become much less relevant, as well as providing a clue to their incredible durability.
