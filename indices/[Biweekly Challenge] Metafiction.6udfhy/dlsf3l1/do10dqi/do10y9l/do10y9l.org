I think you got most of the points.

What I would add is that beyond "making difficult things easier to plan for", Hronar actively improves his situation in ever-more munchkin-esque ways, which leads him to the current situation in which he lives in a more modern and luxurious way. He declines to describe that journey to his associate, calling it a long story.

Though I've never put this in the text, and you're therefore free to disbelieve this, "word of god" on that journey would be that Hronar fully escapes his Bronze Age Fantasy reality by using his meta-knowledge to make the plot more and more meta. Think about it: If the story becomes about his knowledge about stories, there has to be some sort of climactic achievement regarding knowledge about stories, and him escaping reality fits the bill, especially if he arranges for subtle foreshadowing to that end.

But where is he /now/? Well, I imagine he is in some place where others have ended up through similar journeys (which is why the guy he's talking to expects his story to contain him realizing it's a story). So I'd say that although the story doesn't state it, the other man is a fellow meta-aware protagonist of another story.

For the record, I don't think that it's a good idea to leave so much unsaid in the story, yet declare it canon, but I never really took /Hronar/ too seriously. I wanted to poke a bit of fun at the concept of a rationalfic by making the classic barbarian hero, perhaps the most unintellectual of fantasy stereotypes, an absurd munchkin.

Thank you for reading, I didn't think that people would check in on such an old challenge :)
