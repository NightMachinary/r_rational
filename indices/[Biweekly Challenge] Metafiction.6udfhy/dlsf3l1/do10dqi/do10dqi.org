I tried and this is what I understood: Hronar is, obviously, a rationalist, talking to a man (another storyteller, perhaps a non-rational one).

Up until he goes to the temple, he's being a rational player but one unaware of being in a (real-life) story.

The book of poetry spurs him on to read and then write fiction, which helps him predict his own story and make difficult things easier to plan for.

Any corrections?

My questions:\\
Is there any significance or symbolism behind the character of the other man? Is he an Elder God or something, who is wondering how Hronar has been as successful as he is?
