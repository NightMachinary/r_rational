Heh. I bet Tolstoy didn't think that we'd be reading him after so many years either... I enjoyed the story, and thank you for pointing out the munchkinry; I skipped over it without realizing the importance of it... It's easy to forget that its the small things that lead to bigger things being possible - like being able to Google better gets you better reading material and puts you ahead of some other people around you, which leads you to becoming the person whom difficult questions are brought to, which leads you to knowing more about esoteric things and resources... And the cycle continues.
