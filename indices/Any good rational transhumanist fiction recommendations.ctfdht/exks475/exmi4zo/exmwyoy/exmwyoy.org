It's not transhumanist, it's primitivist. Their entire transhuman utopia is destroyed by one person who has mental issues, because "meaning has been lost", as if it's that important compared to the incredible amount of incomprehensible torture the AI prevented. It sets up for this by having the main character have a much higher pain tolerance than normal and hating anything that's not "real", and disregards any others that would disagree.

If she wanted to live primitively, she should have asked the AI to let her and it would have gladly obliged. Instead she destroyed a utopia of absolute freedom with a population in the trillions because she thought it was meaningless. That's /way/ more hubristic than creating a god whose purpose is to provide people with freedom to do as they choose without mortal limitations.
