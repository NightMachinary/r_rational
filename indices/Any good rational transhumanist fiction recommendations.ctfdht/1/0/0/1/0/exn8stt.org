It had actually taken over the entire universe. And you're right, it shouldn't have erased those alien civs. It shouldn't allow people to torture animals, and it should have allowed people to kill themselves if they wanted etc etc... It should have been programmed better. But that seems a fixable(in advance) problem rather than a condemnation of transhumanist thought, and that's not what the main characters were mainly complaining about. The problem that they basically had was it was boring, i.e. they had a total lack of imagination of what to do with their freedom to do absolutely anything they want, and claim that everything is boring because it's not "real", and long for their nostalgic past where people would kill and be killed with impunity.
