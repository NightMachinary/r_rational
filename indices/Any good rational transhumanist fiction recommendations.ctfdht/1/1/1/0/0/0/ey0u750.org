I also wrote a little story for HFY:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/79crty/oc_upgrade/]]

My soul was pretty much crushed when Rusty let Kuro5hin go to shit and I didn't write anything for a long time. I am currently doing a little series that started as a one-off but my wife encouraged me to follow it, and it's now The Curators. Curators Book 3 will finish that story, and after that I think I will try working on Transmigration again.

Transmigration is an incredibly difficult story to write because it involves multiple human persons merging into a single personality, which is the only way I could imagine mere humans evolving to a point where they could challenge a being like PI. I essentially had to throw away everything I had written at the 20,000 word mark because I realized it had to be in first instead of third person.

But I'm still here, so far, and still thinking about it. Not sure 55 year old current me is up to following what 30 year old me wrote back in the day, but I do want to try.
