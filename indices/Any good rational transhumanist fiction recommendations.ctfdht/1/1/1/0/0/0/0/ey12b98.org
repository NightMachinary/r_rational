Oh, hey, it's Roger! I didn't know you read [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. Thanks for explaining in more detail what went on behind the scenes. I loved /The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect/; it's a pretty good read even now, but considering that it was published in /1994/ it was incredibly groundbreaking and visionary.

There's something I want to ask you now that I have the chance. Have you ever read /Friendship is Optimal/ by [[/u/iceman-p][u/iceman-p]]? It was obviously influenced by your work (to the point of including a reference to it in [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/3/friendship-is-optimal/2-resources][this chapter]]) and I'm /really/ curious about what you think of it.
