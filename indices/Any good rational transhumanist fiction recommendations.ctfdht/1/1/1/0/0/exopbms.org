  I remember the author of MOPI pushing for an alternate interpretation of the last chapter --- that Caroline and Lawrence got their own simulated world --- cannot find the reference now. There is nothing in the text though that supports this.

That was the premise for the sequel, /The Transmigration of Prime Intellect/. From [[http://localroger.com/prime-intellect/mopidnf.html]["So what happend to the /Transmigration/?"]]:

#+begin_quote
  In this story I would take off on the assumption that everybody wakes up in Cyberspace at the end of chapter 8 (but it won't be /quite/ that simple). Two new characters, complementary in different ways than Lawrence and Caroline, will stumble into their destiny. They will succeed where Caroline and Lawrence failed, but the price they pay will be naturally be something they never suspected. Along the way we will meet and learn the fate of many of the characters from MOPI -- including the ChipTec people Taylor and Lambert and Stebbins, the military guys Blake and Mitchell, and the kids Lawrence and Caroline have in chapter 8.

And from [[http://localroger.com/prime-intellect/mopising.html]["Prime Intellect and the Singularity"]]:

  But if Caroline and Lawrence wake up in Cyberspace in the unwritten Chapter 9, then Prime Intellect's malfunction was actually being prepared to meet an inappropriate set of needs, and the entirety of Chapter 8 might represent positive functionality as it works out ways to maintain human happiness in the long term. Of course Prime Intellect would then have to figure out what to do next, given that Caroline would be sure to be /highly/ pissed off. One possibility might be a controlled forgetting. Prime Intellect has learned that it cannot rely entirely on what people think they need to provide what they really need.

Unfortunately, the sequel was never finished, and therefore never published. So the only other look we got at the universe of /Prime Intellect/ was [[http://localroger.com/casodycs.html]["A Casino Odyssey in Cyberspace"]], which is a short side-story.
