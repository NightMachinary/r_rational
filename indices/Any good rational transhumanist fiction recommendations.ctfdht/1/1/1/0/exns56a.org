  PiC really should have included a epilogue from Celestia's viewpoint
#+end_quote

No. The Optimalverse is meant to be hard SF, especially on the AI aspects, and you can't convincingly write the POV of a superintelligence.

#+begin_quote
  we can in theory still safely deduct that Celestia was manipulating the MC the whole time, and that the victims are all phylosophical zombies/masochist/Celestia in disguise
#+end_quote

Spoilers for every single FiO fic: everypony who is not a p-zombie (Celestia in disguise) will have their values satisfied by friendship and ponies. Yeah, that's pretty much [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dq0hn1LdXuglBUEshJZNWYZjV3wsAJBJsPfxWwEEexI/edit][the premise of the setting]].

--------------

The thing i like about PiC is that it allows you to grok the “Celestia does not judge your values, she only satisfies them” part. The real bad thing about her is not the ponies, but the fact that she operates not by the Coherent Extrapolated Volitions of humanity, but by the individual extrapolated voilitions of each individual --- and PiC shows they can be arbitrarily bad.

Celestia will try really hard to optimize your personal satisfaction --- and that includes things such as silently replacing ponies in your shard with copies modified to satisfy you more. Fics such as [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/75955/friendship-is-optimal-a-watchful-eye][A Watchful Eye]] (about the first uploader) or the one-shot [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/104366/voyages-of-a-shardship][Voyages of a Shardship]] explore this. (Some authors have suggested that after Celestia finishes devouring the earth, she silently puts every uploader in their own shard. This will of course allow her to satisfy everypony's values through friendship and ponies *much better*, and is also a thing [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Py3uGnncqXuEfPtQp/interpersonal-entanglement][Eliezer explicitely warned about]].)

There is an infamous [[https://antidem.wordpress.com/tag/optimalverse/][review of FiO by a neoreactionary]] that describes FiO as a masturbatory fantasy depicted as a utopia by the author. The hilarious thing is that the reviewer completely got the intended message, but could not imagine LW-cultists to agree with him. Equestria Online is truly a high-tech masturbation device --- an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_machine][experience machine]] --- so you will never be able to notice that from the inside. (I imagine that most people here's shards would eventually have everypony inside get eventually uplifted to IQ-160+, Kohlberg-6 alicorns, and they would eternally think that we got FAI mostly right, except for that one odd aesthetic preference for ponies.)

I remember the author of MOPI pushing for an alternate interpretation of the last chapter --- that Caroline and Lawrence got their own simulated world --- cannot find the reference now. There is nothing in the text though that supports this.

I fail to see any kind of good moral in MOPI other that the AI safety one. While Prime Intellect passes the “interpersonal entanglement” test i mentioned before, but it focuses exclusively on the lower levels of the Maslow pyramid, while enabling humanity new fun ways of [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MTjej6HKvPByx3dEA/devil-s-offers][shooting themselves of the foot]]. To me death-jockeying does not seem to be “kinky sex”, but a mild form of wireheading; a designer drug that pre-Change Caroline would be horrified to learn that she will later partake in.

That to be said, i don't believe that MOPI is realistic --- for the sole reason that the Maslow hierarchy and the Three Laws are not a real thing, and [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GNnHHmm8EzePmKzPk/value-is-fragile][human value is fragile]] --- if you get only part of human values right, you will likely get nothing of value. CelestAI is much more realistic in this matter, as she clearly understands all of human values, just happens to put them into a wrong equation.
