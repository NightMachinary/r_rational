"A Fire Upon the Deep" by Vernor Vinge touches on this, though the ascended civilisations remain peripheral to the action and the protagonists are not directly involved in any transhumanist shenanigans. Still, it's a very interesting setting and world (too bad the prequel is amazing but then the sequel sucked).
