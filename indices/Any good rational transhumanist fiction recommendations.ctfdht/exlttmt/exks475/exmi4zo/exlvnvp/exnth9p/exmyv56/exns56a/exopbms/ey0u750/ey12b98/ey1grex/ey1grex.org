Yes, of course I've read FiO, and I'm aware that it is in some ways a sendup and some ways an homage to MOPI, particularly in that chapter where Princess Celestia does the fast takeoff. It's an odd thing because to me the idea of being trapped in what is essentially a children's fantasy is far more horrible than any of the things I wrote. In that sense it is quite brilliantly done.
