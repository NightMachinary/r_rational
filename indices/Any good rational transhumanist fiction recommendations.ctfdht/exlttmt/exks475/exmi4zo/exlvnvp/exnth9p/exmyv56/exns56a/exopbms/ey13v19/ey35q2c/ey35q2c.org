“All the myriad worlds” illustrates the concept quite nicely, but to me it was too well-written and poetic to be terrifying in any way.

As i understand Eliezer's [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Py3uGnncqXuEfPtQp/interpersonal-entanglement][Interpersonal Entanglement]] which i already linked before, this is a case '''precisely''' against sharding everyone, and this post confirms a rather central part of LW orthodoxy against anything which looks like wireheading, even when utilitarianism suggests otherwise (Compare [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/synsRtBKDeAFuo7e3/not-for-the-sake-of-happiness-alone][Not For The Sake of Happiness Alone]]). Scott Alexander goes even further in [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/08/whose-utilitarianism/][Whose Utilitarianism?]], arguing it is morally obligatory to un-wirehead humans who have wireheaded themselves and try to re-introduce them into society. Apparently the protagonists of [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/104366/voyages-of-a-shardship][Voyages of a Shardship]] are onboard with Scott regarding this.
