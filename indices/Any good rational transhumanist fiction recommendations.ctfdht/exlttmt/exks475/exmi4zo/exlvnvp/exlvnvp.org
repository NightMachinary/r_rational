Seriously, you have a warning for the ponies in FiO, but not for the gratuitious gorefest that starts of Metamorphosis? Grow up, man. MLP is considered normie stuff now. ;)

I've been actually reading a lot of Optimalverse fics lately despite not even being a pony fan, solely for the AI safety content. An underrated one of my favorites is [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/75657/friendship-is-optimal-psychopathy-is-configurable][Psychopathy is Configurable]], which covers a lot of similar ground as MoPI, but is actually a well-written uncanny-valley horror instead of some kind of slasher gorno.
