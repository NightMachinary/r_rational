Actually, there is supposed to be a sequel released in the future. We don't know what really happened (yet?), but world didn't really "reset" and PI still exists.

Only main character is. And without making main character something like this, there would be no story.

  If she wanted to live primitively, she should have asked the AI to let her and it would have gladly obliged.

Her issue was with AI reencoding the world. That locations would cease to exist when no one is there - therefore nothing is real anymore. Of course that's stupid, because AI being able to do that means world was always like it - AI could make a "real" location with inefficient original encoding for her and then there wouldn't be a difference.
