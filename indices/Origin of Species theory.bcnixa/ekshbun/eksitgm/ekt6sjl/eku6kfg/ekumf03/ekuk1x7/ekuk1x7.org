So, afaik the closest instance of 'canon' tends to be that powerful trainers have powerful bonds with their pokemon. For Red to fulfill canon, where he's the strongest in Kanto (and effectively Johto too), he needs to have an extremely strong bond with his pokemon. Psychic Red seems to be the most popular, if only because it provides a justification for him to be exceptionally good with pokemon, even at a young age.
