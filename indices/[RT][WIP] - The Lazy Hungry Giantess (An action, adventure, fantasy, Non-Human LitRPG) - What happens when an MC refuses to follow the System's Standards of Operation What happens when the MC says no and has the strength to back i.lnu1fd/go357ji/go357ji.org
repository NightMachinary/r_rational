Good luck with your story, but I wouldn't really call it rational. The magic system is very soft, edging into surreal, and the story and characters seem to bend to the themes you want to show, rather than the themes emerging from a self-consistent story. There are also quite a lot of really uncomfortable sexual moments that stray into unusual fetish territory. This for the most part seems less like a rational story and more like a surreal giantess fetish story.
