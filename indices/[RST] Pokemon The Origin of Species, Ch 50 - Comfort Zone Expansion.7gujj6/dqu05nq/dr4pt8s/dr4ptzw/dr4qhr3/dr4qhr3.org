Good effort, but that sequence made me run screaming from Bayes, and I like maths!

My humble suggestion: have Leaf quizzing Red on how you could possibly use Bayesian probability, given how laborious the calculations are.

She goes ahead and calculates it the original way, then Red excitedly shows her the odds ratio method.

You could keep Red being bad at maths, and have her save face, by having him comment that he'd always mess it up when he tried to do it her way.
