I think they are a nice change from the more action-heavy Blue chapters. While I think the Red chapters have a nice mix between the occasional action and him theorizing and studying, it's interesting how Leaf faces problems, that are in some ways similar to Red's struggles, but approaches them in her own way.

With Red it often seems like he perceives looking for Oak's help as some kind if weakness, because he fears getting extra passes, because of starting off working in the lab. I feel like Leaf looks up to Laura and values her as a mentor, while still trying to rise on her own merits.
