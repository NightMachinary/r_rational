  The fact that tier 3 threats were almost completed is rather annoying
#+end_quote

Almost completed?

#+begin_quote
  They're not exclusively related to the stormbringers, but what else can cause a tier 3 threat?
#+end_quote

On a rare occasion, if for example there's a whole group of Tyranitar on a rampage instead of just one, the threat would quickly approach that of a Stormbringer. Those are pretty rare, however, and far less frequent than the already somewhat infrequent Stormbringer flights over populated areas (which happen roughly once a year), so those are the vast majority.

  What is the true "top" of the threat range?
#+end_quote

What's the greatest threat you can think of? :)
