The difference between the disease example and the Tyranitar version is that with the diseases the accuracy of the test is given as it applies to the specific disease we are talking about.

For Tyranitars we accuracy of reporting is derived from the statistics we gathered about all pok√©mon events. That is like saying medical tests in general have a 10% false positive rate, so we should apply that to this disease as well.

So if we have no data about the specific test how can we get the probabilities that we need to apply bayes?

What is the reasoning for keeping specific probabilities fixed when going between general case and specific case? You can get vastly different results for different choices on what to keep fixed.
