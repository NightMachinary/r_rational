So we take the rate of error given a report, convert that into the rate of error given an actual classification, assume that this rate is the same when only looking at Tyranitars, and convert back into the rate of error given a report. Resulting in the 26.77% Leaf arrives at.

Alternatively we can take the error rate given a report and assume that is the same when looking only at Tyranitars. We get a 79% chance.

How do we decide that we are better off doing it one way or the other?

Personally I would take Leaf's previous comment about being surprised by the actual classification and assume that reports about Tyranitars are hard to get right. I'd mostly go by the 2:15 Tyranitar odds and not give the report a lot of weight. So Leafs number makes more sense to me. But I don't understand how or if it is mathematically more justified than the other approach.
