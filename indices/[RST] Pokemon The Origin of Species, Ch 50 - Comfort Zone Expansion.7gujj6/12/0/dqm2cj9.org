Because if we have additional information, we should update our thought process based on it. We know that tyranitar attacks are more likely to actually be tier 2, so we should consider that when doing a threat assessment.

One of the places this shows up a lot in real life is in medical tests. If a test for disease A has a 10% false positive rate, you might naively think that if you test positive there's a 90% chance you're sick. But that ignores the fact that most medical conditions have a relatively low incidence rate. If disease A is typically found in just 1% of the population, then it means that most of the positives were actually false positives, since it was more likely to start with that you weren't sick. (This is the idea of "priors" sometimes discussed). Using the hypothetical 100 person population, and ignoring false negatives, for this test you would expect 11 total positive test results, only one of which corresponded to an actual positive.
