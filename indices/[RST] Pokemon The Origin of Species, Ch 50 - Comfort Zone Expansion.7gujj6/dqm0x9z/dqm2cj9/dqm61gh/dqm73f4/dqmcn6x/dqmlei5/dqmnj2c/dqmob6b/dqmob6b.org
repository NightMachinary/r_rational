I think so :) The way I see it, yeah, there could suddenly be a bunch of Tyranitar attacks in the next couple years that massively change the rate of expected Tier 1 vs Tier 2, but people wouldn't necessarily get better at recognizing it right away. Or people might get worse or better at reporting the events from one decade to the next, and those two different factors will be important to determining how to treat a report.
