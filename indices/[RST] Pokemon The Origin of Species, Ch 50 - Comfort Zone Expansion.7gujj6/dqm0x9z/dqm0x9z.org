I have a question about the math.

One of the assumptions we start with is that Tier 1 reports over all pokémon have a 21% chance of actually being Tier 2. Why exactly can't we just take that as our final answer?

I guess that number is too far away from what we expect the odds to be so we assume there is something special about reports about Tyranitars in particular.

Instead we calculate that over all pokémon Tier 1s are reported accurately with 71% chance and Tier 2s are reported accurately with 76% chance.

We then continue to use those numbers as the probability that a Tyranitar Tier 1/2 event is reported accurately.

Why is it any more reasonable to restrict to Tyranitars in that context?
