"Sometimes an incident that looks like a Tier 1 ends up being a Tier 2, while other times a Tier 2 threat is misidentified as a Tier 1"

These are the same situation; based on the reply, should the first one be 'that look like a TIer 2 ends up being a Tier 1', so that that first one is the one where resources are overcommitted?.

"Who can tell me why that's a problem?"

"Because the threat assessment keeps us from overcommitting resources on one end, or not committing enough on the other"

Being kept from overcommitting resources sounds like a good thing; should this be 'leads to us overcommitting resources'?

Curiously, the two cases are sort-of consistent in their parallel.

"It could look small and be big, or else it might be big and look small! Why is that bad!?"

"Sir! We might not use too many resources, or we might use too few resources!"
