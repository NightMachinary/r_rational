Ok, I see how a different amount of Tier 1 reports changes the outcome. Can you walk me through what makes this situation different from the cancer one?

Instead of this:

#+begin_quote
  1% of women at age forty who participate in routine screening have breast cancer. 80% of women with breast cancer will get positive mammographies. 9.6% of women without breast cancer will also get positive mammographies. A woman in this age group had a positive mammography in a routine screening. What is the probability that she actually has breast cancer?
#+end_quote

I have this:

#+begin_quote
  12% of reported Tyranitar events are Tier 1. 71% of Tier 1 events will be reported as Tier 1. 24% of Tier 2 events will also be reported as Tier 1. A Tyranitar has been reported as Tier 1. What is the probability that it is actually Tier 1?
#+end_quote

Neither mentions the amount of actual women who get tested, so why does it matter for the second one? Is it because in the story example there's a completely separate test (Tier 2 reports) that can give a false positive, whereas in the cancer example the same test will either give the false negatives or the false positives?

Edit:

Or is it because of the age group thing? Am I essentially saying:

#+begin_quote
  1% of women at age forty who participate in routine screening have breast cancer. 80% of women with breast cancer will get positive mammographies. 9.6% of women without breast cancer will also get positive mammographies. A woman *not in this age group* had a positive mammography in a routine screening. What is the probability that she actually has breast cancer?
#+end_quote

By mixing non-Tyranitar-specific "Tests" while the prior is based specifically on Tyranitar?
