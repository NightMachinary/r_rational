You got it half right. The math is correct (except it's .25 or a 25% chance, not a .25% chance), and this statement is correct:

#+begin_quote
  Specifically, the number of T1 events that are reported as T1 is fundamentally different from the number of T1 reports that are actually T1 events
#+end_quote

The ratios you'd done earlier did not actually apply to real life, since they didn't consider the priors. They don't represent the chance of T1 being reported accurately.

The next paragraph is a bit off as well. The alternative (changing the statement) is correct, but the way you can fix that without changing the statement wouldn't be to do any extra math. Instead, it's to just take the percentage of Tier 1 reports which are actually Tier 1 (which you directly provided in the question) as the answer.

Remember, the question was for the percentage of Tier 1 reports which are actually Tier 1. Which you gave. And it does not change by pokemon. It would be the same whether it's 12% Tier 1 or 99% Tier 1.

I'd love to do a Skype call with you. I have Discord but I've never actually tried it for anything. Plus, you're my current favourite serial fiction writer, so it'd be a bonus for me. Do you prefer weekdays or weekends?
