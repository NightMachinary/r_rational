^ Should have been "If you don't care how often T1 occurs" (i.e., if you ignore T1)

You're right. The 12% (T1) /is/ your prior, but you're not using it when you're calculating P(R), which is dependent on P(T1) and P(T2). By T1 I mean specifically the Tyranitar Tier 1 events.

No matter which way you look at it, unless you take the straight P(T1 | R1) = 0.79 (which is the likelihood), you have to use P(T1). It's unavoidable.

Now, if you had actually meant the 0.79 to be P(R1 | T1) (the percentage of Tier 1 incidents reported as Tier 1) rather than P(T1 | R1) (the percentage of Tier 1 reports that are actually Tier 1 incidents), everything goes much more smoothly, and it's a simple step to get P(T1 | R1) after that.
