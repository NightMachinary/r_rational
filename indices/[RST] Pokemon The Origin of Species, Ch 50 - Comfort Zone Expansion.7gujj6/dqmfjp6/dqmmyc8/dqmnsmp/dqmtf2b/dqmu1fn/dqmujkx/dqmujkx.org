I just did, sorry, I had the tab open for awhile so I just answered that one before refreshing and seeing the new one.

#+begin_quote
  If you don't know how often T1 occurs, then the first part (12% vs 88%) gives you absolutely zero information. You'd be working with likelihoods and ignoring your priors.
#+end_quote

But the 12% is the prior? I don't get what you mean by it gives you zero information.

Since they're specifically looking at a Tyranitar report, the amount of Tyranitar events that have been T1 or T2 in the past is far more accurate a prior than the total amount of T1 vs T2, of which Tyranitar is just a subset, no?

That's my understanding of it after being told that there was no reason to apply the frequency of T1 events to the frequency of Tyranitar T1 events, anyway. It sounds like you're saying there is actually a reason to do that?
