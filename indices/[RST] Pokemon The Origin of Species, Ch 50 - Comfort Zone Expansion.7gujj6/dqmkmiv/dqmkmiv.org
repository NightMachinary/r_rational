Holy shit, that was ominous. I was expecting a fun chapter about Red's experiences in this gym, and instead we get Leaf's life being slowly consumed by her attempts to uncover a dangerous conspiracy only to find out that Laura's in trouble...

(Also, I note that Leaf didn't consider whether Giovanni could have calculated what he said to point her to /his enemies/, regardless of if they actually did it. :p)
