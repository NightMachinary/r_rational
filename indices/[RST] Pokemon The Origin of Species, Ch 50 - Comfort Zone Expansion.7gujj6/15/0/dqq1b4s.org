  If you used the above data, out of 200 reports, 79+33 = 112 would be Tier 1, while 88 would be Tier 2. This clearly doesn't match the actual 2:15 ratio of Tier 1: Tier 2.

That's because the 2:15 ratio is for Tyranitar, though, while the hypothetical 200 reports used to generalize the accuracy %s is for all pokemon events reported.

#+begin_quote
  These are not the same things.
#+end_quote

Right, I changed it for this example to keep the numbers the same out of convenience just to see if I understood the issue.

#+begin_quote
  Instead of mentioning actual Tier 1 and Tier 2 events, mention there were 6 Tier 1 reports and 11 Tier 2 reports, and then try to figure out how many were actual Tier 1.
#+end_quote

This is a good idea, but for now what I want to ideally preserve the ultimate question presented: upon hearing that a report is T1, how do you figure out the chance if it's actually tier 1 or not? If I have to change the other bits of information provided for that, I'm happy to :)
