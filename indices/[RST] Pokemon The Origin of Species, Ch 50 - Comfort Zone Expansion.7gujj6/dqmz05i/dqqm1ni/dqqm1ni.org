Yep. Generally thinking that you have a better understanding of a situation than an expert requires something like demonstrable mastery or understanding of why the expert is wrong. In this case, Leaf just /wanted/ to be right, which is not sufficient when facing an expert telling you you're wrong.

I like EY's take on it overall.
