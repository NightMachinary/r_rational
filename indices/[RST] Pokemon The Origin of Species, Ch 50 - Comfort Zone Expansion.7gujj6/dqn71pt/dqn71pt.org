Something that had been floating around my head for a while:

  I suppose it's been too long since I saw this place through fresh eyes.

  Maybe I had been turning away Mastery challenges to keep myself from seeing it. On some level, maybe I thought I'd lose my nerve if I was reminded. It's certainly making me rethink all of it now.

  But what's done is done. What happened happened, and there's no unbaking this cake.

  There is one last formality before you can call yourself a Master, Blue. Three questions, all with one answer. You don't have to tell me; they'll tell you inside. But I think you can work it out, if your history classes didn't cover it.

  First, why does the region have a Champion rather than a General?

  Second, why did we walk to the Plateau instead of flying?

  Third, why is such a desolate place called Victory Road?
