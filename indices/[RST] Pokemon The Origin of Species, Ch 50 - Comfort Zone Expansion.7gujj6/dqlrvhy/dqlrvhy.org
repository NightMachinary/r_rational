Welcome back everyone! Quick disclaimer/warning: this chapter contains a section with math. I apologize in advance, but if my characters are going to start using Bayes' Theorem while calculating things, I figured it was worth actually showing them going through it at least once for anyone interested in learning. If your eyes glaze over and you find it horribly tedious, I totally understand, and apologize for not finding a more entertaining way to include it.

That said, I do think it's an important bit of math to learn for any aspiring rationalists, and there are plenty of resources online that can do a better job teaching it than I can, including the one you can find [[https://arbital.com/p/bayes_rule_guide/][here.]] Whether you take the challenge on or not, I hope you enjoy the chapter, and all feedback welcome, as always! (Particularly if you think I got something wrong or explained something poorly. I know I say that a lot, but I super extra mean it this time.)
