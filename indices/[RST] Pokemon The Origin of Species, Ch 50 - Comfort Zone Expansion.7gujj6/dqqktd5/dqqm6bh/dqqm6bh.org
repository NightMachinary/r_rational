It's super rare in most fiction because danger = conflict = the plot for pretty much every story where someone is warned that something is dangerous. Protagonists get into extraordinary danger and survive because they have Plot Armor, by and large: to show a Protagonist who's able to differentiate between danger they can handle and danger they can't, they have to actually once in awhile hold back out of legitimate and justified fear of it.

Harry in HPMOR is smart enough to know not to look for the Chamber of Secrets when McGonagall tells him that it led to a student's death years ago, but even then once he learned what potential powers lay waiting inside for him he was tempted to go looking for it. In general he's pretty conscientious about safety, but we're all fallible to desires that can overcome justified caution.
