Ahh, I see! (I took 'the threat assessment' to mean 'the mistaken threat assessment'... maybe 'is in order to' or 'is intended to' or 'is supposed to', and/or 'make sure'->'stop us from (overcommitting...)'... clearer that Red is talking about the purpose of a threat assessment, rather than the consequences of a mistaken threat assessment... *nods*)
