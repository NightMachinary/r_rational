I'm stuck and/or confused.

The terminology I use is:

T1, T2 = Actually Tier 1/2 R1, R2 = Reported Tier 1/2

I get this part:

| Givens                     | P(T1) | P(T2) |
|----------------------------+-------+-------|
| Prior (an attack occurred) | 0.12  | 0.88  |
| R1                         | 0.79  | 0.21  |
| R2                         | 0.33  | 0.67  |

What we're looking for is P(T1 | R1), the probability that a Tier 1 Report is actually a Tier 1.

What Leaf tries to find is the probability of Tier 1 being reported accurately, which, to me, would be P(R1 | T1) / P(T1). We don't know P(R1 | T1), so we have to use Bayes's rule:

P(R1 | T1) = P(T1 | R1) * P(R1) / P(T1)

But we don't know P(R1) either.

What Leaf instead does is calculate the percentage of Tier 1 reports that actually represent Tier 1, which we can do:

P(R1 | T1) / P(R1) = P(T1 | R1) * P(R1) / (P(T1) * P(R1))

which cancels out to P(T1 | R1) / P(T1).

However, she calculates P(T1) as:

P(T1) = P(T1 | R1) + P(T1 | R2)

instead of:

P(T1) = P(T1 | R1) * P(R1) + P(T1 | R2) * P(R2)

And this got me completely stuck. Help?
