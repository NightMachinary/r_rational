  There is no mathematical reason that keeping the accuracy of the reports the same between general Pok√©mon and Tyranitar is the correct thing to do. That part is taken from additional reasoning about the world.

Right, by my reasoning they /wouldn't/ be the same, but if all you have is the accuracy of general pokemon reports and the ratio of Tyranitar events, I thought both could be used to reach an estimate of how likely a Tyranitar report is to be accurate. Apparently I was super wrong XD
