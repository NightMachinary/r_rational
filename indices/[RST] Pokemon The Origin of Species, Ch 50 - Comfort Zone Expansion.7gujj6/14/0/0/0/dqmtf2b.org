  If you know P(T1 | R1) (how often reports of Tier 1 are actually Tier 1) and P(T1|R2) (how often reports of Tier 2 are actually Tier 1), you still need to know the individual frequencies of R1 and R2.

I'm not sure I follow why you need to know the frequencies. Isn't it enough to know what % of them are accurate, regardless of how frequently each one is reported?

The point of this section:

#+begin_quote
  100 Events reported as Tier 1

  79 are actually Tier 1

  21 are actually Tier 2

  100 Events reported as Tier 2

  67 are tier 2

  33 are Tier 1
#+end_quote

Is to essentially give that information as a hypothetical, since they don't have the actual frequencies of T1 vs T2 reports. Since their goal is to just figure out, as you say, whether /this specific/ T1 report is in fact accurate, I'm a little confused as to why it's necessary to know how often T1 reports occur at all, rather than just how often they're accurate.

This:

#+begin_quote
  P(T1 | R1) = 0.79

  P(T1 | R2) = 0.33

  P(T1) would then be equal to 79% + 33% = 112%.
#+end_quote

Seems to be answering how frequent T1 is compared to T2 for /general pokemon reports,/ but we already have that answer for Tyranitar reports: 12%.
