#+begin_quote
  I had to find the actual probability of Tier 1 *events* first. Look, here...
#+end_quote

Should probably say "probability of Tier 1 *reports*".

#+begin_quote
  See how that's different than "*73%* of Tier 1 reports are Tier 1 events?" she asks.
#+end_quote

Should probably say "*83%* of Tier 1 reports" since that's the probability she calculated.

Other than that looks good.
