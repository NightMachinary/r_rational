Sorry about that! I guess I wasn't paying attention in class. I calculated it for you!

Assumptions:

- P(T1) = 64%
- P(T1 | R1) = 79%
- P(T1 | R2) = 33%

Result:

- P(R1 | T1) = 83.2%
- P(R1 | T2) = 39.4%

Using this data, we can calculate the odds for Tyranitar.

- P(T1) = 2/17; P(T2) = 15/17
- P(R1 | T1) = 83.2%
- P(R1 | T2) = 39.4%

P(T1 | R1) = P(R1 | T1) * P(T1) / (P(R1 | T1) * P(T1) + P(R1 | T2) * P(T2)) P(T1 | R1) = 0.2197, or 22% probability that a Tyranitar attack reported as Tier 1 is actually Tier 1.

You end up doing the same thing, but have that extra step of having to find P(R1 | T1) and P(R1 | T2) manually in the first place.

edit: Please double check for accuracy. It's almost 6 am here with no sleep for me. Basically, write the equations for P(T1 | R1) and P(T1 | R2) and solve for the unknowns. The simultaneous equations if you want to solve them automatically:

You're solving for P(R1 | T1) and P(R1 | T2). Remember that P(T2 | R1) = 1 - P(T1 | R1), and P(T2 | R2) = 1 - P(T1 | R2)

1. P(T2 | R1) * *P(R1 | T1)* + P(T1 | R1) * P(T2) / P(T1) * *P(R1 | T2)* = 0
2. (1 - P(T1 | R2)) * P(T1) * *P(R1 | T1)* - P(T1 | R2) * P(T2) * *P(R1 | T2)* = P(T1) - P(T1 | R2) * (P(T1) + P(T2))
