I didn't do the calculations again, but this looks good. I love how you used your original error as Red's, and you fixed it well, too. I also like that you used two completely different methods to get the same answer.

Plus, you incorporated Bayesian updates, and potentially opened a way for Leaf to figure out a new (world-changing?) method of deploying Rangers.
