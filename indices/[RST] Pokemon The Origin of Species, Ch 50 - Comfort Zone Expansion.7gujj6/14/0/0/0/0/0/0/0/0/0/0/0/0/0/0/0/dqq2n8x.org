I'll probably respond to this more in depth later, but I just wanted to say thanks again for explaining it all out. I think I understand it a little better now, and will be rereading it a few times in the coming days to make sure it sticks a bit.

One thing I wanted to highlight is that this:

#+begin_quote
  Also, don't forget. In a big emergency, you will get multiple reports. After every report, you can use the posterior as a prior and update on that... It /should be/ taken less seriously specifically because it's rare. But it shouldn't be dismissed out of hand. You have a default starting probability of 12%. With one report, it got nudged upwards to 25%. Still unlikely, but you can breathe slightly easier.
#+end_quote

Is exactly what I had in mind. The idea in my head is that you start with the prior probability of a Tier 1 Tyranitar (12%) and update from there upward or downward for each report you get based on the general accuracy of reports, or specific accuracy of Tyranitar reports. This is why I was so confused to hear that the prior probability of Tyranitar events has no bearing on P(T1 | R1)... but I guess that's a really bad way for me to phrase it now that I understand what you mean a little better, and clearly the way I represented that mathematically was very off.

Gonna respond to the lower comments with the alternative ways to present the problem now :) Thanks again for the long explanation!
