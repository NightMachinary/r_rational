I think the first equation should have a - instead of the +. In the second we can use P(T1)+P(T2) = 1.

Corrected:

1. P(T2 | R1) * P(T1) * *P(R1 | T1)* - P(T1 | R1) * P(T2) * *P(R1 | T2)* = 0
2. (1 - P(T1 | R2)) * P(T1) * *P(R1 | T1)* - P(T1 | R2) * P(T2) * *P(R1 | T2)* = P(T1) - P(T1 | R2)

Although I think it is easier to calculate P(R1) explicitly in an additional step. By doing that we can solve three equations, one after the other instead of solving a system of two equations simultaneously.

We get P(R1) from P(T1) = P(T1 | R1) * *P(R1)* + P(T1 | R2) * (1 - *P(R1)*), where it is the only unknown. After we have that we use P(R1 | T1) = P(T1 | R1) * P(R1) / P(T1) and P(R1 | T2) = P(T2 | R1) * P(R1) / P(T2)

For the purposes of the story it is probably clearer and more instructional if P(R1 | T1) and P(R1 | T2) are known from the lecture.

edit: For the actual numbers, I get P(R1 | T2) = 39.3% Probably a rounding difference of some kind, but rounding more accurately I get .39311594...

The rest of the numbers stays the same (excluding differences that are rounded away).
