Oof, okay, I still don't understand this at all then:

  Remember, the question was for the percentage of Tier 1 reports which are actually Tier 1. Which you gave. And it does not change by pokemon. It would be the same whether it's 12% Tier 1 or 99% Tier 1.

I don't get why it should be independent of the % of Tyranitar events, whereas in the cancer example it is dependent on the actual cancer rate among the tested population.

  I'd love to do a Skype call with you. I have Discord but I've never actually tried it for anything. Plus, you're my current favourite serial fiction writer, so it'd be a bonus for me. Do you prefer weekdays or weekends?

Hey, thanks a lot! Glad you're enjoying the story so much :)

I'm actually heading to CFAR on Monday, and will be there for about a week. I'm available Sunday evening though, if you are, from about 5PM EST till at least midnight.
