Look at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7gujj6/rst_pokemon_the_origin_of_species_ch_50_comfort/dqpamaj/?context=3][this]] reply by [[/u/Iijil]]. He fixed my derivation, and had the brilliant idea of finding P(R1) first.

Let's work through it step by step:

1. P(T1) = P(T1 | R1) * P(R1) + P(T1 | R2) * (1 - P(R1))

   Solve for P(R1)

2. P(R1) = (P(T1) - P(T1 | R2)) / (P(T1 | R1) - P(T1 | R2)) = (0.64 - 0.33) / (0.79 - 0.33) = 0.6739

   Now, we solve for P(R1 | T1) and P(R1 | T2)

3. P(R1 | T1) = P(T1 | R1) * P(R1) / P(T1) = 0.79 * 0.6739 / 0.64 = 0.8319

   P(R1 | T2) = P(T2 | R1) * P(R1) / P(T2) = 0.21 * 0.6739 / 0.36 = 0.3931

   Now, we solve for Tyranitar (first report).

4. P(T1 | R1) = P(R1 | T1) * P(T1) / (P(R1 | T1) * P(T1) + P(R1 | T2) * P(T2)) = 0.8319 * (2/17) / (0.8319 * (2/17) + 0.3931 * (15/17)) = 0.22

edit:

What we just did here, though, doesn't have much to do with Bayesian reasoning apart from the fact that it uses Bayes's rule. It's just algebra for the most part.

For the story, I recommend that you use the 79% as P(R1 | T1) instead of P(T1 | R1), and treat it as given and constant. If you want to make it such that they do perform updates, you can give them a sequence of R1 and R2 and have them adjust their probabilities accordingly, which is what we did in the last part of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7gujj6/rst_pokemon_the_origin_of_species_ch_50_comfort/dqp4h7c/][this]] comment. And this is, as you'd said earlier, the essence that you wanted to get across. A few bits of evidence don't do much on their own. Sure, you update your beliefs (up to 25% instead of 12%), but you don't change your behaviour. You still respond as if it's a T2 (if it's binary) or interpolate. The more evidence you get, though, the higher your belief (98%, in the last case) that it is just a T1 incident, and respond appropriately.
