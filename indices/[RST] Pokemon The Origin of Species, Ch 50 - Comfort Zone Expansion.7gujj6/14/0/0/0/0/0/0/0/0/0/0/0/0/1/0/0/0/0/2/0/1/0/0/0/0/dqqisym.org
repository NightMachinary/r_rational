Something like that sounds like a good idea for a way to improve the Ranger system as it currently is. Though the interpolation scale will probably be different, yeah, since there's not much added benefit in ramping up quickly then tapering off as you approach a higher chance of it being T2: instead they'd want to keep the amount they commit as small as possible for low or even moderate chances of T2 and then ramp up very quickly in the, say, 70-90% confidence range.
