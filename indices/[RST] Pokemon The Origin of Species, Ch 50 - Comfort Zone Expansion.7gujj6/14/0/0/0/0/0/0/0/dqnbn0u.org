Okay, so you're basically saying that because I'm mixing my reports (probability of a Tyranitar event being Tier 1 or Tier 2 vs probability of general incidents being T1 or T2) I'm skipping a step in figuring out what the actual relationship is?

If I was using general incident frequency and general report accuracy, that would be fine.

If I'm using a specific pokemon incident frequency, and specific pokemon report frequency, that would be fine.

But mixing both means the relationship isn't as clear cut and the actual number of general reports matters to how much confidence I should be giving the smaller subset of Tyranitar T1 or T2 reports.

Is that about right?
