I would like to comment that it's not heat itself per se that provides work, but rather temperature differences. For example, if there was magic that could instantly cool an area down, then it would be able to power a steam engine just as well as a magic that could heat up an area. It's just that it's normally a lot easier/faster to heat up something than cooling it down. I got the idea from a comment someone mentioned on the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] discord.
