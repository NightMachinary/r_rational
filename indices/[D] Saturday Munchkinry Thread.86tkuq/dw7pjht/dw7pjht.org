The main character of my serial can convert heat into kinetic energy and vice versa, and is able to store a lot of heat inside of himself (he's gotten up to 3k degrees Celsius).

In reality his power is actually absorbing vibrational energy of all kinds but for his current level of understanding he absorbs Heat and Kinetic, and can change them into each other.

What are some cool tricks he could pull as he figures his power out down the line?
