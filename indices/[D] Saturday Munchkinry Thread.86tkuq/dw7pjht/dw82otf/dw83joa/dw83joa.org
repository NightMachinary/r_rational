Some of these I've planned and considered, outside of the car idea (he's still figuring things out right now: he's learning the physical and temperature invulnerability, some super speed, loves to launch himself around but hasn't quite figured out flight yet, and uses the "sort-of" super strength as his main go-to), but the super crazy body horror ones I had NO FUCKING CLUE WOW WHAT THE FUCK.
