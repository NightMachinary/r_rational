So, the basic conceit is he's a clone of a superhero who had total energy conversion/absorption/immunity, but only ended up with the vibrational energy conversion (So heat, force, etc) but didn't get electromagnetic energy at all. He can't manipulate gravitational forces (though the actual kinetic energy of falling he can use) or electricity.

I've limited how fine his control over his power is by his book smarts: he doesn't understand enough fundamental physics to make full use of a lot of his powers (Yet!) but the more he learns, the finer his control gets. He can't fly yet because it hasn't clicked that he could just constantly reconvert the kinetic energy of falling into energy that would propel him in flight.
