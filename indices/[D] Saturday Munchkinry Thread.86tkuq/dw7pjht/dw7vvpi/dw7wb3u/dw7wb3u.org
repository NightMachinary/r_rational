He can pull or dispense heat all across his body for about five feet around him, but if he wants to be more concentrated on where he's drawing he has to physically touch that area. For the part of his ability that deals with kinetic energy, he applies it by touch as well.

He recently figured out how to absorb kinetic energy (so when something hits him, instead of taking the force he can now turn that into heat) and re-purpose it. This means he can apply kinetic energy to his own punches and kicks without worrying about breaking his limbs (which he was worried about before he figured this part out).
