He can fire giant frickin' lazer beams as long as he has sufficient heat stored in his body. He just needs to vibrate all of the particles in a sample of any lasable material such that they start producing light. He could probably do it with some unknown (to me) material which creates a laser just through heating to proper temperatures as the heated atoms produce light of the right wavelengths to lase.
