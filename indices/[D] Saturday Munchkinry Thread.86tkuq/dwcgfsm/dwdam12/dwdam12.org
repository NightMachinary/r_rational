It's hard to imagine how a species like this progresses, however since an ability like this doesn't naturally evolve one can at least imagine people get it suddenly.

The most obvious issue with trying to speculate here is that pretty much immediately people are going to start increasing their own intelligence with this power. Which means it's very likely that the first person to get started on this undergoes a sort of biological foom, rapidly reaching insane levels of eldritch intelligence and producing complex cells which can construct the first generation of self replicating nanobots after all there's no reason you can't use your control of biology to create something better than biology.\\
If no one eldritch horror gets a decisive edge early on one may win out over time or likely there will be many superintelligences vying for power, however that may not be ideal for obvious Moloch related reasons.

Anyway since the first people to increase their own intelligence rapidly probably won't be doing it slowly and carefully, one can imagine the superintelligences that arise immediately will be extremely alien due to extreme value drift in the improvement of their own mind.

*TLDR*: A bunch of people turn themselves into eldritch horrors and overtake the planet within the week of this power becoming available.
