You live in a world with real world physics. Your humanoid race can print (custom) DNA (and cells) with your body and you have an incubator (you could make a clone of yourself in it)

main limitations:

*knowledge (you could make a killer virus, put probably not know how to survive it yourself, also others of your race would mo)

*calories

*time

*sqaure-cube-law (you could make giant insects, but they wouldn't be overpowered... also cat sized humans would be physical less good than cats, even with modifications.)

Other of your race have the same abilities like you. You can also modify your own body horns, fur, more muscle, different height or colour is save. Tails or claws can get tricky. Organ fuctions should be tested on a clone. And of course someone else already figured out, how not to age.

Knowledge limitation:

*You can basically give your creations anything animals have. (like electric eels, poision, venom, lizards throwaway tails) if you have the blueprints. (lets say for this exercise you have them)

*your race can analyse and copy unknown DNA, but you would need research time (weeks or months) to know which part does what.

*Everything a machine can do, your creations can probably duplicate less efficient. don't forget, real physics (biological guns couldn't shoot as fast and big projectiles as ones made of steel, also ammunition/gun powder would be external or need time and energy to grow.) You could give your creations the ability to communicated via wifi/radio, but only over short distances. (still needs calories)

- mental commands and instinct change would degenerate fast with sexual reproduction, if they are not beneficial (even dormant ones)... aka evolution exists

well I hope I'm not too late or should I post this Saturday?
