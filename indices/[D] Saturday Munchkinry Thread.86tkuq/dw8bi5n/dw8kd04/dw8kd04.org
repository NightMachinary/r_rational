I am assuming intra-cellular matrix counts as 'connected'.

Honestly with my newfound understanding I'm gonna go to the nearest biomedical research facility and start brainstorming with them.

Maybe make a living selling custom made HELA style cells?

Can I alter my own DNA?

What if I'm a chimera (this happens and is a valid point although I don't think I personally am a chimera).

What if some of my DNA is mutated/altered by me or random cell division errors?

Important questions.
