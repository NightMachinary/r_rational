Me, personally? In a few days?

Hmm. Some detailed drawings of useful things other people could make. A treatise of basic germ and genetic theory. Gravitational theory. Badly understood astronomy and calculus. Basically just an info-dump of things I think would/could be useful for people to tech-jump themselves if in the right hands, ie. a talented, literate alchemist-blacksmith.

I could /make/ some miniature models of things, like plows, waterwheels and waterscrews, keeled boats and tallships, leaf-spring suspension for carts and wagons; other 'basic' machines.

I have no practical chemical knowledge.

I have enough practical medical knowledge that I suppose I could become a competent and successful surgeon, especially what with washing my hands all the time.

I could 'invent' crop rotation, depending on the region.
