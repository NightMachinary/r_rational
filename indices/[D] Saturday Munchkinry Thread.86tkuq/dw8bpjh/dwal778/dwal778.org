I, personally, could make an early wet-cell battery. I could probably make an electric motor and a generator from scratch too. Zinc, copper, iron, vinegar, brine; that's basically the raw materials for level 0 on the electronics tech tree.

I think I could make a steam engine too.

From there I would do my best to go full Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.
