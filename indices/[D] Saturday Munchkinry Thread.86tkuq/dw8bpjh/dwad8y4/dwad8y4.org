Crucible steel is really nice, if you know how to make it. And not too /terribly/ difficult to make if you can already work iron. After that, I would use my prestige from making the strongest metal anyone has ever used to do what a couple others suggested institute a written language and/or create a printing press. This of course is followed by using that to spread modern ideas including, but not limited to:

Basics of Germ Theory and medicine. The basics of Evolution, biology, neurology and psychology. A large portion of Mathematics and physics, including rudimentary electrical technology. A little bit of agricultural science and steam engine mechanics. Cosmology, ethics, and philosophy.

Maybe I'll just make a new religion and use my superior metallurgy, science, tactics, and technology to take over the world. Who knows, maybe if I have help I can get the singularity going before I die. I'll need to reinvent computer science from scratch, since I have no personal knowledge of the field other than basic IT stuff, but with the entire population, maybe I'll find someone brilliant enough to get it going with my guidance and a story about Charles Babage.
