I've gotten a better one, even. It's pretty easy to replicate Pasteur's experiments disproving spontaneous generation with iron-age tech if you know to do so in the first place. Making usable glassware for it might be difficult, but making metalware would be easier. Also, if I'm near the coast and citrus fruits, I can make agar from seaweed and show them Penicillium a millennium early. They won't be able to isolate the stuff for a while, but knowing is more than half the battle on that one.
