Given scrap metal and help from a blacksmith, I could create a prototype for a [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plough][mouldboard plow]]. The real innovations were in having the sharp blade to cut the ground and the wide, curved wings to physically turn the dirt over, exposing dirt that isn't as nutrient starved and aerating the land. We only developed them in the 13-1400s in our world despite it being technically possible to do so far earlier. They're credited with the massive European population spike beginning in the Renaissance which necessitated colonialism just to have a place to dump all the extra people.
