still just a way to make yourself smarter.

okay you do that and i research how to make a minion (maybe dogs or kamikaze birds) obey and mass produce them as fast as possible and order them to kill everyone who does something similar.

then or maybe as soon as I find them, i kill everyone who tries to improve themself

of course who wins would depend who has more calories and how long each approach would take. (also at what point will someone kill everything with a virus, so better to assassinate everyone secretly)

another problem is, that testing a new Idea will always take the same time (the clone becoming an adult). so even if you got lucky with your brain modification, and could come up with new ideas every day, you wouldn`t be able to see if they are really save for a long time

sorry i don't want to be mean, but I think the promises of the singularity highly unlikely. More brainpower will not solve all problems and doesn`t mean you will be in a position, to leverage your brainpower.

also I doubt what society calls a genius is really visible in the DNA. Of course there are some factors that work at least negatively, maybe even a few that would give more brainpower, but it is mostly training which someone makes good.

honestly I expected more of the kind of: make microorganism that make sugar with electricity instead of light -> cheap calories

or put spider silk under your skin ( some claim that would make you bullet resistant)

or find out how to move information directly into the brain (no more schools and easy propaganda tool if it is not direct mind control)
