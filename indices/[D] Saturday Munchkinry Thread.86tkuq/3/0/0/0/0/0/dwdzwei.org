  okay you do that and i research how to make a minion (maybe dogs or kamikaze birds) obey and mass produce them as fast as possible and order them to kill everyone who does something similar. then or maybe as soon as I find them, i kill everyone who tries to improve themself

Given any intelligence improvements will probably be done in secret (you don't want other people to get your research) that plan doesn't remotely work. Also that plan couldn't remotely work for quite a while anyway, since you would need a super long time to make swarms of weaponized animals that obeyed you, since you have to figure out all the genetics the hard way.

  another problem is, that testing a new Idea will always take the same time (the clone becoming an adult). so even if you got lucky with your brain modification, and could come up with new ideas every day, you wouldn`t be able to see if they are really save for a long time

See I thought the incubator could create full grown clones of you. If it can only function as an artificial womb then this setting is starting to sound basically like real life except with slightly better gene editing and artificial wombs.

  or find out how to move information directly into the brain (no more schools and easy propaganda tool if it is not direct mind control)
#+end_quote

See that seems like it has nothing to do with genetics here since no other animals transfer memories like that so there's no genes to copy and creating something like that from scratch is likely to be harder than something like intelligence enhancement.

  also I doubt what society calls a genius is really visible in the DNA. Of course there are some factors that work at least negatively, maybe even a few that would give more brainpower, but it is mostly training which someone makes good.

Given IQ is 80% heritable you don't need to know what you're doing at first, just copy genetics from existing geniuses. Then you can figure out more advanced stuff later once you're already a genius.
