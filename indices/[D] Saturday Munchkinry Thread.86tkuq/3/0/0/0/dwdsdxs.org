Given you already mention fixing aging and other complex traits I was imagining they start with some good knowledge.

However even if they don't they can still get started pretty quickly by copying the neurology of geniuses until they find a way to reliably produce it. Then once most everyone in the world is a genius you expect that research would go extremely quickly. After many people likely realize the incredible stakes here so some people would be killing hundreds of clones in order to test out neurological improvements (for instance birds have vastly denser and more efficient brains than us) and every time they found something that works they could immediately use that to speed up their research speed with their new enhanced intelligence.\\
It's hard to say exactly how long that process would take compared to if they started with a lot of genetic/neurological knowledge however it might reasonably happen in a few years. Plus it might be highly exponential so once the first group made enough progress (and enhanced their intelligence enough) it's possible it might speed up from there into something resembling a foom, after all relatively small neurological changes can be pretty dramatic in their effects.
