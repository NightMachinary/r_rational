You have the power to precisely control the growth of your own body.

- The power can cause any cell containing your DNA connected to your original body by an unbroken chain of your cells to split, turn into any other human cell type or kill itself.
- Your mind has an instinctive understanding of your body's constructive potential so you don't have to micromanage blood supply etc. unless you choose to.
- Creating new cells requires resources as usual, so you have to eat lots if you plan on lots of growth.
- The human mind is assumed to be close to an intelligence limit so the obvious answer of expanding your brain isn't productive. You can, however, create new independent brains.
