The Worm fanfic [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/amelia-worm-au.13577/][Amelia]] should provide inspiration.

Is the power as course-grained as the three options per cell imply or could I copy my brain down to the memories?

Which of my cortices controls my power? The motor cortex? An extra? Leaving at least that one out of a copy of my brain would let me experiment on it to see if I can, say, grow around a bunch of electrodes to make a brain-computer interface.

Money begets food begets brains begets online mechanical turk work begets money. It might be tough to explain what I need all those milk tankers for. Perhaps I could leave a copy of my original self in place to take over my life, which might also be useful as someone to inform the feds if I ever accidentally myself into insanity and become Nilbog. Copies in the role of illegal immigrants could handle face-to-face interactions, but it'd be awkward if any are deported. How common is identity theft by lookalikes?
