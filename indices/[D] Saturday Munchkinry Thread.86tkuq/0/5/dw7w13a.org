Do you mean that his body temperature reaches 3k Celsius without causing him harm? That's a neat trick. It would make you deadly in hand-to-hand combat, as anyone who touches you gets burned alive. However it could also set the room on fire.

With the ability to absorb kinetic energy (on touch?) you can block any weapon, then release the energy to send it springing back into it's owner. However this violates conservation of momentum.
