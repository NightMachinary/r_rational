With conservation of momentum I've had it that he still moves with attacks, but he doesn't take damage from the kinetic energy. Not sure if that's strictly accurate, but I am being a little lenient on myself in that department. Edit: wouldn't some things bounce off of him, if momentum were conserved but he just absorbed the kinetic energy?

He usually wears gear that's thermally non-conductive, but I've also allowed him the ability to "shift" that heat around in his body so he doesn't burn things when he takes his mask off or grabs someone's hand.
