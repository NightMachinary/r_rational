If his fine control is good enough he should be able to survive without breathing for some fairly absurd periods of time (eventually he would need oxygen for collagen production type of time scales) by selectively exciting atoms sufficient to break their bonds and positioning them via vibration/motion in such a way that they fall into a shape that supports the chemical chain he wants.

Given sufficient finesse and scope of awareness he should be able to do transmutation of materials short of actually making atoms. Although if you consider 'temperature' to be a vibration it should also be possible for him to also instigate fission and fusion reactions by 'shaking' neutrons and atomic nuculi into each other.

What I'm saying is that with enough control he should be able to make a sun happen.
