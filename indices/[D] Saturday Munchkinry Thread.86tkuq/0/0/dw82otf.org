*Flight*: Not just any flight, but almost perfect flight. No need to turn gradually. No need to accelerate gradually. No need to worry about momentum. Assuming he can convert kinetic to heat and back very quickly, he can do all kinds of crazy stunts like instantly stopping, instantly changing directions, and staying perfectly still without any need to generate lift.

*Superspeed*: Just apply your flight ability while staying on the ground.

*Physical and Temperature Invulnerability*: Any kind of attack that deals damage using physical force, heat, or cold can be nullified just by converting its energy away. The only limiting factor is how fast your MC can convert one energy type into another. The amount of energy he can store isn't much of an issue since he can funnel the excess energy into firing stuff away from him at super speeds.

*Ridiculously Maneuverable Vehicles*: One reason we don't have super fast vehicles is the squishiness of the driver. If the vehicle accelerates or turns too fast, the driver will be crushed by the forces exerted on the human body to change its speed and direction. The reason this kills the driver is that the particles that make up his body will have different amounts of kinetic energy, causing them to squish together or tear apart. Your MC will have no such issues if he can distribute the kinetic energy equally to every part of his body (he can't just convert it all to heat, or he blast out of the vehicle). Then again, your MC probably doesn't need the vehicle other than as a nice way to carry things with him.

*Super-strength*: Sort of? You can give objects kinetic energy to make them move upwards or throw them really hard. You can absorb their downwards kinetic energy to make them float in midair. It isn't quite the same as having super-strength, but you will be able to act as if you do have super-strength.
