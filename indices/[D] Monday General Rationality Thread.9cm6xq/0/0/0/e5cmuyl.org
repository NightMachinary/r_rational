Yeah , though there are not much more ai safety nonprofits either . And all of them are doing different parts of basic research so Its difficult to tell at this point which ones will end up being relevant .

How much competent researchers consider the problem important enough to work on it will probably be more important that money , unless you had the enormous amounts of money necessary to change that .

Miri has had some impact on the field , independently on how useful their research ends up being . But its not very clear if them having more money would change anything significant .
