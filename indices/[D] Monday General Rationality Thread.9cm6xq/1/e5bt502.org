So I'm planning to start my first ever quest. TL;DR the quest is about having strange dreams where you explore a world of horror in a bombed city.

Type - Exploration/Mystery/Experimentation

Genre - Horror/Mystery/Journey

Here's my current [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JHLywZ8JPwUhB5CrGHwBW2dZEzShti6KAYdWhOsDLCI/edit][draft]] of the first chapter for anyone interested.

But I have questions about running a quest that I hope people here can provide advice on:

- I want to do an exploration/mystery style quest. This means that I don't want offer any choices and every post will be write-ins only. Should I expect issues with this?
- I have no idea what would be better to post this quest to. SpaceBattles or SufficientVelocity (or some third option I haven't considered). Or should I go with both and combine votes from both sites?
- I dislike quests where the character does things out-of-character depending on the vote. So I want to do a trait system where the character will have bonuses or maluses depending in how in-line the vote is with their (determined) personality. The trait system is inspired by [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dragon-ball-after-the-end.30940/][Dragon Ball: After the End]]. Since it sounds like it might conflict with my desire to only allow write-ins, will this be a problem?
- What style of voting would work best? I know of [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nettally-vote-tally-program.508853/][NetTally]] and am tentatively deciding on approval voting.
- A lot of quests have game mechanics, but I want the quest to be character-driven and to focus on the actions taken rather than stats. Will I run into issues without having stats?
- Anything else I should be aware of?
