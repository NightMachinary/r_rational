I'm wondering if anyone is interested in exhanging notes from what we read or watch? Personally what I gain from notetaking is remembering better, and when it's meant to be shared I'm forced to be more organized, explain context etc. Receiving notes will of course yield a high gain low cost output, lets me know of its existence and see if it's worth the read.

It's supposed to be a “whenever the mood strikes” kind of thing - I'm in a reading heavy period now but I often go long periods without consuming all that much information. Neither do I feel like taking notes everytime I read. It would only be when either party feels like it.

Books currently on my reading list are: The Crowd by Gustave le Bon, Strategic Interaction by Erwin Gottman, Crystallizing Public Opinion by Edward Bernays, Notes On Directing by Frank Hauser, The Magus by John Fowler, 100 Deadly Skills by Clint Emerson.
