I'm skeptical of its effectiveness, mainly because I've encountered more than a few people who believe that AI is what we should all be focusing on, and who still doubt that MIRI in particular is the optimal AI risk nonprofit. I haven't seen anyone write up something on what we'd expect from the ideal AI risk nonprofit, either, so as a layperson in a complicated field, I don't think I'm well equipped to judge MIRI's effectiveness myself.
