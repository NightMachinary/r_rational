Interesting so far, although I agree that there's not enough to make any firm judgements yet.

Starting a story /in media res/ is... I'm not going to say it's a /bad/ choice, but it's writing a check that you'd better be confident in your ability to pay off.

There's some blatant narrative contrivance here, but I don't have any problem whatsoever with that when setting up the premise of a story. Just as long as it isn't indicative of a habit (which, again, way too early to tell).

I'm a little confused by the story having the framing device (narration from the POV of the character as she's being tortured) at the beginning of the first two chapters, but not including it for the third.

I like the tone, I like the snark (first person smartass is the best story perspective), I like that I can see mysteries already starting to get set up in anticipation for future chapters; hopefully, those are paid off well.

Thanks for sharing it!
