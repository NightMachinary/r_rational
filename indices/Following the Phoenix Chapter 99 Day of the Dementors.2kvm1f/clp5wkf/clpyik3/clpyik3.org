Quirrell cannot cast the Patronus charm.

He has been shown to be seriously weak to Dementation in the past.

He learned the truth about Dementors, and he fears death.

He wants Harry Potter to become a Hero, worshiped by the masses.

So, with all these facts, why /wouldn't/ he arrange a situation in which every Dementor on the planet is destroyed by Harry Potter and those who he taught?

It eliminates one of his most glaring weaknesses (One which Harry Potter and Dumbledore both know about), removes the one creature that Avada Kedavra doesn't work on from the world, spreads terror in the name of Voldemort making his eventual defeat even more prestigious, and gives Harry the chance to be the hero.

It hits all the points.
