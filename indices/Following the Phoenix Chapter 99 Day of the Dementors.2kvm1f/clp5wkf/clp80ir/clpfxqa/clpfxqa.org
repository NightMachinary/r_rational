That... seems a bit too easy. I suspect that Dementors are caused by Death, rather than being the cause of Death. I mean, we already know about the physiological causes of Death, or at least that in most cases Dying Is Caused By Physical Things. Removing Dementors from the equation won't change the physics of being stabbed by a knife, or the reproductive tendencies of microbes, or anything.
