Thank you for doing this, I don't know what we would do without you!

Btw, I think you should put [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9915682/1/The-Last-Christmas][The Last Christmas]] (originally by name The-Day-That-Santa-Stole-Christmas) in the other fics. It's written really well (although a bit short) and it uses all rational tropes fantastically.
