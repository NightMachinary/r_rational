I would actually do it if I knew that most people wanted it. Like, do we, as a community, want to rename it to Rational Fiction? I'm not sure if it's that good because it kinda makes it sound a bit like every other fiction is horribly irrational and dumb, whereas RationalFic sounds a bit more palatable.

...or maybe I'm talking out of my ass. I don't really know.
