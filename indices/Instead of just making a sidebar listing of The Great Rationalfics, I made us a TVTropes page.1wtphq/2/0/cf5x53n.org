I assume you meant Wiz Biz, by Rick Cook.

I really don't feel like Wiz Biz teaches any useful lessons at all, really - I mean, it has the trappings of computer science mixed with the trappings of magic, but overall it has basically no lessons to teach, and it isn't particularly well-written - basically, it has nothing to commend it to my attention as particularly rational, or even interesting.

I don't hate it. It wasn't interesting enough to hate, or even feel strongly at all about. I just thought it was sort of 'blah'.
