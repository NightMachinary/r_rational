It's a good page. I understand why there is currently such a heavy emphasis on fanfiction on the page, but do we expect that emphasis to fade with time, to the point where a more general page might be RationalFic*tion*? As an aspiring Fantasy author myself, I like to imagine everything above the Bonus Points section applies to my project.
