"Unlimited power requires unlimited energy" (rephrased) isn't a valid argument against the proposition that a superintelligence would be extremely powerful.

That's like saying "Accelerating to the speed of light would require infinite energy, therefore it is impossible to travel faster than 5 km/h"
