Jeph Jacques' comic features hipsters in a coffee shop making snarky comics, who incidentally happen to have robot AI companions.

I think this is the first time that there is serious discussion on their post-singularity world, if it could be called that. Ironically, the combat droid Bubbles is the AI that has the most to say on the subject and I like her logic.

The follow-up comic "Happy Thoughts" takes it a step further discussing the Singularity AI p-zombie simulating the 'cold uncaring universe'
