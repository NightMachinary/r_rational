Calm down. It's a valid concept in the /Questionable Content/ setting, because the author uses "conscious" to mean "thinks like a human". Which, really, is all it's ever meant. Most AIs in the story, from [[http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1999][sentient toasters]] to [[http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=2113][space stations]] still act like people, so they need a word for "human or AI" (it's important for discussions of AI rights). And once they settled on "conscious", it makes sense to discuss the possibility that someone will build a type of mind that isn't based off humans.
