A direct rebuttal does not imply upset.

  It's a valid concept in the Questionable Content setting, because the author uses "conscious" to mean "thinks like a human".

That seems reasonable as a premise. But it doesn't fit with use of the term p-zombie at all. A p-zombie supposedly thinks it is human('conscious') but is not. There doesn't seem to be any compelling reason to presume a non-human mind would think itself to be human.
