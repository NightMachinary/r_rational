Why do people think p-zombies is a valid concept? One of its essential premises is [[https://scientiasalon.wordpress.com/2014/08/04/p-zombies-are-inconceivable-with-notes-on-the-idea-of-metaphysical-possibility/][fundamentally magical thinking]] -- 'because I can think of a world where X is the case, X must be possible'.

Not really trying to prompt a discussion here, just disappointed that a discussion that started off credible ended up at p-zombies.
