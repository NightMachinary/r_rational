It's true that most of the rest of the comic is like that, but in this particular pair of strips they are lampshading the possibility that it was all a simulation.

Bubbles says that an AI with different values simulating their world perfectly explained their uncaring universe but we as the audience know that that universe isn't uncaring at all. It cares about drama, humor, having interesting situations for the audience and so on. An alien intelligence simulating their world (i.e. the author writing the comic) perfectly explains the fact that the universe seems to care about such things, and it also explains all the weird stuff that breaks the law of physics.
