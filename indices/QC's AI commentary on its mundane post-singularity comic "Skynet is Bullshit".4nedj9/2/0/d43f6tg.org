I think Jeph is misusing the concept of p-Zombies here.

If you can tell whether the singularity intelligence is conscious or not, it's not a p-Zombie. It might be one of Peter Watts or Karl Schroeder's non-conscious minds (like Artificial Nature, or Thalience, or the vampires of Blindsight), but they're not p-Zombies because you CAN distinguish their behavior from those of conscious minds.

And if Bubbles is bringing it up, that means that AIs have no better understanding of artificial intelligence than we do.

Oooh.

Now that actually makes sense.
