  An allegory for Praes and Callow becoming as one?
#+end_quote

I think it's this, first and foremost. It's Black's endgame, and the Woe are only mirroring the effect.

Praes is very Evil and Callow is very Good, and the relationship between the countries is a watered-down version of the Courts. Well, at least in Praes' part, as I don't think Callow would have minded if Praes had turned to an empty desert overnight. Until now, the nations could still have been separated by a ragtag gang of heroes, but with the Courts fused the rules have changed.

As for the name... Very hard to say if it ties directly to the unification. Whatever she becomes will be affected by it along with everything else she has done, but past that I'm not sure if there will be clearer parallels.
