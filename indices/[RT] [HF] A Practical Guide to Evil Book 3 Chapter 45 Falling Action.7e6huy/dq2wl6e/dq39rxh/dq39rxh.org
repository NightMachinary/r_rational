This assuming that she retains the /ability/ to open paths to Arcadia once her heart is returned and fealty to Winter removed. That would be a pretty typically fae fulfilment of the letter but not the spirit of a bargain.

I don't think it'll happen, as it would be narratively unfair at this point. Maybe as a de-powering later on to bring the start of the next book closer to status quo at the start of this one. But for now she should be able to act on the bargain.
