From a previous chapter:

  “That,” the Empress said quietly, “is worrying. Wekesa once told me that Arcadia is akin to a first draft of Creation, and mirrors it still. If Winter is meant to he be the reflection of villainy, and yet bound to it, there are... implications.”

Winter and Summer are now married and one court. If Winter is the first draft of villainy, then Summer would be the first draft of heroism... what does that mean for Creation?

- Blended teams? The Woe are already going down this path.

- More ambiguously aligned Names? Ranger and her apprentices tend to be more neutral than Good or Evil; could it be that most Names will be like that going forward?

- An allegory for Praes and Callow becoming as one?

- A new path for Cat's next Name? IIRC, Grey Knight isn't going to happen as per the author, but that doesn't mean she needs to become the next Black (or White) Knight either.
