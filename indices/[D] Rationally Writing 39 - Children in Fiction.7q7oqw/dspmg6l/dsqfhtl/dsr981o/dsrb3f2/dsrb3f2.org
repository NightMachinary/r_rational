I do agree that these are hallmarks of childish behavior, but I think the mechanism is "newness" rather than something more fundamental to their neurology.

Like, a kid is more likely to laugh, cry, and hurt others impulsively in a variety of situations compared to an adult.

But if you put a kid in an environment in which they cry very often to the same thing, most will quickly acclimate and approach levels more similar to adults in terms of impulsive crying about that thing.

Part of that may generalize to the other impulsive/emotional reactions, but maybe not. In any case, what I don't think you'll see is a reset to a base state where they just continually are prone to crying often about that thing: they could still be "childish" in the way they react to things that bring them joy or make them angry, but be more mature in specific ways that make sense for their environment/upbringing.
