Maybe? I guess that's an empirical question. But of course there can always be exceptions, and I know for a fact that motivation can improve executive functioning a lot (momentarily).

But still. Isn't impulsiveness and a general lack of control hallmarks of childish behavior? Children get easily into new things, laugh, cry and hurt each other without thinking, but are also quick to forgive, and generally do not plan much for the long term.

This is not rational behavior and will thus be deempathized in rational fiction. But because we feel this to be central to what is means to be a child, I think depicting children without these qualities makes them harder to recognize as children. (Never mind that there might be some real world counterexamples.)
