On the topic of speech, I think it can actually be more realistic for kids to speak with a /more/ elevated diction and vocabulary than their adult counterparts might.

Speaking from my own experience, as a kid, my view was mostly that the point of having a large vocabulary was to use the biggest words possible and impress listeners with unfamiliar words. At the age of 9, whenever I was in a conversation with someone and they had to interrupt me to ask for the definition of a word I'd just used, I took it as a positive sign, because it meant that I was winning at some imaginary game I'd constructed in my head where every conversation was a contest to see who could speak in the most grandiloquent way possible.

As I got older, I realized that the purpose of having a expansive vocabulary wasn't so that I could use the most complex words, but so that I could use the /right/ words: sometimes, this means using bigger words when they remove ambiguity, but preferring smaller words when they can communicate an idea just as effectively. Under this model, any moment where someone has to stop you to ask you for the definition of a word shouldn't be taken as a sign of success, but a possible sign of failure on your part, because it can be an indication that your choice of words has failed to successfully communicate the idea that you were trying to convey to the listener.

I don't know very many adults who talk like Artemis Fowl. But I've met plenty of 12-year-olds who talk like Artemis Fowl (and I was one of them). Some kids (especially a lot of "smart kids") are under the mistaken notion that the point of language is to show off how smart you are. Most adults seem to understand that the point of language is to effectively communicate ideas, rather than to seem impressive. (I like to think of use of buzzwords as one of the exceptions that proves the rule, as people who talk about "corporate synergy" are probably more interested in seeming impressive and cultivating an aura of eminence than actually communicating whatever idea they're talking about.)

Also connected to this is the notion that using more words to explain an idea makes you sound smarter. (As a child, I delivered lots of rambling explanations that were more about demonstrating how many facts I had memorized about a subject, rather than actually trying to explain it in a way that the listener would understand.) In reality, the people who have the greatest understanding of a subject are often the ones most capable of delivering a concise and easily-understood explanation.

This also connects to a broader point, which is that certain speech patterns (such as demonstrating a large vocabulary) can be a form of signaling, and a strong desire to signal intelligence is often a sign of /immaturity/. (For examples, see [[/r/iamverysmart]].) People who are actually well-read usually don't go out of their way to appear erudite.

(As an autobiographical note, one of the things that helped me overcome this childhood mentality was living abroad during from age 13 while my dad was working at a Chinese university. One of the reasons I enjoyed using big words and speaking "impressively" as a kid was that using words that not everybody understood allowed me to feel a certain sense of intellectual superiority. When I was outside the US, I was confronted with the fact (obvious now in retrospect) that there were plenty of people whose English vocabulary wasn't as large as mine, but who still outclassed me intellectually; the fact that I could speak English in a more extravagant manner than a Chinese physicist didn't mean I was "smarter" than he was.)

One thing I'd like to do more in my writing is portray children's misuse of language. Partly, I just enjoy this idea because it's often "cute" and can be a source of fun and/or funny moments, but I think that the way that children (mis)speak can often reveal a lot about their understanding of language, which can indicate how they think. As an autobiographical example, at around age 3, I had the following exchange with my mother:

#+begin_quote
  Mom: Did Daddy go to the store?

  Me: Daddy goed to the store.

  Mom: Daddy /went/ to the store.

  Me: Daddy wented to the store.
#+end_quote

As a 3-year-old, I apparently understood conjugation of verbs well enough to intuit that the past tense of "go" was "goed," and, went confronted with the new verb "went," assumed that I had to conjugate it in the same way. It might be a bit of revisionist history, and odds are pretty good that the experience of "Junior understands verb conjugation" is about as unique as "Junior learns how to walk," but there's a part of me that wants to draw a logical through-line from that point of understanding verb conjugation and my career today as a professional writer. At the very least, it was an enjoyable and memorable moment (not for me, but memorable enough for my mother to recollect the incident and tell me about it decades later), and there's a good chance that specific moment altered my mother's understanding of what kind of child I was. (To point out the obvious and explain how this pertains directly to the topic of writing, the job of an author is to control and guide the reader's understanding of the characters and inform the audience about kind of people they are, and it's often done through small moments like these.)

On the topic of character ages, one of the things I've gleaned from conversations with YA authors and editors is that kids (and teens) want to read stories about characters who talk, act, and think like they do, but they also want their heroes to be a few years older than they are so they can "look up" to them and have a sense of "I'll get there one day." (That sense of "I'll get there one day" can also help young readers overcome a sense of envy that can arise from the realization that the characters they're reading about have lives that are much more exciting and interesting than their own.) One of the effects of this is that you have a lot of YA characters who behave like 14-year-olds but are canonically 16 years old. (The same is true of some middle grade fiction, to a lesser extent, where the characters' canonical age is 1-2 years higher than their behavior would imply.) I think that this also can make it easier for adult readers to connect to these characters, because while many adult readers are fully capable of sympathizing with a 14-year-old character, they find it easier to connect with a character who is reported to be 16 years old in the text than they would if that character had a reported age of 14. (A similar idea is expressed in [[http://pervocracy.tumblr.com/post/169407780474/people-always-make-fun-of-moviesshows-about][this post]] about how adults might have an easier time connecting with TV shows and movies about teenagers when those characters are portrayed by actors in their 20's, because it makes the stakes feel more real when the characters on screen look more physically mature.)
