Nice episode! I think this is an especially tricky point for rational fiction, but not only for the reasons discussed here.

It's obviously true that kids can be unusually mature and intelligent for their ages, as well as having more experience than usual. And of course you can take some liberties with speech patterns and the like (we do that when writing adults after all).

But rational characters need not only be good at memorizing stuff and computing Bayes factors. They also need to be able to plan their actions well, respond to complexity and act calmly under pressure. This is an area where experience or unusual iq can't really compensate fully. Children have undeveloped brains, and it's especially the prefrontal lobes, and thus capacity for executive functioning and emotional inhibition, that is impaired. This makes them bad choices for MCs generally, and I think especially in rational fiction.

(Not that I think it's always a problem though. In hpmor the mc is such an alien that age doesn't even seem to apply. And in pokemon I kind of forget their ages altogether which helps with suspension of disbelief. But I think this is something many miss when writing children. Possibly because we don't normally see even mature children act under the kinds of pressure there are in most stories? While they can seem mature in basic social situations, this could maybe blind us a bit to their neuropsychological impairments?)
