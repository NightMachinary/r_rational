I really like your description of certain types of children using big words to sound smarter, and just realized it should probably be a character flaw that Red's grown out of, or at least a criticism of him that Blue has said before. It seems difficult to make a main character have that flaw while also thinking of high level and precise concepts, but maybe I should experiment with it to see if it can come off without being too annoying :)
