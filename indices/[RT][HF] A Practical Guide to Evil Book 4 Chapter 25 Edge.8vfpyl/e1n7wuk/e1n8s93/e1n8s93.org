Interesting theory... we know that Chancellor's eventually betraying their rulers and taking up the throne is a common plot in Praesi stories, so with such a move she eventually paves the way for her own path to becoming Dread Empress...

I'm curious as to how Cat views the Name of Chancellor, we know the Calamities and Malicia are actively destroying any trace of the Name but we don't know what Cat thinks of it. Adjutant, to her, feels like the same role a chancellor might take, but without the chronic scheming/backstabbing inherent to Praesi culture. But honestly I think if Akua gains any /overt/ power, Cat will just wipe her soul and be done with it.
