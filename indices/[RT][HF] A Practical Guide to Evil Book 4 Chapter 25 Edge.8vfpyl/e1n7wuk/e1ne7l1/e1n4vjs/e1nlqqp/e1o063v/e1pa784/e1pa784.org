With apoligies to [[/u/ErraticErrata]] if I am stealing his thunder, let's reinforce your statement with some context. This is a story is which the /Woe/ are superseding/replacing//upsurping?/ the /Calamities/, and our protagonist? Catherine *the foundling* is in her early twenties and was born after the conquest; in that time:

- Maliciea, who is not a member of the Calamities has ruled over Praes and Callow ruling via noble infighting, Black and her unstated but overt (to Black and Cat) condonement of the Lies tragedy on top of the no doubt larger slaughters she has caused as well as ultimate responsibility for the bleeding to expand the green stretch by ritual magic.

- Black who has been Malicia's red right hand uprooting rebellion in Callow, and in which capacity has (reluctantly) established the rule of governors, his death toll is less then Malicia's only because he isn't responsible for Liesse, or anything else he didn't know about, but the rape and murder we see in the first chapter are explicitly /his fault/ even if he is cleaning it up and inducts Cat i n the progress /after all that was his goal/, or did you think he allowed the governors without a good cause?

- Tyrant, tyrant has no redeeming qualities other than raising Hierarch to a *Name*, I am saddened to say that may spare him.

- Trismegistus(sp?) The dead king. The guy has been a litch for more than two thousand years, zombified the entire nation he ruled, and may only have not conquered the rest of creation because he 1) is now bound by demon rules for conquering a hell 2) was bound by the empress Triumphant /may she never return/ 3) Is busy studying like Warlock or Hierophant to become a big G God, or something else

- William who was going to *soul rape* a major city (I'm assuming a million plus but an archive dive may provide a lower number; but this isn't murder, it's /soul rape/ aka fucking mind crime, something maybe deserving true death even after we defeat death)

In this larger context Ubua really does qualify as a:
