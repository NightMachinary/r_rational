A heroic redemption arc is only possible for people who were only token villains/victims of circumstance etc. in case of villains like Akua who have committed mass atrocities on a grand scale without even a shred of regret/remorse, the best that can be done with is redemption equals death, along with the fact that I don't really see /any/ of the choirs willingly granting Akua fucking Sahelian their power to "do good".

Unless there was a bigger threat that they would need her /specifically/ for... like the Dead King.

And Cat has precedent in cheating the "death" part of the narrative by technically dying...

But even with all that, the very idea of Akua as a hero would change pretty much everything about the endgame... like, if the choirs get super desperate and make Akua their champion, it could have far reaching implications regarding the whole Good v Evil story that calernia is modelled on. If someone who has murdered a hundred thousand people as a /distraction/ can qualify as a "good" person, then what is Evil anyway?

I could totally see it happening though, that's scary...
