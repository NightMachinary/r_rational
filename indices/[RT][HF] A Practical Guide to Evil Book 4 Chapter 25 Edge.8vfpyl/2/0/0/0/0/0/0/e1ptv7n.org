However much of a threat Catherine eventually becomes, as long as she holds on to her ideals of achieving lasting peace for her people, there is no real danger to anything that the Gods Above proclaim, other than just the changing of the status quo of Callow with regards to the eternal conflict in Calernia.

And if, for the Gods Above, status quo is greater than all else, then yeah they will be super desperate to destroy Catherine.

Buuut recruiting Akua Sahelian, whose evil deeds are known throughout Calernia, would present a very similar dilemma. If she becomes a "hero" or acquires a "heroic mantle" then that means that the Gods Above condone her actions, and then that means they no longer have justification to go on crusades against Malicia OR the Dead King... THAT seems like a much more certain death of the status quo than anything Catherine can do just by sitting in Callow...
