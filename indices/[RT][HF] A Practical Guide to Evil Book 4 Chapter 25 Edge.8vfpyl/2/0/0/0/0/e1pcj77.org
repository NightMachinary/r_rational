This kind of ignores the morality of the Gods Above. To them, it's not mind rape, it's the call to arms for people to fight for a "good" cause, and apparently it's a weapon given to William by the Gods themselves, so we can be assured that they're fine with mindraping innocents as long as it's for a "good" cause, i.e. fighting "evil". And they accepted the sacrifice of William's life as the penalty for doing so, basically redeeming him of any notion of "crime" by his death.

Ubua is /definitely/ not a "villain of circumstance", you can see that in the 3 stories trap that she laid for Catherine. Every single different story ended with Akua murdering her way to power and asking Cat to kneel before her. Which kinda means that she would've been a villain no matter the circumstance, because it's a part of her.

Maybe before second Liesse she maybe, might have had a very very microscopic chance to get a mantle from the heavens, if she expressed contrition or mercy or whatever other choir qualities there are (consider if she would even be capable of doing so). But after the massacre, Akua is an abomination to the gods, because not only did she kill those people, she turned them into undead that can't be killed with priestly healing, which is basically an /insult/ straight to the faces of the gods above, basically defying their authority over undead, and she herself is a soul in a cape, going against the concept of life and death that the Above preaches.

So, no, I don't think the gods above will gift a heroic mantle to Akua unless there is a much much bigger threat and they're very very desperate. And if/when they do this, it will be a turning point in the history of calernia.

And I think the Above knows this, and won't make that mistake.
