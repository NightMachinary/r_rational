Imagine if that becomes the case, I keep imaging Akua as some Hero's spirit guide in 1000 year. Trapped in the mantle of woe and buried with Catherine, some hero goes to the site of this great evil for loot and treasure, they stumble upon this dark cloak, covered in patches of banners and magic resistant. He puts it on and is filled with cold hungry power that they must learn to control without it controlling them, and then a beautiful Woman appears from nowhere telling them that now that he owns the cloak she will teach him to master it's power. Years down the line when they are moments from victory and at the height of their power, she rips it away from them, their power having failed they die, only hearing the laughter of their closest friend as she watches. Would be a great tragedy.
