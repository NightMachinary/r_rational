Shower thought: what if Akua, being positively certain that Cat is the next Dread Empress, is willingly putting herself in a position of complete submission to her in exchange for being her most useful tool in political regards? She's already replaced Aisha as Cat's closest political advisor and now she has found a way to directly interact with others while holding this same position of political right-hand to the crown. All this while also strengthening Cat's leash over her, which she knows is a prerequisite condition to her continued existence.

Said another way, what if Akua is building her claim to the Name of Chancellor?
