Remember that Akua has a specific view of what Praes is.

#+begin_quote
  “Praes is a story,” she said. “A Tyrant to lead us. A Black Knight to break heroes. A Warlock to craft wonders. A Chancellor to rule behind them. And an Empire like clay, to shape into the tool they need: an entire nation built to empower the ambitions of a single villain.”

Cat is currently building something that look a bit like that (though it's not her endgame) and there's no one that quite fits the Chancellor role yet. Hakram doesn't rule, he administrates (the current "chancellor" of Callow is Kendal). He's also too important to Cat to stay on purely political duties. Besides, his lack of backstabbing tendancies is a point against him here, Chancellors are supposed to treacherous. Kendall, Ratface and Talbot would be contenders but they all lack the narrative weight that Akua has.

Akua is currently working on two things: making herself useful and make herself untouchable. My theory is that, by becoming one with Winter as she's shown to be, Akua hopes that Catherine can't easily kill her anymore. Doing so would damage her too much. And if it makes Akua absolutely enslaved to Cat's will, well, then she's not a threat anymore and can be worked with. She only needs to keep her game under wraps until she can't be easily removed anymore, which she is more than capable of given that it was her main scheme for two entire books.

That said, while I think that's her plan, I don't think it will work out quite like that.
