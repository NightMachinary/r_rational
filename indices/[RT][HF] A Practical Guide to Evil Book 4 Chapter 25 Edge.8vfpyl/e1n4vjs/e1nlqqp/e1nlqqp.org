Is it Cat's redemption story or Akua's. I've never seen a single point that makes me think Cat misses the redemption story (her I ternal monologue is noticibly blank of rejecting it outright) and many beats where she's almost as outraged as Black by heroic hax, Akua would see that as more power and Cat needs an opposite number enfocing the Liesse accords. If I'm mistaken please point out the quotes, but I think Cat is reluctantly crafting a hero who she can have soulbound to the accords.
