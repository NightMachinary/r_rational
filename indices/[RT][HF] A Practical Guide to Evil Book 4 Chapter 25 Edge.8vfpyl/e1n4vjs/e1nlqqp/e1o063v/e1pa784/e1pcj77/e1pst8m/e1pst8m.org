  Unless there is a much bigger threat

How big of a threat do you think the foundling is going to get? I think we agree on how evil a monster Akua is, but differ on what the tyrant God's above will be forced to choose as Cat continues to ramp up. Cat doesn't go through a book without achieving a /significant/ power-up, and with The Dead King, and The Grey Pilgrim on the board there is a choice of redemption; or Eldritch power usurpation; or establishing precident for diplomatic peace with things athetical to the gods if she can get him roaming and leaving outside his borders, and at a negotiation table. Cat doesn't want redemption it'd just put her on the side of the light psycos instead of the dark ones, and her last power up while of winter/unseelie court is far not magical or divine (generally an other thematically at right angles or at least skewed off axis to the good evil poles). Someone is probably going to get redeemed with the Grey Pilgrim in the heart of Callow but it's a fools move for Cat, and then there's the Dead King and Cat is carrying the soul of the only other practicioner to create a greater breech . . . Who really got invited?
