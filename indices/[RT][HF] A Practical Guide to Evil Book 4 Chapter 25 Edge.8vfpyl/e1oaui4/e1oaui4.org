I think we have Akua working to become the Black Queen. This means that at a key moment, Cat can step out of the role and let Akua take the fall for it.

I am imagining a deal where the Black Queen swears to give up her life at a predetermined event or time, and Cat later agrees to let Akua take that mantle. We already know Akua is unaware of things that occur when she isn't freed.
