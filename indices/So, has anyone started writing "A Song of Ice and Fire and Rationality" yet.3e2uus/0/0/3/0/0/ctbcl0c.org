I mean, there doesn't have to be any rational to deciding your goals - the rational part comes in enacting them. There's certainly some irrationality there in their means, but most of what 'seems' irrational to us is just the aims, which really you can't rationally choose.

I think that in this world, you have to expect that any of the old religions that the great families follow probably have some truth to them. Based on the advantage that we've seen the religions give you (look like any person, revive the dead, create a shadow vagina assasin, etc.) it's hard to believe that anyone who didn't have supernatural help would stay in a position of power very long.
