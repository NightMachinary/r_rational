I'm pretty sure religion was a big part of the reason (or at least the explanation) for the traditional dark ages concept of honour. I figure if anyone understood honour, it would be those guys right? And to my knowledge most of them thought they were being judged every day, so I disagree.

E: If you think honour is explicitly separate from religion, and the best analogue to Ned's honour is in the middle ages, then you must be talking about a type of honour which is different than Ned's honour.
