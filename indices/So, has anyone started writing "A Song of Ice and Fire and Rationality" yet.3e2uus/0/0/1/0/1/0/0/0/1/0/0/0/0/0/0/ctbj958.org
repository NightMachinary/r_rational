Well it kind of is though. Being altruistic in your motives is mostly irrelevant to being honourable.

Honour means doing what you say you will do and following a strict code of conduct in certain situations. In doing so you become predicable but also gain power because potential followers know you will not betray them if it becomes inconvenient, thus giving you access to greater numbers and quality of fighters (among other benefits). It doesn't really matter much if you're doing it because of earthly or heavenly rewards.

Good is different of course. Building an orphanage reflects better on me if I do it because I like orphans, rather than because the Pan-Galactic Space Cheese told me to, because the former I am more likely to do more good in the future whereas in the latter case I'm just as likely to burn it next week because the Space Cheese is fickle.
