Ned is a more interesting and three-dimensional character than Rational!Harry. Harry is not three-dimensional, he's a diamond sharp /needle/ pointed at exactly what he wants to achieve and utterly indifferent towards everything else. A Rational!Ned would be like that, less characterised, but still entertaining in a sense.
