I'm going to talk about Eddard here and this is going to spoil things from the latest season and book. You have been warned.

I hate it when people talk about Eddard as being "honourable to a fault" or having "honour before reason" because it's just not true. As soon as Eddard gets imprisoned the north rises up in rebellion and crowns Robb king of the north because they would do anything for Eddard and his house. They would go into war against the seven kingdoms if they had to because of their loyalty to the Starks.

While it isn't shown in the series, the books show how the north rebells against the Boltons in hatred because Roose Bolton helped kill Robb. The mountain clans of the north all join up with Stannis to march on Winterfell, the Manderlys join up with the Boltons by necessity but spend their entire time there insulting them and assassinating the Frey retinue present.

Eddard is an honourable man and acts honourably which has given him the most loyal and powerful kingdom out of the seven. He rules a land as large as the other six combined and everyone (with few exceptions) loves him and his house and know he can always be trusted. The north remembers and Eddard and his children will be followed to the ends of the earth.
