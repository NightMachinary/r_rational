Well the people who cheered weren't northeners. The only northener in the crowd almost broke his vows to get Eddard's daughter to safety.

Throughout the series everyone else plays dirty and thus they keep winning but by the end of AdwD the Starks are basically the only house (neutral Martell aren't really relevant) that are still in a position of power. The Starks never compromise and err on the side of honour and therefore they are one of the most powerful houses despite not even having a member of their family not in hiding.

You could balance it out perfectly in theory but in reality that's almost impossible and making compromises would lead to more compromises if things got worse. The Starks stick to what they think is right and that's why they are left while the Lannisters, Baratheons, Tyrell's and all the others have fallen so much further as soon as they lose steam. The north remains as a base no matter what because the Starks are honourable no matter what.
