That would certainly be an effective strategy to pursue. But I have two issues:

1. That's pretty much what the OTL characters try to do.

2. People like Melisandre, Moqorro, Quaithe, Pyat Pree, Jaqen H'Gar....they can't be negotiated with or threatened to act against their own interests and the ultimate interests of their order. And they certainly can't be 'studied'. This isn't X-Men and you're not Colonel Stryker.
