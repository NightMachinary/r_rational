What about the Warlocks? They apparently gained their power from study and consumption of a plant. I'll remind that the infinity clones of the same man in the TV series are not at all the same as the ones from the books.

And even if there are many powers only passed through bloodlines, a little selective breeding and effective child-rearing could help greatly with a long-term plan.
