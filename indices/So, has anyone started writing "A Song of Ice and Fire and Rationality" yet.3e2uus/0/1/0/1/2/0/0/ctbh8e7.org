To my knowledge the Maesters actually use science and rationality to try to kill magic and drive it from the world because it fucks up their plans. That's why they spent generations poisoning the dragons, which incidentally were the sources of much of the magic in the world. The glass candles went out because there wasn't enough ambient magic because all the dragons were dead, and came back on because some more were born.
