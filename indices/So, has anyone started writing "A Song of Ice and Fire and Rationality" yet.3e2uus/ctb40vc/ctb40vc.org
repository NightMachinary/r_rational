We don't know how magic works. Anything a character tries to do without magic will be stomped on by "a rational Maester did it," the Lady of the Church of Fire Always Makes it Better, or the invulnerable zombie apocalypse with an unanalyzable-without-magic weakness.

Gods are real, but we don't know the details. Lots of people have magical powers, even if they're not throwing literal fireballs around. Much. Noble bloodlines have literal power that commoners don't. And that's just the passive stuff.

Instant healing from death or near-death exists, which depending on how it works is a game changer. Precognition exists, which is a game changer. Remote access sensory processes exist, which is a game changer. Precursor civilizations existed, but they were...destroyed by bio-weapons? And they tamed/made dragons? And had advanced or magical materials science? It isn't clear.

Without clear rules the author understands, especially about magic and the supernatural, a story can't be very rational. On the other hand, you could just make it a "real world" version of everything.

Magic doesn't exist. Magical priest-assassins are simply very good at misdirection and disguise. Maesters are simply using preserved sciences from the precursors. Dragons don't breathe fire, are no larger than Golden Eagles, and are even more fragile on the ground. Fire only works like it should, but when you start burning people they fall in line as one would expect. No back from the dead healing, just silk undershirts, ceramic inserts, blood squibs, and artificial adrenaline infusions. Yes bioweapons, no divine right of kings other than as a social construct. Precognition is what it looks like, seizures. Distance viewing is just cold-reading plus strategy knowledge and map reading.
