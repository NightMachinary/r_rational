It /is/ true.

Yes, "Honour" is a useful method for earning trust outside family units and building the reciprocal relationships on which feudalism is built on. But even a "Good Thing" can be a "Bad Thing" if done to excess.

Ned was honourable and that's why people loved him.

But he was /too/ honourable and that's why they cheered as they took off his head.

Same thing with Robb.
