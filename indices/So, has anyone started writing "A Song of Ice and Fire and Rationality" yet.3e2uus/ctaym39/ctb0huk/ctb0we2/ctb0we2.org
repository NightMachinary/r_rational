I think [[#s][]] is most commonly used as an example of "irrationality" but I really do think that this is a case of values; he'd rather die an honorable death than live a dishonorable life. For that reason, I don't think you can call it a lack of rationality, because rationality doesn't mean that you're changing your core values.

Some of the others are more arguable. I think I would defend religious fanaticism when there are actual, verifiable results that come from that religion. There's no excuse for [[#s][]] though.
