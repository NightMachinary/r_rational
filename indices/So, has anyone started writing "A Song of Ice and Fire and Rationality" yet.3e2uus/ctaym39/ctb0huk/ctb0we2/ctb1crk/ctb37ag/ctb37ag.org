I think he has multiple values which come into conflict with each other (which is good characterization). Simply saying "his family was more important to him, ergo he should have behaved dishonorably from the time he got to King's Landing" is simplifying too much. His family /was/ more important to him than honor (and I would argue that this is one of the chief reasons to believe [[#s][]]), but honor was also something that he valued. I don't think trying to do things as honorably as possible while protecting his family was that irrational.

As a comparison, it's like Batman trying to fight crime while also refusing to use guns or kill people. Those are both values that he holds, and there are some good stories that come from throwing those values into conflict.
