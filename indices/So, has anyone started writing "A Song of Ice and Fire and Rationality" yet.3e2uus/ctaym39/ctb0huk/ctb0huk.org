I haven't read the books, so maybe it's better there, but just from the TV show, I'd say there's a significant amount of irrationality, such as Spite Before Reason ([[#s][]]), Passion Before Reason ([[#s][]]), Honor Before Reason ([[#s][]]), Poor Communication Kills ([[#s][]]), and plain good ol' religious fanaticism ([[#s][]]). Examples are not exhaustive.
