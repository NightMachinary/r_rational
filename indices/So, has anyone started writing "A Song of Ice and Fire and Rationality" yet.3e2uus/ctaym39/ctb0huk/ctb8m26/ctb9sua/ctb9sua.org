I don't think so, I thought there was difference between taking emotions into consideration (instead of just dismissing them as 'unrational'), and just deciding on pure emotions. Otherwise you can claim that there's no irrational decisions, since biases are driven by emotions ultimately, and emotions are rational, ergo biases are rational.

The religion that has some demonstrated results to it is arguable, but the other one totally qualifies.
