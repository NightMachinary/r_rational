I don't really see the relationship between the faceless and Arya as irrational. I liken it to the relationship between the master and disciple that is central to Zen. The master's task is to pass on an experiential understanding of the tradition, not an intellectual one. This involves methods that appear irrational or mystical to outsiders.
