It's overly mysterious and purposefully frustrating in order to weed out unsuitable candidates. A lot of what they do is classic cult behavior; wear the candidate down with drudge work, entice them with mystery, break down their ties to the outside world, scrub away their individuality ("Who are you?" "No one"), etc. Part of this is to build up a dependency on the cult, part of it is to make the candidate feel like there are sunk costs, and part of it is to weed out people who aren't suitable. The only thing that marks the Faceless Men as different from a real-world cult is that they have an actual mystery at their core, rather than a faked mystery. This gives them even more of a reason to be mysterious and frustrating; they want to ensure that anyone they introduce to their secrets won't reveal them to the outside world, which would lose them one of their major institutional advantages.
