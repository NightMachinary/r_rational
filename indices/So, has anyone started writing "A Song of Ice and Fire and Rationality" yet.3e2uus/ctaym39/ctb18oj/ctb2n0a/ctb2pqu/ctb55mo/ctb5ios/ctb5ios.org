No, I just explained myself poorly.

It's like the Maesters. An order of medieval scientists who use science and rationality in order to explain and give order to the world. They do everything in their power to understand and control magic using the "scientific method" and have got precisely nowhere and now don't get anywhere anything magical with a ten-foot barge pole.

The big exception to that are Glass Candles. But even then, they seem to be extremely unpredictable. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.

Magic is "dark matter."
