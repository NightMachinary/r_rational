  But there are other magics that seem quite learnable

I would dispute that point. I don't believe that Qyburn's (for instance) techniques are teachable or transferable. The guy has access to a medieval level of technology, how would he even begin to use that stuff to resurrect a human being? It's more reasonable to believe that Qyburn has a latent ability to cast necromantic spells and he simply obfuscates that ability by pretending that he is using some form of "Maester Learning" in order to throw off his enemies.
