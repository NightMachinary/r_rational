As no one has actually tried the scientific method on magic, we can't know that. There are /some/ magics that are only accessible by certain "special" people, like greenseeing and warging. But there are other magics that seem quite learnable, like the advanced alchemy used to create [[#s][]], (possibly) the kind the priests of R'hllor use, or whatever methods led Valyria to its doom.
