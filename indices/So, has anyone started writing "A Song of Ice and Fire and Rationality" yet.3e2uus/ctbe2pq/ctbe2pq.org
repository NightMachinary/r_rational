There are a ton of SI (self-inserts) which are kind of rational on alternatehistory and SpaceBattles.

The best thing about these is it usually involves the introduction and effects of modern technology such as printing press and farming to the world.

There was one with a self-insert as Robert just as he won the Rebellion but I can't remember what it was called otherwise I would recommend it.
