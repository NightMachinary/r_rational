I can totally see humanity using the matrix as a tool, such as for education, entertainment, and therapy. For people who can't function in normal society, giving them a matrix world which lets them fit in seems like a good step forward in providing them with the support many don't get.

At the same time, being locked into a matrix is essentially a horror, especially when coupled with (near)immortality. If I had incontrivertable proof that there was a concious entity intentionally subverting my desire for agency, they'd clearly be an enemy if they had no intention of ever letting me have agency on a level similar to their own. Even if I was convinced they did plan to allow me out eventually, I'd still be pretty adversarial towards them.

Yeah, I've never had a very good relationship with parents or other controlling entities. :P
