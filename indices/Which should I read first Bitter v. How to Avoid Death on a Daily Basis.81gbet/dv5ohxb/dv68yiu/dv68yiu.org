not the way moody is going with HTADDB... honestly I think most powers could be equally badass and it wouldn't break the world if some new summoned hero gets an awesome power (or an anti colin power) and tries to kill colin still I think too much random stuff is happening and the groundhog day power is not explained also the last arc was confusing as hell for the protagonist and me and the batman gambits where just too much for me
