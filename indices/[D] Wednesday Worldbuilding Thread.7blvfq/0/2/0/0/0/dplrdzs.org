Oh man, I've derped hard. I was thinking 2^{8,} which would be 8 binary choices made in sequence. derp. Guess it's back to the drawing board... Though admittedly, the system still works, and now I get to think up 16 classes instead of 8. Or maybe a system of 8 classes, and then 5 binary questions (for example, AOE-RANGED-ENERGY-IMMOVABLE-OUTPUT Magus, or POINT-CLOSE COMBAT-PHYSICAL-MOBILE-DEFENSE Defender). There's a lot of interesting options, actually.
