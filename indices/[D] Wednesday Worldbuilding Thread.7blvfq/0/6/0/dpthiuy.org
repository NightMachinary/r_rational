  even now there are many places in third-world countries that don't have smartphones or anything similar. Those places are going to be in trouble.

Prepaid clamshell smartphones are dirt cheap these days-- a few bucks a pop. And because they're so incredibly useful, close to [[https://www.rferl.org/a/report-says-75-percent-of-worlds-population-have-mobile-phones/24648234.html][75%]] of the world's population have mobile phones (albeit not smartphones). So since people can share phones, in a situation where getting access to a device at least once is so important, even the poorest places in africa, latin america, or asia are going to have people able to at least create a character, if not play.

And that's before the game would provide an economic incentive to make dirt cheap devices that basically just consist of a bichromatic screen, 4 buttons, and a token processor (think even shittier gameboy) to distribute to people. Considering a raspi zero is only $5, the cost to make a minimum viable game playing device would likely be below a dollar.
