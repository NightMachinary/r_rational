  Well, this ROB doesn't have to worry about things like processing power or programming difficulty, so the game could be an entire simulation of a universe. Of course, that wouldn't be a great game, but you could have a hyperrealistic game where not only can you pick up things and throw them, you can break them apart and blow them up and look at them in scanning tunneling microscopes. Controls could be such that you're just controlling your actual muscles, so it would be hard to do complex tasks with a mouse and keyboard or an oscilloscope, but not impossible. What I'm trying to get at is that making the game far more realistic than any modern game could help solve a lot of your problems.

Oh believe me, it will be-- the game will be a 1:1 simulation of planet earth, physics will be modeled perfectly*, and any action** you can do in real life will be able to be done with the game. Which is where the challenge comes is-- getting a m+kb setup to still work in such a setting is doable (although it would provide a significant difficult curve for players, that's a feature rather than a bug), there are fundamental advantages to being divorced from the actual gameplay.

Thought admittedly, that's where an earlier suggestion comes into play-- that that's also treated as being a feature, because powergaming will stop working after the 256 days are up, so it would be a long-term disadvantage.

*With specific exceptions made for the game's "magic" system, however I decide it to work, and for adding in stuff like invulnerable objects and safe zones for game purposes.

** Again, with a few restrictions for game purposes
