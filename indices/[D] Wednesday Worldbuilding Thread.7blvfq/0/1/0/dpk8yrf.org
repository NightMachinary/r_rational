To be honest, I'm actually leaning towards making it both beneficial and widely known. That is, if you commit day 1 to choosing that class and follow through, at the expense of never getting to properly play the "game" and starting with no equipment or personal abilities, then you get to use this rare and useful class. It would still be "balanced" in the long run versus, but it would obviously be much more rare than other options, leading to a comparative advantage.
