  With 256 possible combinations of starting categories, someone can kill themselves once per day (in-game) and not have a remaining character combination when the game becomes real. What should I do in that case? I'm currently leaning towards having a special "final" ability that people who do that get, and if I implement that, what suggestions do you have for that ability?

Congratulations! You've done the easter egg to unlock the Challenge Class! You have no special abilities / some really bad special abilities. Have fun!

This is based on the "Wanderer" class in Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (roguelike), which has a random set of starting skills and equipment. It's meant to be a challenge: you might end up with a greataxe and heavy armour and low STR but very high INT.
