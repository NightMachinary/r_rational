  To clarify, I specifically hate grinding for levels.

My experience is that modern MMOs don't grind for levels. I hear some people are still playing Everquest, which doesn't have a level cap. I literally cannot imagine. On the other hand, WoW has a level cap, even if each level is a substantial investment. In Guild Wars, the design decision was to make each level an hour or two of play at most. The point is for players to quickly reach max level and start the real grind. In many RPGs, even if there isn't a level cap, the boss monsters will scale with player level, so that grinding just makes it harder. Do whatever will make the best story.

  VR is indeed really interesting from the point of immersion, but while immersion makes games more fun, it doesn't make you better at the game.

While immersion is where VR excels, that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about how players interact with the game world.

In an FPS, keyboard and mouse rules not because they are superior inputs, but because they cover all situations that matter /to an FPS/. Why would you pick up a chair and hit someone with it when you can just shoot them? The fact that you can't do something you wouldn't want to do never even crosses the player's mind. This is by design. Think about the differences even among first person games. Say, Overwatch and Minecraft. You can't even do the same sorts of things in these games. Each shows the very real limitations of the other. If the game world were as real as possible, it would allow players to do everything that either game allows. On the other hand, designing the inputs to such a system would be a nightmare.

My point here is that more realistic inputs allow players to interact with the game world in more flexible ways. Hopefully that flexibility is worth giving up the agility granted by more rigid input systems.
