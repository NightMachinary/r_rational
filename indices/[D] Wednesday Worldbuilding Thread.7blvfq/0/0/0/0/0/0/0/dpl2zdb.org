Yeah a degraded experience is probably the best plan to have. That being said, it comes with its own balance problems-- it's emotionally easier to order an on-screen avatar to kill a monster than it is to control its stabs with a game controller with haptic feedback than it is to get up close and personal with an oculus rift.

But I think you make a good point with the "better preparation" part-- it's better when the game is a game, but people won't be able to prepare as well for when it starts being real life. hmmm...
