  In an FPS, keyboard and mouse rules not because they are superior inputs, but because they cover all situations that matter to an FPS. Why would you pick up a chair and hit someone with it when you can just shoot them? The fact that you can't do something you wouldn't want to do never even crosses the player's mind. This is by design. Think about the differences even among first person games. Say, Overwatch and Minecraft. You can't even do the same sorts of things in these games. Each shows the very real limitations of the other. If the game world were as real as possible, it would allow players to do everything that either game allows. On the other hand, designing the inputs to such a system would be a nightmare.

That's definitely true, but as a Game Developer I still want my game to be played by the widest possible audience, which means much of the in-game content still needs to be accessible with M+KB, a game controller, or a touchscreen, rather than a fancy $3k haptic feedback rig.

Obviously as an /author/ I get the freedom to do a bunch of handwaving, but I need at least a few sentences of plausible explanation.
