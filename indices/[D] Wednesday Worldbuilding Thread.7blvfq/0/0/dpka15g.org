  I abhor LitRPGs that are all about grinding stats and levels.

MMOs are all about grinding. From the game-designer's perspective, this means making the grind as enjoyable as possible. From a LitRPG perspective, it means making the grind as enjoyable /to read about/ as possible. These are very different.

  m+kb is the superior input system of the vast majority of games for a number of reasons, with a few exceptions for things like racing games and realistic flight sims. How do I make a game where it's an advantage to use the most "realistic" input system available to you, despite the fact that think like headtracking or wiimotes are usually inconvenient and difficult to use in games, even though they have a closer to 1-1 correspondence with real movement.

Have you tried out any VR systems? What makes mouse+keyboard wonderful is that it's both easy to use and easy to develop for. The keyboard makes it easy to interact with the game-world in predefined ways. The trick for the game developers is to make those predefined ways seem complete, while in reality they never even come close. While VR systems currently don't even come close to what already exists, we can already glimpse how they could be used to create a game experience that gives players limitless interaction options. If you haven't tried VR, I recommend visiting an arcade at some point. For "research".

  How do I go around designing a system where players can create new abilities based off their class/subclass/any external knowledge they have without either making player abilities seem arbitrary or having to nail everything down to stats that bog down the story flow?

Played any trading card games? M:tG does a pretty good job of this. Hundreds of new cards are created every year, each with unique effects, with the potential to change how players interact. What's really interesting is that the cards interact with the /rules/ rather than other cards. Even though each new card has its own unique rules, this doesn't create a combinatoric increase in game interaction logic.
