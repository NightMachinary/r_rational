- Some people (think remote tribesmen in the Amazon or similar) will have access to no computing devices at all. For complete saturation, I recommend the ROB permitting the game to be played in any /reflective surface/ (i.e. puddles of water can work), with the surface acting as a touchscreen. Naturally, this would be the lowest-computing-power option.

- Some people (babies in particular) will have no conception or understanding how to play the game. They might mess around with a parent's phone in any case, just picking options at random. This results in a non-negligible possibility of dozens of babies across the world suddenly obtaining Full Starting Equipment on start-day. (And some may have bumbled their way through a level or two by sheer coincidence - or by another person holding their elbow and poking their hands at the screen ('yes, dear, but if I get baby through one more level she'll have a passive healing aura, you can't tell me that won't be worth it'...)).

  How do I go around designing a system where players can create new abilities based off their class/subclass/any external knowledge they have without either making player abilities seem arbitrary or having to nail everything down to stats that bog down the story flow?

How about this - apart from primary class and subclass, powers have to have a /theme/, which is constant for a given character. This theme is chosen by the player, and depends on the player's understanding of that theme. So, a player might choose the theme of /fire/, which makes pyromaniac abilities very easy but healing abilities very hard (except Cauterize). (Mind you, a Fire theme can be used to cool something down - by removing its fire - as well as warm it up).
