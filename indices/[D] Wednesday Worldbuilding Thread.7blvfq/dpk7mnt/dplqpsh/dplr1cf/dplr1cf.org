8 choices, that can be doubled up on. So you can go Rogue-dancer, Dancer-rogue, or Dancer-dancer, for example. The first "class" gives you your primary abilities. The second class specializes you. Or at least, that's one of the possible ways to A-B be different from B-A, while still picking from the same 8 categories in each slot.

As for your list, I think it's pretty solid. The idea of having "supercategories", so to speak, would be an interesting way to impose order on abilities developed by people.
