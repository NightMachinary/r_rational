8 classes:

- Mage: Elemental/blaster
- Cleric: Buff/healing
- Enchanter: AoE/noncombat
- Ranger: Ranged
- Bulwark: High Defense
- Berserker: Pure damage
- Rogue: Stealth/trickery
- Dancer: Dodge/movement

Most of your abilities are determined by your primary class: mage/cleric/enchanter are primary spellcasters, ranger/bulwark/berserker are primary fighters, and rogue/dancer are primary utility.

If you double up for your secondary class, you will be more powerful but less versatile.

If you stay in the same category (eg. Mage/Cleric), you can benefit from many obvious synergies that are available (+ magic power items are more useful, you are best on the back lines, etc).

Taking your second class /across/ categories, on the other hand, has specific hardcoded advantages. Berserker/Mages can deal bonus elemental damage with their attacks, Ranger/Rogues make good assassins, and Dancer/Bulwarks are very good tanks.

There are 8 double-class, 14 in-category, and 42 cross-category builds available in this system. (Where are you getting 256 from? Is there another two bits of choice?)
