Well, this ROB doesn't have to worry about things like processing power or programming difficulty, so the game could be an entire simulation of a universe. Of course, that wouldn't be a great game, but you could have a hyperrealistic game where not only can you pick up things and throw them, you can break them apart and blow them up and look at them in scanning tunneling microscopes. Controls could be such that you're just controlling your actual muscles, so it would be hard to do complex tasks with a mouse and keyboard or an oscilloscope, but not impossible. What I'm trying to get at is that making the game far more realistic than any modern game could help solve a lot of your problems.
