  Okay, so first of all, playing the game literally has no downsides, as presented. You get a "Get out of Dysphoria Free Card," you get to choose what you look like so that's going to make a lot of people really happy, especially everyone who wants to be a sicknasty monster, you might even get to extend your life by changing the age slider! That doesn't even cross the fact that you get magic for playing this game, which is pretty cool.

Yep. The "Game Designer" /wants/ people to play the game, insofar as something with a divergent enough value system to make the planet a LitRPG can "want" something.

  But what I was talking about is the fact that artists, farmers, engineers, business men, politicians, and every other human who understands the ramifications of this thing are going to ask themselves what class will give them an edge at their passion. Killing monsters is going to be a secondary objective for them.

Definitely-- that's what makes the concept so interesting for me. The regular gameplay loop of MMOs is "kill monsters so you can get better at killing monsters." The gameplay loop of this MMO (long term, anyways) would be to kill monsters to you can become more efficient at your chosen proffessions (so you can spend more time killing monsters to get more efficient at your chosen profession, etc.)

  I also forgot to mention that people will pay out the ass for a beautiful avatar. People will commission artists to meet them and walk through character creation, so that they avoid looking like a freak. Having a microphone that takes natural language queries will probably mean that even people shitty at art will be able to make a pleasing avatar, but that depends on the parameters and when you get down to brass tacks artists are going to be better than the layman when it comes to making cool shit.

That's an interesting idea, actually. I've mostly just been thinking that people would either pick their own appearance, pick their own appearance + a few tweaks (ex. increasing facial symmetry or gender swapping), or go completely off the rails towards their transhumanist fantasies. But I was still only thinking in terms of a single person deciding what they'd look like, a-la the "uglies" quadrilogy. I can definitely see people hiring artists for their avatars, once people figured out this really wasn't a joke.

(though that being said, while controls would be very, very intuitive, they wouldn't be capable of just straight up inferring your preferences.
