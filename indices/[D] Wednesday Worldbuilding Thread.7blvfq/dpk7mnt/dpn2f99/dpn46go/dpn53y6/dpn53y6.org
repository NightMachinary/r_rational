  That's part of the fun! On one hand, nobody will be able to force you to play. On the flip side, even just checking it out will make you a player character.

Okay, so first of all, playing the game literally has no downsides, as presented. You get a "Get out of Dysphoria Free Card," you get to choose what you look like so that's going to make a lot of people really happy, especially everyone who wants to be a sicknasty monster, you might even get to extend your life by changing the age slider! That doesn't even cross the fact that you get magic for playing this game, which is pretty cool.

But what I was talking about is the fact that artists, farmers, engineers, business men, politicians, and every other human who understands the ramifications of this thing are going to ask themselves what class will give them an edge at their passion. Killing monsters is going to be a secondary objective for them.

Edit: I also forgot to mention that people will pay out the ass for a beautiful avatar. People will commission artists to meet them and walk through character creation, so that they avoid looking like a freak. Having a microphone that takes natural language queries will probably mean that even people shitty at art will be able to make a pleasing avatar, but that depends on the parameters and when you get down to brass tacks artists are going to be better than the layman when it comes to making cool shit.

Of course, the command "inference my preferences from my internet history" will get a lot of mileage in certain circles.
