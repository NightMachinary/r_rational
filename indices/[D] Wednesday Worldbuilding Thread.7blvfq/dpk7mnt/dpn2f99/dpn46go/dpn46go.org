  Since the world is a one to one copy of earth, that includes all it's sordid secrets and skeletons. Expect political and corporate espionage to a ludicrous degree.

Ooh, yeah. Hadn't thought of the espionage angle, actually :P You'll probably have a weird economy of hiring high-level players to defend industrial secrets in-game, at least in the interim period.

  You should really consider the fact that not everyone is going to want to be an adventurer. Most people will be perfectly happy being npcs. You'll need to figure out what your world looks like when it starts settling down, and what it takes to get there. Look at the tippyverse for seeing what a logical conclusion to d&d's system means for society.

That's part of the fun! On one hand, nobody will be able to force you to play. On the flip side, even just checking it out will make you a player character. And sure, that won't necessarily be a big deal-- in the character create option, there's going to be a "keep me as I am" setting, but then you'll have situations where, for example, someone who makes a deliberately alien looking character to play as before the event anonymously (with the plan to transfer their assets to a friend, kill their character, and make a new character) and then for whatever reason fails to carry out their plan will have to explain to their family why they look like that now.

  I mean, the only reason we use m+kb is because it's precise and fast, not because it's flexible. You have arbitrary precision with a couple of cameras and microphones and the fai does the processing.

This is a good point, actually. That being said, the kind of people who can rig crazy multi-smartphone setups are going to be in the minority :P They'd definitely feature, though. Personally, I'd expect to see a lot of people with wearable displays (ex. google hololens) running around in their backyards, as they only need to optimize for input and display fidelity, rather than for computational power.
