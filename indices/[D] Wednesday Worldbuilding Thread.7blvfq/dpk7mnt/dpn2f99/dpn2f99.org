Ok, so I think this is a really interesting idea.

Some thoughts:

Since the world is a one to one copy of earth, that includes all it's sordid secrets and skeletons. Expect political and corporate espionage to a ludicrous degree.

You should really consider the fact that not everyone is going to /want/ to be an adventurer. Most people will be perfectly happy being npcs. You'll need to figure out what your world looks like when it starts settling down, and what it takes to get there. Look at the tippyverse for seeing what a logical conclusion to d&d's system means for society.

You need to remember that the players aren't controlling their character. A super-intelligence with infinite processing power and the directives "convince my player they are their character" and "prepare my player for the system they're going to be using" is what is /actually/ controlling the character.

This means that you've got at least something as intelligent as a person with infinite math skills, memory, time, and patience analyzing every frame, button press, and second of feed. This means that every camera pointed at someone gets a 3d feed of a persons face analyzing where their eyes go, micro facial expressions, [[https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/149623-mit-releases-open-source-software-that-reveals-invisible-motion-and-detail-in-video][heart rate,]] and anything a human can get from watching someone's face in a billion different ways. A human intimately familiar with every quirk of the subject and infinite inferential power. You also get infinite gesture understanding, as well as infinite body language understanding.

With a microphone, you might get some echolocation information, and you get biometrics on their breathing. You might also get trembling from their hands, whooshing from waving their phone around, and natural language commands. Stuff like that. You also get natural language processing, so you can take whatever commands you choose from people.

If you're looking at an average smartphone, you also get an accelerometer, a gps, and a touchscreen.

The big difference between an oculus and a smartphone is screen resolution and processing power, assuming you can log into multiple devices and composite their input, which you really should allow because of the shenanigans it allows. The smartphone can even do retina tracking, which the oculus can't.

You can plug an ekg into your computer, or even an [[https://gizmodo.com/5843117/scientists-reconstruct-video-clips-from-brain-activity][fmri]], and suddenly you've got mind reading and intention inferencing.

Strap a shit load of accelerometers to your body and let the game figure it out.

Have the game make people go for a run with their smart phone so it can make them think it's taking their biometrics, which it probably is already doing.

I mean, the only reason we use m+kb is because it's precise and fast, not because it's flexible. You have arbitrary precision with a couple of cameras and microphones and the fai does the processing.
