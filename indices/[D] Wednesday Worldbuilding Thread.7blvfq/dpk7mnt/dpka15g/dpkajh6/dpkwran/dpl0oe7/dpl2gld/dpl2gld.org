  I still want my game to be played by the widest possible audience, which means much of the in-game content still needs to be accessible with M+KB, a game controller, or a touchscreen, rather than a fancy $3k haptic feedback rig.

The usual solution is to provide a degraded experience. You could create a very high-end immersive experience for someone with a full rig, while someone playing on a digital watch gets to make a few high level decisions while an avatar plays for them in the game world. Some of the options will prepare players better than others for when the game becomes real.
