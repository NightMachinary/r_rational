  MMOs are all about grinding. From the game-designer's perspective, this means making the grind as enjoyable as possible. From a LitRPG perspective, it means making the grind as enjoyable to read about as possible. These are very different.

To clarify, I specifically hate grinding /for levels/. I intentionally avoid games where characters have strict power curves based on the amount of time players have spent smashing rats, or whatever. I have fewer problems with grinding for items, although that's with the caveat that I much prefer when items in MMOs are sidegrades that let you do something different rather than upgrades. The MMO I've had by far the most experience with is Planetside 2, where levels have absolutely no bearing on the ability to kill other planetmen, and the grinding for currency, beyond a certain basic point of getting the equipment to deal with specific situations (like having to unlock an AA launcher to deal with planes), doesn't actually make you better, because you can only equip one set of equipment at a time anyways. Similarly, I plan for my next MMO to be Star Citizen (if it ever gets released, anyways...), which also won't have individual character stats to grind. And in the interim, I'm playing Overwatch, where I don't have to grind at all (although it's not actually an mmo...)

  Have you tried out any VR systems? What makes mouse+keyboard wonderful is that it's both easy to use and easy to develop for. The keyboard makes it easy to interact with the game-world in predefined ways. The trick for the game developers is to make those predefined ways seem complete, while in reality they never even come close. While VR systems currently don't even come close to what already exists, we can already glimpse how they could be used to create a game experience that gives players limitless interaction options. If you haven't tried VR, I recommend visiting an arcade at some point. For "research".

I've had very limited experience with an oculus rift dk1 (just a demo at an event) and played one of those arcade games with the pull-down headset. VR is indeed really interesting from the point of immersion, but while immersion makes games more fun, it doesn't make you /better/ at the game. For example, in FPS games, you have people deliberately lowering graphics to get better IFF, even if they have a monster gaming rig. M+KB is great because you can have a large number of instant inputs with the keyboard, and the mouse lets you make small, precise motions that are difficult to replicate with a controller, joystick, or especially wiimote/other handheld motion sensor.

Which is what makes my dilemna so difficult-- I'm trying to think of how to make M+KB inferior, but /without/ gimping it. That being said, I do have some ideas. Looking at, for example, warthunder, m+kb becomes worse than joysticks when mouse controls stop being first-order (ex, point where you want to go) and begin to be second order (point at a section of the screen to determine roll/pitch rate) and third order (point at a section of the screen to control a virtual rudders and flaps that in turn control roll and pitch) because joysticks stay second order the whole time. The trick would be to figure out how to make most input devices consistently second order, but it's difficult to visualize how that would work in an efficient manner when controlling an avatar, rather than a vehicle.

  Played any trading card games? M:tG does a pretty good job of this. Hundreds of new cards are created every year, each with unique effects, with the potential to change how players interact. What's really interesting is that the cards interact with the rules rather than other cards. Even though each new card has its own unique rules, this doesn't create a combinatoric increase in game interaction logic.

That's a really good point, actually. Though as with trading card games, there would of course be the problem of avoiding power creep :P
