So I've just had the very broad strokes of an idea. Here it is:

“*We* have bestowed upon humanity a Game. Play it. Learn its intricacies. Master its systems. Because in 2^{8} days, it becomes real.”

Or in other words, an ROB (that is, Random Omnipotent Being) has created an MMO and tells people to play it. They aren't forced to, but 256 days from the announcement, people will become their in-game character, gaining their abilities and equipment. On the flipside, monsters will also start appearing in the real world. Individual physical locations might change, but the world itself will still be "planet earth"; this wouldn't be an isekai.

In the following paragraphs, I'm going to talk about some initial ideas I've had. If you want to get directly to the part where I ask people to contribute ideas, scroll down below the line break.

The plan would be to have one "book" about the 256 days leading up to the conversion (I haven't even started thinking about what the plot would entail), and however many books necessary about the world after to get to a "stable state" so to speak.

By ROB fiat, the game is playable on literally any device with a screen and input (so if you really wanted to, you could play it on an oscilloscope) which means that pretty much everyone on the planet is be able to play, should they so choose. That being said, while the game /does/ somehow run on nokia flip phones and calculator watches, it's deliberately designed to be easier to play the more "realistic" the play medium is. A mouse+keyboard is worse than a wiimote and nunchuck is worse than a kinect. (I'd need to figure out /how/ to make the game naturally easier that way, though-- m+kb is almost always the best control surface IRL).

After the 256 days, death will of course be permanent, but prior to that, death "kills" your character, forcing you to start over at lvl 1 with a new character, with the additional restriction that you can't choose the same set of starting choices as you chose initially (this is a big deal) and you can't choose the exact same character design (not a big deal). You also get locked out of playing until the next (calendar) day, so that someone can't kill themselves 256+1 times and not have any character options.

For starting choices, I'm thinking of heavily restricting the player options. Namely, that there would only be 8 total "abilities" to pick, and you get a "primary" ability slot and a "secondary" slot, both of which can have the same ability in order to specialize.

That being said, these "abilities" would be very broad; think worm power categories (ex. mover, blaster) rather than something more specific (like regular MMO abilities), and individuals would develop their own abilities though some system. Which brings me to the questions I have for you guys:

--------------

I'll be asking a few questions from the perspective of the ROB "game designer". Note that my "job" is easier for a few reasons:

1. I'm not restricted by the computational power of what the game is run on; a literal toaster could run the game at full quality.
2. My servers can "magically" connect to any computer with no latency and 100% uptime.
3. Outputs (ex. graphics, sound, and even stuff like smell, taste, and touch, if supported) are maximally good for the output system they exist on, and will asymptotically approach "lifelike" the better the displays/sound systems get.
4. Inputs are used to their maximal potential. A kinect camera will be able to track you near-perfectly by vision, although its limited to the detail it can get out of its limited resolution.

And onto the worldbuilding questions:

- Given that there will only be +8+ 16 broad categories that need to do double duty as both a character's primary class and subclass, what should these categories be? (think "mover, area-of-effect, healer, whatever). Note that no class can directly affect a player's mental state before or after the game becomes real, (so no "thinker") class, but classes that indirectly affect it (such as an alchemist class creating LSD) are kosher.
- With 256 possible combinations of starting categories, someone can kill themselves once per day (in-game) and not have a remaining character combination when the game becomes real. What should I do in that case? I'm currently leaning towards having a special "final" ability that people who do that get, and if I implement that, what suggestions do you have for that ability?
- I abhor LitRPGs that are all about grinding stats and levels. So how do I design a MMO with a combat system that a.) doesn't have levels (but will probably still have stats to some extent), but also b.) doesn't play out like an FPS, where if you don't have twitch reflexes and great input system, you simply can't compete (as this would be a worldwide phenomenon, and most people /don't/ have great twitch reflexes, or gaming keyboards and mice)
- m+kb is the superior input system of the vast majority of games for a number of reasons, with a few exceptions for things like racing games and realistic flight sims. How do I make a game where it's an advantage to use the most "realistic" input system available to you, despite the fact that think like headtracking or wiimotes are usually inconvenient and difficult to use in games, even though they have a closer to 1-1 correspondence with real movement. Note that the game shouldn't /restrict/ the ability of people to play the game with non-realistic input systems: I "want" as many people as possible to play it.
- How do I go around designing a system where players can create new abilities based off their class/subclass/any external knowledge they have without either making player abilities seem arbitrary or having to nail everything down to stats that bog down the story flow?
