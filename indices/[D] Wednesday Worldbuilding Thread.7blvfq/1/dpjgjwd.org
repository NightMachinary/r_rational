Hoping to collect some opinions for a short story I'm working on.

Say there were a ritual which granted unaging immortality. The specifics of immortality can match whatever flavor you find most desirable, for the purposes of setting up this scenario.

The rules of the ritual are as follows:

- The ritual can only be performed /once/, and will only affect the current living population of Earth (anyone born after will have a normal lifespan)
- The ritual simply needs to be read from a scroll, which you currently have
- When the ritual is finished, X% of the world's population (chosen randomly) will instantly die. The remaining percent will be granted immortal life. All people have the same chance of being chosen for death, even you the scroll-reader, and there's no way to know beforehand who will be chosen.

Given that...

- What value of â€˜X' would make it /definitely/ worth it for you, the scroll-reader? What value (range) would make you /unsure/, but still consider it? At what value would it definitely /not/ be worth it?
- Same as above, but in the eyes of the general public. Obviously the views will span all possible values (and likely there would be some who wouldn't even /want/ immortality), but what's the highest bound limit of X that the /majority/ of people would accept, if it meant a chance to become immortal?
