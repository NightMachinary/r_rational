I thought that by majority of people you mean a scenario where majority of people on earth are asked whether the ritual should be conducted. I think quite the opposite, majority of people think that they want immortality, but slowly they would realize how foolish is that desire. Also, human brain has certain limit on how many memories it can store, after 500 years you would most likely forget about everything from the first 150 years. Most of us can't even live normal, "short" lives while being happy. Then what about eternity of being unhappy.
