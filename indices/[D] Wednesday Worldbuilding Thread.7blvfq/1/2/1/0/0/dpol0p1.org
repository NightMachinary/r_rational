I mean, for one, I think we can only theorize as to whether traditional immortality (the way you've constructed it here) would be "eternal unhappiness". I personally think much of why we're so unhappy, is because of the constraints of mortality (trying to find a life purpose, achieve "success" by our own personal metrics, etc., all within the short span of our adult lives). Without the pressure of aging and death, you'd have much more time to find happiness, I think.

In any case, as I said originally, for the purposes of this exercise you can interpret "immortality" in whatever way you think would make it most universally desirable. So maybe your version of immortality is one which (a) expands our memory capabilities, so we can retain memories for a much longer time, and (b) includes the ability to choose to die or lose your immortality whenever you wish, so it's not a forced eternal existence.

Given that, if you asked people what value of X% of the population would they accept to kill off to grant the rest immortality, what range of X do you think the majority of people would fall into (and where would you fall)? Still 50% (so they'd accept killing 3.8 billion people, for a 50/50 coin flip chance at immortality)? I'm asking from both a morality perspective, and a risk-assessment perspective.
