-From the perspective of someone immortal it's the best if the ritual killed as many people as possible, so up to 50%? World would be in chaos (to your benefit) for a few decades, but hey, you are immortal. I am assuming that immortality means not aging or dying by means of sickness, you can still get killed. -Majority of people would simply not accept such ritual.
