The immortality is stated to not apply to any new human that will be born. Also you're making the assumption life extension aging prevention doesn't make significant progress in the (likely longer) lifetime of any humans alive today.

Also even if no current humans could be saved you're making the assumption that the potential disutility of people being unable to opt to die will be worth it over trillions or more years. Particularly when you consider that (excluding human extinction) technology allowing immortality will inevitably come around /eventually/ and even if it was millennia from now that would still mean nearly all human-descendants to ever live would live after its advent.
