  So? Irrelevant.

You specifically mentioned a "breeding population" what would be the point of saying that otherwise? Also if you're trying to maximize the number of immortals then it would seem like you ought to wait until you can maximize the number of humans that exist, which pretty much necessitates that you do it far enough in the future that you can apply it to potentially an absurdly large number of people.

As for your other two comments if people can exist in a sufficiently well defended and stable state to survive until heat death, then the utility of immortals here may not be so clearly positive. Since I mentioned there is no opt out for this immortality.

Though I suppose it's sort of irrelevant since any form of true immortality is going to be able to be leveraged for free energy meaning you can beat back the heat death of the universe indefinitely. Which means keeping around a bunch of miserable /insanely/ old immortals is unambiguously worth it since they can be farmed for energy to keep civilization running.
