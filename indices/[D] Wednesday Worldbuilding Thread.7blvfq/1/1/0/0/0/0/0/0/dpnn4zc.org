  My point being that with any sort of reasonable form of immortality nearly all of their existence would be spent either floating in a totally empty void or perhaps constantly being in incredible pain inside a black hole which will never decay since they are an infinite energy source. They may have some sort of regeneration that affects their sanity as well as their body, but that would just mean they wouldn't have insanity to serve as a coping mechanism which would probably just make their existence worse.

... your preferred immortality sounds pretty crappy. I vote you don't get to perform the ritual.
