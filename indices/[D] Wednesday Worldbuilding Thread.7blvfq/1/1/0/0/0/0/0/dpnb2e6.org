  To ensure the race continues beyond just a few male (or female) immortals. A single immortal being may have an infinite number man-hours, but an immortal civilization will have... well, still ℵ₀. But it would be something different, and something I wouldn't want to lose.

Still it seems like it probably won't matter whether you have a breeding population since (especially with the immortals around) since it seems unlikely humanity wipes itself out in a way that makes that relevant (for instance UFAI would imprison them for power sources countless years from now and wouldn't waste resources letting them breed).

  I'm not. OP asked what the minimum value was that makes the ritual worthwhile, not how to maximize on the ritual.
#+end_quote

He asked for the minimum percent left alive, however that doesn't mean you wouldn't still wait as long as possible since time isn't an issue and you can only use the ritual once.\\
Even human extinction isn't a concern likely to make you not want to wait, since extinction events would generally be something you could see in advance well enough to use the ritual before the population drops to much. Even UFAI doesn't much matter here (provided /all/ you care about is having humans around forever) since it would likely mind control you then create as many humans as possible then do the ritual in like a trillion years so it has the maximum number of power sources to beat back heat death.

  Without endorsing utilitarianism, the benefit of immortals by definition outweighs that of everyone else. It is, after all, the form of immortality I find most pleasing.

My point was that if immortals are around forever then one should only really consider the era close to heat death (I say close to because as long as the immortals exist it's not heat death) when considering whether their lives are on the net worthwhile. So since ~100% of their existence will be spent in an empty vacuum probably extremely uncomfortable and utterly insane there's a question as to whether such a life is really worth immortality?

I said before that their bodies could act as the generators to run a sizeable civilization ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qam5BkXIEhQ][in a cold enough universe processing power becomes /extremely/ efficient]]). Of course while they're being used as generators they would probably be plugged into some sort of perfect VR so their lives would still be pretty nice at this point. However sooner or later, perhaps via quantum tunneling, the rest of civilization will /eventually/ be destroyed, and thus they will enter the period of floating in an empty vacuum which will be ~100% of their life.\\
So from a utilitarian perspective if these immortals live forever and their lives are on the whole a net negative that would seem to make keeping them around infinitely terrible. Of course I'm not a utilitarian nor lacking in time discounting so I might be willing to ignore the fate that awaits me in the future if I could have a truly mind boggling amount of fun before then, but i'm not sure this is the most reasonable choice.

  Yes, true immortality means there is no heat-death. How observant. But no, there would be no "miserable old immortals", because it is the form of immortality I find most pleasing.

The fact that you have control over the method of immortality probably shouldn't mean you have infinite leeway here. After all if you could do that why not just specify a form of immortality that allowed time travel, the production of negative mass, and could be tapped into to draw out however much energy you want at lightspeed?\\
My point being that with any sort of reasonable form of immortality nearly all of their existence would be spent either floating in a totally empty void or perhaps constantly being in incredible pain inside a black hole which will never decay since they are an infinite energy source. They may have some sort of regeneration that affects their sanity as well as their body, but that would just mean they wouldn't have insanity to serve as a coping mechanism which would probably just make their existence worse.\\
It's not that the immortals become miserable and old, it's that their existence is on the whole mostly terrible. After all if their memory isn't perfect then so long as they had a civ to keep them in VR they can always have new (to them) interesting experiences to have as a loop immortal.

As for coming up with the best form of immortality, I think the issue would probably be figuring out what you could get away with in terms of complexity. After all if you could really get away with /any/ type of immortality then I'm confident you could find something that would satisfy both of us and allow for pretty much everything we could ever possibly want forever.
