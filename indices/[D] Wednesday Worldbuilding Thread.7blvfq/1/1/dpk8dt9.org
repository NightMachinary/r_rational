Any non-zero X is worthwhile. This is mathematically verifiable. If the ritual is not performed, 100% of the population will die (eventually). If it is performed, the maximum number of man-years lost is (human lifespan)x(population). +If even one person survives to become immortal+ Let's make it a breading population that lives to become immortal. Then an infinite number of man-years are gained, which is greater than the finite number lost. And the benefit of guaranteeing the perpetuation of the species for eternity? Priceless.
