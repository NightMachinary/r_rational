I've come up with a dumb but amusing idea. Take the standard Japanese mecha show, and invert the premise. Instead of humans building mechs to fight inside, you either get mechs creating humans to act as pilots to enhance their capabilties, or humans creating mini-mechs to act as pilots to enhance their capabilities. I think it'd be potentially interesting to explore the question of pilot-mech synchronization from this angle, contrived though it might be. There are some echoes of Yeerk-human synergy concepts from r!Animorphs here.
