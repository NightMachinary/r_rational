I don't think humans building mechs to pilot them is terribly contrived, except insofar as you would never actually build a /mech/, you would just build a brain interface that would take over and pilot you from time to time. Though actually, it would be well-possible that people might benefit from giving that "pilot" a personality and visual identity, along with some rudimentary communication ability, even if that only existed as a virtual display.

As far as story went, you would probably want some drawbacks to the "piloting", other than just the loss of autonomy. The narrative constraint I would want to put on would be something like "no more than thirty minutes a day" or "to get the most use out of the internal mech you need to jailbreak it and remove the safeties that prevent it from injuring you". Oh, and some need to "sync" the mech, meaning that you actually are building up a relationship. And from there you have some built-in tension to work with, and could focus a story on, say, a skilled gymnast who competes in these human/mech cooperative events that go beyond what mere human muscle memory and cognition can do.

Or, if you wanted a more shonen mecha thing, a young boy who has been implanted by a godly powerful minimech by his father and is now on the run from the government or a corporation or something -- capable of turning into an expert marksman at the drop of a hat, gets in lots of cool fights, etc.
