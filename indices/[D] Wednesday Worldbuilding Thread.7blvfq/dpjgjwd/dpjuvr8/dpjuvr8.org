As you command, this answer assumes the specifics of immortality I find most desirable: Opt-out invincibility to physical effects such as force, aging, disease and starvation.

If the method of death is heart failure, a global coordinative effort to set up defibrillation for everyone in advance would make it worth it for almost all percentages. If one's "life force" leaves, so that modern medicine can't revive the corpses, cryonics is still an option, but it's even more outlandish to suppose that the public will agree to that.

If I were selfish, a few percent would be worth it, for that is a ballpark for a lower bound on the chance I'd die anyway before a global paradigm shift. Any value would make the scroll worth keeping in hand in case the existential risk situation turns dire in ways the scroll can help with.
