I am assuming immortality means something different than invincibility, so you still can get killed. Imagine this. The information about immortality is public. New generations of normal, not immortal people are alive and well. Ritual killed off only a few thousand people so overpopulation is still a problem. When conflict arises, and it's bound to happen someday, you need a scapegoat to put the blame on/rally the people. Who are they gonna blame? probably the immortals, they are "unnatural" or even "evil", also add the factor of religion rising in popularity in times of crisis. "Immortality? That's only reserved to god!" etc. So by killing of half of population you solve that problem, although temporarily. TLDR: Jews 2.0
