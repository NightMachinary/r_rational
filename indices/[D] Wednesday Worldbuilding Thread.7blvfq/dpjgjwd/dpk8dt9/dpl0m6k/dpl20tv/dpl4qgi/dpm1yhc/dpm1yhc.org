  You specifically mentioned a "breeding population" what would be the point of saying that otherwise?
#+end_quote

To ensure the race continues beyond just a few male (or female) immortals. A single immortal being may have an infinite number man-hours, but an immortal civilization will have... well, still ℵ₀. But it would be something different, and something I wouldn't want to lose.

  if you're trying to maximize the number of immortals
#+end_quote

I'm not. OP asked what the minimum value was that makes the ritual worthwhile, not how to maximize on the ritual.

#+begin_quote
  As for your other two comments if people can exist in a sufficiently well defended and stable state to survive until heat death, then the utility of immortals here may not be so clearly positive.
#+end_quote

Without endorsing utilitarianism, the benefit of immortals by definition outweighs that of everyone else. It is, after all, the form of immortality I find most pleasing.

#+begin_quote
  Though I suppose it's sort of irrelevant since any form of true immortality is going to be able to be leveraged for free energy meaning you can beat back the heat death of the universe indefinitely. Which means keeping around a bunch of miserable insanely old immortals is unambiguously worth it since they can be farmed for energy to keep civilization running.

Yes, true immortality means there is no heat-death. How observant. But no, there would be no "miserable old immortals", because /it is the form of immortality I find most pleasing/.

--------------

To be fair, working out what form of immortality I find most pleasing is a chore in and of itself. My preferred form is probably different from your preferred form, so working out the definition of immortality for the purposes of the ritual would take quite some time. I'm not convinced that there isn't a definition that could please everyone (excluding, of course, those people who can't be pleased in the first place).
