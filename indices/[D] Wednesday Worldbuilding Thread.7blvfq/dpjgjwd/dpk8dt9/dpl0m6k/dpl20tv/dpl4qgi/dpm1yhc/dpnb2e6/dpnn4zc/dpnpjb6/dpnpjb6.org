  ... your preferred immortality sounds pretty crappy.

That's the thing though, the fact you inevitably end up floating in the empty void of space basically forever /isn't a feature of a particular type of immortality/.\\
It's a feature of everything /except/ the immortal person /*not*/ being immortal. Eventually everything /except/ the immortal is gone, which ends up being pretty shitty. And even if other immortals exist, the cosmological horizon ensures that sooner or later all immortals end up permanently alone.
