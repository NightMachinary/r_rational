I'm recommending... a Pewdiepie video.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ_qiYc133U]]

He reviewed five books that he read in January: /Consider Phlebas/ by Ian M. Banks, /Brave New World/ by Aldous Huxley, /Fahrenheit 451/ by Ray Bradbury (spoiler: he didn't particularly care for that one), /the Picture of Dorian Gray/ by Oscar Wilde, /Children of Time/ by Adrian Tchaikovsky, and /12 Rules for Life/ by Jordan B. Peterson. At the end he says that this month he's reading /Beyond Good and Evil/ by Friedrich Nietzsche and /Life 3.0/ by Max Tegmark. I'll be pretty interested to see /that/ video.

It was interesting to listen to him talk about books. Very different from his typical videos.

Another recommendation, the most recent book I've read is [[https://ia801401.us.archive.org/32/items/thirdclassatmiss00braz/thirdclassatmiss00braz.pdf][/the Third Class at Miss Kaye's/]] by Angela Brazil, it's a children's book written in 1908 about an 11-year-old girl who gets sent off to boarding school because her parents think she's too spoiled because she would rather read than interact socially with other children, so it's basically cotton candy, very fluffy and light reading, which is nice sometimes. It's completely non-rational, but you might enjoy it.
