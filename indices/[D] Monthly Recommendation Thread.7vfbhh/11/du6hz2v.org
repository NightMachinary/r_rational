Conventionally published hard SF novel (translated from Japanese): [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31140453-orbital-cloud][Orbital Cloud by Taiyo Fujii]].

This is a technothriller set in the very near future, reminiscent of Neal Stephenson in that it builds convincing technical and scientific details into the plot and features nerdy protagonists using their expertise to achieve their goals. Definitely the kind of realistic hard SF that Stross is talking about in his [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7vse2i/charles_stross_on_consistency_in_worldbuilding/][recently-discussed post about worldbuilding]].

This has been out for a while, but the search engine tells me that it hasn't been mentioned in this subreddit yet.

Aside from the enjoyable SF elements, the depiction of the Japanese characters is definitely more convincing than that of the Americans who get involved later, but it's very readably translated and the characters are engaging.
