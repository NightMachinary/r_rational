Non-rational Harry Potter fanfiction I think people here would like, spurred by the Death By Water rec:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3784000/1/The-Scarlet-Pimpernel][The Scarlet Pimpernel]] is a canon-mostly-compliant story from Percy's point of view that takes place during /Deathly Hallows/. It is very cute and intensely personally relatable for the sort of broad-autism-phenotype people I think this community attracts.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/924488][Reclamation]] is an AU in which Tom Gaunt-nee-Riddle is the Defense Professor at Hogwarts and has been for years. It's very short, so more details would sabotage the emotional work the story does itself, but I highly recommend it.
