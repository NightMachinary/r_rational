(Should probably make this a proper top level post, but feeling lazy)

I recommend [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8341348?view_full_work=true][Almost Nowhere]], an original web-serial by [[/u/nostalgebraist][u/nostalgebraist]] whom we know and love for [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522][The Northern Caves]]. There was a year-long gap in updates, but the author finally starting updating it weekly once again. If you dropped the story because of the horrible update schedule, you could give it a second try now.

What's it like? It looks like it's going to be hard sci-fi, but it's one of those stories where there's a ton of weird stuff going on and it's all told out of order, from the povs of several not entirely reliable, uncomprehending narrators, so just keeping up with the plot and figuring out what's going on is almost like a puzzle.

Also, it seems to feature aliens who are disgusted with humanity for reasons that can only be expressed via differential geometry... or at least I think that it does.

If all of this sounds appealing to you, you will probably enjoy almost all of /Almost Nowhere/, except maybe for some measure zero subset of it.
