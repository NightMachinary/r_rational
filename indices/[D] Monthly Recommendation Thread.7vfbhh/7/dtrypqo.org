I fear I may have recommended this before already, but in case I did not: Robert J. Sawyer's /Quintaglio/ Trilogy, with the first volume being /Far-Seer/. If I had to give a five second pitch, it'd be: The copernican revolution on a world inhabited by dinosaurs.

I forgot which kind exactly, but they're raptor-like, carnivorous, and very peculiar. For one, their hunting instinct is triggered by blood, pheromones, and violation of personal space. Their culture has many rituals and rules that govern and make allowances to this territoriality, which then feeds into and is picked up by their religious dogmas and such. It's all very interesting, in my opinion.
