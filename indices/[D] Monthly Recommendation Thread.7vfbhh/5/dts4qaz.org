[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PopTeamEpic][Pop Team Epic]] may be the weirdest anime I have ever seen, and that alone makes it worth checking out. It started off as a 4-koma strip, then became an internet meme, and now has become a show about meta-humor and pop culture references that gives the same sensation as reading dumb memes while actively producing more memes.

Every episode I've seen so far has been a parade of absurdist scenes that parody animation, video games, Japanese television, and itself with no overarching thematic elements. At the halfway point, they roll the credits and then episode repeats from the beginning with different voice actors and /some/ dialogue changed.

I can't definitively say I like the show since it has none of the elements I usually want from comedy shows, but even when I didn't laugh I still /got/ the joke. I weirdly respect it for how it trolls the audience by violating its “premise”, makes you cringe with awkward direction, and never comes across as badly made even when poor production values are the joke.

The show is still airing week-by-week, but I honestly think that's the best way to consume this show, binging it would cause [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuso][kuso]] burnout. There's only so much “WTF was that?” a person can handle in one sitting. I personally recommend the dub since bizarre line delivery is a common joke and, for me, that didn't come across with subtitles.
