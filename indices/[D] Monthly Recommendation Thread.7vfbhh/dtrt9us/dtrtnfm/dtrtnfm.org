I've personally tried to read the Culture series a few times, but I always get about five chapters in and lose my interest. I've tried starting with Player of Games and Consider Phlebas.

However, all the Culture fanfics that I've found (of which this is the fifth - I've seen two Harry Potter crossovers, one BtVS crossover, and one Worm crossover before) have all been high quality and very intriguing. I have yet to read this specific fic, but my priors are quite high for this being good.

EDIT: The fics are:

- (Harry Potter) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3983128/1/Culture-Shock]]
- (Worm) [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/you-needed-opponents-with-gravitas-worm-the-culture.512650/]]
- (Buffy) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11338629/1/Collision-Course]]

There was another HP fanfic, but I can't find it now.

In searching for these three, I found a few others that I have yet to read:

- (Lensman) [[http://bbs.stardestroyer.net/viewtopic.php?t=17812]]
- (Star Trek) [[http://bbs.stardestroyer.net/viewtopic.php?t=14323]]
- (Not a crossover!) [[http://bbs.stardestroyer.net/viewtopic.php?t=35080]]
- (Another not a crossover!) [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-speaker-of-silence-culture-story-feedback-wanted.63735/]]
