I just binged five episodes of it. I'm feeling like a victim of [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3999][SCP-3999]] would feel, I think. It's fascinating.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing][WMG]] ahead, beware:

Pipimi and Popuko are eldritch abominations similar to SCP-3999. They're nearly-omnipotent entities of pure chaos that take joy in infecting worlds of fictional stories and turning them to random, unordered directions, making their inhabitants into toys for their alien amusement. /Sometimes/ there appear hints of a prolonged narrative, because "order" is a subset of "chaos", but they're always just as quickly swept away. The entire show is taking place in a desecrated carcass of /Hoshiiro Girldrop/, the first anime Pipimi and Popuko infected: that's what first episode's beginning was about, and why the next episode previews are consistently from it (of course, this "consistency" is just a sneer of Pipimi and Popuko at our pathetic attempts to find order in chaos).

(I'm sorry, I'm just really into cosmic horror.)
