That threw me too; definitely noped out as soon as I got to that part on my work PC. No calls from IT yet, so I think I'm ok...

Oddly enough, having finished the rest of the available chapters later at home... the series more-or-less backs off from the over-the-top goblin rape/nudity pretty quick after the first few chapters. In one of the more recent chapters there's a scene with two women in a bath with all the tropes of mist and hair covering the sensitive areas. I wonder at the thought process... showing nudity during goblin rape is OK, but showing nudity in a bathing scene is too far? Priorities, guys...

The goblin killing is as advertised, though.
