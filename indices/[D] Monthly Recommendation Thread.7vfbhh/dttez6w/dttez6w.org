I always eagerly await this thread but haven't contributed before, so here are some recommendations you guys might enjoy:

(A Song of Ice and Fire / Game of Thrones top-quality fanfictions)

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/reader][Purple Days]]: awesome Joffrey Baratheon time-loop. Yeah, no kidding. The world-building, character development and existential dread in this one are unbelievable, and it pays off big time towards the latest chapters. Still in-progress, with irregular but fairly reliable updates.

[[https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/summer-crowns-au.425453/][Summer Crowns]]: Robert Baratheon gives up on the Iron Throne to chase after Rhaegar Targaryen, who fled to Essos after losing the war. He is followed by Eddard Stark, Jaime Lannister and the Blackfish among others. Quickly turns into the legendary tale of the Dragonhunt and the newly-formed Kingdom of Summer's war against slavery. Note: in-progress and requires an AH.com account to read, but is updated regularly.

[[https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/rhaegar-the-great-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-embrace-the-suck.396456/][Rhaegar the Great; or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Embrace the Suck]]: Engrossing and very well-written Rhaegar self-insert. Shakespeare plays get adapted to Westeros, and plot ensues.. Note: also on AH.com, complete with a sequel in-progress.

(Other fiction)

[[http://daystareld.com/guardian-1/][Guardian]]: by the author of Pokemon: Origin of Species, this new original story seems really promising. Only two chapters out yet though!
