I second that.

As someone who absolutely loved Code Lyoko back when it was broadcast and posted about it on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] before, I have to say it hasn't aged well.

It's formulaic as hell (and even in later seasons the show just switches to different formulas), a lot of the run time is copy-pasted filler (the kids getting to the factory, then into the virtual machine), the characters are bland and archetypal (you have the funny idiot, the serious moody guy, the serious action girl, the nerd, the emotion-driven girl, and eventually the new addition who turns out to be a traitor); even the characters with agency are kind of dumb, as in even as a kid I could always figure out what was happening way before they did ("What's this? The robot they brought for their serial killer movie is missing as the same time people are starting to disappear? Ah, I'm sure it's nothing"). The NPCs are stupid and never show any agency except to create problems from the heroes; since it's a kid show, all the adults are useless; the recurring plots are pointless and annoying (rich bully girl is trying to get with the serious moody hero who very obviously isn't into her, rince and repeat for 12 episodes), etc.

The story itself is a Lost-type plot where the writers went "Okay, so we have this time-travelling video game computer of evil in an old car factory's basement. How did it get there? Secret government agency! We'll figure out the rest later". Re-watching this as an adult, it's very obvious the writers were making things up as they went and hinting to mysteries that were ultimately shallow. Also, as an aside, the "this technology was created by secret government agents" doesn't really work in French settings like it does in American ones. The DGSE just isn't as sexy as the CIA :P

(another thing that bugged me in retrospect is how lame the protagonists were for a few seasons; they basically spent episode after episode barely winning fights against the Lyoko equivalent of Goombas)

I mean, there are good things too. The 2D animation is still gorgeous (the 3D parts are very dated, but it's hardly the show's fault); there are a few cool character moments, and the sword guy and fan girl are okay. But ultimately, I think we mostly liked it because it's was the only take on "These kids are playing /inside/ the video game!!!" at the time, before the concept was explored to death in anime.
