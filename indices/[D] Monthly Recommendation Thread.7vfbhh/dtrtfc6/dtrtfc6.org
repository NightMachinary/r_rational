I recommend Code Lyoko. It's a French cartoon (although it has a very good English dub) that is available [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqBBMSS2bno&list=PL8E15wc0MoOap139fhJcf-o8xL7YY416C][on Youtube]]. It's very well done. The first season is a bit formulaic since it was written to be viewable out of order, but later seasons are much less so (especially the fourth).

The show is about a group of middle school students who discover a supercomputer that contains a virtual world called Lyoko. On the computer, they have to fight an artificial intelligence who wants to kill humanity.

It has a small but dedicated English fanbase and I think that it'll really appeal to the large majority of people on this sub.

[Also, if you want to watch it properly, you might want to start with the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msuusqraTIY&index=2&list=PL8E15wc0MoOap139fhJcf-o8xL7YY416C][first episode]] rather than the prequel]
