A couple more good abridged series are Faulerro's [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ2qHjL_gVN577A6Qam2V1-RghVuB8zfy][danganronpa abridged thing]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS_eWXHBYXhOWIvE3vLNauKLvpyDgzqJ9][nullmetal alchemist]]. Both have good writing and production quality, don't take themselves especially seriously, and are unfortunately dead. There is still enough to enjoy

One hidden gem I found recently is BAC's [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL853Lf5HtEQwn7VaHPrxl2efFbSuBYVLk][Bleach S]] wherein Ichigo just wants to talk thing out with whoever it is that he happens to be fighting, Orihime is dangerously genre savvy, and +Aizen+Josh Groban is just as terrifying as he should be. They update regularly, and have just remade the first episode to be more representative of the later ones quality
