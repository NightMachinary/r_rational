I wholeheartedly recommend [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDr8HZvJ_30][Kotoura-san Abridged]]. The show it is based on, Kotoura-san, is about a girl whose parents abandoned her because she has mind-reading powers... so there is a lot of trauma and depression to deal with. The abridged series also has all of that while somehow being hilarious.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Titans_Go!_(TV_series][Teen Titans Go]]) might be considered an abridged series, maybe? It has new animation, rather than dubbing over something, but it takes the characters and world from the Teen Titans show and plays it for laughs.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDWp9IC1ZxI&list=PL8cGaJKvM_-5lkA0h_cwWxYrC-fc27apd][My Little Pony: Friendship is Witchcraft]]. In which Fluttershy has a cult, Applejack has trauma from the war, Rarity makes giant hats, Rainbowdash has poor eyesight, Pinkie bakes a portal, Twilight wants to become a Princess by any means necessary, everypony hates Spike and somepony is a robot.

And if you need more I suppose you could also watch [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-32NGYLqwAQ&list=PLTagxffHmpfT765IfQj68dMmfFs3W7s1f][Yu-Gi-Oh Abridged]].
