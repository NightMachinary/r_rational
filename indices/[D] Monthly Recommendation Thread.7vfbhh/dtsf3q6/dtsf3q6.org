[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RxFgJkA2ko][Chris and Jack]] need more love. Every one of their videos is absolutely awesome (and short, so it's not a huge time investment).

Anyone knows good Abridged Series? The ones I'm watching or watched:

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nYozPLpJRE&list=PL6EC7B047181AD013][DBZA]] (ongoing) is a classic. Probably the most popular Abridged series there is, made by the very talented guys of TeamFourStar, including LittleKuriboh, the creator of Abridged Series as a concept.

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ0yOmtl96A&list=PLE8663CF9B6EA072E&index=1][CDZA]] (complete): The best French Abridged Series (that I know of). Based on Saint Seya. This the same guy who made the French Abridged Yu-gi-oh sketch for the Joueur du Grenier, for all the 0 persons who know what I'm talking about. Hurry up, 'cause it's being taken down and the creator has said he doesn't intend to fight with the Youtube system anymore (though back ups can probably be found). Again, it's in French, but from what I've seen the subs are decent and even the puns are pretty well translated (though I'm not sure how well the 90s French cartoon dub references carry over).

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKHHqIF-yM4&list=PLqRvzulx5xsqvS7obEPGhsXJ2VwLWOX9A][Abridged on Titan]] (complete): Covers Attack on Titan's first season, made by Reality Punch Studios with Kaiserneko from TeamFourStar. High production quality, but maybe a little generic. It's basically a shorter, wittier version of Attack on Titan. The author also made Fist Master, which seems to be in hiatus now that he's working with TFS.

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQhfkpX9bc&list=PL6PNZBb6b9LvDWpI-5CPYUxG1Rnm-vr9V][Freeman's Mind]] (ongoing). This is pretty long, and gets pretty high quality after a while. Covers the entirety of Half Life, and now the beginning of Half Life 2 (and launched a thousand spin-offs by other people into Portal, Opposing Force, etc, most aren't that good). Described by the author as "If I were a jackass, what would I do?" The author also did Civil Protection, a 10 years old video series that explores what life would be like working as a cop for the combine (it's smarter than it sounds), and Ross's Game Dungeon, a video series about interesting and rarely covered games (some reviews really made me want to play the games, like the one for Strife).

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTKzdPCyZ9c][Full Metal Alchemist Anotherhood]] (complete): A different take on how the Elric brothers could have exploited their powers to reach their goals. Shorter than FMA.

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6kJKxvbgZ0&index=1&list=PLuAOJfsMefuej06Q3n4QrSSC7qYjQ-FlU][Sword Art Online Abridged]] (complete): There are fanfictions made out of love and wanting more of a compelling universe, and there are fanfics made of hatred and wanting to prove to the world that, /yes, you can do better and you fucking should/. SAO Abridged is in the second category. Production quality is pretty high by Abridged Series standards. As a mark of quality, features Takahata101 from TeamFourStar as Heathcliff.

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZrqs5c9tNA&list=PLFEE5FB7BF31B8FF7][Young Justice Abridged]] (ongoing): Started as a dub of YJ, and branched out on DC animated movies (Red Hood, Crisis on Two Earths, etc). The production quality is not as high as the others I linked and the humor can feel a bit forced (especially in the beginning), but that's par for the course for an Abridged Series. Maybe watch one of their latest Abridged Movies first to get an idea of what they're like at their best.

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9yy7WxzLgQ&list=PLKC7HY2CHv4uh1TUUFe03F9_Roa9TgQ5q][Korra Bridged]] (ongoing) (not to be confused with Korra Abridged, which I don't like as much): This is probably the least well known Abridged Series with good production quality I've ever seen. It's a light spoof on Korra, focused less on meta humor or plot and more on character interactions and personal growth. Season 1 is complete, Season 2 ongoing. These guys also made a Code Geass Abridged, and you can see how far they went since the first episode the original author uploaded.

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgnIjJexut4%C3%A0][Hellsing Utimate Abridged]] (ongoing): Made by TeamFourStar. Very funny in an over-the-top vulgar way, with a lot of violence ridiculously obscene dialogues. Since this is TFS, the production quality is basically on a commercial level.

Also, I've you're a fan of DC animated movies and you've somehow missed it, definitely check out Batman: Gotham by Gaslight. I thought it would be really tacky and stereotype-y and over-sexualized, but it's actually really thoughtful and well done and it's up there with /Gods and Monsters/ among my favorite DC movies ever.
