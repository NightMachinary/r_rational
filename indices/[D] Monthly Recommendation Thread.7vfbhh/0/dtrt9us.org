In vaguely-somewhat-rational-adjacent fanfiction, the Harry Potter / The Culture crossover [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/death-by-water-harry-potter-the-culture.44788/][Death By Water]] is pretty good. The beginning couple of chapters are more than a bit rough, but it picks up and improves a lot in later chapters. If you're not into it by Ch. 7 or so, you should /probably/ give up. In particular, Ch. 11's potions class is absolutely delightful and I love that chapter a lot. Also, Quirrelmort confirmed for SSC reader. They're updating at a fairly quick pace, too.
