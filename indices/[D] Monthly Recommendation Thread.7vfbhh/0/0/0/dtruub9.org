Eh, I don't think Player of Games is as great as everyone says it is. Consider Phlebas is fun, but the least "Culture-y" of all the books. I'm partial to Use of Weapons and Excession. Use of Weapons I think is the best "here's the Culture from the POV of an outsider" narrative, plus it's just a great personal story for the protagonist. Excession may be the best Culture book in my opinion, because it focuses heavily on the Minds, which are really the best part of the series.
