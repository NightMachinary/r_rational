It's been a good while since I read the Culture series but I did read it in its entirely and agree that Player of Games and Consider Phlebas were overhyped relative to my tastes. I don't think I enjoyed Excession much /because/ of its heavy focus on the Minds (IIRC), in that I find the idea of benevolent mysterious superintelligences works a lot better from a distance, where you only see them performing feats of miraculous technomagic or explicitly dumbing themselves down to avatar form for interaction with humans. I think Excession showed those chatrooms that let you peer directly into the thought processes of the Minds, and they read like any old interhuman chatroom conversation, even if they occurred on the scale of nanoseconds or whatever. Focusing on the Minds just revealed the wizard behind the curtain that was Iain Banks making everything up, and Banks was decidedly not a post-singularity superintelligence. Bit suspension of disbelief breaking, that was.

My favorites, though, were Use of Weapons and Surface Detail (which should be read in that order), the latter because it explored some vaguely interesting questions like the nature of personal identity or the moral status of simulated individuals.
