Grim dark is the term that's been coined for that fantasy sub genre. Before I discovered rational fiction it was the majority of what I read. Joe Abercrombie's works were probably my favourites - if you're just on his first novel, the trilogy is more than it initially seems - but R Scott Bakkers â€˜Second Apocalypse' series was great and Matthew Stovers Caine series is another I would highly recommend.
