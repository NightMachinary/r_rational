I'm not sure I could use that definition to identify a group of works. Protagonists winning but at a cost seems like a not uncommon element in a lot of well written fantasy. As best as I can determine the Matthew Stover series fits the bill.

I should clarify as well that the Joe Abercrombie trilogy and works I spoke about were his non YA works. I stopped his YA trilogy after Half a King.
