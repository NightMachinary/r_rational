I don't mean grimdark, exactly. A lot of what qualifies as grimdark (Warhammer 40k, for example) wouldn't quite fit in with the sort of story I mean.

I think the unifying thread is that the story isn't about whether the protagonist succeeds or not - it's about the price he/she pays to win. Waylander 1 & 2 are good examples of this; on a meta level, Waylander effectively has a 'kill whoever my target is' power, but the story isn't about that.

It's the same for Half A King, the one Joe Abercrombie book I've finished so far. Yarvi always lives, but he often pays a heavy price, or his allies pay it. In a way, a lot of these books have the same protagonist in different bodies and with different names.

The one exception is Son of the Morning, which doesn't really have a single protagonist. It's more like Unsong in terms of the setting, but without the humour.
