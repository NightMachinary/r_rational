If you mean /Shadows Linger/, the first book of the first omnibus, then... well, it depends on your relationship with plot threads left hanging. The omnibuses are well-selected in that they are, more or less, all containing the same arc. The first collection deals with the Black Company in the employ of Lady, wife and rule of the late Dominator, who conquered the empire she resides over in the first place. Their task is to ferret out and engage against revolutionaries rising up against the empire. The whole arc culminates in the third book of the omnibus, naturally, and the company leaves the employ and instead starts their search for Khatovar, their original employer hundreds of years ago. The major PoV character is Croaker, company physician and annalist, and we're supposedly reading the annals of the company.

This leads into the next major arc, which takes place in the equivalent of South Asia (particularly India) in contrast to the previously European mold of the setting. They are employed by various powers there, taking part in revolutions and counter-revolutions that, in some aspect, draw parallels to occupying and policing foreign countries by outside invaders, which the company effectively /is/. The PoV changes here, as the annals are kept by different people. Of note is the portrayal of the wrong part of a siege, and seeing how the characters cope with deceasing stocks of food and water.

During this they do get hints as to Khatovar, and saying too much here would be spoiling the book, in case you do decide to read it.

So in brief, yes, the first book will give you a good overview of the setting, but for completeness' sake I'd advise reading the whole omnibus. Plus, I gather the single books will by now be hard to come by.

To add to that, since the PoV is almost always the annalist of the company, they're privy to many, but not all conversations. They're an officer in rank, certainly, and as such take part in planning and such, but not always for fear of the annals falling into enemy hands. Which means plans at times do come as a surprise to the annalist. Croaker in particular complains about this a lot.
