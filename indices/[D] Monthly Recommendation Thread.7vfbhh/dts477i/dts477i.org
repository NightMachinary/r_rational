#+begin_quote
  A young priestess has formed her first adventuring party, but almost immediately they find themselves in distress. It's the Goblin Slayer who comes to their rescue--a man who's dedicated his life to the extermination of all goblins, by any means necessary. And when rumors of his feats begin to circulate, there's no telling who might come calling next...

The dude kills goblins. He is very good at it, and not through any super ability nobody else has or unrealistically superhuman skill. He does not want to fight goblins, he just really wants them dead. There are no sudden powerups to match escalating adversity, just meticious planning and preparation. At one point protagonists take out goblin camp by magically putting them all to sleep and suppressing sound propagation in the area, and just proceed to methodically stab them all.
