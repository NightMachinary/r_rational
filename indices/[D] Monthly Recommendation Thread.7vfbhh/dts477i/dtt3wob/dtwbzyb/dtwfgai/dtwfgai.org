I think the censorship decisions is part of focusing the story. Nudity draws attention, and the author makes it easy to pay attention to just how fucked up the setting is. The character's bodies during the bathing scene are unimportant to the plot in comparison to their words.

It might also be a reflection of the characters' perspectives.

One of the ongoing themes with the protagonist is that he doesn't care about normal things like love or adventure, instead focusing on the stuff that's relevant to his obsession---these atrocities are signs of goblins. Seeing people in those situations is also probably impossible to not notice when you've got mental scars related to it.

In the bathing scene, the two characters didn't care about their nudity, possibly causing it to not be the focus of the scene. If the story was meant exclusively to reflect the protagonist's perspective instead of theirs, then he also probably wouldn't care about their nudity.

If later the story starts caring about bathing scenes---or wondrous imagery inspiring any feelings of adventure---in proportion to character development, then that may confirm the theory.
