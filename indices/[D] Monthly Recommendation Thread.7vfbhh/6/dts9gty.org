While I'm not a huge fan of ASoIaF (I read the first three books then stopped because the pacing was bad and I wasn't invested in any of the characters), I like that that type of setting - dark, brutal fantasy with low magic - has become more popular. Has anyone else read The Left Hand of God trilogy, Son of the Morning, or The Broken Empire trilogy? There's also Joe Abercrombie's stuff but I'm only just getting started on that.

Some of it reminds me of the Drenai setting by David Gemmell, which is obviously somewhat older (also where my username is from), but that tends to have a little more heroics.

There're quite a few rational and rational-adjacent stories that are very similar - Practical Guide to Evil and Worm are both close enough in some way that I feel like they form a cohesive group, although I'm not sure what to call it.

If anyone has other recommendations in the same direction, I'd be quite appreciative. Also, if you enjoyed any of the books or series I mentioned and want to talk about which others are similar or are likely to also interest you, I'm more than happy to chat about it.
