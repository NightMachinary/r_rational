  Protagonists winning but at a cost seems like a not uncommon element in a lot of well written fantasy.

I definitely agree with this. What's less common is for the protagonist's success to feel almost-guaranteed, but the developmental cost to him/her being the sticking point. It's in some cases almost like the issue isn't whether the character can survive a challenge, but more whether the reader will still be rooting for them afterwards, as they approach the line of 'irredeemably evil' (in the case of e.g. Jorg in the Broken Empire trilogy) or 'as corrupt as the opposition' (as in The Left Hand Of God).

It's hard to describe what exactly I mean, especially in written form. The sort of conceptual cluster of stories I'm trying vaguely to gesture at isn't necessarily all that coherent in a lot of ways, but I still feel like there's an underlying thread that binds them together.
