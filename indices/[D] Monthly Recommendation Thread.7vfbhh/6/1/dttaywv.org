I'd recommend The Black Company by Glen Cook ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Company][wiki]]) ([[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackCompany][TVT]]). It follows the events of the eponymous mercenary company in a medieval fantasy setting as they're employed by the archetypical evil empire whose original conquerer had been usurped by his wife.

Personally I enjoyed the books, both for their grey-in-gray setting and the characterisation and their worldbuilding. The series is finished, I think, with the novels now available in the form of three omnibus editions: The Books of the North, The Books of the South, The Books of the Glittering Stone.

The magic system isn't so much as explained as present, with the wizards and witches being the curious opposite of the archetypical glass cannon. The more powerful a wizard is, the harder they are to kill and the longer they live. It's not clear if that is due to their efforts of their talents, but it remains true.
