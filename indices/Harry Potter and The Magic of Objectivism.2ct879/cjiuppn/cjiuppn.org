Disclaimer: I am partial to objectivism, and though I do not label myself an objectivist, I share a lot of beliefs with objectivism's core tenets.

That being said: This was pretty funny. I was worried it was going to be a parody of the shitty caricature the likes of Salon or HuffPo like to drag out and burn every so often. However, it had a least a few very barbs, mostly relating to Rand's writing style rather than her philosophy, that I found very funny.

One odd note: The fuck is with the SNAPE IS A JEW thing? The fact that this guy seems to associate the way Snape is described with Jews is what's wrong here, not that one of JK's archtypical characters has a typical description for said archtype, and archtype that many thorughout the years have associated with Jews (shiftyness).

It's just... weird. A hook nose is really the only part of Snape's description that can really be taken to imply Jewish heritage but even that's a stretch.

Also, I really like the art. Silly name, but great art.
