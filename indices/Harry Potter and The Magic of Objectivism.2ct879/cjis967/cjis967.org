Just in case no one was aware of this reddit functionality, there's an [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/duplicates/2ct879/harry_potter_and_the_magic_of_objectivism/]["other discussions"]] link at the top of the page which will get you to the other discussions (naturally) like those posted at [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/26ua4g/ayn_rands_harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone/][/r/HPMOR]]. I found this a quite funny send up of both Ayn Rand's writing and the dark side of using fanfic to make an author tract, but your mileage may vary.
