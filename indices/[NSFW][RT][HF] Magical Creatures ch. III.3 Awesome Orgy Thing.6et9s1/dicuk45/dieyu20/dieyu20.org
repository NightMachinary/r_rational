Ok, you know what? Removed. Sorry. Two grounds here:

- No obvious rationality or rational content.

- Very difficult to read.

It's not exactly good writing, or good rational writing, to make me read from the first-person perspective of extremely sexually aroused characters who aren't going to give me any description of what their lives and their worlds are, what they look like, what their goals are (besides the sex), etc.
