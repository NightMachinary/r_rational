Your [[http://sadehall.tumblr.com/contents.html][table of contents]] lists all of the third major division of this story as "III: Chapter One." So by "a couple of chapters" do you mean "a couple of eight-segment things" - such that we might get to the theory of mind stuff sometime in late September / early October, and after another ~200k words (taking your most recent chapter length as typical)?
