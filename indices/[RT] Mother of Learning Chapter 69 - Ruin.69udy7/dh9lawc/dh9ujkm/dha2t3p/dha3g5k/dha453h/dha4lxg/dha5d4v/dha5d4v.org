Ok I concede, maybe they would get him. To your point, while it took them almost the entire restart this time to get the orb, the next time should be much easier since they know where it is, the protections around it and get reinforcements for the hydra. Maybe even start the encounter with the final trap in place.

The reason why I was opposed to them getting Damien was that he wouldn't leave without the orb and it is a waste of time to try and get the orb if it takes the entire month to do so. But if it takes less than half the month it might help having his experience. That being said, having him on wastes as much as half a restart (lots of foreplay with convincing him, his future in-laws, his team, then hiring reinforcements, then getting the actual orb), so his experience at least better reduce their search time by more than half, if he is going to be useful.
