I think you're somewhat misreading the situation.

It's Daimen who should be offering help. I believe the reason why he is grumpy in this chapter is that he realizes that the Orb is found and Zorian has no use for him in the future, where he loses all memories. He needs to continue to be useful to Zorian in the future restarts, or he is screwed in the real world. "Best" case scenario Zorian gets out of the loop and ignores the orb in real world. That would leave real!Daimen still stuck with nigh impossible mission. Middle case (for Daimen) is that real!Zach snatches the orb for himself. Worst case is that the red robe succeeds (still no orb for Daimen, plus a shitty possible world to live in)
