You're actually missing some of the info. It's controlled by a soul marker in the time loop. Most things act normally in the timeloop, but the keys do not necessarily (they absolutely don't in at least one way - they don't allow people to escape the timeloop when they're not in it). Whoever made the keys might've keyed them into the maker only during the loop.
