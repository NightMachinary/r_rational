OK, but even then, whatever else could theoretically control it is likely going to be an artifact on the same kind of level. And the emperor didn't have any other Key pieces on his person when he died, but he was able to deploy the orb. So it seems to me that he probably did have a marker, somehow. Perhaps the emperors were in the habit of using the Key to mark their heirs, in preparation for the next Gate activation (or out of tradition, without knowing what it was really for)?
