Possible. Or else, the orb works like any other magic artifact and can be operated by mages normally by infusing mana in a specific way, but it simply has an additional function of also being affected by the marker as well. It probably has more than one failsafe to return it to its original shape once deployed, beside interaction with the marker, in case its owner dies before doing so.

The fact that it's an imperial artifact responding to the marker neither confirms nor denies that Ikosian royalty all have a marker as a bloodline (which is especially doubtful), or are capable of transferring it.
