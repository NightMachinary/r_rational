I think all the keys are controlled by a soul marker while in the time loop. The marker probably allows its users to get the keys no matter what. In this case it can force the orb out of its activated state so loopers can actually retrieve it. The gate is designed very well and it wouldn't make sense for the keys to be unobtainable. The actual control for them in the real world is probably something else.
