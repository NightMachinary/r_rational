Wait, wraiths can consume souls? I thought souls were indestructible?

I guess it would still be possible to twist and reshape a soul into a tool, as necromancers do...so it wouldn't be "consumption" in the sense of using it /up/, just using it.

And aww, missed opportunity for Zach to fight the troll/dragon...

ETA At least Zach will get the satisfaction of fighting the hydra without Daimen's team next time. Of course, that /might/ actually make it easier for him; no need to protect anyone except Zorian.

Plus, in theory stealth might now be possible. If they can sneak past the chameleon drakes, then Zorian can un-deploy the orb and seal the hydra inside. Because why stop at a portable palace when you can also carry a Pokemon?
