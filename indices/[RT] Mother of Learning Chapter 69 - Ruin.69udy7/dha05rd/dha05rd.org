Ah, the classic D&D Wightpocalypse.

Back then you did it by virtue of the "Locate City" spell.\\
You see, most /dangerous/ spells strictly limit the number and range of targets, for obvious balance reasons. You Magic Missile a specified number of people, you Grease a small area in front of you. And so on.

Locate City is a harmless Level 1 spell available to most spellcasting classes; its innocuous purpose is spelt out in its name - it locates a city. That's all it does. But its purpose perforce means that it /targets an entire city/. This presents a loophole in the limited targetting rules that can be exploited using two otherwise unrelated rules:

1. Dungeons and Dragons includes "metamagic" skills. Rather than learning /new/ spells, you can increase your general spellcasting ability such that the spells you've already learned are empowered. These skills might let you increase your spells' duration, or their strength...or add additional effects.

2. Certain evil-flavoured effects reduce character levels rather than cause physical damage. When a character's level is reduced to zero by an an outside effect, they die, and they are reanimated as a type of undead called a "wight". Wights are intelligent, evil, and can drain living beings by touch, turning them into more wights. Wights are nasty low-level threats, but necromancy is limited in range and targets, as mentioned above, so you tend to only encounter one or two at a time.

The so-called "Locate City Bomb" uses metamagic skills to add a level-draining effect to the otherwise harmless but immensely wide-target Locate City spell. This causes every commoner within the targetted city to lose levels, with no "saving throw" to prevent it. As a result, *thousands* of wights are spawned, all of which immediately leave the city and begin turning every living being in the surrounding countryside into more wights, which spread out further and...you get the idea.

The starting population of several thousand wights increases exponentially. It soon becomes a continent-spanning existential crisis that even epic-level parties struggle to bring under control without divine or GM intervention. All from an innocuous Level 1 spell that any beginner spellcaster can learn, a few mostly-useless metamagic skills, and a basic life-drain effect that several races get as a /free bonus/.
