They are magically isolated from the outside world as far as possible, but it's not on the same level as a pocket dimension, which is why they only reach maximum 30x time dilation. I doubt it would be enough to count as nesting dimensions.

And I don't recall any warnings about nesting dimensions, either. After all, the loop world contains multiple pocket dimensions eg Silverlake. They were warned about tampering with the /Primordial/ pocket dimensions, certainly - not because of nesting, but because of the apocalyptic monsters inside.
