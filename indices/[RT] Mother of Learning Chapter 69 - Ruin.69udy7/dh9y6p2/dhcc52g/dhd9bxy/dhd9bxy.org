Interesting idea, but of course we might consider some drawbacks to it. Namely your life in the real world gets shorter the more you use your 'home', so great inside the loop, not so great outside of it.

The orb is a part of the Sovereign Gate system, so I don't know whether the desires of the first emperor were taken into consideration in this.

What would be /really/ cool if the Orb wasn't subject to resets inside the loop. But probably too broken, so I don't expect it to happen.
