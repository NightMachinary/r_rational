  [[https://i.imgur.com/3rljdg0.png][Seemingly encased inside the glass [..] The palace and the trees were extremely detailed and lifelike, to the point that Zorian could count the individual leaves on the trees if he focused on them long enough. It reminded Zorian of one of those novelty snow globes that Cyorian merchants liked to sell, the ones that high-qualify models of famous buildings encased in the glass.]]

  but did you really have to cut off his arms?”

The lack of all the excuses that usually serve as idiot-ball nesting ground is very nice in this story.

  All that was left to do now was to wait for Quatach-Ichl to leave for Ulquaan Ibasa so they could make their move. There was some worry about that, as Quatach-Ichl didn't seem to be getting ready to leave. Xvim had raised the issue that they might have tipped Quatach-Ichl off somehow, and a fierce discussion sprung up about whether to go ahead with the assault anyway if that was the case. Thankfully, the question turned out to be irrelevant in the end -- Quatach-Ichl still left on schedule, and the mission could proceed.

So whatever makes the lich leave is something unexpected and very important. Does [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail][conservation of detail]] state in this case that Zach and Zorian will get involved with that something eventually? Maybe lich has an additional unresolved conflict\fight happening with some other group elsewhere?
