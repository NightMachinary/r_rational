They have to be sealed, and I'm sure that dimensionalism is involved but it's probably not a pocket dimension since it it an actual room.

Also there are pocket dimensions inside the sovereign gate and that is a giant pocket dimension itself.

Maybe the way pocket dimensions work is that they create a gate into a completely different space, not space folded inside actual space. This way it wouldn't matter where the pocket dimension is created since it's only a gate to a completely separate space.
