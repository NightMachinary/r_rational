Nope, I lie.

  Hsan is not set to appear in the story, so I guess I can expand on it a little. Hsan was kind of inspired by China and India, though they are neither. The continent has a history of being unified by a single large nation and that is currently the case as well. That is not to say that Hsan lacks other states as well -- it has plenty of them, it's just that they're smaller and lived under the shadow of the Grand Dynasty. However, the last few emperors of the Grand Dynasty have been very underwhelming and the empire is slowly stagnating and rotting from the inside. Rebellions are starting to get more common and some of the empire's vassal lords are not paying their taxes as they should. Meanwhile, the smaller states that live in the Grand Dynasty's shadow have been more open about trading with Altazia and are rolling out new technologies and mage academies received by their trading partners. Blasphemous voices have started to whisper if it might not be the time for the current Grand Dynasty to fall and a new one to rise from its ashes...

  Hsan has two main forms of magic. The first one is the Ikosian casting system, which they have imported during the height of Ikosian Empire. Since contact with Altazia and Miasina has been sparse since then, and because Hsan mages have never been as numerous or as supported by their states as mages on other two continents, Hsan mages are a somewhat worse than their counterparts in Altazia and Miasina. Their training methods lag in effectiveness, and their spellcasting necessarily suffers accordingly. This is being rapidly corrected now that Altazia merchants are making a big push in the area... outside the Grand Dynasty territory, at least.

  The second form is something I have not really nailed down, and probably won't for a long while. If ever. I was originally thinking of something inspired by martial arts and the like, but the various Xianxia I have checked out since them have inspired me to think in new directions. In setting, the mages tell all kind of wild stories about exotic spellcasters living in Hsan, but little is confirmed and the whole place is a giant mystery aside from a couple of port towns.

  The basic idea was that Hsanic mages are more focused on specialized long-term shaping regimens that give them non-structured magical abilities. This gives them a handful of really flexible abilities, but they can't just pick up new spells like Altazian mages do. But as I said, nothing is really set in stone here, and probably never will be. All that is really important is that native Hsanic mages are Different, with a capital D, but not really superior to Ikosian-style mages.
