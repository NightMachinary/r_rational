I'm curious how Zorian would be able to kill the hydra on his own given enough time, training, and attempts.

My guess is a group of specialized golems plus some mind control. Maybe he could learn that slicing spell Zach used in combination with an anti-teleportation field.

I'm also curious what abilities or insights could be gained by making potions out of the corpse. I hope these questions get explored later!
