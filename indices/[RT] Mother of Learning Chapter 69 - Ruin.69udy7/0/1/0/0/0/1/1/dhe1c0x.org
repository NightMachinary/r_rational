You are refering to that statement he made. Yes I guess that makes more sense. Also it helps move the plot along since it would be easier to convince him to help if he actually asks. But I am not sure why that would change anything for him. Zorian can still ignore him after the loop if he so chooses. But I think that is the best he can hope for.
