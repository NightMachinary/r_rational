I felt slightly compelled to figure out the grammatical rule at play on the first one. The best answer I found came from [[https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/29843/types-of-followed-by-singular-or-plural][here]].

For the phrase "a certain type of artifact(s)", whether artifact is singular or plural depends on if we're using it in an uncountable or countable sense.

If Zorian means that he can sense a single type of the set of things which can be described as artifact-like (referring to the /idea/ of an artifact), he should be using singular artifact.

If Zorian is referring to a single type of a well-known, countable list of specific artifacts, then the current plural usage is correct. In this case, I'd argue that the set /should be/ qualified (e.g. "a certain type of /Imperial Artifacts/"), but that detail might be left out if it's sufficiently implied by the context.

edit: single != specific
