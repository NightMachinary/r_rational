I'm not sure I'd go that far; so long as you ignore the whole "everything I do and think is perfectly controlled by the mentalist" possibility (because you would be helpless in that case, so it's pointless to consider), then you can still reason about the presence or absence of mental tampering based on your current thoughts.
