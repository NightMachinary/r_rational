  The most I see one of them doing is foregoing morals and doing something brutal that the main one wouldn't have been willing to do, but that would still help him.

This is more what I mean by 'going rogue' - Zorian's very dangerous if he's not constrained by his morals. If one of his duplicates decides that nuking a city will make it easier for him to (for example) steal an item from the royal treasury, it just might go ahead and do it.
