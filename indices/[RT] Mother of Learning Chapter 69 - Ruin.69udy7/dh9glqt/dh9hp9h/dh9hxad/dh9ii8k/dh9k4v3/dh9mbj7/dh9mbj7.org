Ah.

That makes /slightly/ more sense, but sounds very inefficient and unreliable. What if it results in the capital assuming the country is under assault and beefing up security? And there's no point in drawing away any "special countermeasures" for wraiths, because priests were not the obstacle to robbing the treasury in the first place.

Plus the moral implications, because souls are indestructible, so this will have eternal implications despite the time loop.
