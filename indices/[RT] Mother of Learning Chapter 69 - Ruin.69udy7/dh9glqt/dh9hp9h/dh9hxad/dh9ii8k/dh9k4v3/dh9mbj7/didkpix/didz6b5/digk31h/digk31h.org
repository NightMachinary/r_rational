In my opinion, the meaning---that souls are destroyed---is clear from the passage you mention, however there's further clarification in the discussion about switching souls and again about the moral ramifications of lesser markers. Destruction of an original or sufficiently diverged soul is referred to as a type of murder. Thus, the discussion about mass murder is indeed referring to the obliteration of souls.
