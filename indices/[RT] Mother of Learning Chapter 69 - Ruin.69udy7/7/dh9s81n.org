Pokeball: GET.

A really fun chapter, with some very good action and interesting plot.

I think Sudomir's transformation is madness-/induced/. I mean that he has to get himself into that mad state to trigger a pre-casted transformation. Though it could be just a side effect, but I like the idea of an emotion-based trigger.
