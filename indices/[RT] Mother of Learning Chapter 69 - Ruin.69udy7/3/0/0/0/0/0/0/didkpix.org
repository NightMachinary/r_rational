I agree about uncertain benefits of using the nuke on another city, though he could also carry out the nuke, then send in simulacra to observe the effect on security. That's all assuming he could still function after doing something so evil, even it was a simulacrum that did it. I doubt his simulacra would even consider using a nuke though.

That said, we know souls are destructible as all unmarked souls are destroyed at the end of the month. I apologize if you meant "destructible by normal means". Thus, a wraith attack should have no lasting effects.
