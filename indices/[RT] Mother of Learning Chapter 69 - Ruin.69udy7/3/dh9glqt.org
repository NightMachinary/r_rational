So Sudomir's building the equivalent of a nuke. I wonder what the odds are that Zorian ends up using it himself? On the one hand, it would definitely be a culmination of his knowledge of necromancy. On the other hand, I think (character-wise) it's completely out of the question.

The one thing that does worry me about all this dangerous knowledge that Zorian's effectively gathering is that his duplicates have been slowly becoming more and more independent, and that seems like it could be leading up to one of them going rogue.
