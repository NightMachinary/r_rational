Hmm...I don't see how the two are similar except that they both kill lots of people. Locate City Bomb is about adding extra energy/damage types to a wide-area divination, causing everything (or at least every creature) in the targeted area to be flung away and killed. Whereas the wraith bombs are about releasing self-replicating destroyers, leading to necromancy's version of a grey goo scenario.
