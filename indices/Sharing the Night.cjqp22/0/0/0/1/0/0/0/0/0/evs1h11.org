The problem I have with all of that is that life doesn't give you a trigger warning. "Uncontrolled exposure" through books and movies and college lectures /is/ the controlled exposure that prepares you for encountering the trigger in the real world. You can't put a fence around the family two tables over who met there specifically to discuss a familial issue that triggers you. If you've been allowed to avoid reading about it or your professor allowed you to sit out of that class, then you're suddenly in the pool and don't know how to swim.
