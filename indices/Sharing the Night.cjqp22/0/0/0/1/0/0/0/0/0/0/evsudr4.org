You're talking as of exposure therapy is just simply repeatedly running someone through their trigger, with no support, and letting them learn how to cope.

In reality, that's likely just going to traumatize then further. Exposure therapy involves giving someone the tools to cope, standing at their side while they encounter the /smallest possible quantum/ of their trigger, and then slowly escalating and stepping away in tiny intervals until they can deal with a full-strength trigger on their own. And, all the while, giving them the opportunity to call a halt if things get too intense, because /going into full-blown triggered traumatic distress may just reinforce the trigger further/. Hence, the swimming analogy. Throwing a non-swimmer into a lake unprepared isn't teaching them to swim; it's putting their very life at risk.

I'm going to change analogies here, since "you can't put a fence around all the water in the world" went over your head entirely.

Yes, therapy is needed, and yes, therapy can involve exposing people to their trigger repeatedly. But what you're basically telling people with peanut allergies is that allergen warnings aren't necessary because peanut desensitization therapy is a thing, and because you can't protect someone from every source of peanuts. *Exposure to peanuts can kill you if you are allergic enough to peanuts.* (Which is why desensitization therapy doesn't just consist of feeding an allergic person peanut butter sandwiches until they're cured). You can carry an Epi-Pen (which, in this analogy, would be having a therapist on speed-dial), but they're expensive, and a far better tactic is just to make every effort to avoid coming in contact with peanuts, to the best of your ability, until/unless you can be successfully desensitized to them.

If someone were able to learn how to cope just by being exposed repeatedly, a lot of therapists would be out of a job. The reason they're not is that it's not nearly that simple, and you reducing it to this, to such an extent that providing trigger warnings is "literally the stupidest thing," is... Well... If mental illness weren't as stigmatized and misunderstood as it is, I'd call it "facile to the point of either willful ignorance or disingenuousness," but, under current circumstances, I'll settle for "profoundly misinformed."

(Once again, all of the above is argued under the assumption that trigger warnings are effective, which I don't take as proven.)
