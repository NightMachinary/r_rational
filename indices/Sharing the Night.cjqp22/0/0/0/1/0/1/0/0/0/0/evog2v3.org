I did read the articles actually and am not contesting that they're harmful. I am saying it's a weird conspiracy to claim that people are spreading them on purpose. But I think you know this and are just trying to pretend I said something I didn't so you don't look dumb. But what do I know, I only read the actual articles and saw that they said nothing about your conspiracy claim.
