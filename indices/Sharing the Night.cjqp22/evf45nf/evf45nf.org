Trigger warnings: innuendo, ponies.

Status: complete.

It's a story about Twilight ascending to godhood. It's one of those rare gems that's incredibly well-written, sufficiently â€˜rational' for this subreddit, and still puts the characters and story ahead of any didactics. It also doesn't treat immortality as a curse, either explicitly /or/ implicitly, which is quite a feat, especially while still acknowledging that downsides exist.

Mostly, I put this here because I read it and I think it's good fun while also being intelligent enough that the people here won't just sneer at it because ponies.
