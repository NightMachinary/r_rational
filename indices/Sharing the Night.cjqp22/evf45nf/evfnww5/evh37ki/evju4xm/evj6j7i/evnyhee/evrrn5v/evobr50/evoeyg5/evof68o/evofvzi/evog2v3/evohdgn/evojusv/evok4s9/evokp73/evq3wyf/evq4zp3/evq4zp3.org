Are you being intentionally obtuse or just missing the point? I was honestly wondering, but at this point I think I know. You straight out admitted it, even, that your conspiracy makes no sense. And yet the earnestness with which you seem to believe that I doubt the claims that these chemicals are poison is troubling. You've come to a point where you realized you're wrong, but instead of simply admitting it you push back. It's not healthy, you know. Relationships are ruined that way. You didn't even have to admit that your claim was stupid, you just had to laugh it off. Just say something like, “ah, yeah, that was a funny idea, I didn't really mean it,” and you could've salvaged your reputation. It's too late now, of course. You already look like an idiot, and if you actually do reveal that you're doing all this simply to avoid admitting that you were wrong, you look socially inept. You have no winning moves. Your only option is to slowly backtrack, frantically implying I said things I didn't and posting walls of text. Are you afraid of looking stupid? I'm mocking you, but not because you were wrong. It's because I'm frustrated, because you didn't just drop it. It's because you insist in this continuing this little game, insulting me by insinuation. You post link after link that I've already read, ignoring the fact that yes, I do read that quickly by pointing to outdated information, and simply failing to acknowledge another point on which you were proven wrong. I've avoided calling this behavior out for a while now, but this is where it ends.
