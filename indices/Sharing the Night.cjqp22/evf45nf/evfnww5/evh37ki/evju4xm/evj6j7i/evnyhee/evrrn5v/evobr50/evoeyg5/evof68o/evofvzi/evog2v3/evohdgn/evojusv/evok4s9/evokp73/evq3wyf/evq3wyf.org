  So, you're factually wrong there.

  I said that your conspiracy, that these chemicals were spread intentionally, is stupid and wrong.
#+end_quote

Sure, it probably is. But again, I don't always believe that it's being done purposefully. In fact, I don't even /usually/ believe it. Right now, at this very moment, it seems patently absurd. But the effects of these chemicals are very, /very/ real.

No one who makes an honest effort to truly look at the research could come away from it saying something as ridiculous as:

#+begin_quote
  No, no one is purposefully *poisoning* people. Some materials simply turned out to be *harmful* and so they're *not being used anymore.* That's all there is to it.
#+end_quote

They aren't poisons, they're endocrine disruptors. They aren't simply harmful, they're /endocrine disruptors./ And they're used in just about every product you've ever consumed.

#+begin_quote
  Alongside the evidence of continued adverse trends in male reproductive health in humans, data describing patterns of reproductive dysfunction in male wildlife have also expanded considerably over the past ten years. In many cases, these patterns appear to mirror those observed in humans, in that the affected wildlife populations exhibit a suite of symptoms consistent with a demasculinizing and/or feminizing mode of action.
#+end_quote

That's from a 300 page report by the World Health Organization titled "[[https://www.who.int/ceh/publications/endocrine/en/][State of the science of endocrine disrupting chemicals - 2012: An assessment of the state of the science of endocrine disruptors prepared by a group of experts for the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and WHO]]." It doesn't matter that it isn't being done intentionally. We're being feminized. That's all there is to it.

I provided a lot of links here to some relatively dense material. You're not going to read any of it. You might skim some of it. If you fully read just one link, make it this one:

+EDIT: Here's a popsci article about that last study, if you'd find that easier to digest:+ No, actually. Scratch that.
