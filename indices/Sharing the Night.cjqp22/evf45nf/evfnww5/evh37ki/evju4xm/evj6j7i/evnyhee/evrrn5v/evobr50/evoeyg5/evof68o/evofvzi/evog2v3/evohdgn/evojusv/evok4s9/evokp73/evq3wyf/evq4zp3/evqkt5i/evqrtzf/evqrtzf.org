You are still doing it. Reread what I wrote and stop twisting my words. Here are the facts:

1. You claimed there is a conspiracy to poison people.

2. I disputed that statement.

3. You said that no, actually, poison is poison.

4. I said that actually, I know that; you're wrong in saying that there is a conspiracy to poison people.

5. Repeat ad nauseam.
