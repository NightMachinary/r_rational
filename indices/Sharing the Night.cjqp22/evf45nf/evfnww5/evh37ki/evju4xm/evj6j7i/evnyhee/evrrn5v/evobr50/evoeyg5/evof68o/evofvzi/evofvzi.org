You didn't read that in 2 minutes. You certainly didn't do 90 minutes of research in 2 minutes.

  Are you trying to sound like a conspiracy nut? No, no one is purposefully poisoning people.

As I said in the comment you originally responded to, I don't always believe that it's being done purposefully.

  Some materials simply turned out to be harmful and so they're not being used anymore.

You didn't even do 90 seconds worth of research. BPA is well known, so products (especially plastic water bottles) are quick to state that they're "BPA Free." BPA has been substituted for BPS and BPF and about half a dozen other chemicals. People who kinda know about things kinda know about bisphenols. People generally don't know about phthalates, and there are dozens and dozens of phthalates. Plastic *IS* bisphenols and phtalates. Synthetic fragrance *IS* phthalates. These aren't chemicals used in the production of these products, they ARE the products.
