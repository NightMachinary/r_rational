  I really don't think that's equivalent at all.

Okay. Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that trigger warnings work as intended, and prevent distress.

There is a potential negative consequence (traumatic distress/drowning). There is an hazardous environment (a trigger/open water) which creates a risk of experiencing that negative consequence. Controlled exposure to that risk (exposure therapy/swimming lessons) will, in the long-term, prevent the negative consequence from occurring, as the person learns how to survive being in the risky situation (triggering scenarios/water). Uncontrolled exposure will just lead to distress.

I think that's a pretty equivalent analogy. How is it not so?

You can't put a fence around the entirety of water. Given that you can drown in water an inch deep, your choices are to stay inside or to risk drowning.

You can, however, put fences on water that you have introduced, which create a substantially increased risk of someone wandering into unawares and drowning in it. Which is what pool fence legislation does. And which, in theory, trigger warnings do.
