Seriously. A soldier at age 18 goes off to war and makes what he believes will be a lifelong friend, and then two years later he sees his good friend's head get blown off, and he has to just get on with life. He doesn't get a trigger warning before a car backfires near him, or before some redneck goes into the woods to play with their gun within earshot, or before a neighbor decides to celebrate their kid's birthday with fireworks. Trigger warnings are literally the stupidest thing. People who have /actual/ PTSD that isn't self-diagnosed and has to be treated by actual psychologists, those psychologists treat them with /exposure therapy/ where they literally expose the person to their triggers repeatedly.

The way self-identified liberals have become is so absurd that I sometimes think it's been done on purpose as sabotage. Possibly by the same group that's allowed bisphenols and phthalates (endocrine disruptors that mimic estrogen and block testosterone) to be used in such a wide range of consumer goods (from plastic bottles and toys to food packaging to the synthetic fragrances in perfumes and air "fresheners") that those chemicals show up in the urine of almost every U.S. citizen who's ever been tested.

That sounds like an Alex Jones conspiracy theory, but I think I believe it sometimes. I'm pretty sure I believe it right now, while I'm talking about it. Even when I don't believe it's being done on purpose, it's still definitely a real thing and I sincerely believe that exposure to estrogenics and testosterone-blockers in the womb is having and has been having an epigenetic effect. People are absolutely being exposed to them in utero during development. Our children's children are going to think we were incredibly stupid for allowing Febreze to be legal.

EDIT: I also often believe that the obviously stupid stuff with mommy bloggers prattling on about vaccines and GMOs and fluoride is heavily promoted by the media to make the easy mental shortcut "person starts talking about chemicals, person is an ignorant moron" so people won't pay much attention when people bring up the facts about endocrine-disrupting petrochemicals saturating our food and water and air.
