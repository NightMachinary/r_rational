Sure, but they're still useful. They can even be useful in /avoiding/ spoilers.

Before I watch any movies I think might have a torture scene I make sure to check their Wikipedia article and skim the summary to see if they do. I'd probably be a lot less spoiled if the movie just told me "there's torture in it" instead.
