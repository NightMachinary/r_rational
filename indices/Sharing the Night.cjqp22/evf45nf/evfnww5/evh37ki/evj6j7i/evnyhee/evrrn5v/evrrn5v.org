  Trigger warnings are literally the stupidest thing. People who have actual PTSD that isn't self-diagnosed and has to be treated by actual psychologists, those psychologists treat them with exposure therapy where they literally expose the person to their triggers repeatedly.

...In a safe, controlled environment with mental health experts at the ready to treat any adverse reactions.

I'm not totally convinced about the value of content/trigger warnings (e.g. [[https://slate.com/technology/2019/07/trigger-warnings-research-shows-they-dont-work-might-hurt.html][this article]] explains why they might be more harmful than helpful), but your argument is roughly equivalent to "Swimming instructors literally take children into the water repeatedly to teach them to swim and not drown, so the laws requiring people to put fences around their pools to prevent kids from drowning are literally the stupidest thing."
