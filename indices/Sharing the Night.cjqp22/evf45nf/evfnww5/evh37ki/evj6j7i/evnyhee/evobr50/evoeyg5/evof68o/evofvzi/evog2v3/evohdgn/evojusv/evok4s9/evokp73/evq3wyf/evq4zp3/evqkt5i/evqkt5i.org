Wow. That was the most pretentiously condescending thing I've read in at least a month. Manipulative as well. It'd take me a long time to unpack all of that...

*sigh*

  the earnestness with which you seem to believe that I doubt the claims that these chemicals are poison is troubling.

I don't believe that you don't believe EDCs are harmful, I believe that you don't actually know what they actually are and what they're actually doing because you're not actually reading.

  You post link after link that I've already read

Why lie? And about something so obvious at that? It's ridiculous.

  You've come to a point where you realized you're wrong, but instead of simply admitting it you push back. It's not healthy, you know. Relationships are ruined that way. You didn't even have to admit that your claim was stupid, you just had to laugh it off. Just say something like, “ah, yeah, that was a funny idea, I didn't really mean it,” and you could've salvaged your reputation. It's too late now, of course. You already look like an idiot, and if you actually do reveal that you're doing all this simply to avoid admitting that you were wrong, you look socially inept. You have no winning moves. Your only option is to slowly backtrack, frantically implying I said things I didn't and posting walls of text.

Jesus H. Christ.

"I sometimes think it's been done on purpose as sabotage."

"That sounds like an Alex Jones conspiracy theory, but I think I believe it sometimes. I'm pretty sure I believe it right now, while I'm talking about it."

"As I said in the comment you originally responded to, I don't always believe that it's being done purposefully."

Maybe if you'd slow down and read correctly on the first pass, you wouldn't miss that sort of thing. 95% of the time, I don't believe it's being done on purpose. 5% of the time, I /do/ believe it. I /did/ really mean it last night, because I believed it then. I don't believe it right now. What's so hard to understand about that?

"I said that your conspiracy, that these chemicals were spread intentionally, is stupid and wrong."

"Sure, it probably is."

I literally admitted that I was wrong. I'll go further now. The products came first, and discoveries about their biologically active properties came second, and it's probably not possible for this to have been premeditated. It'd be pretty stupid to believe that there's some sort of secret agenda doing it on purpose, it's just a thing that happens to be happening. Where do you see push-back?

Pfft. When have I /ever/ seemed to care about Elizabeth's reputation?

That isn't a thing that happened? Where do you see anything that looks like that?

But it's okay when /you/ do it, huh?

I'm really not even sure what this argument is about. You reacted incredibly strongly to something that I from the very beginning said I didn't usually believe and that I acknowledged sounded like a weird wingnut conspiracy theory.

  The way self-identified liberals have become is so absurd that I sometimes think it's been done on purpose as sabotage.

Is that what actually upset you? Would it pacify you if I were to state that I accept the true facts that trickle-down economics is mathematically bullshit, homosexuality is a biological trait and not a choice, and global warming /is/ actually happening and /is/ actually a result of human carbon emissions?

Are you upset because of what's implied by these chemicals being estrogenics and anti-androgens? I didn't even bring up androgenics and anti-estrogens.
