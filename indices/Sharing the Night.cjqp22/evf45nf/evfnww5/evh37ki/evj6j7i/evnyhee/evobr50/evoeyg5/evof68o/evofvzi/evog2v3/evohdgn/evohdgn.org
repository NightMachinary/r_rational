  I did read the articles actually and am not contesting that [bisphenols and phtalates are] harmful [chemicals].

It should take an average of 7+ minutes to read /that one singular article/. I linked it twice because I'm drunk. So no, you didn't read "those" "articles," because it was just the one article, and to read it once in the span of 2 minutes would mean a reading speed of like 900 words per minute, which is bullshit.

  But what do I know, I only read the actual articles and saw that they said nothing about your conspiracy claim.

The conclusions I've drawn about the facts don't negate the facts. It is an irrefutable fact that bisphenols and phthalates are endocrine disruptors, and it is an irrefutable fact that 99.9% of fetuses/embryos/whatevers are exposed to them in utero.

I'm dropping out and won't see your reply for like fifteen hours. Take that time to sincerely research this issue, rather than attempting to respond immediately with what you already know, please.
