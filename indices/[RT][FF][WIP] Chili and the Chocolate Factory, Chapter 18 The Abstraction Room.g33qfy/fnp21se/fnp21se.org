  "Children! No need for pretending anymore, we know what this is! I am going to leave you for an amount of time, you can choose for how long. When one of you has had enough, click your heels together three times, and you will have a chocolate stroke. The other child will win. Goodbye."

That moment when the guy who spent an afternoon pretending he wasn't trying murder you goes "Screw this, this is too much effort. I'll just shoot you instead." Reminds me of the end of /The Cabin in the Woods/, actually.
