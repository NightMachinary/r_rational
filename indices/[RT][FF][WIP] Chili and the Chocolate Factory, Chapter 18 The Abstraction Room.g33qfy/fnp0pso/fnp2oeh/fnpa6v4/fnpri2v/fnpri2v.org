Mahuika does have a years-long headstart on /her/ power, but the requirement to focus only one thing prevents the ability to develop more than one psyker power. So if Tide is lucky enough, then she might have a favorable match up with mind reading against Mahuika's power.

I also hope that by specializing into /only/ Mahuika rather than the more vague and general subject of vaping, Tide's power will be more powerful due to being a more narrow domain.
