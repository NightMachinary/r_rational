Considering how getting high on drugs can lead to out-of-body experiences where one views reality as false, a single world out of billions, viewing higher dimensions, or similar surreal experiences, I conclude that Mahuika gained the ability to be aware of being a character in a story.

She then capitalized on being a seemingly one-dimensional character to preserve the mystery surrounding her so that she would survive until the very end. After all, no character can die until they get a turn as the 'protagonist'. I'm basing that bit on Cleo in chapter 5 who died after we saw her spend time thinking and making wishes.
