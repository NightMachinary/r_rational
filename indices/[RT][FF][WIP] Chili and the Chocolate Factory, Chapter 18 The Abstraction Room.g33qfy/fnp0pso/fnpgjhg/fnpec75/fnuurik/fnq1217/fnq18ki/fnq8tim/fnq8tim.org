  The Abstraction Room was as barren as the Potato Room, with a one potato margin of error.

The potato room had 1 potato and nothing else. A "one potato margin of error" means there might be one more potato, or one less potato, than the estimate.

This seems like a roundabout way of saying "zero potatoes", like so many other things in the story ("I am as far off the ground as something one meter above the ground!")
