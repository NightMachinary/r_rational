This is probably the best fic I've ever read in terms of keeping me on the edge of my seat. I have no idea how its going to end. If all the children are secretly alive, or if even the winner gets killed after inheriting the factory. I can think of so many different endings.

Charlie is only giving up the factory because he wants to escape and do something else, but there must always be a chocolatier in the factory, and you can't end the curse until you pass it on.

All the children are secretly alive, and Charlie is offended that anyone thought otherwise. Or he reveals that everything horrible was a lie, this was all some fucked up test of character to see how they would handle a clearly evil demi-god.

Lee survived, and is gathering the other contestants plus the down room slaves for a revolution.

Tide unlocks psychic powers and banishes Mahuika to the shadow realm. Mahuika reveals that she has had psychic powers all along, and banishes Tide to the shadow realm.

Tide reads Mahuika's mind, realizes that she could never destroy her for moral reasons, and surrenders.

Tide realizes that psychic powers aren't real, she just went insane after a year with only Mahuika and two potatoes for company.

The story just ends right here, chapter 19 is never published.

I would care about each of these endings in a different way. I'm looking forward to seeing what the ending actually is.
