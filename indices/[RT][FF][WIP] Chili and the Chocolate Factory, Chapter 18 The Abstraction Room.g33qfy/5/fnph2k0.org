  "My mom likes literature. My dad likes science. When I was little, I loved the ocean, and I still do. But they always... they always tried to make it about what they liked. My mom wanted me to appreciate it from a literary perspective! My dad wanted me to appreciate it from a scientific perspective! I didn't care! I liked it both ways, but they didn't listen to me when I said it. They didn't fight about it, but they were always trying to make it about something bigger. I didn't want it to be bigger! It's the ocean! What's bigger than that?"

I'm happy you're here, writing this story for this subreddit. It doesn't have to be any bigger than what it is. The science parts and the literary majesty were really cool. But it's enough.

  "I have no idea what I'm doing," said Tide. "JUROR is right about how he does it. I hate dealing with endings."

  She smiled. "But I liked the attention. Mr. Bucket does too. I don't think he believes what he says. He might believe that he believes that, but he doesn't. He just wants to speak. The content doesn't matter."

  "I vape," said Mahuika.

  "We're the worst ones," said Tide. "Having nothing to say, and saying it."

The Omelas reference, man. And the fact the last child to be eliminated always seems to be in this room. Also, Bucket is probably lying about the stroke. This room clearly vinegarizes people and things.

(Vinegar is an essential component of pickle brine, too. Hmmm.)
