The obsession with "numbers go up" is probably because /the first half of the story was mostly about numbers/. Half of the chapters was Rain doing math, with the other half being the consequences of him doing math and figuring out what math he should do next. It makes sense that a disproportionate amount of amount of the audience cares about the thing that was given a disproportionate amount of attention in the narrative.

To flip it to another genre to try to explain it if you don't get it, imagine if you were reading a book and the first several hundred thousand words focused almost exclusively on romance. Then, after a while, the author decides to entirely abandon romance and barely ever mention it again. The new direction the story is going might not necessarily be bad, but the existing audience will have a large portion of people there for the romance so you're inevitably going to upset them by abandoning it.
