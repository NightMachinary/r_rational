Are you asking if it's worth reading?

It moves the plot forward. It builds the relationship between Rain and Ameliah, establishes better how Rain /feels/ about his soul damage, and shows us a new character who will presumably important to the coming conflict with Crimson Gar (Hegar).

No numbers go up. I don't really understand people's obsession with them though, since the numbers aren't the point of the story. Rain is continuously making forward progress, even if it isn't reflected by his level.
