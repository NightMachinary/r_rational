I do like math and would probably love being in Delve-world. Don't care to follow someone else's train of thought when doing math, though. That's just tedious and basic algebra is not super interesting, if it doesn't give YOU superpowers.

So yeah, I skim and skip, till plot and/or dialogue happens.
