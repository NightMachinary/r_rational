it is where is heading. The soul stuff is not only confusing and tedious to read but also a clear plot device for many of Rain "accomplishment". He would have fail to interact with the magistral artifact if it wasnt for his broken soul. he wouldnt have made such an impact with the dulls without his "aura of fear" and so the company would not kick started.

To me, the author could not find a way to use his system to acomplish this things so he added soul stuff.

Spoiler

half of ch 134 is about dozer getting in rain´s soul. All of ch 137 is about soul stuff and Rain coming to the realization that dozer is in his soul. The author consider his readers idiots, in need for a doble explanation of what happened. For fuck sake the pace is horrendous and now we have multiple POVs of the same shit? what´s the problem with these authors and their long ass explanations of things that where previously shown? why can you left things to be read by context?
