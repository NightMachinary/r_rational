I really hate how so much of each chapter is dedicated to this soul bullshit. Literally nothing ever changes, all that happens is “woah, my soul is hard to concentrate on”, but with 3 pages worth of bullshit. Maybe once every 5 chapters we'll get a slight change of “it was slightly easier to concentrate on this go around”.

I was wondering why every chapter felt so pointless, and you've helped me realize that's because 1/4 of every chapter is spent on soul bullshit. The way you put it, I really do feel insulted by all this now, what with all the padding on the exact same development every chapter.
