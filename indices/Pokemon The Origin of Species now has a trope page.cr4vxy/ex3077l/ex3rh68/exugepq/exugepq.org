To me the psychic investigation thing is a little double-edged. Like I've said before, the psychic phenomena are the most interesting aspect of this story to me, and easily the best I've seen it described in any work of fiction, so I'm really glad to see it getting more focus. However, TBH the whole mind-damaged Red thing is not so interesting to me. All in all I am liking this arc though.
