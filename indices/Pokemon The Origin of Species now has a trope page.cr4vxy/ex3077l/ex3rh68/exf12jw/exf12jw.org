Enough people have wrongly made this assumption about Rei that I'm considering changing her name. I probably should have seen it coming, since Jedi have psychic powers, but I wasn't shy about matching name spellings and descriptions for the others, so it's a little puzzling. I guess it's what I get for using so many references; it's expected that all of them must be.
