I like the psychic investigation stuff. I am also looking forward to seeing Blue again soon. It's a problem of web serials that if you have multiple arcs, some people like one better than the other and they can be left out for a little while. It's valid to lose interest in the parts you don't like, but don't worry, I'm sure the author will resolve the other stuff eventually.\\
Agree about the references being jarring, the Rei/Rey Mary Sue nod with her being good at everything is a little much for me.
