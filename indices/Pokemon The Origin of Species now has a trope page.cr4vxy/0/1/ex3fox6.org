I'd say my own enjoyment of it is pretty roller-coaster-y, personally. Started off solid, then dipped enough (with the psychic Spinarak investigation and the paleontology museum stuff? + random didactics) that I dropped it. On rereading I managed to push through / skim that stuff until the Birdbringer battle, which is where my interest peaked, but these recent chapters have seen it wane again. Think I just find all the talking and pontificating a bit boring, and hope for a return to action soon. Psychics are my favorite Pokemon type, too -- I just want to see an Alakazam tossing a Snorlax around or something.

As for the OP topic -- kudos on the TVTropes page! Fic is goin' places! :D
