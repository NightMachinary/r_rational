Between the Mold Earth and Stonedrill, excavation and breaching traditional fortifications should become a lot easier for the party:

- The party could bypass rooms in dungeons or other challenges by tunnelling around them. Robbing stone buildings would also be easier, although the method would be rather visible and distinctive.
- The party's items could be very valuable in a siege for breaking through castle walls or tunnelling under them. Since it's a low-magic setting, I'd assume countermeasures to these spells are rare.
- If there are spare charges at the end of the day that can be used without exploding the items, I'd probably use them to set up traps or fortifications around the campsite, like pits or walls.

I think there are plenty of threads online for imaginative uses of Unseen Servants. The main ones that spring to mind are setting off traps and reloading weapons like crossbows in combat, and out of combat performing mindless but valuable work like copying books.

I assume the Dagger of Extension returns to normal after a while? This is obviously useful for situations where weapons are limited, a dagger would be a lot easier to sneak past guards. A player might try to argue for getting advantage by surprising their opponent with the extension effect in combat, which might be overpowered for a rogue. I'd also want to be ready to shut down someone asking for extra damage because it extends in the wound. The main consideration here I can think of is what qualifies as a 'hit': if you sneak the dagger in, can you bash objects with it repeatedly to get it up to full length before you enter combat, or does it require live targets? If I want to keep it as a magic weapon, can I drag the tip along the ground so it keeps 'hitting' as I walk?

If the Ring of Slow Metabolism affects all metabolism, there are a few other uses I can think of:

- Win drinking contests by doubling how long it takes alcohol to affect you.
- Hold your breath for twice as long, for underwater exploration.
- This would be very useful for hunting and tracking, and could make for a scary pursuit predation-style enemy, maybe a ranger of some sort?

To avoid the downsides, I'd want to arrange a routine of taking it off before going to bed and lending it to whoever's on watch, and probably having a similar system with meals and the like, to avoid the exhaustion for keeping it on too long.
