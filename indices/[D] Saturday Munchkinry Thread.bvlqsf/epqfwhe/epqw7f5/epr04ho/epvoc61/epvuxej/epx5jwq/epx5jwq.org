I don't have the book on me to check, but I'm fairly certain it specifies non-magical stone. I might just build a combat use into the item though, give a stone enemy a CON save to avoid loads of damage.

The dagger reverts to normal at a rate of one die per round unused. So that would work, but you'd better turn right around and use it on your real target or it'll shrink.
