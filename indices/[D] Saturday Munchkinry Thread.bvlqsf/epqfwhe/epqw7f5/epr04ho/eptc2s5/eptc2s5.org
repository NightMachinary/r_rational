Solid ideas. I absolutely intend for them to use it for creative dungeoneering, and 25ft/day of tunneling + debris clearing doesn't feel gamebreaking to me. Watch out for other things that like to tunnel through stone. Your other two points re: Stonedrill are also creative, but not game-breaking.

Dagger returns to normal at a rate of 1 damage die per round unused, and must be used on a hostile living (or undead/construct) target.

Love those uses of the ring. As for the scary enemy, you mean one who's tracking them and not giving them time to sleep or hunt, so they have to pass the ring around to survive? That's a fucking terrifying and great idea.
