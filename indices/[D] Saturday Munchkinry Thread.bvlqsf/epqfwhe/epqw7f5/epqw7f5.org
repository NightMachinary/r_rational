Dunno exactly what you'd consider a "hidden use", but:

Stone Drill /effectively/ destroys stone, since changing an area of solid stone to an area of [[https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Stone_Drill_(5e_Spell]["fine gravel"]]) involves reducing the amount of stone. Casting it straight down would automatically create a pit at the top as the gravel falls.

Mould Earth says "portion of dirt or stone" within a 5 foot cube, and allows you to instantly relocate "loose earth". If that works on fine gravel, you can instantly clear out your pitfall and make it even deeper, or clear a cylinder of gravel beneath the enemies feet and trap them within, or just clear out the rubble from a normal horizontal Stone Drill tunnel. (You'd probably need to carry around a shovel to reach bedrock in the first place, but it's usually not that deep in most places, and deep pitfalls are a good at area denial or taking enemies out of fights)

Depending on what "natural rock" is defined as, Stone Drill could destroy the gemstones in people's jewelry.

Have the person with Mould Earth carry around coal dust, and use the instant relocation to place the dust particles in a high surface area space filling curve to trigger dust explosions.
