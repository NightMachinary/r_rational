I've posted before about the low-magic D&D campaign I'm running. I'm about to give my party their first real magic haul, and I want to run the items by you fine folks to make sure there are no game-breaking combos or hidden uses.

- Two Wands of Mold Earth, as the cantrip. 3 charges/day, wand explodes if brought below 1 charge.

- One Auger of Stonedrill, an oooold spell I found in a splashbook. Lets you make a 10' diameter tunnel through rock (but not earth, wood or metal) at a rate of 5 feet/round. The rubble still needs to be dealt with. Has 5 rounds of charge/day, explodes if brought below 1.

- One Talisman of Unseen Servant. A paperweight that can be activated to cast Unseen Servant for up to 3 hours a day.

- One Dagger of Extension, which ups its damage die on each hit until it reaches greataxe damage (1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d12). At full extension, after 4 hits, it also becomes a +1 magic weapon.

- One Ring of Slow Metabolism. Halves the metabolic speed of the wearer, doubling time needed between meals and the length of time they can go in extreme temperatures or without sleep before taking levels of exhaustion. Also doubles the amount of time poison or disease takes to do harm. Wearing it for more than three days causes 1 level of exhaustion per day over 3 when it is removed.

Go to town! My players aren't huge munchkins, but I want to make sure there are no crazy interactions here.
