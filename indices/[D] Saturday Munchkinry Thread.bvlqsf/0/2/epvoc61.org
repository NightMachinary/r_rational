Yeah, so the only one of those magic items that has some really strong "out of the box thinking" advantages is the stonedrill.

Although I wouldn't even call the advantages to be "hidden uses" or anything. It is just the straight up intended usecase of the drill.

There are 2 major usecases for "tunneling" spells and abilities. The first usecase, is to just tunnel around any obstacle that gets put in your way.

Magic puzzle in a dungeon that opens the door? Screw that! Tunnel around it, through the wall! Trying to break into a house/castle? Tunnel! And really just any sort of dungeon, if you put something in their way, that isn't clawing there face out, well you just hit the tunnel button and make the obstacle trivial.

The 2nd main usecase for "tunneling" abilities is destruction. A 10 foot diameter, 5 foot deep hole is kind of a big hole. You said that it only works on rock, so I guess thats a bit of a limiting factor here. But any stone-like structure of moderate size, or anything with a stone foundation, could possibly be collapsed using a single use of this item.
