The origin is likely [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXARrMadTKk][the Ballad of Big Yud]]. Nostalgebraist over on tumblr, the ultimate source of the Salby referenced in this chapter, uses "#Big Yud" as his general tag for rationalist stuff, but I'm pretty sure his use derives from that video. I have seen it show up a bunch of places.
