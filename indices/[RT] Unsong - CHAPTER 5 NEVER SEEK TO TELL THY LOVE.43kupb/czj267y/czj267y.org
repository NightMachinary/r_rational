I'm getting worried that I don't have the knowledge base to keep up with this story. Even when I went to church, we never talked about the kabbalah.

Are you expecting that readers will need a specific theological background to get all the jokes in Unsong? And if so, is there an introductory text you can recommend?

Or is the theology of Unsong more of a mish-mash of copyright law and information theory not based in any specific tradition, and we just need a lot of general knowledge to keep up?
