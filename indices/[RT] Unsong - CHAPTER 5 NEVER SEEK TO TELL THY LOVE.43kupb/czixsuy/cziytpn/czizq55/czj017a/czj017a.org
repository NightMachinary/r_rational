I don't think a Christian angle is even required. It was Genesis, part of the Torah, where the serpent did its thing, and even without original sin theology or the serpent being Satan, it was still the first in a long-series of fuckups, and a bad enough fuckup to get cursed by God to not-having-legs.

I'm picturing a particularly boneheaded entrepreneur who has pretty much zero exposure to the Bible looking through the Bible for a Biblical name for their startup and literally stopping on the first page. "Oh, yeah, we're just like the serpent! We bring divine knowledge! Fund me!"
