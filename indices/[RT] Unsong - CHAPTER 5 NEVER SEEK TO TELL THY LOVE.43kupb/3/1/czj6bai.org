She might not actually be aromantic, though. If she had been romantically attracted to people in the past, for instance, but wasn't with Aaron. Or she was homoromantic. Or she wasn't totally sure, and was sticking with asexual until she figured it out. Or she didn't want to confuse him, and figured she could get her meaning across by saying "asexual". Or she didn't like dating people, but knew she could become attracted to people after knowing them for long enough.
