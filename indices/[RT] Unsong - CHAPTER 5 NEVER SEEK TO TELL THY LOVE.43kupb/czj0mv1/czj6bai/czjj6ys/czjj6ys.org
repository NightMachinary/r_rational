Either way the asexual reveal doesn't add anything to the conversation in that case, the only time you would offer it up first is if you wanted to date someone but believed that they value sex and don't want to mislead them into thinking any sex they have with you would be enjoyable for you except through the vicarious pleasure one gets from seeing someone they care about happy.

Used as a romantic refusal though it is largely useless.

Communication is the key and I can't imagine her character would rather be not disingenuous but not as honest as she could be.
