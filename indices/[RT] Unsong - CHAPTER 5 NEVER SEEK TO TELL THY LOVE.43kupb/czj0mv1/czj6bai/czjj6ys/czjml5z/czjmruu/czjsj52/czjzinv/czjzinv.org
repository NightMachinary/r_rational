Ok, I am not denying that in the entirety of existence that someone has used asexual instead of aromantic. I'm saying that this character would know the difference and making the claim that she is some every day person when it is clearly not the case is absurd. Things that people are "more likely to know" do not apply to these characters.

Also the asexuality is completely irrelevant, people don't specify their sex drive on a first date unless you want to date someone but worry they'll ditch you if they learn of a low libido later on, and you'd like to be upfront about it.

Again she didn't mention anything to do with sex for the whole conversation so she obviously should have said aromantic.
