Albert confuses all issues. No one else should have a clear or easy reaction.

The one hole I see is not asking after what he said and for speculation on how he might similarly take action to limit the opposing forces.

Also, the not going over his story in fine detail is off. The officer got off topic and did not get back on, but knew it was important.
