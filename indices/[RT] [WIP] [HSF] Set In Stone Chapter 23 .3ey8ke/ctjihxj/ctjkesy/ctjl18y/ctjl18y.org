The next chapter will start with Riko picking at Allen's arguments, if Allen doesn't immediately fold.

The officers know that Allen has a temper. They also know that Allen will listen to Riko, and if there's any way to push past Albert's influence, Riko will probably find it.

Does that help, since you can't read forward yet? Do you believe I should seed something else in this chapter to clarify these things?

With the story being solely from Allen's viewpoint, I'm limited in how much I can narrate outside of his knowledge, and I don't want him to be too intelligent and calculating, even if I am trying to show that he is getting better at it.
