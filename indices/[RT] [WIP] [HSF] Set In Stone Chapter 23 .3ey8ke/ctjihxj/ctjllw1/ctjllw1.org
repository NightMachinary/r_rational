It seems crystal clear to me:

What Allen knows:

- Allen figured out you can guns without metal.
- Albert bribed Allen not to tell how to make guns without metal
- Albert will put humanity through a pre-literature stone age if guns are re-invented.
- Allen knows the best thing to do for him country and himself is not disclose how to make guns.

What the army Knows:

- Allen is a useful violence consultant for people constitutionally ill disposed for it.
- Allen doesn't want to be a violence consultant
- Allen claims Albert said he can't be a violence consultant
- If Allen isn't lying then there is something he thought up that could be /significantly/ violent and therefore useful in the war. => The army knows they should try to get Allen to tell him what he came up with.

This is because the army doesn't know Allen talking would be much much worse than their own nation being wiped out.
