The problem with these books is the author doesn't want to kill his cash cow. He teases all these nifty things -- magic based computers and AI, magic based fusion bombs, etc, but they never come to much, because if they did that would end the series as formulated and he couldn't write more of the books.

The meat of the plot in each book seems to get slimmer and slimmer, with more and more dull phoned in filler, like even the author is getting bored with stretching it out. He should have brought the series to a bang up conclusion long ago.

Great books are made when the author creates a setting he loves, then takes a hammer and multiple atom bombs to it so we can appreciate the beauty and the horror as it shatters and dies and changes into something new. That's what Vernor Vinge does. When the author goes all Gilligan's Island/Lost like Christopher Nutall has with this series, and refuses to break or change his creation, then the interesting parts whither away to dry filler leavened with a little spark of teasing at the climax of each book, as time and book after book go by.

And the writing quality goes down because the author gets bored, too.
