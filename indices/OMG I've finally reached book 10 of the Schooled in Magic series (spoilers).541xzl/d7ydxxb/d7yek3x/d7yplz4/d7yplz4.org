No. The quality is consistently superb. The series is a masterpiece and you only read the crappy version on space battles as you would know if you actually read the OP. I wish you would all stop bashing the story when you haven't even read the real thing but only what was undoubtedly a crappy rough draft that really shouldn't have been posted online.
