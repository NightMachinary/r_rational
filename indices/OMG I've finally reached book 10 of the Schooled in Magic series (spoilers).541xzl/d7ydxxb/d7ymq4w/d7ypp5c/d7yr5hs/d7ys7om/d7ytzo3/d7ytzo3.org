  Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do )(or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.
#+end_quote

I've felt a few times that there's a few events that happens because the plot requires it... I read them in May and it'd take time to recall specific examples though.

  Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
#+end_quote

Shadye who is the antagonist for the first book is not much more defined beside being an evil necromancer. He's not a very interesting villain and the conflict is pretty manichean. The second book's faction has some reasons for trying to take power but it's not much more than the bog standard Coup trope. I'd guess an argument could be made for saying that it's more interesting in Wedding Hells and that in The School of Hard Knocks, the Headmaster from Mountaintop is a more interesting villain...

  The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

Point for this, Emily does solve problems through the intelligent application of her knowledge and resources but only when she is not too emotional which happens often enough (and makes sense since she's a teenage girl) especially when the plot requires it.

  The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.
#+end_quote

Yes, at least the magical system is sane and consistent as far as I remember...

So 2/4 if you make allowances for the fact that as a teenager she's allowed to hold the idiot ball every so often. That's not still not what I'd call rational.

Look, I know you love those books but you're very very defensive about them... You don't have to get into fights because people disagree with you.
