Well, let's agree to disagree, I still stand by my opinion that the writing is not bad but it's not great either and that it's not a great work of rational literature (there's a lot of other work published on this subreddit that I think are much better).

I don't have the time to go back through the books to note down when I thought Emily behaved stupidly for the sake of advancing the plot but that's exactly one of the criticism I had about it. If I read the next books (which I don't really feel like reading them... ), I'll write them down as they come.
