I'm quite sure that no one has ever held the idiot ball in the entire series. An idiot ball is unnatural author-enforced temporary stupidity of a character, usually for the sake of advancing the plot. I'm quite certain that there are literally zero examples of this in the series.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall]]

Most of the characters are driven into conflicts by their beliefs and values, and never solely because the plot requires it. Even the necromancers! Those who become necromancers do so NOT for the evulz, but rather because they underestimate the risks of necromancy and overestimate the rewards, they don't listen when other people warn them of those dangers, and because they foolishly overestimate their own abilities and assume that they won't go mad from it like every other necromancer has.

Remember in HPMOR where Harry mentions the following possibility for how Voldermort became so evil?

>"Too many Dark rituals, maybe? In the beginning he thought he'd do just one, but it sacrificed part of his good side, and that made him less reluctant to perform other Dark rituals, so he did more and more rituals in a positive feedback cycle until he ended up as a tremendously powerful monster -"

That's very similar to how someone becomes a necromancer in the "Schooled in Magic" series. Except that the change happens a lot faster.

As for why I'm being defensive...I find a really amazing work of rational fiction and post it to the sub, then a bunch of people start misrepresenting it and not even bothering to criticize it for its real shortcomings, instead choosing to strawman it and make up shortcomings it doesn't have! You're actively discouraging other people on this sub from reading it for reasons that aren't even true! This is one of my favorite novel series ever, I like it almost as much as I like HPMOR, and you guys call it things like "a guilty pleasure" and "consistently poor writing" rather than acknowledging it as the great work of rational literature that it is! Why wouldn't I be a little ticked off?
