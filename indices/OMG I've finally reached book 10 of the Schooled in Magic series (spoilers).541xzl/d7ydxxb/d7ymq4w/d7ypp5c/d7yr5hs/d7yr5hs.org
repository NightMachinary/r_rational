Sorry but I've read the paid version of the first 7 books... I'm not talking about the spacebattles version which I've never read...

I know you really like those books (I read the previous books following a post you made on this subreddit) but no, there's no way I'd call them rational or even great books. They are a fun guilty pleasure kind of read though.
