You've got to be kidding me. The author did obviously take a setting he loves and take a metaphorical hammer and metaphorical atom bombs to smash into it just like what you're talking about! There are legitimate reasons that Emily didn't share the secret of magic atom bombs and didn't try to leverage that secret. Because it's REALLY REALLY DANGEROUS. The interesting content, the meat of the story actually does NOT slow down from book to book. I have no idea where you're getting the impression that the author is bored from. As for the idea that the series should have ended a long time ago, I don't know where you got that idea either. Keep in mind that Emily is transported to the Nameless World as a fairly intelligent but immature teenager with no credentials in science or engineering nor any rationality training. The mistakes she makes are totally believable for her and DON'T happen because of an idiot ball or because the plot requires it. Again, have you actually read the paid version of the series, and if you did how much were you actually paying attention to it and how much were you just skimming?

Also the writing quality does not go down. It stays very good throughout the series. Are we really talking about he same book series?
