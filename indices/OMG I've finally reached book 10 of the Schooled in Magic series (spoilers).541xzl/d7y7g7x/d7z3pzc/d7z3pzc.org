Basically anything is possible if you can figure out how to do it and provide sufficient power. It is a neat one to day dream about but it doesn't give the reader much details. The environment provides some power, some places provide lots of power, each person has a varying amount of power.

In setting they learn a bunch of different methods and symbols to create spells, potions, and other stuff. Different materials provide different magical effects, potions, and so on.

It feels like in setting its very logical and knowledge based but to the reader it isn't because all of those details are glossed over. I like it because of its knowledge background but comes off too much as what ever is needed for the story will happen because the reader does not have any details to work with.
