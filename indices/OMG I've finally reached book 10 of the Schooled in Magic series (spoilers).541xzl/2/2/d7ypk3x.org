I'm guessing you read the free version on spacebattles right? I'm talking about the paid version which is MUCH better. The story is intelligent rational and very well written even in the first book. I encourage you to get the paid version of the first book and to stay away from the crappy version on spacebattles which I suspect is a very early draft.
