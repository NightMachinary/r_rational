The realm was shaped by a lot of things. The person who abdicated had a lot of significance, and Saint's gung-ho swordswomanship also affected how the realm will manifest.

I'm pretty sure that donning the crown and immediately sacrificing yourself will also affect how the realm will look once the dust settles. Wasn't there an epigraph about how "blood is more potent when willingly spilt," too?
