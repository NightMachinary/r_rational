I'm not sure sufficient explanation was given as to why Roland was not crowned? The Grey Pilgrim, even should his death not cause the ending of Cat's hopes' at alliance, will surely make such an alliance against the Dead King more difficult. He is also one of the premier Named on Above's side and would be incredibly useful in the conflict with the Dead King. Cat mentions all of this and the plot unfolds in such a way that he never counters these points. Roland holds none of those attributes, was a willing "sacrifice" and even had a shot at resurrection.
