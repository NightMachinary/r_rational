Does the fact that Cat didn't get the crown mean the story wasn't at her back and she would have died? Think about it, Sve Noc and Mercy are duking it out to help their champion, Cat loses track of the crown for a few seconds and that's enough for RS to swap out the crown for a glamour, glamour the actual crown and then pass it to Pilgrim? That seems unlikely if you're fighting against a story as well.
