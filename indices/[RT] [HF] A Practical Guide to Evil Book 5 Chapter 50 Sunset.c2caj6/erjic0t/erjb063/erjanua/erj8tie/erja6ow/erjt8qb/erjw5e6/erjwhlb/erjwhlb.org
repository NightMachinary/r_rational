In regards to resurrection, it was not a sure thing but it was a possibility. The Grey Pilgrims death, in comparison, is final.

As regards to shaping the realm, Cat was willing to put the crown on /Tyrant/, so I think Roland would have sufficed. I'm sure that the realm will be better shaped due to Pilgrim's passing but i don't think, given what we know, that that compares to the downsides of losing him.
