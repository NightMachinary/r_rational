Hah called it. was really not expecting the whole fighting over who gets to make the sacrificial play, but probably should have seen that coming too. Man while a geass would come close without a fantasy-England(?) counterpart i guess there's not really good one word comparison for what's been done to the Tyrant. I guess like a forced oath is close.

So does that ending lead to the God(?) being created or was the implication earlier that simply putting on the crown was the part that was more or less apotheosis and now they have the opportunity to take over the realm? Or is this the beginning of the metaphorical boss fight?
