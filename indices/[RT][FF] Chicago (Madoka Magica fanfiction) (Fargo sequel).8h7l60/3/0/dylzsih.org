Stand-alone from /Chicago/, or stand-alone from /PMMM/?

If former, then definitely yes. /Fargo/ ends conclusively, with no major plot arcs left unresolved, and only one plot arc of moderate importance (on which /Chicago/ seems to be based) left.

If latter... Well, it's a 336k-words-long story. I don't think knowledge of source material is really necessary in this situation. Every unfamiliar term could be understood from context, every unknown plot threat could be inferred in time, if you have enough general knowledge of the tropes. Tentative "yes". (First interpretation of your question is probably the correct one, though, so nevermind.)
