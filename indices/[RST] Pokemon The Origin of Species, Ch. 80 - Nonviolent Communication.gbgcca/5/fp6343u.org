Extremely disappointed they won't be finding a switch behind a poster, instead relying on a legendary team-up to open up the basement Rocket base for them - that's overkill guys! Its one poster, how hard could it be?

Also Blue/Red talking, woo! I expect that things won't actually be as easy as Blue hopes, in that they can resume friendship without digging into it - I still think Blue only even partially understands what went down even now (imo, how bad of a friend he was at that time, a partly-different topic he has yet to apologize for). But I guess it might not matter, as their stances on what to sacrifice in a dangerous situation are about to be dramatically tested; nothing better than life-or-death situation to put things into practice.
