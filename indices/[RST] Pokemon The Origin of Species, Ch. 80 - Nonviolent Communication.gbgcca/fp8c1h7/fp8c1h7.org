Guess we'll be seeing more of the inner workings of Team Rocket. Very interested to know more about them broadly, especially the less-sinister sides of them. Come to think of it I don't think we've seen a picture of what a low-level member's work would look like.

Nice to see the team back together. Hoping for some Red/Blue alone time. I found Blue's perspective fascinating and they really need to hash this out.
