I've just recently become obsessed with the 2004 cult classic 'Evil Genius', where you build a lair full of mooks and henchmen, so I'm obviously an expert at this subject;

1. So first off, your general purpose raw man power to buy furniture, dynamite caves out and set up rooms, pick up the briefcases full of money, set up cameras and traps... the odds and ends.

2. You get your hospitality industry; the friendly front behind which you operate your shady business. The restaurant, hotel, resort, whatever. They'll also be at shell corporations making your business look good and profitable and stable and not at all money laundering.

3. Then of course the guards are trained in fighting, and can do gigs as terrorists, mercenaries, guns for hire, security, kidnappings, whatever.

4. The iconic researchers and technicians will run your computer systems monitoring the global situation (where can we deploy soldiers too? Who needs a fake charity to boost our image?), as well as to research new and interesting things (You know, a camera with a laser on it is basically a motion sensor, right? And this furnace we're shoveling coal into, well it's in the basement, and we could just open the floor up to it. We'll just tell everyone that works here not to step right HERE, and when the bad guys break in, they fall into the flames!)

Obviously all of these mooks could level up from basic grunts to karate masters or sharpshooters, from lab techs to quantum physicists, etc.

Don't forget, the only way to turn a henchman into anything other than a henchman is to have him kidnap a maid or plumber or something and strap them into a chair and interrogate them. Usually with Michael Jackson moves, sometimes cymbals.
