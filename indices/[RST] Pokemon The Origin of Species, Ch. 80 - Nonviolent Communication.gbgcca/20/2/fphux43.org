Leaf says the first earthquakes are off the east coast of Hoenn, while the seafloor cavern in the games is south of Hoenn. I guess you indended it to follow the games, and just forgot the Hoenn map is rotated 90 degrees from Kyushu IRL. That or the quakes are just very widespread, or you intended for the first one to be near Mt Chimney rather than Sootopolis. It's hard to tell what was intended here.
