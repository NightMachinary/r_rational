The world is extremely well-built, as are the characters. Some scenes are so visceral that every thunderstorm, I find myself thinking of a line from the chapter with Zapdos.

At times the characters' thoughts could stand to be a little more "show, don't tell," but this is intended as a "rationalist" story, so that's a stylistic choice. I really dislike the "therapy" chapters (basically entirely told, not shown), but they're few and far between. There's also a fair bit of woo-woo psychology, some of it taken seriously.

I've been reading this story every month for more than five years, so let that inform how you take my critique.

I think you've read so little that you've only seen the story's weaknesses. You should give it another shot, reading at least a few more chapters; once the cliffhangers start, I expect you'll be hooked.

Also, I vaguely remember that the first few chapters were being rewritten. They might be better now; I haven't reread them.
