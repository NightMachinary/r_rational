IRL, Kyushu /is/ oriented that way, but during game development, the island was rotated 90 degrees to improve playability. And based on (admittedly obscure) game dialogue, that design choice included making the top of the Hoenn map oriented north within the Pokemon world. According to Bulbapedia, in Pokemon Emerald, if you call May with Match Call after connecting the two halves of Rusturf Tunnel, her dialogue is:

/"<player>, how are you? I'm out on Route 111 now. I'm going to get a rest at an old lady's house. She lives just north of the desert."/

So, as much as the Pokemon game environments are based on real world geography, some creative license on Game Freak's part should still be accounted for.
