  In this case, it's up to our writer to decide the orientation of Hoenn, along with everything else.

Absolutely true. But I believe it's evident that Daystareld also interprets the Hoenn map to be oriented top = north. /If/ top = east, then the east coast of Hoenn would be the Fortree / Fallabor coast. But in the source material, the games, that specific coastline and the offshore ocean never features in the story, and is never explored (other than Soaring over it in Alpha/Omega). In contrast, if top = north, then the east coast of Hoenn is the Lillycove-Mossdeep-Sootopolis region, which lines up with the game lore of the Seafloor Cavern being ground-zero for a super-ancient Legendary Pokemon in all Hoenn games.

/If/ Daystareld adapts Pokemon Emerald's version of the story, then only Kyogre is in the Seafloor Carvern while Groudon is inside Mt. Chimney. But even if top = east, then it would make more sense for the epicenter of the first earthquake to be described as closer to central Hoenn rather than off of the Fortree / Fallabor coast =)
