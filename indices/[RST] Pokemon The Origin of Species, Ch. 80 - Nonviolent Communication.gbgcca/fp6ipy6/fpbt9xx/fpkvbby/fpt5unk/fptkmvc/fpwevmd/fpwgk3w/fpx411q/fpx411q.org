There are the in-game maps as well as at least two released as promontional materials, none of which feature a traditional "north arrow". However, there is (obscure) game dialogue in Pokemon Emerald* which confirms that the in-game Hoenn map is oriented with north at the top.

*This dialogue occurs when the player calls May after clearing the Rusturf Tunnel of boulders, where she says she's going to rest at the Old Lady's House, north of the desert.
