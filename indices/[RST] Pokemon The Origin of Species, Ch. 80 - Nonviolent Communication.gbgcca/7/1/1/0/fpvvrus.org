Pokémon Adventures / Pokémon Special. Ruby and Sapphire's. second plan, after stopping the awakening fails, is to use a machine powered by a meteor - the same deal used earlier to turn off mount chimney by team aqua. The Regis are Steven Stone's plan; he'd been spending the story thus far tracking them down and getting the instructions to awake them. He deploys the three of them in sootopolis to attempt to limit the spread of the damage, but while they stop the energy and weather from spreading, it's an imperfect solution.
