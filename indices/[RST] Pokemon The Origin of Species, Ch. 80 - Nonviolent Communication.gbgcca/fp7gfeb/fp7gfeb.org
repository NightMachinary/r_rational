Just finished catching up, assorted reactions:

1) they just developed this tulpa mind technology, and we know that the way it works, one mind can be affected by a mental effect while the other one is free to act(see: red's merger with egg pokemon). We also know that red's second mind feels like something that encompasses the first, like a bubble within a bubble, to both red and other psychics(see: red's examination by the psych doctor). Further, Pressure is very likely a mental(or well, emotional) effect, mostly because I don't think there is anything else that they wouldn't have thought of guarding against by now(e.g. weird sound beyond the range of human hearing would show up on recording devices, and would be possible to fend off against with good sound insulation)

my hypothesis thus is: can you guard against Pressure with a tulpa by just dumping the entire mental effect into one mind and subsequently ignoring it

A thing you'd need to test before testing this if you can kill a tulpa, since you probably don't want a pressured insane mind inside your noggin.

2) Blue can get dabbed on with his non-risk-management ethics. Here is me, dabbing on him: \o\

3) I strongly suspect red could have made the whole storm night much safer by spending some % of that 150k bank he has on purchasing pre-trained pokemon. Given how shitty their world is, having more stuff to put between yourself and whatever is trying to kill you really seems pretty essential. A basic flier, some easy to catch pokemons with status effect attacks, something like a Tauros for the sheer bulk - surely all of those should be cheap due to supply being very significant. I can't really buy that glorified cattle would be expensive to raise in a world where you can make them follow all orders unconditionally by just putting them on a shelf in a pokeball for a week.

A shock suit would have helped greatly too, and he was thinking of buying one all the way back in chapter 7. That whole Magnemite fight had a lot of close calls, and being immune to electricity would sure have helped.

All this to say: what are the chances that at least one of the common-sense purchases red could have made in order to prepare for /general/ threats before that night would have helped with the whole fire hospital fiasco? A pokemon that can prevent the roof from crushing you, some firefighter suit? Hell, just a basic construciton helmet, thing fairly useful for keeping yourself alive when things fall on your head?

I do not think assigning lower odds to this than 5% is justified, so red has at the minimum directly murdered 5% of Aiko by being insufficiently prepared for threats and not utilizing his monetary advantages.
