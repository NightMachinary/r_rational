My problem with Skyeater (and the Game of Champions world of pokemon in general) was that if you get pokemon that powerful *and* are sapient, the worldbuilding kind of falls apart for human survival at that point.

I don't mean this as a major criticism, I loved GoC. It's actually the only pokemon fanfic I really enjoyed beyond "The Line," which was only a few chapters long. But realistic/rational it is not.

Badass, however... hell yes.
