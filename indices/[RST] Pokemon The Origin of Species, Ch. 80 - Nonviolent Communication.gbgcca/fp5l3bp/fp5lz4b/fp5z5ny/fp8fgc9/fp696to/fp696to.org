I could feel the tension building the whole chapter. Earthquakes, strange weather, the gang in one spot again and gathering at the casino, a team rocket hideout in the games. If the translation from game lore to OOS lore is what I think it is, that means there will be encounters with renegades. Exciting.

But now I really want to know what happens next. Curse you and your month-long cliffhangers!
