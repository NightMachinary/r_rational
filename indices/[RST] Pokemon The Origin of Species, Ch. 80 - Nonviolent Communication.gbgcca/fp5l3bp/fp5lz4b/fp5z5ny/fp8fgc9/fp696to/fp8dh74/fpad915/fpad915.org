That kind of still matches the games. You don't find out they're team rocket until the battle starts, except if you're infiltrating their hq or some operation. It just looks like some random hiker in Mt Moon and then the battle starts and they have an R. If you take their overworld sprite as what they're actually wearing and the battle sprite as a metaphor for who they really are it fits.
