Pokemon that are better at battling than the average trainer can capture and train themselves within a couple months are *very* expensive in this world, since, as you say, supply and demand. Tauros are not just good at battling, however, they're actually super rare, hence the Safari Zone nature preserve.

For trainers to buy their own powerful pokemon, they have to believe they will need it NOW rather than just collecting powerful pokemon for later. If you've ever played a video game and not purchased some good gear from a vendor because you might find gear just as good or better on your own soon, I'm picturing the same mentality.

All that said, yes, underutilizing their money to gain advantages in survivability is a mistake that they made. Red in particular has his money bookmarked for other things that might help in his research, but as the end of this chapter showed a hint of, they have all definitely updated on that mistake.
