Loved the chapter! I'm glad to see the team back together again, if tentatively to start with, what with them not having addressed the split itself. But it seems that may be forced to the forefront soon, or maybe even put on the back-burner while they escape (explore?) the underground rocket base.

Also tentative is my rising hope for Red and Leaf! We may have nudged in the right direction in this chapter, though it's still a bit shaky.

I must admit, the first quake I didn't connect to the showers indicating it was the Hoenn pair going at it, but it clicked a bit after. It'll be interesting to see the reaction both there and here, and I have to wonder how Giovanni will try and solve it, since he is closely related to both parties I assume he will.
