If we go by various Pok√©mon canons, you can stop Kyogre and Groudon via:

Rayquaza

Red / Blue Orbs

All three Regis, albeit not permanantly

Certain machines, very temporarily.

So my guess is Mewtwo will have to step in, as most of these as solutions aren't available given the worldbuilding. Rayquaza is a possibility though.
