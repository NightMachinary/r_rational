One of my favorite things about POoS is that the characters feel like real people. This is not as apparent in the first few chapters. POoS also has a very cool take on the danger and society of the Pokemon world. Again, not really captured in the first few chapters.

If you don't like Red talking about scientific theories, that doesn't ever go away. But there are a lot of really great aspects of the book that you don't get until reading more than the first few chapters.
