Daystareld's interpretation of the Pokemon universe is honestly my absolute favorite interpretation. But I can see where in some places there's just a lot of /talking/, as well as exposition about some world stuff. Sometimes I find myself skipping lines, and even though I go back to read them when I catch myself doing it I don't think it would hurt my enjoyment of the action scenes down the line. I would say you should definitely give it another go, especially if you've ever wanted to know what a truly living Pokemon world would be like. Of course I'm also extremely biased, so keep that in mind!
