The Hoenn games (gen 3) take place at the same time as the Kanto games, and in them Team Aqua and Team Magma fight to try and awaken Kyogre and Groudon respectively, in order to try and expand the sea or the land respectively. In the climax, one or both teams succeeds, causing natural disasters (storms for Kyogre, a drought for Groudon, or the two alternating in Emerald where they both are woken up and fight each other) until the player intervenes by either defeating the woken legendary in the cave of origin, or in Emeral, waking Rayquaza so that it can stop the fighting.
