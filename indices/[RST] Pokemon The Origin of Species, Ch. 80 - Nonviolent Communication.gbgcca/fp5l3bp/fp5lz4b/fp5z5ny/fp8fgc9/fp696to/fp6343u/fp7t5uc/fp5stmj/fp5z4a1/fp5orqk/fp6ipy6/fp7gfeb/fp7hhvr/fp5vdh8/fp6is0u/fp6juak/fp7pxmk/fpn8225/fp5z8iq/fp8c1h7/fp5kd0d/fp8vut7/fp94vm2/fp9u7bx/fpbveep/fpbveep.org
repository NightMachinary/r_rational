I bug all my friends with how much I talk about this story. I'm literally such a nerd for this.

Loved the ship complexity; the gang's back and I love it but also gonna be more complex... they all had a huge jump in power and ability, but suddenly their coordination and shared goals are DRASTICALLY different. This could lead to redefining themselves together, or being too different to work together, or any combination of giving up other goals to get back to adventuring or giving up adventuring because OHGODDANGER....

Just when I was thinking the whole rocket casino part was being HPMOR chamber of secrets hand-waved away, it comes crashing through! What a roller coaster.
