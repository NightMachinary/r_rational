To be fair, there's a wide disparity between real world geography and Pokemon world geography.... Or at least, the possibility of such. With the creation of fanfiction, a third world is created, which takes its queues from both. Is Alola in the Pacific, an ocean and a continent between it and Unova? Are Kalos and Galar neighbours? There are plenty unaddressed mysteries. In this case, it's up to our writer to decide the orientation of Hoenn, along with everything else.
