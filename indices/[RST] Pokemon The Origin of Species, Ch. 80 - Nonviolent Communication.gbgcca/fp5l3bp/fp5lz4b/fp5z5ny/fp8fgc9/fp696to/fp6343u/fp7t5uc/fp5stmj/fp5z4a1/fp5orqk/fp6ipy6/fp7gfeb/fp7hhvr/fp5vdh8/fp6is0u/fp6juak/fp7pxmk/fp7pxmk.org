I do have to wonder, are the player characters from the Hoenn games canon to this universe? Like, maybe they're not catching legendaries and stuff like that since this is a pretty realistically grounded series, but I guess what I'm asking is, do they exist and are they actively taking a part in helping stop the situation in Hoenn?
