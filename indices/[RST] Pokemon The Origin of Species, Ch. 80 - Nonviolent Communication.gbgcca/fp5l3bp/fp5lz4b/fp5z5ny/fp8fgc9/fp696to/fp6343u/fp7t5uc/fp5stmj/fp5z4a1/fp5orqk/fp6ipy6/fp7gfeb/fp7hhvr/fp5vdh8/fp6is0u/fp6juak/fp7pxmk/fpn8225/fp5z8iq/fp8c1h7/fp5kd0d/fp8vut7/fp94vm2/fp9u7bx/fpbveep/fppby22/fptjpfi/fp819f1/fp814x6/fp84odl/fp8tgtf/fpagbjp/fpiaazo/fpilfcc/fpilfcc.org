Yeah, that's true; Game of Champions /is/ basically post-apocalyptic, with entire towns capable of being destroyed by Butterfree. It's just that, other than Zapdos (and the other legendaries), none of your pok√©mon are awe-inspiring. Which is perfectly reasonable, since they're supposed to be mundane.
