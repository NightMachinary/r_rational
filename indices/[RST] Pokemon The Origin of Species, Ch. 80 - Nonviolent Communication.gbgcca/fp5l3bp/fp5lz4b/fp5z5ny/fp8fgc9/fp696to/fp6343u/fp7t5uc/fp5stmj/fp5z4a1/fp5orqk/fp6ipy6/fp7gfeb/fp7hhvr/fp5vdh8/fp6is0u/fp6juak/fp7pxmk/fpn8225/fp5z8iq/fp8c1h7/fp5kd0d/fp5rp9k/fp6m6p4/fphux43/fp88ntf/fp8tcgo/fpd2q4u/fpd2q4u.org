Not exactly a typo, but Blues letter to Red is written in italics, and Leafs immediate reaction is a mental word, also in italics. I know that's the existing format, but having them next to each other makes for a clunky read; maybe use something like “Leaf rolled her eyes. /Rambly/?” Or some other way to break up the letter and her first thought.
