As much as I'm in love with the subtle "eff you" implied by using that tag, "rational adjacent" would accomplish the same goal of ending any "is this truly RT" arguments, and [RT-ADJ] is less than half as many characters and looks more appropriate / consistent with the rest of the subreddit.

Also, the point of a tag is probably to convey information to potential future readers, so it might not the best idea going forward to continue to use an obscure in-joke for the tag just to jab at maybe like three people.

I'm just sayin', y'know? I /do/ think using the tag was funny, it's just that it leaves open the problem of whether to continue using the tag going forward or going back to [RT] which is apparently controversial to some people.
