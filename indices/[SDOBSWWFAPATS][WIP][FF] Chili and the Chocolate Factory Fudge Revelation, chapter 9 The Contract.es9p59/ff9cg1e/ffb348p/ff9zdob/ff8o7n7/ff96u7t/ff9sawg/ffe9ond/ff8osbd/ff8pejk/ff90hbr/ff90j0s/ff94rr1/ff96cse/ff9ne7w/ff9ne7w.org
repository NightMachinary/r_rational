I read it as he has a legal name we don't know, goes by Chili Floss, and has a completely different name that he would very much like to be called but doesn't want to admit it (that probably is very close to C. Lee, because of the misspelling comment).

My guess is his preferred name being something he'd be embarrassed by, but I haven't been able to think of anything that works. Maybe he secretly wants to be so happy that he'd want his name to be Glee?

eta- Wait, JUROR and Keerthi both begin to call him "Ch-". So a name that begins in Ch that is close to C. Lee that isn't Chili? Chilly, and he has a secret desire to go to Antarctica?
