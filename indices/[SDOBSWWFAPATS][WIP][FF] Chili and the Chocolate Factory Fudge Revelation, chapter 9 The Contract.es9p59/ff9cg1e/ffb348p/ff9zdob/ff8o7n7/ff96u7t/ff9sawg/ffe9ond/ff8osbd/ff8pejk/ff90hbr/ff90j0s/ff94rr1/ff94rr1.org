  “That is my real name. I'm Chili Floss,” said Chili Floss.

  “No, it isn't. It isn't your legal name and it isn't even the name my Wonkites detected you wanting to be called. Chili Floss is a silly ridiculous pretend name you made up,” said Mr. Bucket, who was once given a chocolate factory by a man named Willy Wonka.

I think this along with what the BFG said about misspelled Chill Lee means his name displayed as just “Chili” on the website because that's what he wanted to be called.

And it seems like Chili is super defensive about what his real name is so that's why he “legally” changed it rather than reveal it.
