I currently assign ~30% probability Wonka is immortal and has stolen Charlie Bucket's identity to hide that fact (in addition to faking his own death in 2005 and somehow driving the original Bucket to his spectacular suicide.) The very simple reason he has staged another competition is that it's past time for him to take another "heir" and protect the secret of his immortality.

Edit: bumping up to ~70% probability /some/ kind of life extension shenanigans are in play: I just read Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator for the first time in many years and Wonka-Vite exists in-universe: a pill that makes you 20 years younger (stacking.) Wonka claims he doesn't want to "waste" them on himself because they're too valuable (then proceeds to waste 26 of them on shenanigans.)
