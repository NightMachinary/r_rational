I got the point of the tag. It's whimsical and sarcastic so it fits with the tone of the fic. That's not really a "joke" so to speak. My concern was less about practicality and more about precedent.

I don't think I ever said this explicitly, but I think using [RT] for this fic is perfectly fine and shouldn't be controversial. I think that it should not be decided that [RT] is an inappropriate tag for this fic.

However, if it /is/ decided that tagging it [RT] is inappropriate then future postings of it should probably be tagged in a way that future /"idk if this fic is necessarily 100% appropriate to post in this sub but I think lots of people here would get a kick out of it"/ fics can share the same tag for the sake of consistency. "SATIRICAL DECONSTRUCTION OF BELOVED SURREALIST WORK WRITTEN FOR AND PARTIALLY ABOUT THIS SUBREDDIT" is too specific to this fic [EDIT: too specific for other fics to also use the [SDOBSWWFAPATS] tag], and it's probably not desirable to set a precedent for fics of questionable appropriateness to use invented tags specific to themselves.
