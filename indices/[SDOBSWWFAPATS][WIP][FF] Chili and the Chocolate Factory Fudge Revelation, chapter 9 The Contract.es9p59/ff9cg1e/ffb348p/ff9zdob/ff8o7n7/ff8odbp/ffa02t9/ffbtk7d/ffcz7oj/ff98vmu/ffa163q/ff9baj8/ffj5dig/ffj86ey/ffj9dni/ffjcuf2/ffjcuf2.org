  I mean, yeah, maybe, but you're also taking this way too seriously.

While I think it's probably important to discuss the issue of what to do with edge cases, this is still just a casual discussion.

#+begin_quote
  There's always some stories that don't quite fit into tiny little boxes, we don't /need/ a tag for them.

Yes but [RT] and [RST] aren't just "tiny little boxes" though, they're the very reason this sub exists. If a story doesn't fit into the "[[/r/rational]] box" then it doesn't need a tag /at all/ because it shouldn't be posted here in the first place outside of the Monday and Friday threads.

This fic's "questionable appropriateness" is questionable - like, I think posting it isn't inappropriate and I don't think it's an edge case, I think it fits in the [[/r/rational]] box just as well as anything else considering the fact that people really have no idea how the box is shaped. I think it's only a minority who views this fic as outright inappropriate, but it seems (I think - this was days ago and I've moved on) that some people might view it as an edge case, hence the discussion of what to do with edge cases.
