Sorry, but I have no idea. I couldn't make the previous two years, but this time my college finishes a bit earlier than before and the Solstice is happening a bit later, so I can finally see what it's like. Even if it sucks, I still want to be able to support the idea of having a non-religious holiday. People might argue that holidays like Halloween should qualify as a non-religious holiday, but even if that's true, it's more of an occasion to eat candy and play scary jokes instead of any real sense of wonder. Here's hoping for the Solstice.
