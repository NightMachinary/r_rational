Sorry that this is not rational fiction, but holidays can be considered a form of shared fiction and it's a rational holiday to boot!

I'll be attending. Is anyone else going? You don't have to share any personal information beyond that if you're concerned about Internet strangers. I'll just be thinking positive thoughts at you while I'm there. ;)
