I've been finding/experiencing a need for a LOT of ways to apply mindfulness/awareness of behaviors and thought patterns over the last few months. It's been not entirely pleasant but very enlightening.

Things I've been finding personal resolutions/gotten on the course of improvement regarding my life in no particular order.

- Getting a job in my industry, key lesson: if you attempt something enough times success is much more likely.
- Improving my social skills key method: practice talking with people , I started off with coffee shops and then later got a job at a summer camp teaching coding and practiced with kids, I now try to practice with my uber drivers during my commutes, this includes recognizing a desire for amicable silence.
- Better appreciation for recognizing where the real sources of stressors can come from: I had been recognizing a deep frustration/emotional pain with what I see around me in the world. I just got my glasses prescription updated and realized that no it was not entirely emotional pain, I was actually experiencing a subtle form of physical pain from eye strain and this was altering my judgements of just about EVERYTHING on a bad day.
- Been helping my metamour with a LOT of stress and trauma lately and a surprising amount of this is something I recently was going through as well: physiology can be a VERY useful hack to reinforce/help us when we can't manage to think our way through something, hugs, improved nutrition and proper medication can help where philosophizing cannot.
- Jumping from subsistence living on other's charity to being in the lower half of the upper two percent of income brackets for my country is very enlightening: Poverty is an abomination of this universe, I don't know how to describe it any better then that, for anyone who has not been unable to feel certain of anything more then a week in the future because everything seems to come out of nowhere I don't know how to get across how horrific it is in contrast to where I am now.
