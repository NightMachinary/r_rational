Yep. Being in poverty, or even just poor, drains the soul. It's like a constant psychic leech on one's mental energy and emotional health, not to mention the physical health risks. I've noticed that social workers and therapists who work with people in such hopeless situations to try and help them often suffer from a kind of second-hand effect.
