It's election day today for me (Saskatchewan general election), and it's surprised me how little I've actually seen about it without needing to actively seek it out.

I've heard that this one has been really lackluster in terms of the campaign, but I didn't expect it to be /this/ bad. As far as I can tell, it's even being overshadowed by the Presidential Primaries in the US.

UPDATE: I just voted. The polling station was almost completely empty, with about three other voters that I saw. For a bit of scale, there were ~12 lines for people to vote at, and all of them were empty. It may be because I went there at 6:30 PM, but I'm curious what the overall voter turnout will be.

UPDATE 2: Most of the results are in, and it looks like there has been practically no change since the 2011 election. The (right-wing) Saskatchewan Party is expected to be re-elected with 49 seats and 63% of the popular vote (vs. 49 seats and 64% last time), and the (left-wing) NDP will remain the official opposition, with 12 seats and 29% of the popular vote (vs. 9 seats and 32% last time). Three seats were created for this election, and there are still no third parties or independents.
