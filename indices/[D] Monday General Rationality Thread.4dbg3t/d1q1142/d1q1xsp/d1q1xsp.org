For science podcasts I would suggest startalk or the planetary radio podcast. If you want technology podcasts [Relay FM] makes several. Personally I listen to Material which is about google/android but they also make several apple or general tech podcasts, as well as one gaming podcast. My other suggestions are less sciencey/game related, but [[http://www.hellointernet.fm/][Hello Internet]] is a podcast by CGP Grey the youtuber that I absolutely love ( He also co-hosts cortex a podcast about getting things done and apple which is also on on RelayFM and I quite enjoy).
