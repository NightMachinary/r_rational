- Dear Hank and John - A comedy podcast about death. By the people who made vlog Brothers and all the Crash Course videos.
- Total Party Kill - DnD podcast, I also recommend Critical Role, but it's more of a YouTube Channel than a podcast.
- Reconcilable Differences - Another RelayFM podcast, in the two dudes talking format.
- 99% Invisible - About the hidden side of everything
- Hello Internet has already been mentioned, but it bears repeating, I really enjoy it.
