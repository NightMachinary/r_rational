The Adventure Zone is a really good D&D podcast. Sort of a comedy/gaming podcast where three brothers play D&D with their dad. The plot is pretty compelling and their on-air chemistry is great.

I haven't listened to a lot of it, but Oh No! Ross and Carrie is a podcast where two skeptics try various kinds of woo.
