RL warriors in Ancient and Medieval times were either wiry muscled and lithe (skirmishers, standing armies, duelists, assassins), or (if well fed, and specifically kept for combat like mercenaries or gladiators) would be heavily muscular and fat.

The bodybuilder physique did not exist in pre-modern warfare context: it requires and extreme diet and training regimen that makes no sense for a fighter. A medieval-ish fighter would have to either have a lot of stamina and be quick, or have a lot of stamina and be durable (stocky with layers of fat over muscle to protect from blows and glancing cuts).

Remove some muscle from the second left guy, or add a big fat belly on the second right guy, and you have yourself a proper heroic build.

As for pleasing physique: I would say the 3 from the left are nice looking, if a bit over-build.
