Haha hence my inclusion of the world's first bodybuilder in the lineup, b) Eugen Sandow, born 1867! A bit hard to leave humanity behind without ample supplementation of exogenous androgens & other hormones :D

Although I'm not sure I agree with your analysis -- just because something did not exist back when, doesn't mean that today's supraphysiologically dosed super athletes wouldn't wipe the floor with ancient competitors (see steadily creeping world records across the board). At least unarmed -- afaict, most e.g. MMA exhibition matches between champion welterweight fighters & middling heavyweights pretty decisively show the lack of, err, zero-sum DnD mechanics governing real life combat lol. I'm sure medieval warriors with access to modern nutrition, training, and drugs would look quite a bit different if optimizing for combat ability ;]

Regardless, I think the rules differ quite a bit for narrative powered fantasy archetypes, anyhow!
