Curious to hear a less fitness / bodybuilding focused perspective -- of [[https://i.imgur.com/PZVrOSk.jpg][the following lads]], who do you think has the most aesthetically pleasing physique?

(ignoring differences in pose, lighting, & oiliness, and comparing only those included in the set above)

edit, as a follow-up question: circling back to a favorite theme of this subreddit, young-adult fantasy literature -- suppose the Forces of Evil have swept across the land, and you're to hire one of the aforementioned blokes to guarantee your safe passage across the Forbidden Forest, the Chaotic Crags, the Unkempt Undercity, and other Place of Interest, all while carrying an Object of Power well-known to serve as a homing beacon to those who wish you harm. Taking as equal the experiences and equipment of the well-muscled men above (i.e. they're /all/ in boiled leathers marked by hard use and careful maintenance, or /all/ in golden, gleaming full-plate enchanted by the king's finest, etc.), which would you trust the most to succeed in such a venture? Narratively speaking, whose physique connotes the greatest strength and overall competence? (IRL, 'show'-muscles are nearly as functional as they are aesthetic, contrary to media portrayal; Ronnie Coleman in h) and Konstantin Konstantinov in g) weighed about the same off-season and had very similar ~2100lb big-3s, for example)

edit_2, the extra details of the previous edit were maybe not too helpful here. An alternative scenario could be if you were the casting director for some fantasy miniseries, who'd project the best image of valorous heroism when clad in gleaming plate, or grizzled competence in cuir bouilli, etc.
