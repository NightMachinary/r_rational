There's something about the pose and the way the boxer-hang combines with the... line of his hip-bones? I think?

It's not A's muscularity that throws me off specifically.

That said, I tend to hang out with people whose lives are sedentary and whose exercise routines are structured around cardiovascular health and flexibility, not weights. I have a lot of friends who are fit (including a fair number of marathon runners) but none of 'em look like that with their shirts off. (And the ones that do a lot of weights tend to also be pretty chubby; ridiculously strong, yes, but rounded.) So there's a definite weirdness that arises from that.
