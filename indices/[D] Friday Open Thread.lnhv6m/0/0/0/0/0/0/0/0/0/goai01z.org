Yeah, that looks like it might be more in line with the charts, maybe they're only 1 or 2 percent lower than they should be rather than like 3 percent.

Regardless, I'm still around where I knew I was, somewhere between 18 and 23% bodyfat. I've been at the grocery store for the last couple of hours, and no chips came home with me. I've been in a semi-dirty lite-bulk for basically the entirety of the last 6 years (except for 15ish months where I stopped lifting entirely due to impinging or tearing my rotator cuff, and a couple of other several-month pauses due to a health problem... and actually now that I think about it I did pretty much everything incorrectly for the entire first year and I think I was only eating like 1600 calories a day). At this point, I should probably get serious and shift focus away from getting bigger and focus on dropping the bodyfat by at least like 3 to 5%.
