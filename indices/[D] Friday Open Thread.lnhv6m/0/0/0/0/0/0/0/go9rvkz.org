That's surprising. I wonder why they don't use pictures of people who've had their % accurately tested.

Also, your abs are not "reasonably visible," they're just straight up visible. Just about every single one of those charts I've ever seen would use your picture to represent 12%... And you're 15%? ... I'm probably definitely over 20%, then. I might be creeping up on 25%. I /seriously/ have /got/ to stop eating potato chips the way I do.

Great work, btw.
