  I went with 14 rather than 15 because one percent does actually make a difference with how defined your muscles look. One percent can be the difference between seeing the outline of your abs and looking like you don't have abs at all. 13 or 14 percent is pushing it as far as ab visibility is concerned, at that level they'll only be visible in certain lighting.

If we're spitting hairs, it should be noted that charts like [[https://kubexfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/body-fat-percentage-men.jpg][this]] tend to "underestimate" bf% a bit relative to more reliable methods. I've had a DXA scans done a few times and they always peg me at ~15.0%, and I'd say the outline of my abs is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/6rjhyg/physique_phriday/dl5hzlp/][reasonably visible]].
