You changed the question and I'm going to give a similar reply given that the situation is basically the same.

They all look capable, and like they'd fit that role. Preference here will just show other biases, like people preferring the actor that looks like them or a friend, or some random subconscious heuristic.

To get the results you seem to want, what would be needed is to have people that look different. One average, one skinny, one chubby, one chubby strong, one ripped etc. Maybe hide all their faces, or photoshop them to all have the same face. Then the results would show you what musculature level is optimal to get the desired perception.
