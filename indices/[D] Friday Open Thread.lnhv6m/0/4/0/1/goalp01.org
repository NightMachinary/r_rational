In a fantasy setting, I would absolutely go with G, and stay the hell away from D. Body language/ expression make G much more approachable, and he is the only one that looks like he manages to eat well. Older (than the young ones) + more body fat + still obviously competent + not scary. Basically you go for the proven hunter. A and D look like they will kill and eat you for protein, and F and H don't give a shit about you. Edit: the tropes for competent big guys I think of are gentle giant, stalwart bulwark, stern instructor, classic hero played straight.
