Aesthetically pleasing? G, or B. I think the extreme definition you get by cutting body fat over powerful musculature looks uncanny. Fascinating, and very aesthetically distinct, but not exactly pleasing to me.

To the edit, for assessing competence/reading physique for trope-driven competence, that gets very complicated very quickly. As a character in-world, the sort of situation you've posed makes me unlikely to hire anybody. The sorts of people used to accepting pay for prowess seem just as likely to be hired by my enemies, and trust matters a lot more than competence.

If I have some external reason to believe they are sufficiently trustworthy, and all equally so, then I let them decide among themselves who's best suited to help me.

If you just want me to identify, as a reader rather than a character, which body strikes me as most badass/competent... for me personally, bodybuilder's physiques just don't rate that high for me. Sure, weightlifting can demonstrate functional strength of a kind, but still doesn't really translate well to what I imagine the ultimate warrior's physique should look like, or what kinds of function I equate with functional strength. Still probably go with G, here, just because I'm inclined to have more faith in somebody who hasn't spent a lot of time cutting body fat.
