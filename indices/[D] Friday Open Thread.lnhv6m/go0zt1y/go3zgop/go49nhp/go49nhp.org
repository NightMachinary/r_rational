I was actually far more interested in the men's perspective, and otherwise aesthetics as independent from sexual attraction (in the same way that one might find an artwork or mountain ranges or panthers beautiful). The whole â€˜heterosexual women signaling / counter-signaling disinterest in muscularity' discussion is boring and overdone, not to mention somewhat well-studied, at least in western audiences (e.g. [[https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2017.1819][1]], [[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1474704919852918][2]], from a quick google).
