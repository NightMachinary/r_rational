Optimally you'd be asking women if that's your target audience.. They'd probably say A, C and D.

​

There's a point in attractiveness level where it doesn't matter anymore, once you're a 9-10 then it's just personal preference based on what's most genetically compatible with the observer. Comparing at that point is a bit meaningless, it'll just show the genetic compatibility of the group you're comparing, you'd see different results on england vs italy for instance.

​

To the edit, simply put I'd get the one my SO would be least likely to fuck, and bonus points if they look different from me making it easier for me to avoid raising some other dudes child, specially when DNA tests don't exist. So probably H because he looks taller and scarier. Also height is OP in melee combat, more reach, mass, strength etc.
