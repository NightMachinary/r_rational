You absolutely nailed it, in way better words than I could have. It's not the level of muscle size or fitness; it's that lack of bodyfat and the resulting "pop" of the muscles. In that second link you posted, I think the 15% picture is how /I'd/ like to look, and the 10-12 picture is what I think of as the visible-abs end of the canny valley, if you will.

I unfortunately don't think I can give you a good answer to your hypothetical question, because I can't seem to create an image in my head of how, e.g., H would look at 10% or 15% bodyfat instead of like 4%.
