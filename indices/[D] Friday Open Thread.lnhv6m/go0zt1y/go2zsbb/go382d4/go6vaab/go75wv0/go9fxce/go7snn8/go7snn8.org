Keep in mind many of those photos were taken at bodybuilding competitions. They're not what those guys look like day to day, that's months of somewhat unhealthy optimization to get an optimal appearance to win a contest.

​

OP shouldn't have picked photos from those scenarios, they aren't 'achievable' to anyone, even body builders. Sure you can get there, after months of preparation, for a duration of 1-2 days but that's not how you're gonna look in general.

​

Optimally you stay at 10-15% bodyfat, at 15% you can still see abs, your diet can be crap and takes little effort to maintain.
