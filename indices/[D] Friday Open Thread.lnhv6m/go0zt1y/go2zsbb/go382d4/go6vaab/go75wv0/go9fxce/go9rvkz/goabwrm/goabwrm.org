I think it's just much more recent! I remember seeing those charts in the mid-2000s, and think they emerged from prevailing broscience informed lightly by caliper measurements etc. (which, when I looked into it last, tended to just be based off perhaps not the most reliable or x-population generalizable linear models fit via OLS back in the day... I actually tried to reach out in the mid-2010s to some science-y-er fitness folks to see if any would be willing to collaborate on something a bit more sophisticated but didn't get any bites). DXA was only invented in the late 80s, and only worked its way to the 'fitness enthusiast' crowd as a way to track body composition in the 2000s & 2010s.

Thanks! I will note that I found the strongest possible lighting for those pics too haha. [[https://www.instagram.com/p/BPvwEjOjcrd/][Here's a shot]] in more natural light (but still flexing hard as lol, and also not exactly selected at random from all possible candidates ;])

One way to maybe think of it from the perspective of appearance or athletic performance is that for a given physique, higher bodyfat % is always better because it represents that much more possible 'progress' able to be made (e.g. to look leaner or hit a lower weight class, if those are goals). But it's maybe a bit worse from the perspective of overall health and wellness.
