H? 4%? Nah, look at this guy:

Helmut Strebl. Leanest man in the world, 4% bodyfat. A youtube channel I'm subscribed to, Athlean-X, just put out a video today that mentioned him. I actually now think H is probably 6 or 7% bodyfat, rather than sub 6.

Anyways, H is actually Ronnie Coleman, and I found a picture taken of him during the offseason where he's at like 10 or 12 percent bodyfat:

He looks like the Hulk.
