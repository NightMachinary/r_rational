Hmm. Yeah, actually, now that I think about it all of them except for G appear to have a bodyfat percentage of 10% or lower.

There's a saying: abs are made in the kitchen, not in the gym. You can do as many crunches as you want, but basically abs will be invisible until you get down to about 12% bodyfat.

Pictures for a broader context than op's pictures give:

I concede that an extremely low bodyfat percentage looks pretty unnatural. I don't personally prefer the way it looks. 10 to 12% bodyfat is what I would consider the ultimate ideal for somebody trying to "look like they lift weights" while still looking "normal", and 12 to 14% bodyfat still extraordinarily impressive. I went with 14 rather than 15 because one percent does actually make a difference with how defined your muscles look. One percent can be the difference between seeing the outline of your abs and looking like you don't have abs at all. 13 or 14 percent is /pushing it/ as far as ab visibility is concerned, at that level they'll only be visible in certain lighting.

My own personal goal is to be able to maintain a 12 to 14 percent bodyfat percentage, but I can't seem to force myself to go more than a week without chips and end up eating three or four entire goddamn family-sized/party-sized bags of potato chips every single week for three weeks out of every month. I'm probably at 18 or 19% percent bodyfat, hard to tell just comparing to pictures, but I've got A's level of muscular development so it sits differently on me than it would on someone who doesn't lift. My biceps are actually bigger than his, they just don't look so chiseled/defined because of the fat surrounding them. There's no such thing as "low weight with high reps to get 'cut/ripped/toned' and high reps with low weight to get big", being 'cut/ripped/toned' is exclusively a function of bodyfat percent.

Anyways, I'm not sure if any of what I typed was in service of my point, but maybe your initial comment confused me because I'm looking at it differently, like, I'm looking at the size of the muscles, not how "ripped" they are. Obviously I'd prefer A and B and C to all have at least like one or one-and-a-half percent higher bodyfat. Is that the thing that makes you feel like it looks absurd? Understandable. I'd agree. There's tons of dudes who only weigh like 135lbs but have a sub 10% bodyfat so there's no fat covering what muscles they have so you can see their muscle definition, and they think they're "muscular" but they're not. You mentioned C being the least uncanny valley. Other than G, he's probably got the highest bodyfat percent, probably 10 to 12 percent rather than sub 10 percent.

If you can imagine them all being a bit less "ripped," a bit more fat obscuring the definition of the muscles, would that change your answer? Would the "smaller" ones still be more aesthetically pleasing, or do you think musculature on the level of E or F or H would look good if the muscles were covered with a bit more fat? (And F and H in particular probably have the lowest levels of bodyfat, particularly H, that dude is almost certainly at below 6% bodyfat, like, looking at his quads you can see each of the three top ones (one's underneath the middle one) individually.)
