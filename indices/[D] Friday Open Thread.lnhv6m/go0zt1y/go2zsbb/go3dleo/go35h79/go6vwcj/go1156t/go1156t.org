Aesthetically pleasing (but not necessarily more attractive) are, to me personally, a) and c). But I'm definitely biased against too prominent muscles.

Edit: regarding your edit, I would've picked d), who seems to strike the best balance between showoff-y muscles and looking strong/competent (if that makes sense). g) is also close, but he makes me slightly uncomfortable. To be fair, I find the edit strange---I wouldn't choose a guard based on who has the most aesthetically pleasing physique.
