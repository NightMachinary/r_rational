IDK, I don't know what your qualia is, but my qualia is, apart from a period of my teenagerhood when I was bouncing around sexuality-ly speaking, I have absolutely 0 desire towards any woman (and I'm not a prude or anything, I've had plenty of opportunities, etc) but very strong desire towards men.

Do I believe that there's no way I could ever want to be with a woman under any circumstances? of course not, and I'm open to those sorts of things if they were to come up.

I personally find it really invalidating to my sexuality when people say "everyone is a little bit bisexual". I'm not, and it makes me feel "defective" that I don't want to sleep with women when people say that. I know it's a bit rich as a straight person coming through and saying "I am so discriminated against for my sexuality, pity me!", but this was/is my struggle, as much of a mustard seed as it is compared with others.
