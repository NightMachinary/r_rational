I don't mean like mentally/consciously bi, I mean like genetically. Bonobos are just as genetically related to us as chimps are, and all bonobos are fully bisexual. That might not be relevant to humans, maybe it is, who knows?

I didn't intend to invalidate anyone's sexuality, and I'm sorry if it came across that way. I just believe that the genetics of sexuality don't work that way. And that's not entirely baseless:

I'm pretty sure we all, /strictly biologically speaking/, have some capacity to turn out either way. Maybe. That's all. Maybe I chose a poor way of illustrating that in my initial comment. The comment was getting long, and I had gone off on a long accidental tangent. In your reply to my other comment, you said "i am probably getting a bit too enthusiastic but i love talking about how attractive men are" so I came back up to your first one and intended to mirror your "as a straight woman, this is what I find aesthetically pleasing in men" with my own "as a straight man, this is what I find aesthetically pleasing in men" and then while I was typing I realized "oh, I guess I'm not technically a straight man."

Maybe I should expand on the tangent to try to fix it. Maybe I was born with a genetic capacity for 80/20, or 95/5, or 70/30 (who knows?) and in practice that resulted in an expression of 50/50. Maybe you (and the majority of humans) were born with a genetic capacity for 90/10, or 99/1, or whatever it actually is (who knows?) and for you as an individual that resulted in an expression of 100/0.

I wasn't intending to make a claim about your own mind or anyone else's mind, just trying to express my (admittedly flimsy) understanding of the underlying genetics. I don't believe that people who are straight (or people who are gay) have some sort of subconscious attraction to people of the same sex (or people of the opposite sex). I'm doing some reading, and it turns out that some people believe that sort of thing, and I don't believe that.
