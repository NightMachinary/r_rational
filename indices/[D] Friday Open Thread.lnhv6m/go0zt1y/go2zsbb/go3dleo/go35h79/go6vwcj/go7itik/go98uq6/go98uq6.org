Insofar as I find men attractive (I baselessly believe that everyone is technically bisexual to some degree, and "as aggressively straight as possible" is like 95/5 in favor of the opposite sex and "the gayest of gay" is like 5/95, and most of the people who identify as "bisexual" are probably around 70/30 to 30/70... I think I'm like 65/35 in favor of the opposite sex. Obviously all those numbers are probably wrong, maybe "as straight as possible" and "as gay as possible" are 99/1 and 1/99 instead of 95/5 and 5/95, just trying to build a framework to illustrate the idea of being "just barely bi," like, I can comfortably imagine myself going as far as third base with a guy, but the idea of "going all the way" is, like, the opposite of appealing... Um, actually, maybe being comfortable with the thought of performing oral on a guy might be /way/ more than "just barely bi"... Hmm.)

*/ANYWAYS/*, tangent aside - Insofar as I find men attractive, I think what I find most attractive is a body like A's but with just a couple more pounds of fat and maybe a few fewer pounds of muscle. I think Tom Holland's got a great physique, like, my ultimate goal is to reach his level of fitness (I've gotta give up the potato chips). RDJ's got a pretty fine physique in the first Iron Man, but it seems like in later movies he lost more fat and built more muscle, and that's just not my taste. I definitely have an aesthetic appreciation for physiques all the way up to the level of H, but I don't find extreme and/or lean muscularity attractive.
