Jeff's great, I've been subscribed for like 6 years.

Quote from video description:

  The external obliques insert onto the iliac crest and have a tendinous sheath that blends into this attachment called the aponeurosis. This is the “v'” cut line that you are familiar with in the lower ab region.

So the V itself is a tendinous sheath. That tendinous sheath is technically part of the obliques, so you're technically right, but also I think most people are referring to the external oblique muscles when they use the word "obliques" on its own without any modifiers or qualifiers. When I hear "obliques," I don't think "tendons and fascia." The transverse abdominis is technically part of the obliques too, but I don't think anybody thinks you're talking about the transverse abdominis when you say the word "obliques," y'know?
