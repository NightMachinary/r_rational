as a straight woman (who was once described by a friend as "the most aggressiely straight woman she's ever met"), I... don't really find any of them aesthetically pleasuing.

I tend to like dadbods and skinny wiry men, and if I had to pick it would be a) and g) - a because he has a really defined adonis V which I love, and g beause he seems to have the most body fat.

That said, I'm also a domme, and I would find all except f and h really, really sexy if they were dressed in pink frilly lingere and begging for me to peg them (I am going on a date with a world-class athelete tomorrow and really hoping we get along because we would both like to do this), so it really depends what for.

As far as YA literature/casting the next GOT, I'd probably go for a, b, c, as they look the least "unrealistic", which is great both for men watching (to more easily identify with the character) and for male-attracted people watching (so think that this sexy person is someone they could reasonably kiss).

hope that helps!
