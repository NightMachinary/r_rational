Mister "Sarrat", your english is really good, but I have a small logistic question: you seem to speak English as a mother tongue, but you claim to only use Oliver Faure's knowledge. We can suppose your French is even better. Leaving aside the exclusively reprehensible nature of your species, I'm curious to know how to access (sic) Olivier's memories and experiences so fast. Moreover, I'm curious to know if you conserve memories and experience when you change hosts. I'm not interested in myself (sic), but would it be possible to give Olivier Faure's english skills directly to someone else?

Moreover, can someone, confirm whether "Olivier Faure" really exists? Birthdate, job history, anything. Someone should tell his family (if it isn't too late).
