[META] Alright, I'm going to call it quits.

It was pretty fun, but I think we've explored most of the questions you guys had to ask.

Again, for the record, I'm no philosopher, I'm no neurosurgeon and I'm no yeerk. Everything I said about qualia is mostly my uninformed beliefs + "make it up as I go along". Everything I said about philosophy is mostly me trying to a steelman a nihilist moral relativist henchman, 'cause they usually get the short end of the stick in fiction.

I want to insist, don't take anything I said from a position of authority, and remember this is mostly non-canon. On the other hand, now that it's over, I'd be interested in [[/u/TK17Studios][u/TK17Studios]] 'returns on the whole thing.
