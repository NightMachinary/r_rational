You're right and wrong at the same time. It's not about being a slug. Being a yeerk without host... I think it's pretty close to what humans with total locked-in syndrome feel.

Imagine it as being with 100 people in Plato's metaphorical cave. Every so often, one guy gets to go outside the cave interact with the outside world, maybe bring back (metaphorical) food or (metaphorical) fire. For most of you, your only interactions with the outside world are talking with the people who got out of the cave, and speculating, and preparing instructions for the next guy to go.

Except it's not reliable. You ask the last "scout" a question like "Hey, what color were the trees?", and he answers "I didn't look" or "I don't remember". So you make sure to ask the next guy to look at the trees' color; but other people also have a lot of questions, and the scout only has three (Earth) days to look, and he might forget too, and you can't always predict who will be the next guy to get out of the cave, etc.

Then you get to be the next guy out of the cave. You can see everything. You have hundreds of questions to answer, including your own. You can interact with the world, and you have a /purpose/. Until you need to get back to the pool.

So yeah. Infestation is awesome. For me.
