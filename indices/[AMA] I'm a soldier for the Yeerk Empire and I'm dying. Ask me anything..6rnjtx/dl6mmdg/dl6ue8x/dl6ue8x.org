Has literally any living thing ever just /laid down and died/ because it realized a /moral/ problem with its existence? Has that kind of abstract, disembodied Thou Shalt ever mattered to /anyone/?

Plainly the only way to solve this problem is to take a third option and find some way for the Yeerks to exist as something other than parasites or invaders.

I mean, hell, can you imagine being a sapient individual with emotions, hopes, and dreams... /and you're a fucking slug/? A slug! You can't even move around or anything!
