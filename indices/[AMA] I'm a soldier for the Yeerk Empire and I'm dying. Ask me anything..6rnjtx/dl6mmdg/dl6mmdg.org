Ok, fellow redditors, is this legit? Could anyone have faked that video? Even assuming "Starrat" is an actual alien, this could still be another one of Esplin's publicity stunts, so keep your guard up, as we will likely have no immediate way of verifying whether or not Starrat is lying.

Supposing this is the genuine act of one yeerk, I am perhaps more disturbed than I was before. Starrat talks about his (her, its?) life not like a parasitic drone but like an individual with hopes and dreams. Seriously, alien slugs have "bucket lists?" But if you, Starrat, are truly capable of feeling pleasure and pain, excitement and fear, joy and wonder ... can you yeerks not recognize the horror in your denial of the same to the humans whose bodies you so mercilessly steal for yourselves? Humans do have dreams and bucket lists too, Starrat. I don't know any formerly infested people myself, but I've heard stories, stories of the /horror/, the horror at being trapped in your own mind, unable to move of your own volition, unable to scratch the itch of your own desires, deprived utterly of the freedom even to keep your imagination to yourself. Can /you/ imagine what it's like to be controlled in that way? How can you not see the moral atrocity of your invasion? Wait, of course you see it, you can read the pain directly from the mind of your host, yet somehow you /continue/ occupying his body. The moral thing for you to do is crawl out of his head and die /right now./
