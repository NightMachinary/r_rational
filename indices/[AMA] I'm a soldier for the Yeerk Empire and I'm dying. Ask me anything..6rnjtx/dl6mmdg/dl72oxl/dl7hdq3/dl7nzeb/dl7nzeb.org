That sounds like a cool insult, honestly. "[[http://cinnamonbunzuh.blogspot.fr/2012/01/book-19-departure.html][Your mother infested a monkey!]]". I mean, I could, but a monkey body is a serious downgrade from a human body, and also I would probably die because most monkeys don't sit on caches of maple oatmeal.

I'd argue that it's a practical response, not an ethical one.

But yeah, I hear you. We had a shot at enslaving the entire planet and reaping the benefits (a huge war machine, relative safety from extinction) and we blew it, and now we're in an awkward position.

Rational egoism + benefits of hindsight tells me we'd have been better off if we'd approached the planet openly, and tried to build a yeerk-human society based on consensus and cooperation; but I don't delude myself in thinking there's any higher value in ethics than "rational egoism" mixed with a heavy does of "being afraid of revenge" and capitalism.
