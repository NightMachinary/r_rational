I can't speak for my entire species, but personally speaking, no and maybe.

The topic includes a bunch of information I'm not ready to share, but speaking in broad strokes... Intrinsic values aren't really that important to humans. Values and social standards come from arrangements of convenience, and the standards change to follow the practical interests, not the other way around. They matter even less to yeerks; where human societies change their outlook over the course of decades (eg regarding homosexuality), yeerk societies change over the course of /months/ (hence the Aftran force in Ventura having second thoughts).

If, and it's a big if, diplomatic relationships open, our outlook will matter on a personal and societal level, not on a grand strategy level. I'd argue that outlook doesn't really matter in realpolitik. Most human countries act like impulsive narcissists if we interpret them as coherent entities anyway.

The way it will work is, sooner or later, one of two things will happen:

- Open war will start, until one side is incapable or unwilling to fight any longer (most metropolises will be smoking craters at that point)

- A country or two will start a program for yeerk integration. There aren't many of us, so given a 0.1% "integration" rate, a population of 1'000'000 or more would be enough. We could all fit within Paris/NY/London (assuming we don't blow them up next; again, not speaking for high command, but I do want to point out it's on the table).

Let's assume everything goes well (it won't, the Visser's a jerk). There will be riots demanding we be all killed or sent off planet somehow, political movements and external pressure by other countries to stop the program. Let's assume they all blow over.

As this point, we'd basically have to hand ourselves over for the infestation program to proceed. No-one would accept it otherwise. We'd have so sign treaties, surrender our fleet and our military secrets to whatever country welcomes us, and put ourselves at their mercy.

At this point, integration becomes less about grand strategy and more about personal relationships. This is uncharted territory, because Yeerks have zero experience with consensual relationships so far. Like, imagine you come from a culture where all men/women you date are slaves. That's the socially accepted norm for relationships: a master and a slave. The slave has absolutely no say in how the relationship works, what the master does, whether or when they have sex, when they spend time together, what they talk about, etc. Imagine those relationships are all you know... and then you date a millennial, who thinks relationships should be between equals.

No matter how well-intentioned you are, you're going to make blunders. That's why I'm saying values don't matter that much. Integration will be about yeerks and humans learning the ropes of cohabiting, and eventually they will form habits which will become rules which will become an ethics code, and they'll all agree that people like me were awful and they're very sorry about us (and Ventura).

I guess I could pay more lip service to their future beliefs, help my species' diplomatic relations... fuck that. I was never much for hypocrisy.
