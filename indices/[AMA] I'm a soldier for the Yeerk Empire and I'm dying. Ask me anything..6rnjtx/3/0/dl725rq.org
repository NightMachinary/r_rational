1 - No idea.

2 - The "hard question" sort of answers itself. There is no such thing as qualia, and we're all philosophical zombies. The main reason that your own thinking seems so untractable is that you have a lot of processes under the hood, that operate without you being aware of them.

Like, not just physical processes (processing thousands of little eye-pixels into an image, running your body), but mental processes as well. You thoughts are messages that are sent from one part of the brain to another; each of these messages passes through different parts of your brain that augment or process them in some way, and usually you can't detect those parts (you can just feel the effects when they go wrong).

From where I'm standing, the process is basically

- Information

- Information with noise and details removed

- Information weighted with priors and a few heuristics

- Altered brain state.

The reason it doesn't feel like a physical process, (like, for instance, your vision) is that your "consciousness" only perceives things that have gone through this process, and isn't aware of the intermediate steps on any level (just like your intestines are basically unaware of your stomach).

PM me if you want the longer neurology explanation.
