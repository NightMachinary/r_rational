Aw I didn't mean to be cruel! I don't know anything about neuroscience either :P

I don't think a Yeerk necessarily has to understand brains. Just like you said, we don't 'understand' our own internal processes on an intuitive level--we didn't even know about the circulatory system until the Renaissance. As Gedds didn't exactly have the capacity for advanced medical science, the Yeerks have only had a few years to really dig into brains, hardly enough to come to a comprehensive understanding of how all sentient brains work.
