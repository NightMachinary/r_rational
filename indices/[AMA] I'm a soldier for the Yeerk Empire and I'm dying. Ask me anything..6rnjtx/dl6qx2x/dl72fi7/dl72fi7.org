Brains aren't my food. They're more like my favorite cushions!

Ralph's brand maple oatmeal. It has this subtle flavor of not dying slowly and painfully, I just love it for some reason. (but it actually tastes like crap; never liked oatmeal much)

Croissants. There's something beautiful about a thing that crafted with so much love and effort, just for us to consume. (this was a subtle metaphor!) Seriously, though, viennoiseries are the best.
