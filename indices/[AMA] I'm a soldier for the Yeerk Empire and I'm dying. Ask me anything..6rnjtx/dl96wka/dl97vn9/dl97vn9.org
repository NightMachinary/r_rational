"Olivier Faure" is obviously a pseudonym, and I'm not going to help you contact his family. Anonymity is a matter of survival right now.

Regarding skill transfer: I think that's tactical intelligence, so no comment. Olivier's mother tongue is French, and he does speak English somewhat.

/META:/ Thanks for the compliment, I guess. Most of my internet browsing is on english-speaking websites, so that helps. Of course speaking in real-time is way harder. Oliv*i*er Fau*r*e is my real name, since this is kind of a Self-Insert. In retrospect, it would make way more sense for Sarrat to use a pseudonym, since he's on the run. (also, this is a surprisingly common name; googling it will give you a Parti Socialiste deputy).
