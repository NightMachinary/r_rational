I guess it depends on what "good" you mean. Like, when someone says "wow, this is a really good fruitcake!", it's a valid english sentence, but it's obviously not the same good you're talking about.

Humans have different 'levels' of good too. First you have "What gets me my dessert" then you have "What keeps my parents happy with me", then "What my peers approve", and eventually "What I approve".

Mostly ethical thinking is a process of internalizing social norms and external pressures into your own thinking. It often boils down to "Treat others as you would have them treat you", but it can vary from culture with added caveats and rules.

So our own conception of 'ethics' and good would be pretty similar on some points (though pools are a cultural entity much stronger than most tribes, no comment on that). Killing other is bad, stealing is bad, etc.

Regarding your underlying question "How do you feel about being a monster to your host and the fact that your host thinks you're a monster", I'm mostly okay with that?

It's not like yeerk society was shaped in a multi-cultural environment where we had to learn to cooperate with and respect other cultures. We take what we need and that's about as far as it goes regarding other species.
