Re: the bucket list thing - Not exactly as you imagine it. My... let's call it my purpose, is to learn and amass new experiences. This seemed like the last opportunity I'd have to do so, so I'd make it count. It's not a literal "things I dreamed to do before I died" thing.

Re pleasure and pain: I think you're confused. Feeling pain and feeling empathy aren't the same thing.

For starters, I think you're over-estimating the horror part of the enslavement experience. It's not like our hosts are in constant physical pain. We can control some of our hosts' feelings, both with direct brain "contact" and with a healthy diet, sports, etc. The horror you heard about exist, but it was at it fullest when the humans were in the cages or after they were freed. While we're in their brain, it's more of a muted, quiet existential horror. We can both ignore it most of the time. Right now Olivier knows I'm about to die, so it's mostly awkwardness with some hope and a bit of boredom.

Second, I'm guessing you think of morality as an absolute thing. Like, if you feel pain, you realize that pain is bad and no-one should get to feel it. That's not really how it works. The only reason you're believe that ethics are something that exists is because your species evolved to have strong social mechanisms, which means you have a lot of empathy. So when you see someone suffer, you feel bad, especially if you feel similar to them. Most advanced species have high empathy, btw, that's not really a human thing.

The thing is, most species feel empathy in a different way, and yeerk do too. The most obvious metaphor is "but humans kill cows", but I don't think it works that well, because the social dynamics are completely different. (though I guess the invasion force at Venture could have been called "vegans"; sort of; not really)

The way yeerks see humans is closer to the way humans see their computers or their pets. Except not really, because you have a ton of movies about robots who start demanding rights and dignity and stuff. My point is, we don't see you as people, we see you as resources. I know all about how human psychology relates to dehumanization. I understand about the iterated prisoner's dilemma. And, seeing our recent shortcoming, maybe we'd have been better off if we'd approached you as equals, forced ourselves to respect your agency, and tried to create some sort of voluntary infestation program.

But these things are tactical considerations, not ethical ones. I have nothing to gain and everything to lose by releasing my host right now. So, sorry not sorry.
