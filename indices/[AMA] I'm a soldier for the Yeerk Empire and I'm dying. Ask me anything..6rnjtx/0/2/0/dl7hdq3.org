  I'm guessing you think of morality as an absolute thing.
#+end_quote

It is. It is the set of logical consequences of a certain collection of axioms, including an axiom about empathy. Empathy is what makes morality /morality/, and not just some sort of rational egoism. The mere fact that you evolved to not recognize this, or that I evolved to recognize it, does not motivate me to change my own position. The only moral response to a species which does not recognize morality is hostility.

  So, sorry not sorry.

Look at you, being an apologist for slavery using flippant idioms from your host's own enslaved intelligence.

Fine, you don't want to die? I get it. So go to a zoo and infest a /monkey,/ if you absolutely must have a host. Hell, go to a hospital and pilot the body of a coma patient. I'll wait. Maybe if you yeerks can show that kind of commitment to minimizing enslavement, we can talk about peace. Maybe.
