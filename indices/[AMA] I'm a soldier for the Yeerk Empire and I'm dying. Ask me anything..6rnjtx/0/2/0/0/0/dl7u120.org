Openly admitting that you would totally enslave and exploit us if it were at all practical is /not/ a great way to repair relations with a species that actually does think there is a higher value in ethics (or really any species for that matter). So tell me: if you could modify your biology so that you weren't dependent on another (intelligent) species to accomplish anything, would you do it? Or if you could modify your values so that you actually /do/ value ethics/empathy intrinsically, would you do it, even if only for the purpose of fostering strategic cooperation with humans?
