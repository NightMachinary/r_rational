We have no way of knowing. Alien disinfo, teenager messing around trying to scare people, real alien actually on reddit, some nation-state pulling a false flag, "Animorph" hoaxers sustaining the gag, hyperintelligent AI with aims we can't guess. We don't really have priors or any way of verifying any claims.

All we can do is try to prompt as much information disclosure as possible. See if there's any inconsistencies or if it seems completely made up. Act like we accept it's true, or at least could be, unless we can conclusively disprove it.

We don't know that Oliver Faure (can someone find this guy's social media at least?) can retain any Yeerk info after being unpossessed. Right now Starrat has the information of two minds, one of which might be lost if we encourage him to suicide. Even though it's not ideal, we have to prolong Oliver's slavery to try and get what we can out of Starrat 731.
