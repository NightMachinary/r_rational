No and no.

Re - the color thing: sort of. Imagine colors are letters. What you're thinking is "When Alice sees a G, does Bob see a Y?". The truth is, they both "see" the same "letters", except they see them in a different "handwriting". (except color-blind people, and other exceptions, you get my point)

Re - different qualia: I honestly couldn't describe it to you. The thing is, yeerks don't really "feel" their host's qualia, they perceive the processes underlying it.

If I described a human's processes to you, you wouldn't be able to map much of it to your own subjective experience. For instance, I can spend all day talking about the patterns of anger or happiness, how they work, what stimuli create them, how they propagate to your brain... but it wouldn't make you visualize/feel these emotions the way a good movie would. So me describing a sonar's qualia wouldn't really mean anything to you.

Re - how different are they: a lot. Most species has the same core senses and emotions (sight, hearing, fear, anger, etc), but they all feel them on wildly different scales, and they all have different secondary senses.

Humans have a really good sense of depth, and extremely sharp awareness of their environment. Some have a ridiculously fine sense of smell and taste (and they eat /a lot/). Some are tree-dwellers, and they have amazing balance and proprioception. Some can map heat and air currents around them in three dimensions, and perceive how they evolve and how they're going to go.
