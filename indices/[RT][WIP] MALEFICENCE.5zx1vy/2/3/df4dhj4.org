I'll edit out Arthur announcing he takes Lance seriously.

 

I'll change the wording.

 

Liz's description by Arthur is something I needed to sneak in? It's important characterisation?

 

The players in my story, all embody a certain sin. You'll see some of them in Chapter 3.

 

The sin of gluttony, is subject to change. I'll put some thought into it later.

 

Liz standing there for 8 hours is a plot hole I never noticed. She was watching the duel? I'll go edit that in.

 

 

The reason why I didn't have Arthur say anything mundane, was because I doubt my ability at it. Weiwei is one of the players. If she hears Arthur and Liz talking about something, I can't help but do her thoughts on their conversation. It will have to be of just the right balance, to not raise Weiwei's suspicions. I can't think of such a conversation, but I'm sure Arthur can.
