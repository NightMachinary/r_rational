There are subtler ways you can convey that Liz likes dominating and devastating men. She can get a lot of that across through implication. You could even keep the "want to have sex?" "no, because you'd be the domme and I'm not into that" exchange if you made it more subtle.

As for the Weiwei problem: Your advantage here is that, while Arthur only has seconds to come up with a fake conversation, you have as much time as you need.

You could also, if you choose, have him be /unsuccessful/ at not raising her suspicions, and have that come back to bite him when she makes her play later. But I have no doubt that you can think of an innocuous faux-conversation, given enough time.
