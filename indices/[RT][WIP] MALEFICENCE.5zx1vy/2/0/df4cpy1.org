End of Story, Weiwei becomes Empress.

She'll be pivotal during the fourth World War.

As for the Nihil Superbum, I wasn't merely going for a creed, so much as obsession. The character I based Arthur off, is obsessed with being an absolute existence.

Arthur is obsessed with Nihil Superbum. Read chapter 3, and you'll understand a bit more.

I'll explain I'd you ask after chapter 3.

Nihil Superbum isn't just his creed, it's his maxim, his banner, his flag, his emblem, his signature. Nihil Superbum is the oath he swore on the occasion of the Roxanne incident. Nihil Superbum is a reminder of the sun he carries.

Nihil Superbum is his driving force in life.
