I don't think you can both have Liz be Arthur's gamepiece and have her be beyond the board itself. Readers won't take her seriously as a being beyond Lance's power to defeat if she's initially introduced as just a tool Arthur is using. The only way that might work would be if the full extent of her power were a surprise reveal later in the story.

Can you explain why the hair thing is integral to the plot? You can PM me if you don't want to post spoilers.
