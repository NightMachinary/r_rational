I want to write the prologue as a prequel later on. But definitely not now.

"Verily, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger." was initially "Truly, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger."

MC is commenting on the saying: "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger", and he is agreeing on the veractiy of that statement. He agrees with the saying, and is voicing his agreement.

It's not adverbial fluff.

I see where the dissonance comes from. I'm not trying to strengthen the sentence, but write the MC thinking on and agreeing with a sentence.
