I'll decide the ending then, after I'm more than 50% through. I know some victories the protagonist will have, but I want the greater man to win.

I don't plan on toning erotica down though? I enjoy writing the few chapters that will have them.

As for the Weiwei issue, I'm lost? I admit first of all, that I'm not good at writing female characters. It's a first for me.

Weiwei is someone who has her own agendas, and I aiming to become Empress and get Arthur to fall in love with her. Arthur is a means to an end, and she's willing to do whatever it takes. She's playing to his fantasies, his hopes and desires through sex.

It has nothing to do with nationality. She's only Chinese, because China and Russia will be the other two major countries, with their own players; albeit weaker than Lance and Arthur.

It would have been similar if she's Russian(I'd change a few things, but I have a feeling it will come off as objectifying for Russians. I'll take a look, but I don't really understand/see the problem.

Second of all, I want to write Multiple POV characters. It makes character introspection easier, and allows the reader to connect easier with the characters. MC won't get more than a quarter(on average) or a third at most of screen time. At least as of now.

The other characters are just as important. I'm trying not to get into the habit of he's the MC, and start weaving the story around him. I have the major main characters planned out, so I weave around them.

I stylistically prefer multi first person POVs, even as a reader. I feel it let's me connect with the characters more, experiencing the story through their eyes.

At the very least, the 3 main characters are: Lancelot Arthur Roxanne

There are other players, but the winner(s) will be one of these three. The story revolves around these three. There are other characters as well, that will get POVs, but I'll limit it to only very important characters.
