OK, I read the prologue and the first chapter. Gonna stop there for now and give you my criticisms so far. I put it in a [[http://pastebin.com/z4DG5eRp][pastebin]] because it's long. I apologize for how harsh it is; I chose to be as blunt as possible because you don't strike me as the type to prefer sugarcoating. The overall takeaway is, "Way less telling, way more showing."

I recommend reading Steven King's “On Writing -- A Memoir of the Craft.” It describes a lot of the common beginner-writing pitfalls you're falling into, and how to avoid them. It's not the be-all end-all of how to write well, but it's a succinct and comprehensible starting point, perfect for a beginner.

If there are specific criticisms you agree with, but aren't sure how to incorporate into your story (e.g. "how could I organically introduce this particular detail?"), I'm happy to offer suggestions for you to build off of.

Edit: Just read the author's note for Chapter 2. "I think I'll do a Weiwei chapter when next I'm horny, or maybe I should try Liz?" [/Shudder./] Dude, please don't do this. This takes the story from your metaphorical to your literal masturbation material.

If you want to write a porn, write a porn and post it on a literotica site. If you want to write a /story,/ you need to plan out and write an actual story which may contain sexual elements when they serve the plot, not just spontaneously write in sex scenes when you happen to be horny--not to mention making your audience deeply uncomfortable by announcing the fact. Nobody who's trying to read a story about a complex struggle against a powerful leader for rulership of the world wants to picture the author typing it with one hand.
