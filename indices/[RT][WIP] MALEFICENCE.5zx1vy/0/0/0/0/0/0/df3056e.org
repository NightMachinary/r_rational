I'll take all of your criticisms.

As for the sex scene, it wasn't hamfisted into the story. The story isn't a literotica, but will contain erotica.

The story used sex as characterisation for the main antagonist.

He's a hedonist and someone who likes to dominate. When I pictured his intro, I imagined him surrounded by a bevy of beautiful women.

When I actually wrote it, I took that out, and sought to introduce an actual plot relevant character; as opposed to sex that may not contribute much to the story.

Chapter 2 is a real chapter, nothing plot irrelevant there. I'm not writing porn, just writing that includes porn. If I ever write sex scenes, they would be part of the story; why I said I'll write an X character chapter when that comes up.

I'll remove the Author's note if you felt it really disturbing. I thought it would be funny. I did put utmost seriousness into writing that chapter. I never wrote it as masturbatory material (it may or may not have been utilised for that after the fact, but it wasn't the intention when writing it).

I'll give you full replies on your criticisms, but I am lost on how to edit the prologue though.

I'm stopped writing, so that I can plan out the general lay out of the story. I won't plan out the ending for now, so that I don't force a particular conclusion. My protagonist may not win, and I'm not writing him as someone who will. This isn't shounen.
