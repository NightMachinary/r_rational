There may be erotica chapters, some of Arthur's chapters may be as such, but it will be few and far inbetween. It'll always have story significance from a characterisation point. But I may make mainly erotica interludes that can be skipped without losing much save characterisation.

I'll consider third person, but a switch won't be anytime soon, until I've dealt with other issues. I won't write the next chapter until I've resolved the remaining problems.

There's only really a division between Anastasia and the other two. I don't have their characters separated enough for them to be different personalities. I think I need to work on that.

Anastasia uses "brother" as opposed to "him", doesn't love Arthur(is incapable of love or something of the sort), but keeps Arthur high on her list of priorities. Is the domineering royal one. The one that is super possessive, and greedy and all entitled.

Katelyn/Alice use "him". Hate Arthur. Attracted to Lance, and more like a highschool girl. They have a high school girl kind of personality. They're also quite mentally young, due to being created later and not having Roxanne's episodic memories from before their incident. They are not as cynical as Stacey, and use less formal speech.

Katelyn is a gamer addict.

Alice is a shut in scientist.
