You don't have to tone down the erotica if you don't want to, but you should be aware that the current degree to which it's explicit and detailed will make a lot of potential readers uncomfortable. It's definitely skirting the line of literotica--I've read for-real literotica that had a similar plot-to-sex quotient.

Weiwei being Chinese is fine, I'm just suggesting that you be cautious about how you portray her heritage in connection with her sexuality. Fetishization of Asian women is really common, so it's a sensitive issue that it's best to tread lightly around even if you have no intention of fetishizing.

I think it's great that Weiwei has her own agenda and is ultimately aiming to subvert Arthur. Is that going to be something that's clear from the beginning, or a surprise twist? I've always loved the "apparently passive woman was actually playing this guy the whole time" twist.

Even though multiple first person POVs is your preference, it is going to make things confusing for your readers if you stick to that--/especially/ with one of the characters having multiple personas with different names. Generally when people read stories, they mentally assign the "I" role to one specific person, and then they always know that "I" means, e.g., "Lance." So "I" and "Lance" become equivalent. If "I" can mean several different people depending on what part of the story it is, the reader has to remind themselves of that and it takes them out of the story. If you truly want all three major characters to be on equal footing, it would be best to make all of them third-person instead of all first-person, even if you would normally use first person.

I seriously have to go to bed now, but I'll read Chapter 3 tomorrow.
