Taking out the author's notes about it being fap material will help a lot, yeah. If the sex stuff really does always serve the story, and you don't give in to the temptation to make it gratuitous, it should be all right.

Having said that, the first couple of paragraphs in this chapter about Weiwei...I don't know if you're going to subvert this later or what, but it comes across as exotifying and dehumanizing in a way that's uncomfortable to read. There's a focus on reminding us that Weiwei is Chinese, relating her Chinese origins to her sexual prowess, etc...it might not be intended this way, but it comes across to me as a fetishization of her ancestry. Consider whether you would have put this much focus on race in sex scenes depicting women of other races. I'm not saying you should change her race or anything, just suggesting you be mindful of how you depict her.

The sex itself goes into a level of detail that I do think qualifies as gratuitous if this story isn't meant to be literotica. I'd suggest paring it down; it should be possible to convey that the antagonist is a hedonist dom with substantially more discretion.

Related: Since you're using the sex as a vehicle to show that Arthur is a hedonist, it's not necessary to have him then explain that he is one in his internal monologue.

As a style note, this is I think the third first-person POV character so far? I would suggest either writing all characters in the third person, or writing Lancelot in the first person and everyone else in the third person. Otherwise it is confusing for the reader. Many stories that are told from multiple perspectives use the second convention, with the central protagonist being the only "I."

Pausing in your writing to outline the story is a great choice. The end product will be much better for it. I do think you should decide on an ending, even if it's one where the protagonist loses. You will be able to arc toward that ending in a more natural way if you know what it is.
