It's supposed to be clear that she's playing Arthur. Arthur comments that the entire sex act between them is flattery.

He's fully aware that she's flattering him and trying to take advantage of him. She also knows he's fully aware, and they both know Arthur can't be bothered to do a thing about it.

Arthur's nature is pride. His pride won't allow him to move against Weiwei. She's not on his level. He doesn't recognise her as a threat. He went into that whole tirade about a Dragon using only a single claw to hunt a burrow of rabbits.

I'll clearly demarcate the gratuitous sex scenes.

I'm not sure I can say Weiwei isn't been fetishised. A lot of that scene was written as gratuitous sex. I just hope it doesn't tick anybody off.

I'll make Weiwei stronger and more confident, to make up for it?
