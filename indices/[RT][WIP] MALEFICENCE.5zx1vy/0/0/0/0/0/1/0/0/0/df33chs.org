"Assuredly" is better than "verily" in that it's less archaic/stilted, but it still falls into the trap of weakening the impact of your writing. You don't need to use extra words to tell the reader "this sentence is seriously true, for real"--it can stand on its own. Strong verbs will always serve you better than any amount of adverbial fluff. It's not that you can never use words like that, but it's best to keep them to a minimum.

You can convey the complex plans and redundancies, it just means you have to really flesh out those plans and show the readers the redundancies instead of just telling us they're there. You might be able to introduce that tendency of his on a small scale by having him way overplan for something relatively mundane (but still connected to the plot in some way); then later you can have him overplan for the big stuff too. But the whole thing with Trump doesn't work for that, because the reader has no reason to care about how complex some plan was that already happened ages ago and is no longer relevant.

As you're working on conveying in a natural, organic way that Lance's skills are derived from hard work, it might help for you to examine existing works of fiction with characters that share that trait. One example that comes to mind is Zuko from ATLA; if you haven't seen it, he is a "firebender" who lacks natural talent for the art in question and has a lot of insecurity related to that, but makes up for it over the course of the story with hard work and character growth. You could watch some of that, and other stories in that vein, and take notes on how the writers get that aspect across to the viewer.

One advantage to the "expand the prologue into a whole book" option is that you would be able to show the protagonist actually starting out as a normal dude, and then show his growth over the course of the story. It's more interesting that way than having the reader first meet him as an exceptional person, in any case.
