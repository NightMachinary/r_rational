It's fine for him to like big words, but if you're not careful about the specific big words you choose, you risk the writing coming off as stilted and taking the reader out of the story. Think of the writing as being purely a vehicle for the story; the reader should never be consciously aware of the writing itself, only of the meaning and imagery it conveys. It's like how you don't want a viewer focusing on the individual brush strokes of your painting.

In order to convey the atmosphere you're going for with "pulchritudinous," it might be best to choose a word that means something more nuanced than "really beautiful." After all, my understanding is you're aiming to convey that her beauty is supernatural, inhuman, deific? You might be able to accomplish that by using a word that's normally used to describe the beauty of natural wonders, or perhaps a word that primarily conveys awe rather than merely aesthetic beauty, or even a word that emphasizes the alien nature of her beauty. Or something else entirely--you could play around with it, see what works.

It's ultimately your decision, but I strongly recommend against "verily." Even if you use it in your own daily life, it's going to be jarring for the majority of readers. It's also a weak word that will dilute the impact of your writing.
