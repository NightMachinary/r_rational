My protagonist is someone that likes big words won't pass? A lot of the protagonist's character was based after how I want myself to be, so I feel like I intimately know him. I do imagine speaking as he did then where I in a similar scenario. I'll work on conveying clearly the atmosphere I wanted. I'm hesitant on removing the word as of yet.

As for 'verily' I just imagine the protagonist speak like that. I myself may speak like that.
