I'll look at the pulchritudinous. I actually learned that word for the story, another reason I'm using such words; cause it enriches my vocabulary. The word is unlikely to be removed, but more effort will be put into describing the mood and atmosphere.

 

I promise to go into describing the unnatural deific, alien beauty.

 

I can't imagine removing "Verily", but that part is getting cut out of the prologue. Prologue will start with Veri's appearance. I can replace it with "Assuredly"?

 

Thankfully, I can leave chapter 2 and as it is, and focus only on prologue and chapter 1.

 

I want to say something though. Lance was a normalish person before. It's important that readers understand this, that they don't think he's some born genius. All his knowledge, intellect, skills, etc came through labour.

 

His style also reflects that. He uses a lot of complex plans with several redundancies and contingency measures, because he doesn't have the self assurance that comes with genius.

 

He knows he was ordinary and strived to become the best.

 

I don't want to mislead readers into painting a wrong image about him, due to too much showing.
