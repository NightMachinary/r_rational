@CeruleanTresses : do you think my paragraphs are too long. I'm thinking of splitting them, due to some complaints. However, the current configuration is focused on coherent ideas and trains of thought. If I split up the paragraphs, I have a feeling I'd be having same idea/train of thought trail across multiple paragraphs.
