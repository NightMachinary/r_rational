Arthur using Liz as a piece. Liz is letting herself be used, but there are severe restrictions. She limits her power to a rank 6 esper. Arthur is mainly doing it to keep her entertained. He's keeping her by his side, might as well make as much limited use of her as possible. I might change the wording. Arthur keeps Liz around, to guarantee the World's safety; both from herself, and other sufficiently advanced aliens.

 

 

Teenager's cringey roleplay character.

 

Arthur's creed for Nihil Superbum is based after my cringey roleplay character. I'm 19 by the way, and have roleplayed him for two years? (Lance is based after my ideal self, he draws inspiration from my other cringey roleplay characters.

 

But the hair is an actual point. The plot is intricately woven around it, and it's definitively of the Brittania's.

 

It also serves as an indicator of how much of Arthur's abilities he's using.

 

I could go on and on, about all the plot significance the hair has, but I realise at this point I'm rationalising. Suffice it to say I'll have to redraw the whole plot to rewrite it without the hair and eye changing colours.

 

Take a look at all the unnatural or rare hair/eye color descriptions I've given.
