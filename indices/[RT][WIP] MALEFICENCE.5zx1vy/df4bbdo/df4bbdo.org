Finished Chapter 2. Some thoughts:

As always, less telling. We don't need Arthur to explain to us that his fetish for dominating competent women reflects his obsession with power. Spelling out things like that just makes the readers feel like you think they're too stupid to pick up on it themselves.

The paragraph about how many different places Arthur is wearing the words "Nihil Superbum" comes off as silly. You could maybe have him wear it one place and, instead of him announcing to the reader "this is my motto and this is what it means and I'm wearing it," maybe you could have a different POV character notice him wearing it and leave it to the reader to grasp its significance.

"Bodacious" is a very informal, outdated slang term for something attractive/admirable. It does technically mean what you used it for, but it's jarringly inconsistent with how Arthur normally speaks. From the context, it seemed like your intention was to use a sophisticated word, so I wouldn't have Arthur use "bodacious" unless you want him to sound like Bill and Ted.

It's not worth spending time showing that Weiwei is trying to manipulate Arthur to her own ends unless something is eventually going to come of that. She doesn't have to succeed, but by making a point of her ulterior motives, you're basically promising the audience that she's going to make her play eventually and that this will have some kind of impact on the story. What do you have planned for her endgame?

Liz announces on upon her entrance that they'll be speaking telepathically while feigning mundane conversation out loud (I assume for Weiwei's benefit). But there's nothing to indicate that this mundane conversation actually takes place, which is confusing and seems inconsistent. I believe this kind of exchange is usually handled by putting the "fake" and "real" conversations in the same lines, like so:

"Mundane thing," she said. [Real conversation.]

"Mundane reply." [Real reply.]

Liz, same deal as always about less telling--we don't need her to make a point of explaining to Arthur that she likes dominating competent men. He clearly already knows this, so it's too obvious that she's saying this for the reader's benefit, which breaks immersion.

I'm seeing a pattern where you repeatedly break up the flow of dialogue with the protagonist's internal musings. This makes it more difficult for the reader to keep track of the conversation. I realize that part of rational fiction is showing the character's thought process, but it should be organized in such a way that the dialogue isn't interrupted so much.

Arthur "using Liz as a piece" doesn't seem consistent with how you've said you intend to portray her as being above the game board. Unless she is just leading him to believe that she's a gamepiece? I will see if Chapter 3 sheds new light on this.

It's unclear to me whether Arthur expects Liz to literally kill Alvin or whether he's making a dark joke. This is pretty important to be clear about.

If you want the strategy MMO to be an important aspect of Arthur and Lance's competitive dynamic, I don't recommend just skipping past their games the way you do in Chapter 2. It would be more interesting to see /how/ Lance challenged him and how he defeated that challenge.

I strongly recommend that you do not have Arthur's hair and eyes change color when he's using his Brittania powers. It makes him seem like every teenager's first cringy RP character. The reader won't take him as seriously if you keep this detail.

In the conversation Arthur has after playing the strategy game, it's not clear who is speaking each line of dialogue. In fact, it took me several reads to figure out that the other party in the conversation is Liz. Given that they seemed to have reached an agreement already, that Arthur wants to give the game his undivided attention, and that said game takes /eight hours/ to complete, the reader has little reason to assume he's still talking to Liz or even that she's still in the room. Has she just been standing there for eight hours?

Arthur describing Lance as "strong" seems weird to me. It seems like you're using "strong" to convey competence in general, but that way of using the word seems unnatural. It would be better to use a more precise descriptor.

Why is the "highest caution" taken at the second threat level? What can the first level even be, in that case?

Having Arthur delegate his most competent and trusted subordinates to Lance-related tasks is a great way to organically show that he takes Lance seriously as an opponent...as long as you /don't/ have Arthur announce "THIS SHOWS THAT I TAKE LANCE SERIOUSLY AS AN OPPONENT."

Arthur's description of how intricate and layered Lance's plans are would be more compelling if he used an actual example of how Lance has outmaneuvered him with such a plan. Right now the way he talks about it is too vague to hold the reader's interest. Even better would be having this happen in the actual story instead of Arthur just talking about it.

The months-long time skips are very abrupt. Be mindful of your pacing. (Or is Arthur just describing what he's done in the months prior to the sex scene with Weiwei? It's not clear.)

I was going to read chapter 3 and include my comments on it in this post, but the post is already too long. I'll make a separate post for chapter 3 comments.
