Honestly, it because I'm still not entirely sure what rationalist fic is. I know we've been trying to define it for a while, and there's a lot of cases where it's very obvious that something fits in the genre. This story referenced a few items but it didn't have a rational protagonist or a rationalist storyline, and I was wondering if it would slip in as an edge case or be entirely out of bounds. When my view of the boundaries is very blurry I try to prod at the edges. This was an obvious failure, but it wasn't obvious to me before I asked.
