Black is still going to die in this book regardless of whether he's planning for it or not. The reason for that is again exemplified in this chapter: he's vastly more capable than Cat so any engagement she would find challenging - like the devil - can be solved by bringing him in. There's very little tension with him around so he'll either be removed or operate in a different arena like in book 2.
