Agreed. An Empress outranks a Queen, so even if /Black Queen/ is to be Cat's title, putting her against the Empire before Procer and the Hierarch/Tyrant before pitting her against the Empress just makes sense. Toppling, or at least driving off, the Empress is only really feasible when they don't face an existential threat from invasion.

Note that the /Wandering Bard/'s plan is still in play, causing the ultimate victory of Good. For Cat to stand a chance against that, she'd have to find some way to be able to speak to the Tyrant (likely while making war on his forces) and for him to set up some classic Villain's Last Words speech to reveal it at the end of the arc.
