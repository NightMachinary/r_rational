Rule? Both Malicia and Kairos have that as an aspect, so that makes sense. Though admittedly Cat hates the ruling side of her gig, so I wonder if that would work.

Edit: I'm gonna go with Command instead of Rule. That seems more her style. I think it would be a mixture of Black Knight's Lead and the Dread Empress's Rule.
