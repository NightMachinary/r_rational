I'd have to dig up the interlude that mentions it, but Cat hearing the song 'The Girl Who Climbed the Tower', iirc, hinted that she would be attempting to, well, climb the tower. I may be wrong, though the fact that 5 books are planned and we've had 1 major antagonist per book (the claimants, Lone Swordsman, and Diabolist so far) makes me think Book 4 and Book 5 will have Procer and Praes as their antagonists, though not necessarily in that order.

Edit: Found a mention in the chapter where Cat is made Lady of Marchford. Black mentions the song to Cat, naming it, and mentions he heard it in his youth, but it 'wasn't for him'. With all the rulership flags popping up, I'm pretty convinced she'll transition into Black Queen and start hearing more verses and attempt to depose Malicia.
