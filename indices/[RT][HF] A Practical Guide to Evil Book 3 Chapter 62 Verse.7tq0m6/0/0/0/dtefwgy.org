While there might be some conflict with Warlock or Ranger, the next antagonists should be Cordelia and the White Knight/Tyrant, though if Malicia's plan to stop the next Crusade before it begins works (and I'm not convinced it will), it's anyone's guess. Since the “Prince's Graveyard” is a thing, I'm inclined to believe there will be war with Procer.

And what do you mean by step down? Malicia is the ruler of the Empire, Cat's slated to be the ruler of Callow under her. I don't think there should be any conflict there, it's already been referenced several times that Cat won't break from Praes.
