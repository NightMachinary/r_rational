Agreed. Cat's inexplicable annoyance at not being in command, her mentioning that the Black Knight is the right hand of the Dread Emperor, the voice in her head that wants her to order Black to live, her mantle as Duchess of Moonless Night... Too many things pointing toward that particular transition.

I think Black will die at the hands of Diabolist as part of the latter's plan to break Cat. Black dying will cause Cat to transition, probably after Akua has already rendered her helpless, setting up for Cat to embrace the ruling potential mentioned above and transition into Black Queen. I imagine the transition point will be her commanding Black to get back up in her grief.

That's solid enough that I'm more curious about who the antagonists will be after Ubua's suicide. Warlock seems very likely, as does Ranger, Scribe and Procer. Malicia and Assassin are less certain. For the former, Malicia is genre-savvy enough that she might semi-peacefully step down, or she might feel the need to oppose Cat. Assassin is too much of a mystery to determine either way.
