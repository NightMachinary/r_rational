One of the big problems with the crown is that it can go to, say, a toddler, given the right circumstances. This is one of the big reasons that the Oath of Fealty is to a person, rather than to the crown itself; if it were to the crown, then commands could be issued from someone who wasn't fit to deliver them, which is to be avoided at all costs (and there are similar, less avoidable problems with senescence, with various strategies for mitigation).

Beyond that, there are a lot of reasons that a king might want his orders to not die with him. For one, that would mean that the king is even more of a failure point for governance than kings normally are, meaning that all someone has to do is assassinate him, and the oathkeepers are freed from their compulsion to keep doing what he said to keep doing -- especially a problem if one of the primary things the king fears is insurrection from the oathkeepers (and note that the sages and oathkeepers are remarked as being at least partly in opposition to one another). As a second point, wouldn't the king /want/ the ability to have his orders continue past his death? If he had a disagreement with his successor, he would get the last word, and if he didn't want the last word, then he can leave escape clauses in his orders.

I'm also not sure that the rules of oathkeeping allow oaths to terminate like you're suggesting -- it's sort of a corner case. I made a list of rules, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2j5q53/bst_the_magic_of_oathkeeping/][posted to this subreddit]], and one of the things that I liked least were 1) oaths with end dates, e.g. "I will do x for two years and then stop doing x" and 2) oaths with escape clauses, e.g. "I won't drink, unless I really want to". So before I started NaNo, I cut those two possibilities out; oaths are /permanent/, without conditionals or end dates.

But /Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ is still stuck in first draft, and there's a lot to clarify and fix. There should probably be the text of at least one Oath in there, just to give the flavor of it. And there was going to be a scene where Rowan comes to the sudden, horrible realization that his father is dead and the Boreal Crown hasn't actually passed to him, with some of his frantic efforts to cover that up and secure the Oaths of Fealty from the oathkeepers ... but I just never ended up writing it.
