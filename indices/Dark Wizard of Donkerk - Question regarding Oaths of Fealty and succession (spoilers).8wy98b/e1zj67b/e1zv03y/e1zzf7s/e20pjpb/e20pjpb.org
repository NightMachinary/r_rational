I had always planned for there to be a sequel, referenced in the epilogue where they're talking about going on a trip around the world. If you look at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/alexanderwales/comments/2lip81/collected_discussionlinks_for_the_dark_wizard_of/][the Saturday spotlight for DWoD]] there are a bunch of details that never made it into the final draft, and a bunch of things that I thought were neat that I'd like to get into. That's also the reason there are number of types of magic mentioned in the work and then never used or expounded on.

Unfortunately, I can only write about two thousand words a day at most, which means that I can't write everything that I want to. The "to edit" pile contains a lot of projects, and DWoD is 3rd or 4th down the list, which means that I have basically given up hope on ever being able to get to it. And I don't think that I would ever write a sequel without first doing an edit of it in order to hammer things down. (Most likely, someone else will edit DWoD to fix all the glaring typos, some inconsistencies, setup/payoff issues, characterization, etc. [[/u/couteaubleu]] has graciously offered, and I took them up on that, which is the most likely way that a proper edit will happen.)

+(On mobile right now, but there's a list of unfinished works on my blog.)+

There's a four-year-out-of-date list of writing projects on my blog, [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/05/state-of-my-various-writing-projects.html][pt 1]], [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/05/state-of-my-various-writing-projects-pt.html][pt 2]]. The intervening four years have seen more projects started than completed.
