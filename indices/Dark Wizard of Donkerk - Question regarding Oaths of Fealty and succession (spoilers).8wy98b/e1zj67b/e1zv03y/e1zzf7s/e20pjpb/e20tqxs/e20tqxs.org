I like the idea of the Time Storm. It's like the EverStorm from Sanderson's Stormlight Archive. I don't think the concept is too difficult to grasp of a sudden migrating maelstrom that throws people forward and backward in time. Plus I doubt you have to worry about your ideas being marketable. You're easily one of the best writers in here, and you have a dedicated reader base that would happily buy anything you published.
