Ooh, if multiple oaths cover non-overlapping things, and one desires to break each of them out of general contrariness... do they have any minimum level of sacrifice, below which the boon is rounded down to zero? Or alternatively, is the boon infinitely divisible? I think that's one of the things I was thinking of in my third thought [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7766vw/a_long_form_critical_review_of_the_dark_wizard_of/dorag10/][here]], making a thousand trivial oaths a day and keeping each of them. Likewise, depending on if the spirits care about revealed preference, believed preference, or "true" preference, using mentalism to self-modify into experiencing greater or lesser oath stress.

I quite enjoyed this book, thanks for writing it! :]
