  But it's really intended to be extremely limited in terms of complex structuring so as to give little in the way of release valves or complex mental logic to know whether or not an oath is broken
#+end_quote

An elegant way to put it would be that if your oath has release valves clauses, actually using these clauses takes power away from the oath. If you say "I'm not allowed to eat sweet things except on the Winter Solstice", and then you eat chocolate on the Winter Solstice, you lose all the power you had accumulated since the last year. If you eat chocolate any other day, you lose all your oath powers, period.

This would mean release valves are still possible, but the Rectorate has a strong incentive to never use them in their oaths.
