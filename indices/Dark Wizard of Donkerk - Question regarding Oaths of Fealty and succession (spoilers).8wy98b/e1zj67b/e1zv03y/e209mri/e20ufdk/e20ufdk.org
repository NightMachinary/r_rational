Under the hood, oaths are compacts with a spirit in the spiritual realm (hinted at once or twice, but I'm not sure outright stated). At a certain point of triviality, you would make your oath only to have it silently fail, since no spirit would make themselves party to the compact.

You can see an initial list of rules for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2j5q53/bst_the_magic_of_oathkeeping/][oathkeeping here]], though I ended up changing a few things in the final ruleset, namely removing conditionals and time limits. I can't recall if there's a reference to it, but I remember also wanting to remove the public display part of making an oath. (I'm pretty sure I've written close to a million words since finishing DWoD, so things get fuzzy.)

I just really disliked all the legalese, which I didn't think worked too well on a thematic or narrative level. Taking a magic system that was about the denial of desires and then twisting it into hyper-conditional legal statements seemed like a really [[/r/rational]] thing, but also super lame and contrary to the things I actually found interesting about the system.

Obviously there are some conditionals possible within the system, and conditional equivalents, especially with something like the Oath of Fealty, which implicitly includes orders give to those under the oath (which is its own can of worms, since you could reframe every oath as an order given under Oath of Fealty). But it's really intended to be extremely limited in terms of complex structuring so as to give little in the way of release valves or complex mental logic to know whether or not an oath is broken. Because the oaths are mediated by a human on one end and a spirit on the other, there are some natural "common sense" limitations that can be imposed, making it a bit softer of a magic system, but a bit less frustratingly wordy. I didn't want to deal with anything like the Optimized Wish Project, so I decided that I wouldn't.
