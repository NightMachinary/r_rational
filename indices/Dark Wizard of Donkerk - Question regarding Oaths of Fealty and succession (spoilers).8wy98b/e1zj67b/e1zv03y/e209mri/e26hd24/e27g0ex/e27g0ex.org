Traditional channels strongly frown on content that's already been published. It happens occasionally, but it's something of a non-starter for a lot of agents and publishers, mostly because if people can get something for free, they're a lot less inclined to pay for it (plus all the inherent rights issues).

For DWoD to ever get traditionally published, I would probably have to have an existing relationship with an agent or publisher, or it would have to somehow become a runaway success that would attract attention and make up for the inherent risks.
