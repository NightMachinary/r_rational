I wouldn't be /too/ hopeful if I were you. I do intend to work on it this summer, and I'd give myself better odds than average for an amateur project, but... how do I put this... I wouldn't trust anyone else who told me the exact same thing.

--------------

Since we're on the subject, I did think about what to edit. The big changes I'd work from would be:

- Removing the prophecy entirely, for reasons you've already talked about. It's a crutch, it derails character motivations, most characters already have plausible reasons to do what they're doing (eg Henry could be going to the Important Place to retrieve his birth certificate).

- Spend a little more time describing Henry's time at the orphanage. As it is, Henry goes from naive cloistered weird kid to well-adjusted, popular, socially confident young adult with no transition. I think it would be interesting to show how his time at the orphanage and his experience reading an adult's memories made him more able to navigate social situations.

- Delay the realization that Fiona is Sofia a bit longer. It'd add some tension, make their relationship a bit more organic, and make Henry look less self-indulgent. (though it's not a major problem in the first place)

- Make the first confrontation between usurper!Rowan and Sofia happen in private, and last longer. I've already talked about why, I think your version goes way too fast, and misses some occasion to have characters express their differences, what they learned through their journey, the different ways the King affected his children, etc.

Other, smaller changes:

- Rename it to /The Dark Wizard*s* of Donkerk/. Similar title, feels less generic, and suggests emphasis on the world and the society rather than a character-driven plot.

- Shorten the first arcs, before Sofia starts going out of the Castle and Henry goes to the orphanage. This is when the story really begins, everything else is setup and needs to be as short as possible.

- Add some foreshadowing for the evil Queen mom reveal.

- Spend more screentime addressing the fact that the Chief Mentalist is evil, maybe add more foreshadowing, or make it look like the story will be about him taking over the kingdom (making Rowan look more like a heroic figure for opposing him).

- Give Sofia more screentime to process her family's death, her new responsibilities, and what she learned about her mom, before she goes confront her brother.

- Make the final battle shorter, somehow. There's a lot of cool scenes in there, but they're all extraneous, and at this point it feels pretty inevitable that Sofia will win.

Also, I'll start a typo thread after I'm done with the r!animorphs ARG.
