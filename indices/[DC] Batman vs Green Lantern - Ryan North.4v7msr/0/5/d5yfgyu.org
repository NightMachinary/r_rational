I haven't read the comics either, but it's always been my understanding that the people the Corps go after tend to already be recognized as criminals, terrorists, or dictators by local governments and are usually too powerful for them to stop themselves.

The Lanterns take advantage of the same laws that superheroes do when turning criminals in and have their own prison for the ones locals can't hold. I think it's fair to assume the Guardians maintain diplomatic ties with governments to handle affairs like extradition.
