Dear Sir,

If you want to secede from the rule of the Guardians of the Universe, please fill out and file the standard forms on Oa (conveniently located at the center of the universe) indicating that a positive majority of the sophonts of your galactic cluster wish to secede, and we will begin standard separation negotiations.

Until that time, please be advised that the Guardians of the Universe will continue to operate in your galactic supercluster through their designated agents (currently the Green Lantern Corps) as they have for the last 3,500,000,000 of your planet's years.
