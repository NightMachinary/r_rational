Green Lantern Corps never made that much sense to me, since they have no legitimacy. So far as I know (though I don't read the comics), no one on Earth consented to their governance. You can't just come into a town and say "hey, I am your police now". It would make even less sense if the Green Lanterns of Earth weren't humans (which, statistically, they shouldn't be). They don't have a monopoly on legitimate use of physical force, and in fact they undermine existing police structures. If the comics ever go into detail on the matter, I'd like to know how they resolve this.
