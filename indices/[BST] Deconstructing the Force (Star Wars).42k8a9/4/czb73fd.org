An indirect way to detect Force particles is to look for midichlorians. If they are microscopic organisms that feed on the Force we would expect people who are powerful in the Force will have lots of midichlorians, which is canon.

Further evidence could be gathered by drawing blood from someone with a low midichlorian count and putting some blood near one of those Sith amulets. If after some time the blood near the amulet has more midichlorians than the blood that was kept away from the amulet as a control, that's evidence that midichlorians eat Force.

If the midichlorians don't react to the amulet, then maybe midiclorians are the source of the Force and the amulet is made of concentrated midichlorian poop or something like that.
