Well, in a world where actual souls exist, the question of "who has souls" is not so much a question of "what we can say", but a matter of fact, to be determined by experiment.

But I like your idea of this beeing a point of contention between Jedi and Sith, as this gives us three conflicting moralities to play against each other:

A. Sith morality. The moral weight of a beeing is determined by the force. Force-sensitives have much more weight than non-sensitive minds, who are like animals and mostly worthless. Non-minds are totally worthless. If a Sith encounters a force-sensitive animal, it will be considered worthy.

B. Jedi morality. The moral weight of a beeing is determined by the force. Force-sensitives have the obligation to protect the lesser minds (who are still in the same category as animals). Hence Jedi are vegan.

C. Protagonist / reader morality. Screw this force stuff; morality is a human judgement. A true moral relativist does not change his stance upon encountering a judging god (the force). Morally, sensitives = non-sensitive sentients > animals > rocks.
