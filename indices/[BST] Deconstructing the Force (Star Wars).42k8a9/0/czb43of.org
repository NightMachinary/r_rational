There were pretty nice sources linked in this sub. "Timeless warrior" and "Truth of the Sith" had some nice ideas:

There is only one side of the force (the dark side). Force-sensitives use short-time precognition while fighting. Midi-chlorians are parasites feeding on the force, not its source, and are mainly useful for mass testing for sensitives.

Other stuff: Aside from explaining the force, you need to explain the absence of real AI and powerful computers (otherwise human pilots would be useless- even with today's computers).

Let the force come to rescue: For example, the force might link to sentient beeings and computation. However, the force is only really compatible with human-style minds. This also explains why all species think similiarly (no alien aliens).

If the force detects a computer and tries but fails to link to it, the computation is disrupted. Hence, no powerful general purpose computers above a certain threshold (maybe 1980s-level is the maximum possible). This prevents synthetic AI and useful non-sentient auto-pilots.

What about droids? Droids are (at least) semi-sentient and suffer from the same limitations as biological minds: No copying of experiences (each droid needs to be trained anew), no "hive-mind", no real modular structure, speed of thought comparable to humans. Explained by the force only allowing "human-style" (probably better termed "Sith-style") complex computation.

I'd guess building a reductionist pseudo-science explanation for the force would be a fool's errand. The force should probably be a "magical style" law of nature.

What about FTL-travel and the rocket equation? We see in-universe that energy is at least somewhat scarce. Hence non-FTL travel cannot use the rocket equation (otherwise the amounts of energy cheaply used for propulsion would dwarf anything ever used planet-side). At the same time, you need somehow kill Lorentz-invariance anyway in order to allow FTL travel.

Here the hyperspace ("the warp") comes to the rescue. So maybe space+hyperspace does not have Lorentz-invariance (nor Galilei-invariance); normal, in-system travel also somehow uses the hyperspace, but instead of traveling through it you just use it as an "anchor" in order to remove the constraints of the rocket-equation. This also gives you the nice property of "absolute speed" beeing a thing in space, interpreted as "speed relative to the preferred resting frame of the warp". "Nice" in this context would mean "good for epic battles".
