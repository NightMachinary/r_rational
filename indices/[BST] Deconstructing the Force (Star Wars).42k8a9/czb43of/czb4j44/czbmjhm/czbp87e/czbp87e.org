This is a very nice model.

  Non-sensitives could be, in some literal sense, soul-less. This would allow for slightly more rational genocidal villains ("If even the Force itself considers these sheeple non-sentient, why should I care so much about their well-beeing? They are like droids, or like sheep! Farming is no slavery, and neither is butchery murder.")

Or one could go the other direction and say that some animals have souls. Maybe this is a point of contention between Jedi and Sith? I don't recall Jedi being vegans in canon, but thematically it would fit them.
