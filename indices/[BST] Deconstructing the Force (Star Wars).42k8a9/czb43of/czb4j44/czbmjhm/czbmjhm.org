No, my model predicts that we CAN mind-trick droids.

My model predicts and explains that there is only one possible "structure of mind" because any other complex computation is disrupted by the force (hence evolution converges on this structure, as well as droid design). The force knows how to correctly interface with this type of mind, allowing it to be mind-tricked.

If you want Sith-amulets to be part of your AU, then you could posit that clever engineering can "trick the force" in order to interface with the amulet.

In my proposed model, the force does not "link all living things" (either flat-out wrong or just metaphorical). Instead, the force "links all minds"; it might have the following categories:

A (has no mind detected by the force): brainless plants, rocks, maybe lower animals, slow computers

B (has a mind detected and correctly interfaced by the force; not considered sentient by the force; can be mind-tricked): higher animals, maybe droids

C (has a mind detected and correctly interfaced by the force; sentient; has no access privileges; can be mind-tricked): non-sensitive humans/aliens, maybe droids

D (has a mind detected and correctly interfaced by the force; considered sentient; gets access privileges): force-sensitives.

Occam's razor asks you, whether the force actually makes the distinction beteween B and C.

Non-sensitives could be, in some literal sense, soul-less. This would allow for slightly more rational genocidal villains ("If even the Force itself considers these sheeple non-sentient, why should I care so much about their well-beeing? They are like droids, or like sheep! Farming is no slavery, and neither is butchery murder.")

In between A and B, there is an uncanny valley:

A+ (seems to have a mind; trying to interface; doesn't work; bugs are triggered / computation is unintentionally corrupted, since computers are fragile things): Evolutionary dead ends (stillborn) and failed attempts at computer-design and droid-design (metaphorically stillborn).

Computer design in this world is focused on either staying in category A or jumping directly into a higher category, which requires all kinds of crazy things: Why do targeting-computers of space-ships have to be semi-sentient, aka droids? Why to droids have to have motivations, desire for self-preservation, other desires, etc?

In order to survive the force's attempt to shoe-horn everything into its very conservative and limited concept of a "mind".
