Thanks for the links! I've read "Timeless warrior" but, sadly, it seems to be abandoned. I'll make sure to check the second one.

As for the Force being a law of nature - it's fine by me, but so far we don't have even that law. Alchemy in FMA at least looks like a law; the Force just works "somehow". A reductionist explanation might manage to preserve the "magical" part: for instance, my thoughts in the post are obviously approaching the concept of a deity (in a form of cloud storage). What it can give us, however, is a way to exploit the Force in numerous ways.

For example: telekinesis alone authomatically gives us a possibility to slice a vein in the enemy's body. With this, we no longer need powerful combat abilities and combat itself. To be honest, I don't even know how to block such an attack if I put myself in that enemy's shoes.

Anyway, AI limitations look like an interesting path of research: we can't mind-trick droids, and it's said that the Force unites "all living things". Perhaps that's another indication towards some kind of a "life essence" which allows such complex structures as a mind to function.
