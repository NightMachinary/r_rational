What if you have it backwards? The midichlorians DO eat the force, but the force doesn't come from the force user. The force in this case would be some sort of field, and the midichlorians draw force energy from it and process it in the same way chlorophyll processes sunlight. Thus more midichlorians, stronger force powers.
