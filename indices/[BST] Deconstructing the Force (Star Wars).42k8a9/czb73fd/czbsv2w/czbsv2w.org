Midichlorians were obviously based on mitochondria. While they can't work /exactly/ like mitochondria (for one thing, mitochondria are generally inherited only from the mother), if you think of them as like mitochondria, that puts some limits on how they work. For instance, they are not going to reproduce at a rate high enough that blood would contain more of them when exposed to the Force. (Also, the common fan idea of injecting people with midichlorians would fail.)
