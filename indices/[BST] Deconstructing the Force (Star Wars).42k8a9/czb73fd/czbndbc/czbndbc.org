And if midichlorians eat force, but the power levels of Jedi and Sith do not decrease with age, then the force is constantly replenished or generated in force-sensitives. Disovery of a means to immunize oneself against midichlorians will either result in an increasingly powerful force-sensitive, who perhaps gains power exponentially as time passes, or merely a force-sensitive who is still more powerful than others, if only because their force is able to reach its baseline.

I think the former case the more persuasive, as to have a baseline level of force power at all wouldn't be evolutionarily necessary when midichlorians serve the role of limiters. This might also suggest unpredicable outcomes in having unlimited force.
