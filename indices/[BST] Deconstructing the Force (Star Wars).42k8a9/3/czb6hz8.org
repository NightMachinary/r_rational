  Given that we have Sith amulets, we can easily conclude that the Force itself isn't contained in any living structure (midichlorians or whatever).

The amulet may hold some bacteria as a "living structure" to contain the Force. Alternatively, if we consider the Force as some kind of energy field that requires the presence of life in order to do anything, it's possible that these amulets are to the Force as a CD is to a computer.

What I mean by that is, a CD (I'm not talking about a rewriteable disk) isa static collection of data. Alone, it just sits there and does nothing. But put it in a CD drive attached to a computer, and you can run whatever program's on the CD. I don't know all /that/ much about the expanded universe, but it's possible that these Sith amulets are a bit like that - just static data, unmoving, unchanging, until some form of /life/ gets close enough to power it (and it probably drains a little life from whoever's around, explaining why this technique is more commonly used by the Sith).

So... there might not be a single entity (in the same way that you can't get an atom of Human, just atoms of carbon and hydrogen and stuff). The Force may be the result of combining some sort of external structure with an energy source drawn from life force itself. (This would also explain why Force users live longer - the subconsciously draw in some of the life force from plants and animals around them, perhaps an important part of Jedi training is about /not/ drawing in the life force of other sentients under any circumstances).
