All right, this one is easily tested: 1) We take an amulet with a known effect (preferrably with no spirits at this stage) and test it in the hands of a Force user, then a non-sensitive, then a droid and finally a mechanism. This will tell us if the amulet can work "by itself", without any mind or life present. I think I'd expect similar results in all cases.\\
2) We desinfect an amulet (with reagents, temperature or vacuum) and check whether it works - probably repeating the previous test. Once again, I'd expect it to work. If it doesn't, we'll have discovered those bacteria :)
