Your ideas regarding FD remind me of the warp from 40k, its a psychically accessible spacial dimension where patterns in the real universe cast conceptual shadows onto the fabric of the warp, thus giving rise to structures and entities being born into the warp as the result of the collective actions of a civilisation. This also goes well with the whole 'there is no light side of the force' thing.
