What if the Force isn't a particle, but an additional spatial dimension?

Everything in the galaxy exists in the ordinary 3+1 dimensions, but also in the 4th dimension. Let's call the fourth dimension "the Force dimension" or "FD". The FD is much smaller or denser, so things that are distant in any of the 3 "ordinary" dimensions are not as far in the FD. Patterns that exist in 3+1-space are somehow encoded physically in the FD.

Force users are able to move in the FD.

Let's see what that explains:

- General telekinesis (force push, pull, choke, etc.): moves an appendage through FD to push and pull objects. Pushing and pulling off-center (in the FD) causes motion in 3D.

- Enhanced athletics (speed, jump, etc.): pushes the force user along in the FD. Traveling slowly in the FD equates to fast motion in 3D because a short distance in FD maps to a large distance in 3D.

- Special powers (lightning, etc.): static friction from FD? A parlor trick performed by pushing a van-der-graaf generator completely into FD? Something to do with FD patterns? No idea.

- Mind powers (force suggestion, mind reading, etc.): the mind also exists in the FD, where it is exposed in a physical sense. State of mind, memories, and so on are patterns of neurons firing, behavior patterns, and structural patterns, and all of these are accessible in the FD.

- Foresight (predicting blaster shots, force visions, prophecies, etc.): some aspect of the 4th dimension of time is also projected into the FD, which gives people who have access to the FD, access to time. Another explanation is that it is simple extrapolation of broader patterns that are made accessible in FD.

- Spirits (force spirits, ghosts, body switching, etc.): force users can move themselves by pushing through the FD, and can access patterns that are splayed out in FD. A powerful force user can push their whole being (which is just a big, complicated biological pattern) into the FD. This severs their connection with ordinary spacetime, but they can still interact through the FD.

I think to make this work, we'd need several extra dimensions of Force Dimension, and also a mechanism for physical "patterns" in ordinary space-time to be encoded and physically accessible in the Force Dimensions.

Another question: why is the presence of one or more Force Dimensions not known to science? I think it is, and it's used in a variety of applications, not the least of which is the hyperdrive.
