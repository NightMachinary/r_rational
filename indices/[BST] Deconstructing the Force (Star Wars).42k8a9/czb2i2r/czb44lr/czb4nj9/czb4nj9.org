1) Consider what modern mystics claim about quantum mechanics - the seat of the soul, water memory, ESP, everything is "quantum"... because they don't understand it. Even though quantum effects are at the basis of commonplace lightbulbs, somehow they still use the idea as a source for magical thinking. Now consider Vader's position: he can use a power that nobody else (except the emperor) can, he was taught a bunch of mystical mumbo-jumbo first by the Jedi and then by Palpatine, he has intimate and fine-grained access to a power that drives starships, he knows it enables Palpatine to control the entire galaxy with an iron fist, and it transcends time and space. Furthermore, dark side users have very visceral-emotional experiences with the force. If you've ever taken dopamine or tryptamine agonists, witnessed the birth of your children, had a religious revelation or had some other extremely potent emotional experience, you'd know you're likely to overstate the importance of that experience. Especially if you're trying to impress your superiority over a pencil-necked general who just ordered the complete physical destruction of a planet.

Scientists don't really make much of an appearance in Star Wars, so it's hard to say what they have and have not studied. The galaxy has been ruled by religious fanatics for centuries, a religious order that benefits from suppressing the idea that the Force is mundane, and has been playing up the mystical nature of the Force as much as possible, so it's no surprise we only see that aspect presented. The fact that the handful lunatics that run the galaxy can /slightly/ access the hidden dimension(s) is completely irrelevant to the engineers and mechanics who build and maintain hyperdrives and all the other hyperdimensional technology.

2) That would be a good experiment. Another one would be to see if the instruments used to track ships through hyperdrive register Force user activity.

I thought of another technology that the FD can explain: low-energy hovercraft. In every Star Wars film, we see cheap, low-end vehicles /parked/ and hovering. So, hover technology is cheap, accessible, and low-power. I can't think of a better solution than putting the suspension in a different dimension, to avoid friction and moving parts in the ordinary dimensions.
