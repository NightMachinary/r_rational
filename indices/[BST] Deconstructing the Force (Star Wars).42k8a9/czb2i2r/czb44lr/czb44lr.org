Nice, your hypothesis seems just as logical - I especially like how you combined it with hyperspace. I have only two points to add:\\
1) The widely spread mystical approach to the Force is evidence against the notion that scientists use it. Example just off the top of my head: Vader would hardly be able to say "The ability to destroy a planet is nothing compared to the power of the Force" if the Death Star (at least its hyperdrive) used the Force.\\
2) What we actually need is an experiment which will test at least your hypothesis against mine. What do we expect to see if an additional dimension exists - and if unknown particles exist? In your case I'd probably start marking atoms with radiation and looking whether or not they are "teleported" through FD when telekinesis is used.
