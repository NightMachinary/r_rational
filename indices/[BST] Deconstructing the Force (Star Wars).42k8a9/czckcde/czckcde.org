There are crystals that respond to the Force, canonically used in Holocrons and Lightsabers. In Legends, there are also crystals that can amplify Force powers, Holocrons can create force effects, and cystals that are sapient and can use the Force.

Given all that, it's likely that "Sith amulets" are using these crystals in some way. They might be artificially intelligent, or "force spirits" interacting through the crystal (which may be the same thing; Droids are /suspiciously/ humanlike.) They might be something more technological, based on research into the Force.
