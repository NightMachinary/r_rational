Look up the "vitalist principle": [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism]] It's obviously what the idea of the Force is based on and is a good source of ideas about it. It's an old mystical idea and also a discredited scientific theory about how life works.

And why do Midi-chlorians have to be parasites? Maybe they're neither harmful nor useful, or maybe they're symbiotic. Maybe they're a beneficial change or mutation in the mitochondria that happens due to high Force exposure over long time spans, and that gives a Force user super mitochondria that work better than normal and allow a force user to eat less and exert themselves longer without wearing out, and can also be used to measure Force power in an individual by seeing what percentage of their mitochondria have changed to super Force powered "Midi-chlorian" mitochondria.
