Something that you should consider, is that levitation tech is apparently DIRT SIMPLE, nominally zero or negligible power requirement and so prevalent that otherwise none-technological beings or species tens of thousands of years earlier have utilized it and highly advanced cultures have not found any sizable improvements on it.

This makes me think that things like telekinesis is probably operating on a principle of the star wars universe that is well understood and extensively utilized.

But it is the fact that some one is managing to do it with just their 'mind' that is considered strange/hokey.
