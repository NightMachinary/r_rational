  Even if the universe smites anyone trying to make even those judgements, it's evidently not smiting those who note that it's consistent in its smiting of people who try to study it.

Except when it does. Random peasants who keep their heads down and don't do any of the things you're not supposed to do can still get struck by lightning from a clear sky, or eaten by dragons, or fall into the sky after gravity stops working for no reason.

Consider Descartes. The thing about reality being run by an infinitely powerful deceiving demon is that it's not very fun to live in that reality, and there's literally nothing you can do to avoid arbitrary consequences. Whatever you think you've figured out is subject to revision at any time, including your thoughts and memories, if the malevolent entity in absolute control of absolutely everything thinks it'd be funny.

This leaves the only /working/ method to get one over on reality is to play the demon, not the game... which, as has been noted, is also something that usually ends badly, especially if reality happens to notice you trying to be manipulative like that. However, it still likes what it likes, and if you're clever, you've noticed that it likes 'epic' and 'heroic' stories, and gives more leeway to individuals whose actions fall under those tropes. This might not work any better than anything else; wannabe heroes die in droves. But when you're a helpless pawn dancing in the palm of an infinitely powerful demon, your only real choice is whether or not to attract its attention... so if you are going to try getting that attention, you should at least try to do so in a good way.

If at all approximately possible, a more sensible course of action still is to flee the universe by any means available.
