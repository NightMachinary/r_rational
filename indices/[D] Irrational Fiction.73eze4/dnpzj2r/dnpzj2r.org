The premise does not make sense to me. (Instrumental) rationality is ability to archive one's goals. Whatever arcane process you use to decide on a course of action, if it consistently brings you closer to achieving your goals, then it is rational by definition, regardless of how emotional, impulsive, spastic, random or inexplicable it appears to be.

Thus acting "irrationally" (thoughtlessly, impulsively and randomly) in the environment you describe is actually quite rational, and acting "rational" (based on drawing conclusions from prior evidence using reason and logic) is irrational.

Basically, you described a universe with different rules for what constitutes rational decision process from what we are used to, but that does not make it (the process) irrational.
