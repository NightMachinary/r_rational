So do I, to the point where it worries me. I discovered rationality at a time when I was a hardcore New Age hippie weirdo who was getting a physics degree specifically to study psychics and Reiki. Now I have that degree but no idea what to do with it, suffered multiple existential crises over whether the spirits I talk to while meditating are real, and regularly experience depressive episodes due to doubting that my positive thinking can influence reality.

Part of me feels like I made a wrong turn in my personal development. I've become as implicitly loyal to epistemic rationality as any religious doctrine, attempting to live up to ideals even when I am psychologically incapable of doing so purely because I was told they were good. Now I second guess everything I believe due to concern over unobservable biases, which has ruined the optimistic worldview I once had. Now I don't have confidence in my ability to control myself and the world around me.

Life wasn't easy before this transition happened, and it would be conceited of me to believe that other experiences I've had couldn't also be responsible for my change in mindset, but it was extremely comforting back then to believe in an immaterial higher power that was guiding me and giving me more control over my life despite my mental illnesses. Now I have to contend with lingering doubts over whether any of it is real if all I can measure is how much I despair I'm in when my faith wanes.

I already concluded, long ago, that I am not psychologically capable of being an atheist or materialist. I cannot live happily if I reject my dualistic beliefs, I will always feel like I'm living half the life I did before because it all still seems real to me. However, I cannot reliably maintain my belief in such things when I also believe it is virtuous to constantly be skeptical about my beliefs and seek out objective evidence for them. I'm glad I don't believe in pseudoscience and confirmation bias anymore, but without it I can't rationally justify a worldview that is foundational to my ability to self-actualize.
