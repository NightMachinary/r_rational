I don't think that would work, I genuinely believe that I'm communicating with the ghosts of dead relatives I was close to in life. I place value on speaking with them specifically because I view them as separate entities from me that know things I don't, but believe that guiding me towards learning things on my own would be better for me than directly explaining.

The way the afterlife and God operate is key to my worldview because it allows me to justify hope, determination, and personal growth as part of the purpose of existence. If it's just in my head, then it loses such meaning. It's not that my morality would change if that were the case, but that I would lose confidence in my potential to live the best life I can.
