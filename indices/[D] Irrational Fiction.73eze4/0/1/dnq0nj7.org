*Edit:* Yes, one would need to have a contrast between the two approaches, i.e. what we consider rational and what is rational in this story. In /Cordyceps/, the particulars of the situation make usually-irrational behaviour (i.e. such that it can't be expected to let you win in most cases) rational; in /Methods of Obstinacy/, it's the contrast between rational approaches in two universes.

--------------

Take /Cordyceps/ as an example. Someone found themselves captive in an institution with no memory, and found strong evidence that their memory is repetitively erased by the people who hold them there. We would expect that staying put and doing what they're told would have unpleasant consequences for them, while trying to find out more and make a successful escape would constitute a victory; in actuality, it's the opposite. A rational person would fail here, while a gullible one would win.

Similarly, as in [[/u/ToaKraka][u/ToaKraka]]'s example, there could be situations where trying to study a phenomenon using scientific method would have counterproductive results, as would be trying to systematically find any kind of pattern in behaviour of this phenomenon. Trying to manipulate the outcome by simulating an irrational person would perhaps also fail, simply by virtue of you expecting this to succeed based on rational analysis of the situation.

In some examples, yes, it would still be possible to make a rational decision to act irrationally (as in, how people without any rational training act), and win this way. In other cases ([[#s][]]), it wouldn't be.
