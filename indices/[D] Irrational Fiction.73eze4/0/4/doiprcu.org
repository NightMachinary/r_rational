By this standard the most rational characters are Mary Sues/Gary Stus who just succeed all the time because their worlds run on authorial intervention and plot armour.

Rationalfic protagonists do not necessarily achieve their goals more often or more efficiently than normiefic protags - they achieve them more believably.

I /like/ Yudkowsky's meta/non-definition as opposed to the Enlightenment /tradition/ of rationality, but it's clearly not the only thing at play in the designation of the genre.
