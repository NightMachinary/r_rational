Rationality is the ability to achieve one's goals in a wide variety of circumstances. This is about a pathological circumstance where your ability to achieve your goals is negatively correlated to your ability to do it in other circumstances in general.

As an extreme example, imagine you stick someone in a simulation that's indistinguishable from reality, see how many lives they save, and then kill that many people. The more (generally) rational that person is, the more people will get killed.
