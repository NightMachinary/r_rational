I hope you like it! I think SU (which I do love) can be more heavyhanded with relationship and identity stuff because it's primarily aimed at children, who don't pick up on subtlety that well. But this is aimed more at older teens and young adults, I think. So it's not as much trying to teach the reader a lesson.

I think the representation parts are probably over/represented/ (ha) in the reviews because every time someone publishes a really good work of fiction with ace or trans characters, those communities are like "SWEET" and pass them around amongst themselves. So a lot of the people buying the book are there for the representation content. That's actually how I found the book in the first place, although I ended up loving it even aside from the ace part.
