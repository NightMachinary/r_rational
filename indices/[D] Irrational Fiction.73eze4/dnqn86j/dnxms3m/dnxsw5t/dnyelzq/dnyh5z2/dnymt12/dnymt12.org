  I wouldn't even call it representation porn. One character is ace and one character is trans, but that isn't solely what defines them. Meaning, they don't exist in the story just to be ace and trans, which I think is what people usually mean by "representation porn".

I was basically thinking of whether this falls before or after the "Steven Universe Line". I can pretty well enjoy /Steven Universe/, but it /does/ sometimes slip into baiting me with a show about aliens who fight monsters and then switching to an emotional drama show... with /contrived/ emotional drama. It was very obviously written to appeal to Tumblr, however much it succeeds by other measures.

From the segment you linked, /Every Heart a Door/ is actually closer to /Harry Potter/ than /Steven Universe/, so yay.
