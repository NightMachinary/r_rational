  [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2s6uf1/thought_experiment_for_the_bored_rationalists_is/cnmq6ge/?context=10][/eh-hem/. Real-world heuristics for instrumental rationality are not /actually/ instrumental rationality. If you find yourself in a universe with Spiral Power, going beyond the impossible and kicking logic to the curb /is the strictly rational move/. You cannot rationalfic Gurren Lagann because there are no errors in reasoning to fix, whatsoever: they're doing the right things the whole time because /their universe really does run on awesomesauce./]]
