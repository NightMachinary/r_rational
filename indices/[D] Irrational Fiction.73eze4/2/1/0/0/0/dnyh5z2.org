I mean, is that a bad thing? I would have loved it either way, but it was a really nice bonus that the main character is asexual like me. Plus the representation integrates well into the story's themes--it's fundamentally about identity and feeling out of place.

I wouldn't even call it representation porn. One character is ace and one character is trans, but that isn't solely what defines them. Meaning, they don't exist in the story just to be ace and trans, which I think is what people usually mean by "representation porn". I don't think you'll be disappointed if you read it--it's pretty short anyway. (It's not like super rationalist or anything though, just well-written and emotionally compelling.)
