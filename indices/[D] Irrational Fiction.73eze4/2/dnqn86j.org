I read a great book once called Every Heart A Doorway (sample excerpt [[https://io9.gizmodo.com/seanan-mcguires-new-book-is-just-so-mindblowingly-good-1768914959][here]]), which is about a boarding school/support structure for young people who've returned to Earth from various fantastical realms. The realms are broadly categorized as points along the spectra of Logic<->Nonsense and Virtue<->Wickedness. Students from "High Nonsense" worlds tend to behave absurdly, and this is explained as basically a residual survival mechanism from their time in those worlds. So I imagine the experience of surviving in a High Nonsense world would be similar to what you've described. There's an upcoming sequel set in one of those worlds, so I guess I'll find out when it comes out.
