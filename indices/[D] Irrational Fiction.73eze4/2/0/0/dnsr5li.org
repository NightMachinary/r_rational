In the book's setting it's more common for girls to pass through doors to other realms in the first place. I remember it positing a couple of possible explanations for this, having to do with the ways girls are socialized/treated differently (e.g., girls might be more likely to feel out of place in the real world; girls might more easily slip away unnoticed). Actually none of the students at this particular boarding school /wanted/ to go home--there's apparently a different school for kids who had a shitty time in their fantasy realms and want to move on with their mundane lives.
