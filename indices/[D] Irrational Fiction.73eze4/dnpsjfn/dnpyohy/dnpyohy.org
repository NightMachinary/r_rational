Very interesting. I do think it qualifies as irrational fiction.

I'm not convinced that it's impossible to figure out meta-rules by figuring out how the rules of physics change, though.

Even if we're using the omniscient GM analogy that deliberately sabotages all attempts to munchkin the rules, rational optimization is still possible, as all rule-changes would be made to achieve some goal. In a tabletop game, the GM optimizes for entertainment of players/own's entertainment/building an interesting narrative. Similarly, this inconsistent universe should be optimizing for something, and the way to victory is figuring out what it is and making sure your goals align.

Even if the universe smites anyone trying to make even those judgements, it's evidently not smiting those who note that it's consistent in its smiting of people who try to study it. As such, rational people could see the corpses of all the other rational people who tried to understand it, and decide to not do that, instead choosing the vague direction of making their lives a satisfying story.
