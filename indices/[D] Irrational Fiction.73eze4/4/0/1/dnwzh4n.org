So I don't actually know about the character this conversation is about, just jumping in because it seems you're having a crisis with a concept I think I can say something meaningful about. I bring this up hoping it will have a positive effect, but with the acknowledgement that what I'm doing may only aggravate, though I justify that you probably have a decent chance of running into this concept in the normal course of life and may already know about it to begin with.

Do you know about [[/r/tulpas][r/tulpas]]? It's essentially the concept of having a different self in your mind. I read enough to think that the phenomenon is real, and while I personally think the most likely explanation for it is purely psychological, it's not inconceivable for it to have a spiritual basis, and I think some of the people in the subreddit do believe whole-heartedly that that train of thought is the correct one and developed their tulpas with spiritual methods. Whether or not you identify your spirits as being similar to tulpas, I think a community of people already versed in communing with non-physical beings might be able to help you or give you good insights if you have your own, uh, headspace issues, so you might want to try talking to them.

The one thing I doubt this will help you with is your former feelings of reassurance from a formerly-believed in higher being. But the people at the tulpas subreddit indicate they have made positive, even constructive relationships with their tulpas, and I think you should start on making something similar first. Who knows, if you manage to accomplish that much, that might just be enough for you to live with.
