Actually, I'm pretty sure I belief in belief in materialism. I think I ought to be an atheist based upon the lack of physical evidence for anything else, but sincerely believe in New Age spiritualism. I'm in denial over the correlation between the sincere performance of my religious rituals and the state of my mental health. When I doubt the validity of my "visions", I feel more despair to the point where I decided having faith is necessary for my personal happiness.
