  Part of me feels like I made a wrong turn in my personal development. I've become as implicitly loyal to epistemic rationality as any religious doctrine, attempting to live up to ideals even when I am psychologically incapable of doing so purely because I was told they were good.

Generally we call them both "rationality" because, in real life, true knowledge and useful action go together.

  Now I don't have confidence in my ability to control myself and the world around me.

Ok. So let's ask: do causal arrows flow from your actions to your self and your life around you?

(I totally feel the existential despair angle on /perceiving/ oneself as having little-to-no affordance, little causal effect on the my-salient stuff of my lifeworld. I guesstimate that it's a major component of the feeling of despair, which is admittedly common sense. But also, I keep getting told not to view myself that way Because Reasons.)

  I already concluded, long ago, that I am not psychologically capable of being an atheist or materialist. I cannot live happily if I reject my dualistic beliefs, I will always feel like I'm living half the life I did before because it all still seems real to me.

Sounds like you're already a materialist, and just believe you believe in dualism and believe strongly that you /ought/ to believe in dualism.

I used to be religious, but ultimately, what kicked me off it wasn't so much /factual evidence/ one way or the other, it was [[https://reasonpapers.com/pdf/28/rp_28_9.pdf][throwing out the fact-value dichotomy]], thus ceasing to ideologically wall-off certain beliefs from evidence on grounds that they were the Values rather than the Facts.

Besides which, I feel like I've got a lot more Spiral Power now that I strictly look for the causal arrows that /make stuff happen/ rather than trying to delegate important parts of the work to Above, so despite me having followed a conventional religion rather than believing in any sense that I could will drills into being, stuff actually feels kinda better.
