Totally; Sasuke sitting on Itachi telling Naruto to get ready for an eye transplant is exactly the sort of thing a rational Itachi would project with the Mangekyo if he knew Naruto needed to drop his shadow clones to be vulnerable.

Heck, for that matter, I just realized that I don't think we've seen a /single/ use of genjutsu so far this whole fic. You'd think Naruto would love the idea of the battle tactics genjutsu use opens up---if not for himself (with his poor chakra control) then at least for Hinata.
