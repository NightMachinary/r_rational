Okay, but in the style of a teenage who would win:

1. Canon Kisame creates his entire water katamari in about 6 seconds including casting time. If Naruto takes more than 6 seconds to syrupify the entire sphere than Kisame can outpace it with water creation. Don't forget Kisame has about 3x as much chakra as canon Naruto. So Kisame either didn't think of it (dumber) or his techniques are slower than Canonisame (weaker), or he doesn't have the chakra to do so (weaker).

2. The chakra eating sword absorbs chakra on contact, and when its part of kisame he does too. If syrup without chakra reverts to water, then why would it impede him at all. It certainly wouldn't survive being drawn into his gills, so he'd be able to breathe. The chakra absorption has a maximum rate, but it works quickly enough to absorb most of a tailed vessel's chakra cloak in half a second, and Naruto's experiment showed that syrup isn't much more chakra dense than elementally created water. Kisame didn't do this here, so either he didn't realise he could (dumber) or he doesn't absorb chakra in the same way (fewer abilities).

3. Canonisame's personality was that he loved to fight in close quarters where he could use his superior strength and endurance. In canon he resorted to the water katamari only when he was pressured in close quarters combat. Fanfic Kisame makes no attempt to employ strategy, and goes straight for the water sphere, even though it would accomplish nothing he wasn't already doing (dumber).

4. Bonus:\\
   I'm not sure why Kisame maintained the shape of the water, instead of letting it flow away so he could escape it. Unless the syrup is very viscous, enough so that it can keep kami knows how many tons of water contained. Maybe chakra syrup really is that thick, so free pass on this one.

I think that this fight is just a demonstration to show that Naruto is awesome and he beats everybody no matter what, which is fine for a fanfic, and I'm enjoying how the techniques are designed to be munchkinable and the narrative of Naruto picking them apart.

*The point:* My point is just that this isn't the single point of departure fanfic I thought it was at first, and rational!Naruto isn't the biggest deviation. I also think it would be more satisfying if the antagonists were, maybe not rational, thinking characters, but at least self interested to some extent.
