You want absurdly overpowered? Here's what they need to learn: [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Chakra_Transfer_Technique][Chakra Transfer Technique]]. In canon, Naruto was able to mold chakra into the recipient's elemental nature for their convenience. It's also possible to pass on nature chakra, so Hinata doesn't have to bother learning Sage Mode.

If they learned that and Naruto expanded his water clone facility, all three of them would have infinite chakra and infinite numbers of clones. And all those clones have a Byakugan and a Sharingan.

I don't know if Hinata knows the Kaiten, but if so there's no reason not to teach it to the boys.
