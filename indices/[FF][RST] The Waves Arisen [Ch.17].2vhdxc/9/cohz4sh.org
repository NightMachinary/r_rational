Hey, [[/u/Wertifloke]], do we get to see some more romantic tension between Naruto and Hinata?

Bonus points if there's dialogue among the lines of "I want to have Naruto inside me" (referring to wanting to keep his eye) and everyone misunderstands.

My only other question is whether the rinnegan works like a Langford basilisk (they exist, the nine-tailed beast effectively behaves like a mind virus), because that's really the only way for this story not to turn into a crackfic or pure power fantasy.

Edit: Actually, whether the nine-tailed beast is a mind virus depends on what happens if Naruto becomes the beast while there are still clonces running around. Strictly speaking it depends on the details of how shadow clones transfer their memories.
