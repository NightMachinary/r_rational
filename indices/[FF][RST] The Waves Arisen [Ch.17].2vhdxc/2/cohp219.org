Kudos to [[/u/kaukamieli]] for guessing that the sharkguy (Kisame Hoshigaki for those wondering) would show up. Nice munchking to see him to die to a syrup technique. Did you introduce the syrup technique with that scene in mind, or simply pick a high utility technique that Naruto would go for and then come up with the usage when you got to the scene?

I was worrying that Sasuke was killed and Itachi was using an illusion technique on Naruto, until I remembered the countless backups clones spanming Byakugan.

Well, they are pretty well min-maxed now, but I guess it will still be interesting given that they will be up against a min-maxed Rinnegan user.
