I remember theorethizing about Narutoverse and their transplantable eyes. My conclusion was that they weren't in any way usual eyes, but special simbiontes. This explained the apparent ease of transplantation. Also, with no way to replace one of your eyes, Hinata-style sacrifice would be much less pleasant to do (in Wavesverse I can see "eye donation" becoming mainstream unless Naruto actually fixes everything).

Also, this fic is awesome.
