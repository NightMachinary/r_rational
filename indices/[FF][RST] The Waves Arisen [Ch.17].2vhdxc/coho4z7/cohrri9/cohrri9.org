Eh, doesn't seem implausible even in our universe. The mangekyo transformation seems like the kind of thing that would cause the a burst of chakra, which, like radiotheraphy, might effectively "sterilize" and then "cauterize" the eye, killing any of the host's immune cells inside it and then preventing any more from entering. The eye would, thus, be incredibly vulnerable to infection, which could lead to complications like retinal detachment or cataracts.

But if the eye were to be transplanted to a host whose DNA was similar enough to /not/ reject it as foreign tissue, then the surgical site would create an entrance for the new host's immune cells to enter the eyeball and protect it from then on. Sort of as if the eye had bones which got a bone-marrow transplant.

This does bring up an obvious issue if we try to apply our world's medical science to the world of Naruto: why didn't Kakashi, or anyone else, experience organ rejection and auto-immune problems upon taking some random eye and sticking it into their body? Can /regular/ eyes also be easily given to random strangers in the Narutoverse?
