Chakra can directly materialize water and earth. Thus we know in-universe that direct matter materialization is possible and easy enough to do it for every Shinobi in the setting. Assuming this is a result of some technological means, that would imply that in-universe materializing matter may be easier than transporting that many comets.

If you have on-demand, on-location, instant and rapid matter materialization, then you probably can also rapidly transport energy. Bootstrapping a dyson swarm around the sun is pretty straightforward then. Build your first few solar satellites via conventional means. Capture enough energy to build your next solar satellite via your matter materialization process. Use ultra lightweight material to save on the power required. From there it is straightforward exponential growth in your number of satellites.

And of course, your matter materialization technology might also have some related technology that allows you to rapidly and directly siphon energy/mass from the sun, making even the solar satellites unnecessary.
