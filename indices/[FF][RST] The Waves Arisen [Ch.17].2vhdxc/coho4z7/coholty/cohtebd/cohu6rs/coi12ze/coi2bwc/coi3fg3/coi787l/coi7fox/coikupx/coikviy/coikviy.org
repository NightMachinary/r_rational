  *Comet Shoemaker--Levy 9* ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_naming_conventions#Comets][formally designated]] *D/1993 F2*) was a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet][comet]] that broke apart and collided with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter][Jupiter]] in July 1994, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System][Solar System]] objects. This generated a large amount of coverage in the popular media, and the comet was closely observed by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy][astronomers]] worldwide. The collision provided new information about Jupiter and highlighted its role in reducing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris][space debris]] in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System#Inner_planets][inner Solar System]].

  The comet was discovered by astronomers [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolyn_S._Shoemaker][Carolyn]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Merle_Shoemaker][Eugene M. Shoemaker]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_H._Levy][David Levy]]. Shoemaker--Levy 9, at the time captured by and orbiting Jupiter, was located on the night of March 24, 1993, in a photograph taken with the 40 cm (16 in) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmidt_camera][Schmidt telescope]] at the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palomar_Observatory][Palomar Observatory]] in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California][California]]. It was the first comet observed to be orbiting a planet, and had probably been captured by the planet around 20 -- 30 years earlier.

  Calculations showed that its unusual fragmented form was due to a previous closer approach to Jupiter in July 1992. At that time, the orbit of Shoemaker--Levy 9 passed within Jupiter's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit][Roche limit]], and Jupiter's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force][tidal forces]] had acted to pull apart the comet. The comet was later observed as a series of fragments ranging up to 2 km (1.2 mi) in diameter. These fragments collided with Jupiter's southern hemisphere between July 16 and July 22, 1994, at a speed of approximately 60 km/s (37 mi/s) or 216,000 km/h (134,000 mph). The prominent scars from the impacts were more easily visible than the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Red_Spot][Great Red Spot]] and persisted for many months.
