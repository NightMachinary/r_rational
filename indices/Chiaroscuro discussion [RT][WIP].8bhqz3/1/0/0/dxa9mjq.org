Caught me at the perfect time. I just logged on.

- Yes, Shikamaru's dad rediscovered the Will Manifestation technique.

- Canonically White Zetsus die when take enough damage (what Kakashi and Ino did) or get told to abort by Kaguya-as-Black-Zetsu (what Shikamaru did).

- Kakashi's arms are still screwed up, but keep in mind, Tsunade has Hinata helping her now. Plus, unlike canon, Hidan wasn't buried in an explosion pit, which means Konoha Medical Research has his magically healing corpse.

- They're just about end of 13, close to 14.

- I'm not sure exactly what you're asking here? Keep in mind Ao has a Byakugan so he can stalk anyone from kilometers away without getting caught. He observed the fight against Hidan and Kakuzu. Unless you mean the Wave mission, where Ao tricked Orochimaru's subordinates into being his subordinates.

- Yep, he's gone. The Shinigami has him now.

- Temari and the other Kage will be making an appearance soon.

- Itachi is not the same as canon; he's his own side. His interests currently align with Konoha because of Sasuke and the eye plan thing. Which isn't really working because Sasuke's having way more fun partying with Jiraiya.
