  Black Zetsu. Was it created by a Nara ancestor? What happened to the Shikamary shadows during training? Did his father destroy them or did they escape? How did his shadow kill white Zetsus?
#+end_quote

No it wasn't, it was created by Kaguya using a jutsu. Shikamaru's dad just reinvented it based on their own clan techniques. He shadow during training realized that it was possible to do this, but it was incredibly stressful/damaging, I messaged the author and he said it was essentially like staying up all night, you /can/ do it, but it's not something you'd want to do, and Shika represses the memory because reintegrating two divergent minds is really fucking crazy.

#+end_quote

Errr, the same way that black zetsu can control white zetsus black shikamaru (not racist) told them to kill themselves, I think.

  Does Shika father know about Black Zetsu?
#+end_quote

Not explitcitly, but he knows that someone created that jutsu before and Shikamaru had to fight it (Shikamaru mentioned this to his dad after the battle.)

  What was the situation with Kakashi chakra? Isn't it time for it to come back?
#+end_quote

The time for the chakra blocks to come off is almost here, but we still don't know how complete the damage was, or how much it can recover now.

  True mist ninja (AO) mentioned that one of his subordinates got killed during Kakashi teleportation. I don't remember that happening.
#+end_quote

...... Yeah, neither do I, that's pretty crazy, can you quote the line/chapter?

  Is Orochimaru dead?
#+end_quote

Yes, permanently, and after what the guardian of hell said, he's probably getting tortured for shits and giggles by the shinigami for messing around with life and death.

MAITO-GUY, HERO OF THE LEAF! KILLER OF MADARA UCHIHA! SAVIOR OF KONOHA!

  What the fuck is Itachi plan? Spy on Akatsuki?
#+end_quote

Yep, for Konoho, that and get Sasuke to kill him to awaken his mangykyo, then have Sasuke take /his/ eyes to awaken the eternal mangykyo

This was fun, there aren't enough discussions around this.
