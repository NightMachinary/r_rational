  I'm not sure exactly what you're asking here? Keep in mind Ao has a Byakugan so he can stalk anyone from kilometers away without getting caught. He observed the fight against Hidan and Kakuzu. Unless you mean the Wave mission, where Ao tricked Orochimaru's subordinates into being his subordinates.

Thanks for clarifications! And toads are better then dogs.
