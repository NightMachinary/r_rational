I think it's pretty obvious that there is an N+1 player on the field. Maybe even multiple. As I consider myself as intelligent as Naruto in this story, I find myself unable to even begin to discern what everyone's true goals are.

Hell, Im having a hard time figuring on what's going on between Danzo, Shikaku, and the Third.

What I really love about the story is how Mist got led to believe someyhing completely false, but came to it in a totally rational way. Often times I'll read a bunch of rationalistic fiction and everyone in it come to true observations always. It's so nice to see someone come to a false conclusion, be able to trace how they got there, and be unable to argue against it.
