I feel weird about Patreon for various reasons. If I did rewrite it, I'd do it after finishing Pyrebound sometime next year (and then publishing the edited version of PB as a print book with supplements). I am not a very productive writer, in terms of word count per day, and I have a lot of stuff going on in my non-author life.
