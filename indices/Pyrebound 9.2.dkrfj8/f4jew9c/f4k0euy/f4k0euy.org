I'd say it's pretty good and fairly interesting. It feels very unique, worldbuilding wise. None of the characters are rationalists or anything like that, but everyone acts according to their own wants and needs, even those are sometimes opaque.

The main character is a young man thrown in over his head, so he doesn't always make optimal choices, but they do feel like authentic choices. I'd say read it, maybe the first 3-4 chapters, and see how you like it.
