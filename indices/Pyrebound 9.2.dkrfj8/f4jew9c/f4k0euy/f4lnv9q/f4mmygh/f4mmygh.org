The worldbuilding is extremely unique, fun, and generally high quality.

The writing is good, not literary fiction but it doesn't hold the book back. The characters are interesting, the dialogue is pretty solid, and the description is too.

The plot is also very fun, jetting us across the map as the readers get to explore the varied and lush setting.

I don't think the story is likely to rival PGTE or MoL quite yet but I am definitely a regular reader and very interested in any other work the author does. I find it very promising and hope the author continues his work.

The author Brayton Cole has independently published a book called "The Curse of Life".

  In my case, it took me ten years and two thousand pages before I had a novel I was satisfied with.

  The setting came from C.S. Lewis's "Out of the Silent Planet." I liked the bizarre topography of his Mars, but by populating it with sinless beings he missed out on all the weird geopolitical implications.

  The curse of life itself came from a meditation on the way fantasy tropes get repackaged as sci-fi--orcs to Klingons, distant realms to exotic planets, et cetera. It occurred to me that magic is always . . . still just magic, basically, but renamed as "ESP" or "psionics" or some such. I challenged myself to come up with a sciencey-sounding form of magic, then chased the implications. It went from there.

I might pick it up. [[/u/RedSheepCole]] do you have any other fiction I can read?
