Oops, I've been outed! Not that I was trying to hide it, exactly. TCoL is something I feel conflicted about. I don't think it's bad, per se, but I kinda rushed it because I was impatient to finally get something published. I'd made up my mind to write it in epistolary format, even though that format is stunningly ill-suited for exposition (which a fantasy/sci-fi author has to do a lot of). I discovered halfway through that I was having to make a lot of suboptimal storytelling choices to accommodate the format, but I was too proud and stubborn to go back and rewrite it.

What came out was a story set in a world every bit as inventive as Pyrebound's, and with a certain charm (it's told from three perspectives, each of which brings something different to the table), but extremely hard to follow. Some people enjoy it anyway, and I won't unpublish it, but I don't think it's my best work so I don't go out of my way to flog it.

There's more story to tell there, and I'd like to go back and do it right someday (with a less corny title, to boot). Maybe as a serial. I'll have to wait until I've got a better feel for how I want to tell it. It'll be a very different story when I do. For now, the e-book is free to read for anybody with Amazon Prime, so feel free to check it out that way.

To finally answer your question: not really. TCOL came out in 2017, and every prior project was a bit of a fizzle.
