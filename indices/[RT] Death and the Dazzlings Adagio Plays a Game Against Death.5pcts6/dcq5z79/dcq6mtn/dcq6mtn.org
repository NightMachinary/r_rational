If anyone wants another /My Little Pony/ story about meeting with Death, how about [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/225100/1/long-live-sonata-dusk/long-live-sonata-dusk][Long Live Sonata Dusk]]? It's not necessarily rational (which is why it's not in it's own post), but the subversion at the end is just so clever, I feel compelled to share the story. It's a similar premise where Sonata meets with Death, but with different "rules".
