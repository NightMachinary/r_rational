>! An ancient civilization might choose to surround the tunnel into their dump site with the most dangerous, longest-lasting stuff they have access to. If someone is stupid enough to ignore the fact that everyone who discovered the site previously sealed it up the way they found it and then copied the warnings into every language they know (implying that people who didn't know why the thing was built rapidly learned), they probably won't be stupid enough to ignore their people dying horribly before they even get to the actual dump. !<

So you weaponize the tunnel itself against invaders. I predict that the stone of the tunnel is made of some highly radioactive material specifically designed to last way, way longer than any of the actual waste in the site. They made the tunnel tens of miles long both to make it easy to truck material in and so when they closed the site and put up the kill aura panelling, it would have enough time to work on people even right up to the time the rest of it became safe. This becomes part of the warning: the immediate fulfillment of the curse at the entrance, which terrifies any interloper enough to do as the builders wanted them to do from the beginning.

Leave and never return. !<
