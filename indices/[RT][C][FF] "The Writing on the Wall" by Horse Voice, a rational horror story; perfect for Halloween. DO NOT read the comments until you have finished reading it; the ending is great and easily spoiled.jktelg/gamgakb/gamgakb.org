I would rather not interpret this as being about radioactive waste, even if that might be what the author says (?). The story would be far more compelling and horrific if it is literally some kind of spreadable magical fire, or maybe nanotech gone awry.

Containment breach on 71,000 year old radioactive waste just isn't that scary, especially if it is "safe" at 100,000 -- with exponential decay the danger is already almost completely gone in that case, proportionately, and if it's the kind of dump than humanity is making, at that point the main risk would be, like, heavy metal poisoning if it got in the water.

This shouldn't even be something that decays exponentially... unless there was somehow originally SO MUCH that it could destroy the entire world as a single point, so now there would only be enough to destroy something like 1/100th of the world, and the threshold of "safe" was that it only destroy 1/10,000th of the world. idk. But then, most of the world would still be shielded from the beginning by, well, the world.

Ultimately, I don't think it matters much what it is, so long as it's something scarier than radiation. Honestly, better it be something nameless. Something that actually breaks after 100,000 years. The story does a really good job of setting up this atmosphere of ancient horror, so saying it's radiation kind of spoils it. I think it is fine to take inspiration from humanity's radiation containment so long as that isn't actually what is contained here.
