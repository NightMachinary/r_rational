One thing that bugs me about this.

The site references that it will be safe after 100,000 years. By which, I would have to guess that it means the material within would be safe to handle by that point.

You don't pick a number like "100,000" because it's an accurate representation of how much time it will take, but rather because 10^{5} is an easy number to express and communicate, and in the right approximate order of magnitude. At the same time, people will take that reassurance literally, so you don't want to guess low: the actual safe number is probably somewhere in the order of magnitude below that (10,000-100,000). Maybe a number higher within that order of magnitude, but certainly not accurate to within 5,000 years.

My point is that 71,000 years into a 100,000 year (at most, possibly significantly less) waiting period of exponential decay, you should be /almost there./ If 10% is still there after 50,000 years, then 1% will still be there after 100,000 years, and that's still far too much, so the decay rate must be much faster than that. Let's say they chose a period that would leave roughly 1 ppm of the original radioactive substance after 100,000 years: after 71,000 years, >99.99% of the dangerous material would already have to be gone.

Which is to say, if, after 71,000 years of radioactive decay, this stuff is still killing people who just spend a few hours in the hallways surrounding the storage chambers, there's no way that it would be safe to handle after 100,000 years.
