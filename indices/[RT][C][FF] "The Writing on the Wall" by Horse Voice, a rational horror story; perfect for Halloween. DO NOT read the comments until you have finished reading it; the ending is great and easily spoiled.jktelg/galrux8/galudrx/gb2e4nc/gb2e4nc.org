This is all true I feel, assuming that radioactive decay occurs the same way in a world of magic ponies as it does in our reality. It's the Author's choice for the sake of the story by the author, such that by the end of the story the symptoms are obvious and horrific. Maybe the Idea that it's 'nearly safe' (the characters admit it is not within their civilisations lifetime) adds something to the story?\\
Still, a lot of these assumptions seem reasonable. Realism could be better represented by increasing the exposure time of the afflicted characters, or showing that the radioactive material had been moved closer to the surface by previous expeditions, or as above, setting the story earlier into the decay.
