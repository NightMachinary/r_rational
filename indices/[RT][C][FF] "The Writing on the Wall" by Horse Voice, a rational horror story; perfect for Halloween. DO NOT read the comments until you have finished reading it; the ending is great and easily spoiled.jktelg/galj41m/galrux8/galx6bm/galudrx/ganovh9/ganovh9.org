  Which is to say, if, after 71,000 years of radioactive decay, this stuff is still killing people who just spend a few hours in the hallways surrounding the storage chambers, there's no way that it would be safe to handle after 100,000 years.

Maybe at t = 0, the lethal dose was much less than few hours and the decay is fast enough that after 71,000 years, you're "almost there," but few hours is still enough to get a lethal dose.

(But I have no idea if it wouldn't have melted whatever it was stored in if it was that radioactive at the beginning.)
