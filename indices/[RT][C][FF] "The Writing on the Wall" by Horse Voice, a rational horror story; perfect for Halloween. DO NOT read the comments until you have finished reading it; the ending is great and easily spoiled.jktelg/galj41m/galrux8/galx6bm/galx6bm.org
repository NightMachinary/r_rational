A mitigating factor is that it's clearly not stored properly any more - previous expeditions have broken into the site and attempted to remove the material starting 26000 years in.

The nightmare scenario - IRL too - is that all the warnings attract attention and then convince someone to try using it as a weapon... better to bury the stuff deep next to a subduction zone IMO. (But that wouldn't help with cold war sentiment, so.)
