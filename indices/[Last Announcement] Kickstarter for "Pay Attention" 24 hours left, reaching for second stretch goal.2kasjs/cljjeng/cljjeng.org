Well, I chipped in $5. Wish I could give more. I started out really disliking the writing in Two Year Emperor, but after the 7th or 8th chapter either you improved drastically or I got into the swing of it. Now you rank pretty highly on my author quality lists.

Anyone with a lot of disposable income want to add a few thousand words to the story? I know I'd really appreciate it.
