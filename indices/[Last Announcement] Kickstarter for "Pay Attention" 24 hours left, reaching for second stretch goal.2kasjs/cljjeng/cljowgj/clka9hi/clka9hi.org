I just looked back on the chapters, and I think it was the density of references and "4-th wall" breaking. The main character just wasn't taking the story even a little bit seriously, so neither could I. Of course those things aren't bad at all, and honestly they're a big part of what makes 2YE so entertaining, but at the very beginning it seemed like that's all there was. Just some random guy talking about D&D and programming and fan fiction with a backdrop of OOTS except without emotional investment.

Then you started adding characters and plot and historical background and the rest of the things required for a actual story.

Honestly I think it comes down to me having read so much stuff with a premise similar to OOTS, Erfworld, 2YE, even Natural 20. I've just gotten slightly sick of the start all of these kinds of stories have, I have to push through to whatever part is done uniquely.
