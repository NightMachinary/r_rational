i should probably read the chapter again, but when i read it i got the impression that the dead angel is the bard, because just like a angel she can't die, but being a fallen angel she's judgement without a choir.

but yea i'll reread it to see how wrong i was.

although the timeline don't even add up for that to be the case.
