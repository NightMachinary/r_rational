Cordelia dredged up some hidden superweapon. Theory was that it was an angel's not-a-corpse (because angels can't actually "die," but they can defeated/sealed/transformed, etc.), which turned out to be the case - it was an angel of the Choir of Judgment. The angel's corpse was turned into a sword, one strong enough to hurt or kill the Dead King. But... Now Judgment is busy with a stalemate with Hierarch, which begs the question whether the angel sword still actually has the power of Judgment...
