As I understood it, actively against only the ones who would disrupt Creation.

Sve Noc is self contained and must be wielded from a sort of living domain, but we also don't know that the Bard isn't actively plotting their demise or if it's just too late to affect them.

Also, I don't recall what role the Bard played with Sve Noc that would constitute them being led down a road. Was there something specific you saw besides abstaining from interference, if she even had footing through the privacy of their isolation within the Gloom?
