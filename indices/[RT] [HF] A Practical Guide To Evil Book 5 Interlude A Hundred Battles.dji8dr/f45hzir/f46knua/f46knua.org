EE's writing style has been trending towards being more verbose. In this chapter, it's mainly Kairos being overly dramatic in his monologue. In others, Cat's been getting introspective since her several brushes with death, and likes to examine her actions from all possible angles. She's also a lot more eloquent than she was a year ago. So it does make for chapters that are wordier than before.
