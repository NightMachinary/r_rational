The Bard really just wants to kill the Dead King? I'm a little disappointed, but a conflict with the Gods would probably be out of the scope of the story.

  “Your coalition does not scare the King of Death,” Kairos told her, not unkindly, “your petty assembly of armies and treaties which you so wastefully wring your hands over. He fears only one thing in all the world, and I have torn through the perilous nets she wove against him.”

Suggesting that when the Bard told Cat that the Dead King was attacking because he had been cornered by the passing of time, it was to give her false confidence. Might've been for a good goal though, trading horses, using Cat's coalition to kill the Dead King...except that she was really upset when the Augur disrupted her plans.

Or I'm just reading too much into it. She did try to kill Cat in the same meeting, maybe tying up loose ends.

Edit: I saw a comment saying that the Hierarch died to keep the stalemate going on for eternity. Which makes perfect sense, and is awesome.
