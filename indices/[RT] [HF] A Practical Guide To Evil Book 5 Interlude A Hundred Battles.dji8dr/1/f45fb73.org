I'm tickled to imagine the Hierarch forcing himself into the Choir of Judgement and claiming a seat between the Angels, constantly giving a dissenting opinion to every Judgement. I'm not sure if that's actually what happened, but I hope that it was. All of the White Knight's coins will just land edgewise from now on.
