Well... shit. People seem to be thinking the Hierarch has joined the Choir of Judgment, but I get the impression more that he's locked them in an unwinnable stalemate a la Zelda vs. Calamity Ganon or Oma Desala vs. Anubis. Is there a name for this kind of thing?

Thus, Hanno will wake up, realize he's out of touch with the Choir and that they won't be casting Judgement on anyone anytime soon, least of all the Dead King. Raises the question, though, of whether his plan to disarm them in the first place was any good.

I mean, sure, now we're uncertain whether the Judgment Angel Not-Corpse would be an effective weapon against him, but wouldn't that be the case even if his plan had clearly succeeded and Judgment was confirmed to be out of commission? Doesn't that just leave the Not-Corpse itself as an unreliable superweapon? And ... a band of heroes counting on a superweapon to take down the Big Bad Evil Guy only to have it fail on them in the final confrontation sure does sound like a recipe for a heroic takedown with an Aesop about relying on your own inner strength.
