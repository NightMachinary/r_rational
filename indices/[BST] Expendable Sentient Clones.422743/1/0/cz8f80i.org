This is basically what I was thinking. It's like a time machine, only backwards... and without memory transference. If memories were merged back into the original, you could save up some clone time over the summer so that you could take twice as many classes in the fall. You wouldn't necessarily be "doubling your learning power", since you've given up an entire summer of experience for the chance.

In fact, without memory merging, you're shortening your lifespan by the amount of time you clone. I'm suddenly struck by the image of a child savant who starts banking time at the age of five, and winds up a physical adult who has only matured by a few years. And not even that, since apparently all his waking hours would be spent eating and sleeping and not doing the normal child things that result in emotional growth...

If this is a modern Earth-style setting, you just know there are teenagers who would trance themselves straight through to the legal drinking age unless their parents and peers put down some very strong incentives against it.
