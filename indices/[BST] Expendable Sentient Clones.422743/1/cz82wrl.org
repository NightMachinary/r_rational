I'll try looking at this from the other direction. What can you do with an at-will coma, that has very useful effects?

Are you just sitting in a carriage, waiting to arrive? Make clones! You have soldiers hired, but no war right now? Have them make clones! You work in a seasonal job? 8 months of clones, and 4 months of tripled work! Rainy day? Clones!

You basically have the ability to send labor forwards in time. Choose the most useless times to send "from", so that you have enough for when you really need it.
