The risks were so great that it looks ridiculous that enough people would try it for someone to succeed.

It's not like you can try again if, and when you fail.

One way I could understand, is if someone did human experimentation on this. Got some slaves or whatnot and did the procedure on them, until they didn't get mad.

You'd have to be very powerful to do that I guess, and be able to either kill the subject afterwards or teleport it far enough to not matter.
