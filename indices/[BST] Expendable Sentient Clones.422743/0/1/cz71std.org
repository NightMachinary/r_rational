1. No. You cannot use it as a sleep replacement. It does not reduce metabolic costs or oxygen needs any more than lying very still would, either... which is actually pretty good, if you're looking for a way to pass the time.

2. The magic item must be light enough to hold in your hand and large enough to see. You could use grains of dust, if you wanted to risk losing your clones. You could use a ring, spoon, pot, shovel, or chainsaw, possibly a car wheel, but not an engine block or anything larger.

3. Depends. It gets easier with training, and you can enter a trance that cuts off perception of everything but the magic item to make it even easier. It needs to be done one at a time, so as long as it takes to focus on something and flex a particular mental muscle. Think of it like firing a bow. There's actually an entire school of magic focused around this called invocation, which includes such things as conversing telekinetically with liches and preventing liches from manifesting on their own.

4. Yes, until it disappears. This would be a bad idea, for reasons you can probably guess.

5. Naked. No non-biological materials included.

This is the full system. Any contradictions are a result of me changing my mind by accident: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/magicbuilding/comments/41vw08/cuttings_branches_graces_and_ghouls_cloning_is/]]
