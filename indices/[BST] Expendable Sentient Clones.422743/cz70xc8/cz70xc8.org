Fun!

The first order of business would be crafting a sort of personality and worldview where you would be inclined to help yourself. You'd want your clones to be willing to use every ounce of their lifespan to fulfilling your joint goals, rather than just sitting there and crying about their imminent death.

So once that's out of the way, and you have a mindset that allows you to believe in a unity of identity and purpose, you'd want to stock up on a variety of clones. Having twenty or so five-minute clones means that you can win most fights that last less than five minutes, at least if you're fighting against someone who doesn't have their own stock of clones. That's only 100 minutes of coma.

There's a decreased marginal utility on clone time. Ideally, you make the clones when you're well-fed and well rested, which would allow you to have a clone that keeps going until just before it would get sleepy. If your clone has to sleep, that's wasted time. I can't really think of many applications that you'd need a longer-lived clone either, at least not ones that are efficient.

Questions:

- Is the coma restful?
- How large is the magic item?
- How hard is the magic item to activate?
- Is the clone physical? Can you eat the clone?
- Do clones come in naked or clothed?
