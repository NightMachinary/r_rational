Thank you for the criticism! It doesn't really matter if somebody has written narrative fiction, you can still point out flaws in something, being able to write allows one to sympathize, but isn't necessary to be able to point out flaws.

I think the excessive subtext is a result of reading bad writing where characters didn't both hiding anything from the reader/other characeters and the result was no drama.

There's a certain 'rush' that I feel to get to the meat of the story, and this is what some other writers suffer from too. I have to keep in mind that I can always spread info in later chapters.

I reckon that a lot of what the main character is implying is stuff that he and other people already know in the world. For example, in our world, we don't think about getting into a car and describe every last thing we do, we sorta glaze over it? Not sure how to phrase it? But stating some things outright would help cement the story and the world.

There's a picture of me in the Geneva Conventions underneath the title, "Comma and Period Atrocities." It's an issue one of my professors pointed out too, lots of run ons and just long winded sentences---complex sentences, too many, you know, just awful; one of my long-running weaknesses in writing in general.

I'll keep this in mind, thank you. The general hope is with the amount of time I'm spending writing along with criticism from readers, I'll become a better writer. There's several other stories I've been dying to put into text, but my lack of skill and work ethic is deterring.
