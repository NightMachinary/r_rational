It's a dark fantasy, the protagonist gets stuck with a morally reprehensible sorceress and the two clash over their different agendas.

I'm a pretty slow writer with only 600 words an hour, an hour a day (probably more if I don't get distracted with college), with updates every Sunday.

I recommend sidelining it for now until I gain some momentum since it's rather dry right now.

If you are looking for a good read, allow me to direct you to, WORM or Pact by Wildbow. Practical Guide to Evil, The Gods are Bastards, Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, Overlord (which can be found on skythewood's blog, and vol's 10-13 someplace else, I think [[/r/overlord][r/overlord]] has got the links)
