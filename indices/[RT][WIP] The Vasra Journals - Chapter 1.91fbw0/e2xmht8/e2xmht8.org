I would love to receive some feed back since this is the first time I've ever published something online and my confidense of a writer is that of a cat scruyying away from a vacuum machine. Having read WORM, Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, Pracitcal Guide to Evil... I've gotten tired of waiting for my favorite stories to churn out a new chapter, so, having been inspired by these titans of the underworld in literature, I decided to start my own story which I hope that people will enjoy (and find rational).
