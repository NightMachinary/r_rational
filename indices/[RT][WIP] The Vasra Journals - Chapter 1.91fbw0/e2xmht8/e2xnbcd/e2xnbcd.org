Alright; brackets, parenthesis, whatever you want to call them, use them '-' is not a substitute, it is vary jarring to leave the context of the sentence entirely like that, and brackets help. Otherwise it seems like an interesting read, even if I just skimmed the beginning and end, I'll try it some more once you have more available.
