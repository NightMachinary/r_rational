Edit and sleep on it before posting, I suppose is the lesson.

I think, the most important part of writing is that you have to keep writing everyday and make a habit of it, even if it's not good. Otherwise, you won't have anything at all. I encourage you to post, the idea that people, someday might take a liking to our stories and bother us about the next update, is a fantastic extrinstic motivator. Of course there's the stress of it, but hey, nothing beats stress harder than alchol!
