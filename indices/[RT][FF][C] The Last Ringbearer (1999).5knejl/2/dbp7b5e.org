When I read /The Last Ringbearer/ a few years ago, I was very strongly reminded of my experiences with Project Gutenberg's translations of /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1257][The Three Musketeers]]/ and of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Artagnan_Romances][that book's several later sequels]] (collectively titled /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2609][The Vicomte de Bragelonne]]/, but usually split into several parts). /The Three Musketeers/ consists primarily of action, while /The Vicomte de Bragelonne/ focuses significantly more on court intrigue.

I found /The Vicomte de Bragelonne/ to be rather boring (in comparison to /The Three Musketeers/, at the very least)--but how much of that was due to the slow story, and how much was due to the poor translation? Likewise, I found /The Last Ringbearer/ to be /extremely/ boring (IIRC), and completed it only on my second or third attempt (IIRC). Was that the fault of the author or the fault of the translator?
