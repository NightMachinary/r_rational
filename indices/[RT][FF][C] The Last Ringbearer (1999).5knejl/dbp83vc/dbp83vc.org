I remember reading about 40% of it and not liking it very much, partially because it turned into a spy thriller, and I'm not really interested in spy thrillers, partially because it was advertised as (and maybe intended by the author to be) something smarter and more mature, maybe even /better/ than lotr and that... made it all the more unpleasant when it turned out to be kind of meh. I wasn't a fan. It's not even that Tolkien is all that sacred to me, but I still felt bad for him.
