Plan C: Just go up fast ENOUGH.

Blow through the roof. Get enough velocity that even if the kryptonite depowers you, it won't have TIME to do so before you're clear of the physical obstruction. You can be weak as you sail high sunward through the air. Then once you have your distance from any traces of kryptonite, you can fly again. The idea is going fast enough to limit your exposure so it can't weaken you enough to interfere. If you're feeling generous, use superbreath downwards to counter the negative pressure and heat of takeoff and impact to save Mercy and Lex.
