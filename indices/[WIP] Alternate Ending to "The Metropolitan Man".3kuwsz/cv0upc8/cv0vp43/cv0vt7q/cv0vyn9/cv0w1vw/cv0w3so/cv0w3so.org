I think we can all agree that Superman, with his time dilation aided thinking, has more than enough time and means to come up with a way to save himself. He just simply didn't plan for the kryptonite studded walls. He was arrogant (justifiably so, in my opinion) and it was only Lex's extreme over preparedness that saved him.
