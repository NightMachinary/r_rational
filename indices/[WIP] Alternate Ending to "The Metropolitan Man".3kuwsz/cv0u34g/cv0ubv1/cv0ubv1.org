I think you are right, Superman does view the world through a sort of childish lens. However, I noticed in Metropolitan Man, Superman did seem to catch on to the "game" Lex was playing. Superman became more rational as he also grew less good. I thought the ending in the canon story was a bit unfair - [[#s][]] The canon story itself admits Lex had slim odds, and lampshades the deus ex machina conclusion.
