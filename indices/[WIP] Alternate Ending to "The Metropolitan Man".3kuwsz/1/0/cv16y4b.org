Wow that was really good. I thought that Superman acted that way because it was the first time he was vulnerable so the fear and shock overrode all his higher functions.

I still find it a bit hard he could analyze three days worth of information in seconds and not find a way to beat that challenge but at least it gets close. I like the way you phrased your story.
