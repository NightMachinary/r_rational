I'm not sure it is fair to say that Superman was holding the idiot ball there.

[[#s][Spoilers Metropolitan Man]]

More importantly, [[#s][Spoilers for the rewrite]]

Could Superman have been smarter? Sure. But that's not enough for him to hold the idiot ball. He was acting in character, and he took a reasonable course of action given his options.

Nevertheless, an interesting rewrite. Thanks for sharing it!
