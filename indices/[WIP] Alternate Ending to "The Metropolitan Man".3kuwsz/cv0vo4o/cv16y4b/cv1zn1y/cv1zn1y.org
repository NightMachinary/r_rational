Well, from what I interpreted, it wasn't so much that he couldn't "beat" the challenge. It was more that he didn't identify just how many layers to the challenge there were. The challenge he perceived was "Get away from here right now without harming these frail humans" whereas it was actually "Get away from here right now without harming these frail humans AND avoiding the kryptonite studded walls." Simply put, Superman wasn't paranoid enough. Which is almost understandable, as Superman doesn't face any real challenge, in regards to physical, visceral damage, which is what this threat to his life was. Even with the advanced caution he entered with, I can easily accept that his danger sense wasn't calibrated enough, as an invulnerable alien being.
