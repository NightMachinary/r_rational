Partly humility, partly because I wasn't sure whether there was any interest. This [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2zakjx/spoilers_all_a_crackslash_epilogue/][was posted to /r/hpmor some months ago as a self-post]], and I figured most people had seen it by now. I've lately been trying to gather together a lot of bits of things that I've written into some kind of centrally organized way. That means putting things on ff.net or on [[http://www.alexanderwales.com][my website]]. I don't really intend to post everything from this cleanup process here, even if some of it is intended for this audience, or was initially posted here. There are a lot of things that were posted somewhere and then forgotten about, either as a Google Docs link or a reddit comment. So me putting this on ff.net is just the first part of a spring cleaning of sorts.

([[http://www.reddit.com/r/alexanderwales/comments/36o0mm/stuff_thats_not_on_my_website_fictionpress_or/][You can find my working list of that stuff here,]] though some of it needs editing before I can post it in a more formal way.)

(Work right now is web development, which means frequent reddit breaks. This message brought to you by one of those breaks!)
