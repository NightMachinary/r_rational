Hm, looks promising. A few things:

Interruptions and parentheticals are done with em-dashes (---, alt-code =0151=) instead of regular hyphens (-). For example, the following passage

#+begin_quote
  falling and falling and standing back up-it all led up to this moment.
#+end_quote

takes extra effort to read because it's not initially clear that "up-it" is not a compound word in this case.

Secondly, I felt like a few lines there felt too abrupt, so to speak. I'm having hard time pinpointing just what feels off, but the last few lines of both Qrow's and Adam's intros feel blocky. I think both could use some extra description of just how the things happen.

Also, how was Qrow unaware of her niece's eye color? Even if there is a difference between silver eyes and Silver Eyes, it seems like something that he would've been expecting for a long time now. On that note, Qrow has two nieces. Just ignoring Yang entirely feels weird[[https://i.imgur.com/sakSGqO.jpg][.]]
