Interesting start; been on a RWBY fan fiction kick myself for the past few weeks, mostly with stuff from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6272865/Coeur-Al-Aran][Coeur Al'Aran]]. Looking forward to seeing how this goes, especially if it's striving to be rational.

Incidentally, the direct link in the title does not work for me (I think because it's missing the www in the address). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12466638/1/Broken-Blades][Here's where I found the fic]].
