I second Qrow forgetting Yang is also his niece (even if he's closer to Ruby) and the abruptness of the last line. It gave me a feeling of whiplash to see Qrow's mood to swing so hard so fast and then the chapter just ends all of a sudden. Another flub stood out to me, though.

  Qrow's shoulders slumped, tension leaving his whole body.

  "So she's still there, at least. Has she woken?"

  "Not yet. We'll do what we can."

  "Understood. Now, the other piece of news is about your niece, Summer's daughter"

The first line of dialogue must be spoken by Qrow since Ozpin is the one taking care of Amber and the second is Oz responding, so the third line seems like Qrow speaking to Oz. Except the last line is clearly meant to be Oz speaking to Qrow, which contradicts the progression of the conversation. It's an easily fixable problem, but it really stood out to me.

Other than that, this is a pretty solid, if short, opening. I would've preferred a bit more detailed descriptions to compensate for the lack of visual and auditory storytelling, but it worked fine as is. The action scenes actually benefitted from the brief narration since it makes them feel as fast as they do in the show.

As for what you say is in store for the future, I'm not exactly sure how Cinder's plan didn't make sense. Her dialogue indicated that she altered it as new information came to light so Penny and Pyrrah weren't always going to be the key players she manipulated, she just saw a way that she could exploit them.

The way she went about infiltrating Beacon, rigging the tournament, and causing a panic during the penultimate match seemed straightforward enough. I don't know how she managed to hack into the tournament without anyone noticing, but the plan seemed to make sense based on what we knew at the time.
