Thanks for the formatting advice--I'll be sure to check dashes next time. Adam's intro sort of had to cut off where it did to avoid an M rating. Gratuitous civilian murder and such. Thanks for the criticism though! As for the eyes: weird, isn't it, that Qrow didn't know ruby's eye color? I can't explain it for...two arcs, though. Suffice it to say there is a reason.
