There's things left to be explored. The dealing with Zachs caretaker is already hinted including assassinations, so it could be a nice first arc. Plus fixing Zorians family would take a while (though both of these might get wrapped up in the last chapter)

The royal family could be enemies. They should have at least a couple on xvim / alenics level, plus a whole army Zorian is still afraid of. I'm actually disappointed we never got to meet a prince or princess.

There's the immortal 11. Some of them could be antagonists. I also think they discussed that the previous sovereign gate users might still be alive, possibly one of the 11?

Damien could launch an expedition to the dragon isles, I doubt they got much stronger in a combat sense the last reset, and they were afraid of the dragons then so they should still be a challenge there. Plus there's a whole hinting at "Atlantis" existing ([[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/05/01/continents-overview/#respond]]) and other expeditions they could go on, meeting new and powerful people. Zach sounds like a guy who would like to investigate the bottom of the dungeon.

Endgame could be an invasion from the demon dimension, or maybe Zach and Zorian "invading" the celestial plane.

Maybe Mol2 wouldn't be as long as Mol1, but it doesn't have to be.

Some problems include there's really not that much more to learn, so powerlevels can't grow much (which might be boring. Or maybe not, I don't mind really).
