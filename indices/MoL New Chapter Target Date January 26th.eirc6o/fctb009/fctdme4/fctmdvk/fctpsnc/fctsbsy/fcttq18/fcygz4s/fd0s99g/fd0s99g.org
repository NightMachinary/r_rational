But consider: sequel POV character is Kirielle

We would still get to see what becomes of Z&Z, but the antagonists can reset to small scale and the conflict can shift to Kirielle's attitude towards her two famous/powerful brothers (Fortov doesn't count here) and if she can ride their coattails or one up their achievements.
