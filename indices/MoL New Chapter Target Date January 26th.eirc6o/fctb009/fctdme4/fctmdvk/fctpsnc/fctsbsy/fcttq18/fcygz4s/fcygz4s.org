The Big Problem MoL2 would have to face is that MoL already pretty thoroughly explored its world, so there's not much left to explore to build a second plot on. ZZ are already going toe to toe with some of the nastiest beings in the world so they don't have much left to grow, and even if they did it would just denigrate the powerhouses of MoL by demoting them to 'big fish in the small pond'.

There's still plenty of good options, such as pivoting to a different kind of plot (though admittedly that likely takes the author and readers both out of their comfort zone) or opening up new parts of the world to explore (which is a tricky balance to avoid the problem I talked about just above) or switching to an entirely new character and starting from ground zero again. That last option gives the best potential for a greater series, since you can tell a handful of big stories and string them together into a mega-plot spanning the entire series, but it /does/ require that you abandon the protagonist you started this universe with.
