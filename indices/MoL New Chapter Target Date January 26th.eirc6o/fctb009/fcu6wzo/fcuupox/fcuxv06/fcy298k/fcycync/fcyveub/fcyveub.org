True, and the deadline before that, issued in early September, was October/November, which was only updated to December in (I think?) mid-November.

I'm giving this one a bit more credibility because it's predicting the release date with much more accuracy, and a time remaining until update is much closer to that of earlier updates (which, again, only tended to be a week late, if that).
