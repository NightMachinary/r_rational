Lol. Each with a different personality developed over the years of exploring and teaching one specific topic.

Also, uhm. There was this manga I read some time ago ("Interspecies Reviewers") in which a female and very attractive wizard used her simulacra to run a massive brothel all by herself (though in fact it seems like it's really a massive operation to acquire both intel and tissue samples from multiple customers). I'm pretty sure Zorian would not be into doing that, but Zach? Who could tell?
