Thank you for this detailed response.

I'm definitely not interested in the "literal abstractions" concept, nor so much the "make the game itself as complex as real-world physics" approach. I want to respond to that part of your post with the following: I'm thinking about this more from the direction of encouraging a particular style of *characters*.

If the concept of a D&D party can be traced back to the Fellowship of the Ring, I want to design for characters whose primary meta-influence might be the Manhattan Project. Very smart people who *have* to get the science and the engineering right before the "bad guys" (from the MP's perspective) can use the wild new power of nuclear physics to destroy America.

Nuclear physics works in a particular, consistent way in the real world, and people really did both figure it out and completely change the face of humanity by industrializing and militarizing that knowledge. The magic system I'm gunning for would be an attempt to portray a similar process:

Something new about reality is discovered --> it has implications that will change the world --> you have to figure it out and change the world /your way/ before someone else changes it in a way you don't like. Urgency, the necessity of the scientific method, related rational-adjacent themes like transhumanism and how easily everything could go wrong if we fuck it up this time.

I agree entirely with your last two paragraphs, which is why I'm interested in a "one big lie" set-up. The players can go into the setting with real knowledge of the real world, and that will help them navigate the fictional world. It /is/ the real world, just with a brand-new outside context problem. And crucially, because it's brand new, no one knows what the long-term implications of that problem will be. The game could even be described as the PCs attempting to dictate what those long-term implications will be themselves.
