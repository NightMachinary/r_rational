have you ever seen Mage the Awakening? it is one of the flavors of new World of Darkness, and it leans strongly in this direction (along with Demon, and some of the God-Machine stuff). basically the world you know is a thin sheet over something larger, and there are a few supernatural oligarchs that have already mostly figure out the rules of magic, and oppress everyone else. if you adjust the setting a little bit, you could run it from the dawn of magic instead of a later point where those oligarchs are established and instead compete with them to get there. the issue here is that a character's knowledge of these new magical rules of the world are abstracted away, so as a player you aren't really applying rationality to figure out more, you are just creatively applying your powers the the best of your ability, then spending xp to "learn more".

if you want a game where the players will use their real world knowledge to try to deduce how a magic system works, I am actually working on something along those lines that I am happy to share the idea - it is a pen and paper system that has a computer mediated system for handling physics-magic interactions. the players have access to a physics runtime, and can pass the spells they cast, with the system giving them results. right now that is often instant death. in its current form it is a lot like dwarf fortress: the simulation is complex enough to do cool things, but the interface is terrible. I'm currently stuck in the mud getting it to generate different types of magic systems and other fundamental stuff that will probably prevent me from releasing anything playable any time soon (if I ever do), but I am happy to share the idea with the hope that someone else can do better than I can.
