TTRPGs are, above almost all else, /abstractions./ You roll a d20 and add some modifiers to see whether you got above an opponent's AC because 1) this abstraction is easy to "feel" and calculate and 2) modifications to this basic formula allow for good feedback in terms of tactical choices e.g. "If I use this ability to lower my ability to hit, I'll increase damage, and the expected value of that is /x/, which makes it a better choice in this circumstance".

I think there's some fun to be had in taking these abstractions as /literally/ representing the world, which is what a fair number of litRPGs do, but it's typically not how the games are designed. The abstraction is flawed, and those flaws have implications for the world, but the conclusion (typically) should be that in terms of lore and characterization, the "real" world of the characters works differently from the abstracted representation of the gameplay.

In terms of how to deal with it in terms of fiction, I think there are strengths and weaknesses to any approach. The usual litRPG approach is to take the abstractions as being literally true, with all the inherent absurdity of that, and that's ... fine, if a little overdone at this point.

Another approach might be to reduce the abstraction until it's comically complicated and impossible for anyone to figure out anymore than the real world is, with some guidelines and ability to pin metrics on things, but complications with data gathering and strategy implementation that mean you're often relying on guesswork and there are unknowns when going into any scenario. If you're /just/ adding in a magic system, you can make it like computer programming or something, where every variable is known and everything comes out the same way every time (in other words, computer programming with good, solid, well-documented code), and that's a bit less jarring than applying the same to, say, sword-fighting.

If you're making an actual TTRPG and want to make it "more rational", I think you need to either constrain the magic (or whatever) to just a few people, figure out what about the system is diegetic and what's not, and/or pay attention to the social, economic, political, etc. impacts of either the system or whatever magic you're adding in.

If you have something like "create food and water", you need to think about what this does to agriculture, figure out who can cast it and how often, whether the population of casters is economical to increase, etc. Then you need to do that for every other "spell" or magic item or magical effect or monster. This is a lot of work, which is why people don't generally do it, especially when it's all probably just a backdrop to the actual adventures. Given sheer the amount of stuff in most TTRPG settings, there's probably too much to calculate and figure out, and at a certain point, you're just drawing attention to the problems by trying to solve them (an uncanny valley of worldbuilding).
