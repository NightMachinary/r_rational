The basic concept here is fertile ground for a lot of discussion, but I think the crux of your issue is that capital 'P' Puzzles are easily the least reliably entertaining aspect of TTRPGs. Your proposed idea leans so heavily on the idea of a larger Puzzle for the players to solve, it misses the opportunity to make use of the broader design space: An exploration of TTRPGs as exercises on game theory, for example.

I think it's a common experience among GMs that puzzles tend to reveal just how flimsy the veneer of "perfect communication" is in these games, and this realization is fairly destructive whenever it happens. TTRPGs are social games by nature, because they involve a group of people in constant communication (2 or more, usually 4 or 5, with the exception of solo games which are a different beast altogether). When we notice just how differently we interpret the fiction we're supposedly sharing, communication strains and sometimes breaks down.

I'd be much more interested in a self-aware game in which players and their characters consciously race to level up and achieve the necessary game mechanics to confront a threat or something like that. Maybe that's more rational than rationalist, though I think outside of written fiction the line between the two is blurrier.
