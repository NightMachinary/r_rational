I appreciate this comment! That is definitely not something I had considered, it's closer to the litRPG style, and that isn't my jam. I'm more interested in applications to real life and the real puzzles that people try to solve. Changing the materialist-universe puzzle from nuclear physics to something more internal and personal, like magic / superpowers, just makes it more interesting as fiction.

I'm sort of imagining the Manhattan Project, if instead of the A-bomb they were attempting to become master mages before the Axis could do the same, then /they personally/ traveled to Europe or Japan to fight magical battles with enemy mages.

If they managed to become more powerful mages than their enemies within their timeframe, they could use that to win the war. If they /failed/ to do that, they would have to rely on trickery and cleverness to get anything approaching a victory. Sort of a rolling failure state thing.
