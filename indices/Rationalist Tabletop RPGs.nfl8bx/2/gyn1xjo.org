What stuck out in this question to me is "purely simulationist" and it sounds like a mostly "puzzle solving" style of gameplay, as opposed to something that would benefit from dice or standard progression systems. You explicitly aren't interested in "spend XP to learn more" and I would hazard a guess are uninterested in "roll dice to see if you can solve this puzzle".

It sounds like the design space you'd find interesting is closer to an escape room or the Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective games than a TTRPG. The core game element is experimentation, problem solving, and application of skills.

There's a few things I don't think you need for this:

- Character sheets, progression systems, or dice. Unless you want to simulate combat somehow, or want to introduce inter-party conflict via conflicting values, I'm not sure these things help you focus your core gameplay concept.

There's a few things I DO think you need for this:

- A really really well thought out world, with either an answer prepared or a way of quickly and accurately determining the answer for every experiment players perform or questions players ask. This is going to take time. This is going to take playtesters to imagine things you didn't consider, or get stuck in ways you didn't imagine. This is going to take some method of getting hints so a fail state isn't frustrating and players don't hit dead ends.

- An openness with your players that what you have for them is a puzzle with a "right answer", and clarity about their objective and how they're expected to go about achieving it. Is your problem easy to visualize? Can you give your players tools to visualize it somehow? Decide to what extent you want simulated conflict or alternative win states and ensure that your players understand the constraints of the puzzle.

- A way to make this engaging. Do you have props or vivid descriptions? TTRPGS are engaging for many people because they can play characters with their own motivations and history, in a way that's owned. If the focus is on the puzzle, is the puzzle novel, easy to interact with, does it give good and clear feedback? Abstraction helps games model systems, but it also helps games stay engaging. If what you're asking your players to do is "undergraduate physics lab but on a novel magic system", you need to think critically about how you engage, excite, and interest them.
