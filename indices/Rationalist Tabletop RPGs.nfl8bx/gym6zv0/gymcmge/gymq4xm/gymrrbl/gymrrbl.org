Yeah, "spending XP to learn more" is definitely the exact opposite of what I'm trying to do. It isn't Awakening, but this project began as a mod on Mage: the Ascension, basically "what if the Technocracy was right?" Instead of the Traditions and the Technocracy being two sides of the same coin, the Technocrats are actually anti-mages. They don't have ridiculous superscience, their powers strip away human/mage influence to reveal the true, materialistic universe underneath. This is understandably terrifying to the Mages, explaining their endless conflicts, but overall it creates a lot more nuance in the setting, I think.

Anyway, back to the point, your program sounds like it will probably be a fantastic resource, and if you have a blog or anything with project updates, I would love to take a look!

I should mention, I'm not interested in designing an actual book for publication or anything, this is just a personal project. Ideally, it would only be possible to run it once per group, because once the players figure it out, the work is done. I'd have to design a new magic system for them to interact with. And it would be highly susceptible to spoilers from previous players.
