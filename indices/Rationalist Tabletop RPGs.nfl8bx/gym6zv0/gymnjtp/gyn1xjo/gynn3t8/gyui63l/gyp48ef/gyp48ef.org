How about [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/22/dungeons-and-discourse-third-edition-the-dialectic-continues/][Dungeons and Discourse]]?

It's a homebrew TTRPG based on Dresden Codak [[http://dresdencodak.com/2006/12/03/dungeons-and-discourse/][strip1]] and [[http://dresdencodak.com/2009/01/27/advanced-dungeons-and-discourse/][strip2]], with a [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ep2Z42hYqj68QZz6w/king-under-the-mountain-adventure-log-soundtrack][campaign log]] and [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/08/17/fermats-last-stand-soundtrack-and-adventure-log/][sequel]] from Scott Alexander et al.

I think it's fair to say that it places more emphasis on /scholarship/ - getting and enjoying the references, and making arguments based on them - than cognitive rationality skills as such, but it's a lot of fun. You can attack by making actual philosophical arguments!
