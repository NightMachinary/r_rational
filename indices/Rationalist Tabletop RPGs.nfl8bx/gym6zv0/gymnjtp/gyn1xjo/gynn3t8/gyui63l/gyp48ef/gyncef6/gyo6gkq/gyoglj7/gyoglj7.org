I think that there is a space for playing a game where your character munchkins the rules, figures out the loopholes, uses them to win.

Actually, I can think of two. The first is when everyone in the group is working together, munchkinning as a team, and the team /as a whole/ can win. This is how it can be done in a traditional tabletop game, and I note that there are other people responding with stories about that kind of game.

The second option is when the "campaign" is a single-player computer game. Think something along the lines of Neverwinter Nights - a computer scenario based around roleplaying rules. Here, you can munchkin without crushing the fun of the other players because the other players aren't there. (It gets quite a bit less applicable when using the multiplayer capabilities of the software).
