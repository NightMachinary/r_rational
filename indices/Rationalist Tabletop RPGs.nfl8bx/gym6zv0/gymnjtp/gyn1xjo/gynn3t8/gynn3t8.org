The Worm RPG community that plays Weaverdice is fairly focused on a few play norms that I, an outsider, would describe as 'necessarily rational PCs.'

For example, your character didn't get to pick their powers, so you the player don't get to pick their powers. People don't have time to think in a brawl, so a dice roll can determine whether you struck brutally or weakly.
