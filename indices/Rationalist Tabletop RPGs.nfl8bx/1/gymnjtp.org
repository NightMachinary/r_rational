my group ran something similar to this premise, but using the Pathfinder 1e system. the GM basically had our characters gradually becoming more aware of the rules of the system, eventually culminating in us penning a rather complete book of 'physics' (which just ended up being the pathfinder core rulebook). we also gradually learned in character about story tropes that would show up again and again, and learned to exploit them. we were building a small kingdom, but viziers kept showing up and would inevitably be treacherous, so we eventually created an automatic vizier mulching device that was triggered when anyone tried to sit on the throne (we never sat on it ourselves so it worked out). we also eventually realized that we were different from the NPCs, who had abbreviated rules, and also that we could name people, things, and places to give them more permanence and greater complexity.

the campaign reached its conclusion when we realized that the world was as it was because the gods thought it should be that way, and kept running into this antagonist that was literally brought into being by the gods belief (or fear?) that there should be this sort of antagonist. we eventually solved this problem by evacuating our kingdom to another plane, then finding some of the tools the gods use and using them to reformat the entire prime material plane, to which these gods were tied. no more gods, no more antagonist, and minimal NPC casualties.

as a campaign it was really well done, and I applaud the GM for the idea of rules as written taken to the extreme with rational consequences, but I don't imagine that the concept would function as a rule set instead of a one off campaign inside an existing ruleset. for example, in the game I mentioned above, our characters were the only real "people" in the world. everyone else were partially simulated NPCs, and the world around us was empty except where the gods filled things in ahead of us as we traveled. the GM could make the whole world rational and consistent with its own rules because it was such a small and limited world. as another poster has already stated, RPG systems are designed to moderate some of the ideas of stories and adventure into a form that a human is able to handle as the administrator, in order to allow the rest of the group to enjoy playing in that system. without some sort of augmented transhuman GM setup (which, at this point, you could conceivably create using AI assistants and other purpose built software) then you will keep running into this same limit. humans just aren't gods yet, not even small ones.

your idea about the players needing to figure out the rules of magic isn't fundamentally different to any other mystery where you force your players to actually do the work to solve the mystery. it's a good campaign idea. having rational elements in pen and paper games tends to work fine, but unless you overcome the limitations I mentioned before, it will always be a story that is run on top of an internally inconsistent abstraction that the player characters must remain ignorant of for everything to work out as a playable game.
