Hmm. I think part of my point here is that I'm trying to make a game that is specifically about living in a materialist universe more-or-less identical to our own, except with one big lie.

The central question might be, what would /you/ (normal everyday human in the modern world) do if you suddenly had to face an outside context problem of global importance?

The fact that the lie is the sudden emergence of some sort of magic system is what makes it fun. It allows you to apply real-world problem solving techniques to a fantastical problem, because the fantastical problem follows strict, consistent rules like any other piece of a materialist universe.
