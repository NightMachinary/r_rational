A setting and system that already has something quite like this already is Unknown Armies, though usually it's run as a psychological horror game rather than this kind of tone. One of the stock plots for a high-powered party is an "ascension fight", where someone tries to game the rules of the universe to displace a (pseudo-)god.

How that works: There are (somewhat less than) 333 archetypes which are conceptual human identities, like the Mother, the Demagogue, the Messenger, the Athlete, which sit in the background and influence reality by controlling probability and (omnipresent, but very subtle and mostly not believed) magic. Humans can imitate an archetype and get magic powers reflecting its power if they imitate it closely enough; these are called Avatars. For each archetype, one Avatar is the 'godwalker', someone so close to the archetype that they can challenge it for dominance and supplant them. (In mechanical terms, they are the only Avatar in the world with an avatar skill of 99% - it's a D% system.) An ascension fight plot is when a cabal (party of PCs) try to arrange one of those challenges so that a member of their cabal first becomes the godwalker, displacing the existing one, then challenges and forces out the existing occupant of the archetype itself, thus achieving godlike power over the world.

They give an example of a Trickster avatar who is trying to ascend by mutating it to be the Hacker, and arranges a complicated series of digital traps securing an otherwise ramrod-straight and completely visible path from the entrance to their sanctum, thus fucking with the head of the Trickster, which expects misdirection.
