This is an extreme option, but if you don't need food or water, then almost your entire digestive tract can be removed and the space can be made into storage for smuggling. You'd still need to retain enough of your GI tract to manage saliva, pancreatic enzymes, and bile, but that would still mean you could get rid of most of your large and small intestines, and the entirety of your stomach.

If the 'clean' power can continuously clean off microbial growths, then you can just stick things directly into the cavity. If that doesn't work, then the alternative would be to get properly closed up after surgery but keep large skin flaps on either side of your abdomen. Then, you could place the objects for transport under your ribcage, and put a plastic/foam form guide in place to give your abdomen an approximately normal appearance and feel after you wrap the flaps over it. You could then glue the flaps down the middle and make it look like an old surgical scar.

This could be used to conceal lockpicks, bump keys, digital media storage devices, a handgun, a diamond-tipped hand drill, etc., which could be exploited in a wide variety of ways. This method of concealment would defeat a strip search and a millimeter wave scanner, but not necessarily a metal detector. Obviously most typically smuggled goods wouldn't show up on a metal detector anyway, and for many of the items I listed, it is possible to buy or make ceramic/plastic/composite variants which also would not set off a metal detector. An X-ray would still detect all of this, but that's obviously much less common as a security screening measure, so this approach would allow for smuggling a surprisingly wide range of items through a large majority of security checkpoints.
