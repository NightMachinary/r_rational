What happens if I lose blood? Do I need to eat to restore the lost blood? If not, I am now generating blood from nothing. Same applies to hair.

What does "clean" mean? Am I now the ultimate non-stick surface? What happens when I dive into mud? (presumably naked, since my clothing is probably not immune?)

AFAIK, part of the normal healthy functioning of human skin involves the constant shedding of the dead outer layer of skin. How does that interact with either of the mentioned points?
