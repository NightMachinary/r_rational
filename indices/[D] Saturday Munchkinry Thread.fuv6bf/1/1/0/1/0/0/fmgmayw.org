Yeah, not enough for "become rich by putting a pipe in your aorta and selling mass quantities of blood and plasma", but even a little bit of matter ex nihilo is something.

The obvious thing to do, at least to me, is to take this shocking new phenomenon to some physicists (and/or become one yourself), figure out where it comes from, and work your way up out of the simulation or whatever is going on.

The only way I can really see a small amount of matter being particularly useful is on a spacecraft. If you can develop an energy source that feeds on those complex organics as fuel (lots of hydrogen in there, could plot-insert a fusion reactor) and ejects them really fast away from you, you could become the fastest thing in the galaxy. Everything else has to carry it's fuel along with it, and thus has a top speed.
