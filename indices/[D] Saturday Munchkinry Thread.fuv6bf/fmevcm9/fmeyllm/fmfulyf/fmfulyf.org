I'm confused. If the supervillain's power is turning strong negative emotions into disasters, why doesn't the government just force feed everyone antidepressants and other drugs? That would be far more effective than surveillance, since plenty of people have strong negative emotions so they would need to deal with tons and tons of people, somehow. Anyone with depression, anyone who has had bad things happen to them recently, anyone who is unhappy with the government oppression, etc.

Even worse is how the government could deal with these people, because throwing them all in a prison is just asking for the supervillain to use the prisoner's combined negativity to make disasters. Is the government just killing them? Does the public have access to the surveillance system or any evidence that the killed people truly had strong negative emotions, or does the government just have a free pass to kill anyone they want without evidence?

Also, how does anyone even know that the supervillain exists? His power is magical and remotely activated, so he never has to show his face or be anywhere near the attacked sites or hire any minions. It's like having a death note, almost total anonymity unless they goof up or do something stupid like publicly announcing their existence.
