Is this for a grimdark Miraculous Ladybug fanfiction?

Presumably since you have no superpowers your only option is to leverage your knowledge of the supervillain, which is that he can create terrorist disasters from negative emotions.

So if you want to fight the government, you'd find a way to subvert their monitoring and then cause people near the government in key positions to have strong negative emotions and be turned into disasters by the villain. Eg, do terrible things to the less protected loved ones of government officials.

It might put you on the supervillain's radar, but honestly as a normal person with no powers you don't have much to work with.
