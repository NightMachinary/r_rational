There's a new government that is responding to a supervillain that is able to magically, remotely monitor people's emotional states and create terrorist disasters based on people experiencing strong negative emotions, by setting up a surveillance state of its own and criminalizing the kinds of emotions that can be weaponized. (Think if Japan charged everyone the Dark Kingdom used to fight Sailor Moon with terrorism after the fact). Everyone seems on board with their new surveillance state, which they see as their only protection from the supervillain.

You're an eighteen year old rationalist, who was secretly the hero in canon, but you currently have no superpowers or fame. You don't trust the surveillance state, but you must not attract the attention of the supervillain, who you also want to defeat. How do you win the hearts and minds of the people (or at least make sure both of your enemies lose them)?
