If you could convince your power that "your blood" has to contain something rare or valuable, maybe.

I mean it's gotta be able to account for the change in the the composition of your blood over time somehow (kid blood is not adult blood is not athlete blood), so by slowly and consistently introducing something into your bloodstream you might be able to have the power start creating it ex nihilo. Idk what it would be though. Nanomachines? Monopoles?
