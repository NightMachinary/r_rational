You could call yourself "The Cavalry" and pretend that your power requires a heavy price to be paid, so they only get you out in case someone is trying to take over the world.

As part of your backstory, you enter meditative stasis in the public yet nonetheless somewhat, but not extremely, well defended +Justice League+ Altruistic Alliance headquarters, so people can observe that you're actually in stasis. Add twists as necessary to confuse higher level adversaries

- Make it so that people can observe you at all times with a video feed.
- The last time Bigba Adie and Baba Yaga were defeated, you played a crucial but undisclosed role in the defeat.
- Maybe make your backstory nonobvious, or put it under one bit of obvious misdirection, and two other bits of slightly more sneaky misdirection.

Thus, if someone is trying to take over the world, then the first thing they will do is to try to do is kill you. You thus act as a canary for the Masculine Mongoose to know when someone is trying to take over the world. You will lead a very boring life followed by a very interesting death.

[Feel free to use this idea for whatever.]
