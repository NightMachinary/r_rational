Force feeding mood stabilizers/ antidepressants is definitely coming up on a later arc (when people start noticing their loved ones getting charged with terrorism for getting too angry/sad, and get /rightfully outraged/) This is a very good point about how incarcerating everyone who got too upset does concentrate them in one location (all the downfalls to Arkham Prison having a revolving door); there's something coming up to address that too. Everyone knows that the supervillain exists because they were Voldemort-style big, flashy, scary, and killed thousands of people recently. They don't even have to do anything else in the story; the threat of them acting again is enough.
