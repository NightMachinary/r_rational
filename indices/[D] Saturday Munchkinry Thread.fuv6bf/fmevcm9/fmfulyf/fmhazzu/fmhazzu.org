Unless they have fictional mood-altering drugs that work much better than ones in reality (for example, soma in /Brave New World/), force-feeding them to people is unlikely to work. It's hard enough to get the right medication and dosage with a trained psychiatrist and a cooperative patient who /wants/ the meds to work. And drug addiction tends to create, not prevent, strong negative emotions. Maybe force-fed drugs could stabilize someone's mood in an emergency, but doing that long-term will make things worse, not better.
