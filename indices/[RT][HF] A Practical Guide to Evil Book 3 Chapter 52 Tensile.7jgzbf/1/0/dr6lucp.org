I don't think it's /Cat's/ defeat were leading to, I think it's Malicia's. It's been something on my mind ever since we first learned her plan. This world runs, at least partly, on story conventions, and there is a who lot of hubris in the idea of allowing your treacherous subject to complete her terrifying ritual, even going to the point of secretly aiding it's completion. That's exactly the sort of hubris that tends to get punished in stories.

Yes, Black and Malicia have done a wonderful job subverting those, but we have been seeing cracks in that since early in the story. Now, with Black's cold rationality supposedly shattered would be the perfect time for the other half of that pairing to come crashing down.

What I expect here is that Cat will fight her way past the undead into Akuda's stronghold, expecting a final confrontation, only to discover that there is nothing to confront. Diabolist is long gone, the ritual has been used. Not against Callow, as everyone expected, but to bring down the Empress herself.

Whatever high placed enemies she might have earned, Cat has always had the benefit of patronage at the very highest level. It is time, I think, for her to lose that. At the end of the book, I predict that the Empress will be gone, with Diabolist maybe or maybe not taking her place. Regardless, the empire will quickly devolve into factions backing one side or another, a thing muddled by Black's instability, since the legions are mostly loyal to him.

Instead of warning the crusade off, the superweapon will instead incite it. The threat will rally nation's behind Procer's banner, and the instability will make the war seem far more winnable than it ever would had the empire been whole and strong.
