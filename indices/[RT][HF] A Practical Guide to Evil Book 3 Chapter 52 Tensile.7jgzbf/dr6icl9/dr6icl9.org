I wonder if the quotes at the beginning are a red hearing or if Cat will actually be defeated. It would be an interesting direction to take, not only for her character but also for the politics of the Empire at large.

Would it all be part of Malicia's plan - removing both Cat and Akua at the same time? Would her defeat be a mirror to Black's downfall or if she wins, would it be an example of the 'new way' succeeding while the established order starts to fail?
