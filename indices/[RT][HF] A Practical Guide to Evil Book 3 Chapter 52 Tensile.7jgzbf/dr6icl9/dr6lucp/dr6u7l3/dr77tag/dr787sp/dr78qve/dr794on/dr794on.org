There's speculation that Hune is the spy turned after Summerholm.

This would tie into that. Although, the poster did make a mistake in conflating the war college spy (that was ruled out from being Rat Company) with the Summerholm spy (could be Rat Company).

Edit: To address your original point, it would make Hune more likely to defect because Akua has leverage via her family/people.
