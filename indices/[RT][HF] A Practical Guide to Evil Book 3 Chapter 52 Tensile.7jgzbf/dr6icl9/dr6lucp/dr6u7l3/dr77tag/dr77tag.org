If there is no empire, just squabbling factions, then presumably whoever she expects to win. Black didn't do for the ogres what he did for the Goblins and Orcs, so no real loyalty there. Malicia had reforms but they didn't touch the ogres. She doesn't have anyone to be loyal /to/. I suppose she likes Juniper, but I doubt that would be enough.
