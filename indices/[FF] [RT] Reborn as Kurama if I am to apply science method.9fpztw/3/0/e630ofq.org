I want to say, that it wasn't my intention to bother anyone. So I want to ask for forgiveness, if I somehow offended you.

I am not a linguistic expert, so I am not sure about my ideas/arguments and open for discussion and change of my thoughts.

If I may add, I plan to rewrite and slowly expand this story for the next month, after that it will be done and all ideas should be more fully explained and carefully described.

As example, logographic/alphabetic pros/cons of the system idea: If you look into this link [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram][logographic advantages/disadvantages]], there is a sub “advantages/disadvantages” and subsub “characters in information technology”, just before “see also” sub (all the way down).

There you can find my intended argument about why Main Character choose alphabetical system.

But because of time limit and other constrains which first time writer (myself) often meet with, I prioritized quickly writing novel and wasn't able to correctly refrase this subsub in comprehensive way.

I believe I should be able to do it, during next “rewrite/improve quality” month.

So, again It wasn't my intention to offend and I apologize if I somehow did.

Your argument about Japanese kana is true, but they still use both systems in everyday life and “cons” argument, which you can find in a link stay true as much for Japanese, as for Chinese.
