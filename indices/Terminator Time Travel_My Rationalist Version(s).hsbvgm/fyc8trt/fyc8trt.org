What Im confused about the whole series:

*Why is the pre-war reality not absolutely littered with Terminators, and anti-Terminator fighters?* From what we see:

1. every time a Terminator fails, the/some version of Skynet sends a new one, usually more advanced one.

2. Every time there is a risk of SkyNet winning, the Resistance sends a human or a "good" Terminator to prevent it.

3. Number 1 triggers Number 2 and vice versa, in a never ending cycle.

4. We know for a fact that new timeline Terminators run into old timeline Terminators.

5. We know for a fact that past-stranded parts of destroyed Terminators are used speed up the work of Cyberdyne, and improve the future Terminators, as well as Skynet itself?

Therefore, the only logical outcome is that the moment Sarah Connor is endangered by the original Terminator there should be an instant flood of an infinite (or just absurdly large) number of more and more advanced Terminators and Anti-Terminators, resulting in a very crude and messy form of Singularity. The moment the original T800 aims its gun on Sarah for the first time, the War is basically moot, because the recursive nature of Terminatorisms would completely drown the world in time-travellers.
