It briefly read "fics" not "movies" because I pulled a braino, and it looks like GuyWithLag got in while I was editing it. So that's my bad.

I would love to see more rational/rational-adjacent time travel movies.

Like Back to the Future except when Marty gets back his parents have two different kids, because butterflies, and the firstborn was called Marty because Lorraine liked the name.

Also no photograph shenanigans. Doc Brown figures it out from first principles because he's just that cool.
