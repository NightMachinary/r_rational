I like the rollover theory where it isn't actual time travel but alternate universes where the change is so infinitely small it looks like time travel. Kyle Reese wasn't the father of the original John Connor because Kyle became an extra-dimensional traveller and knocked up the target of his protection detail and spawned the legend of John Connor Leader of the Resistance, which continued to spill over to more dimensions as that one got to the point of "time travel"
