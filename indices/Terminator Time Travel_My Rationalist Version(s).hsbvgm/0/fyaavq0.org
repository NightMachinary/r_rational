There are concepts of time travel where there is an eventually consistent loop that isn't necessarily the first loop.

Maybe Sarah Connor had a child named James, who led the resistance and sent Kyle Reese back, who then fathered a child with Sarah Connor named John, who led the resistance and sent Kyle Reese back, and that second loop is stable.
