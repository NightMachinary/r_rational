I remember a similar self-contained loop was present in Season 2 of MLP:FIM (Episode: It's About Time), where POV character Twilight Sparkle is visited by her bedraggled future self (from next Tuesday) and given a distressing warning that is cut off before any actionable details can be given. Twilight then rushes around the country side for days, patching minor crises, accruing injuries and generally becoming more unkempt and anxious about an uncertain future. It finally comes to a head on Tuesday when... nothing happens. She realizes that there's no actual crisis, breaks into the royal archives for a time travel scroll, and travels back in time to tell herself not to worry about it... but gets cut off before she can get into the details, ensuring the loop.

Someone was taken by the idea of how this came to be and wrote the short story "Closed Timelike Curve" [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/189703/closed-timelike-curve]] , which addresses the "first loop" concept nicely.
