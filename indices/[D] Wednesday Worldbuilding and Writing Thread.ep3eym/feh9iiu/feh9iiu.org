Our civilization is severely flawed. Inefficient systems of governance susceptible to various forms of corruption, economic systems which reward financial entities for acting as sociopathic profit-maximizers, legal systems full of holes and awkward constructions, nonsensical traditions and irrational social norms, predatory and harmful ideologies. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive][Perverse incentives]] which threaten to turn any good cause into an evil, [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][Moloch]] which tempts us to compete each other into extinction, [[https://equilibriabook.com/toc/][inadequate equilibria]] which cause any system to make obvious disastrous mistakes if no specific individual in power is positioned to profit from fixing them, various cognitive biases which make us, and therefore the general public, vulnerable in hundreds of ridiculous ways.

Our world is a pretty bleak place. What if it was worse?

I'm looking for miscellaneous ideas about how a human civilization could be set up in more inefficient, more carelessly harmful ways. Specifics:

- Something cyberpunk-esque and dystopian, but focused on social/organizational horror, not the horrors of new technology ending up in the wrong hands. Systems which commit atrocities and engage in inhumane/stupid policies despite being composed of normal people, not specific evil/stupid people ending up in power and deliberately making everything worse.

- Technology level should be roughly on the level of modern Earth, though one-two instances of slightly futuristic technology is acceptable. On the surface, the resultant world should be roughly recognizable as real-life Earth, just /worse/.

- The ideas shouldn't be too arbitrary or obviously designed to be pointlessly evil (e. g., a federal law which bans consistent sleep schedule). But don't worry about historical plausibility beyond that. You're not bound to real-life Earth history either, come up with whatever geopolitical situation and social customs you'd like.

  - However, I suspect that there are some great examples of horrific systems to be found in real-life Earth's history, so don't hesitate to mention those.

- A possible way to put it: what is to our Earth what our Earth is to [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/post/81447230971/my-april-fools-day-confession][dath ilan]]?

I'm also interested in media which features such settings.
