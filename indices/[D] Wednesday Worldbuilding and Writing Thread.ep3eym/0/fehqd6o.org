Alright, I've been playing around with the idea of taboo magic, specifically, magic that is powered by the discomfort/disgust/fear surrounding societal taboos, after which that power can then be released by breaking those taboos. This is essentially meant to be the "Black Magic" of a setting and I have a few ideas for which taboos will cause which effects, but mostly the idea is that these effects reinforce the taboos. For example, bestiality, if you have sex with an animal it could turn into a bloodthirsty mutant version of itself which you have minor control over (it probably won't kill you). Another aspect of this magic system is locality, a cannibalistic society will experience little to no magical effects when taking part in the taboo of cannibalism, while a community of religious zealots might pass out from hearing someone blaspheme. How do you think society would try to work around this? I think the lowest hanging fruit would be to hide the existence of taboo magic since knowledge of it would likely lead to stronger feelings towards the taboos, which would cause the effects to be even more extreme. I'm also curious about what effects you guys might come up with for certain taboos.

Here's a list of the taboos I've thought of so far:

bestiality, necrophilia, killing family members, plain old murder, homosexuality, cannibalism, abortion, rape, atheism, apostasy, blasphemy, incest, pedophilia

let me know if I'm missing some obvious ones.
