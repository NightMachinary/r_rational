I could quibble about nature versus nurture but actually you're on to something interesting! If an antisocial warlock does try to build a permanent state, the basis for the warlock's magic will quickly erode. The new taboos will be whatever threatens the warlock, which will grant any would-be rebellion a huge advantage. There will be a very dependable cycle of regime change (probably about one per generation). Unless! The warlock keeps the precise nature of the broken taboo a secret (performing the taboo in front of witnesses who are then killed). Or else the warlocks foster their children out among the people most ideologically opposed to them. So their heirs will inherit the kingdom, even if they hate everything their parents stood for.
