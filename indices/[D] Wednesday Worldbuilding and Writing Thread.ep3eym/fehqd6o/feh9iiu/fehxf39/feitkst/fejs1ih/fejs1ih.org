Profit motive is everything, and everything is done through corporations.

Corporations are considered voting citizens, and only corporations have the vote. The corporate vote is /supposed/ to reflect the average desires of the employees of the corporation, but exactly how this is measured is left to individual corporations, and many corporations are believed to completely ignore the results of their own internal vote and simply submit the CEO's preferences. (This is important, because the power of a corporation's vote is a function of its number of employees; a corporation ten times larger has ten times the vote). (It might create an even worse world if 'number of employees' in the previous parenthesis is replaced with 'audited net profit').

A corporation controls /everything/ for its employees. It houses them, feeds them, provides them with medical care, offers them a selection of entertainment, provides (and, if necessary, filters) their internet. The company may also charge for these services. Of course, with promotion comes benefits (e.g. having choices on the menu other than Nutrient Slop Version 4, Shrimp Flavour) and directors have /great/ lives. Children are (usually) automatically employed by their parents' corporation from birth; while there may be marriages between employees of different corporations, these are rare enough that most people have heard only vague stories of them.

Politicians basically rubber-stamp what corporations want. By and large, the only laws that apply to employees are those set by their corporation.

Individual corporations have a range of internal conditions. However, some of the biggest and most influential corporations have internal conditions that start out at "sweat shop" and work down from there, because not paying for anything nice for your workers turns out to be a /great/ way to cut costs.
