- *Killer bots:* Inexpensive mass-produced swarms of semi-autonomous [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CO6M2HsoIA][slaughterbots]]. We already have the technology, we just need someone evil enough, wealthy enough, and greedy enough to make it happen on an industrial scale.

- *Strict corporate internet censorship:* This would be imposed to create a paywall to improve profits, like [[http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2009/images/10/28/net.neutrality.chart.jpg][this]]. Meanwhile, anti-corporate, anti-capitalist, or anti-establishment websites effectively get shut off.

- *Routine genetic analysis in employment screening:* Similar to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gattaca][Gattaca]], with employees being excluded from certain types of jobs for having suboptimal genes (like women with BRCA genes being prohibited from working in radiology or nuclear power, for example). This creates growing pressure for parents who can afford to do so to get prenatal genetic screening and abort children who aren't genetically optimal. Children of poor parents often end up doubly screwed, both with genetic disabilities and exclusion from various occupations.

- *Intense proliferation of connector standards:* Not everything is horrible, sometimes it just sucks. New Apple® wall outlets for charging Apple devices (doesn't work with anything else), Microsoft® wall outlets, GE® wall outlets, etc. Every manufacturer starts trying to build a monopoly and force consumers to use their products exclusively, somehow creating a more annoying situation than an actual monopoly. The connectors are all patented, and the manufacturers don't sell adapters.

- *Flying cars:* Yeah, yeah, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moller_M400_Skycar][futuristic utopia]], right? No. Fuck no. Flying drunk drivers. Flying drivers texting on their smartwatches. Poorly maintained flying cars suffering mechanical failures in the air. Fuel consumption massively increased compared to regular cars, meaning more pollution, more CO2, and /way/ more noise. Sounds bad, but what's worse is that you actually /have/ to get one because otherwise you're going to be stuck in the traffic jams for hours trying to get to work, and public transportation is even slower. Yay flying cars!?
