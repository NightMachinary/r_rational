If you want to go a step further, you could have big corporations lobby for and achieve legalized corporate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterritoriality][extraterritoriality]]. Sufficiently large corporations can then designate properties of theirs which, while technically being within the country, fall under their own jurisdiction and laws. You might have defense contractors lobbying to essentially have their own private military forces to defend their facilities with full legal authorization to handle trespassers as they see fit. Not only can they shoot on sight, even using AA and AT missiles, but they could also arrest people and hold them indefinitely if they so choose. CEOs can then hide from the proletarians within the walls of their militarized corporate complexes.

With the return of privatized military forces, you might have a massive surge in defense contractors, more or less making the national military force irrelevant. Soldiers mostly work for Lockheed-Martin-Boeing, GM-GE-Exxonshell, Academi (formerly Blackwater), Applesoft, and Fox-Disney now. The Department of Defense might have its own small military force, but for the most part, it simply pays the contractors to contribute their forces to the war effort.

Soon enough, you've got private contractors fighting each other, you get into an arms race, and then you have contractors lobbying to have WMDs as a deterrent. Soon enough, Applesoft is operating its own nuclear submarines to ensure against incursions by Fox-Disney. Welcome to the dawn of corporate feudalism.
