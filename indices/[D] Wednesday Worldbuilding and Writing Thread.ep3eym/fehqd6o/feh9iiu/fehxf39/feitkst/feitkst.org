First, regress society. Have the government be plutocracy or theocracy instead of democracy. Reintroduce caste or feudal systems. Have slavery and child labour. Abolish modern banking. Get rid of minimum wage and social benefits. Make people ignorant of the fields of economics and logistics.

Second, demote modern social values. Promote racism, xenophobia, homophobia, and others of the sort. Have justice be based on "guilty until proven innocent". Raise the age for which people can enter the workforce. Increase individual competitiveness and decrease trust. Promote colonialism and war.

Third, restrict information. Privatise the internet. Incentivise the media to report misinformation and fear mongering. Have the media be controlled by organisations with biased interests.

Fourth, slow scientific progress. Let anyone publish into academia. Abolish the peer review system. Promote fear of the sciences, and let anti-vaxxers and climate change deniers be in the majority.

Fifth, curb human rights and sustainable development goals. Increase the wealth gap. Make basic healthcare and education only available to the rich. Increase the cost of water and electricity. Create monopolies everywhere. Close countries' borders and let nothing in or out.

Sixth, change the spending of the government. Focus on building highways that lead to nowhere rather than public goods and services. Increase military funds. Increase taxes, or decrease them to zero.

The change could be a result of wrong lessons learnt from history, incompetence of leaders, ignorance of leaders, or as core values of the major religion in countries.
