I love this so much. Want to buy and use over-the-counter medications? You need to take a course, then pass a test to get a license for home medication administration. Then, every year you have to mail printed certificates of completion of annual continuing education credits to maintain your license. The course costs $600 to take, the test is $150 for each attempt, and the credits cost $50 to enroll in each year. You also need to keep a record of every medication you use (date, time, who it was given to, what the dose was).

Want to have knives with sharp blades, perhaps in your kitchen? You have to get a permit for that. You need four people outside of your family to write affidavits which affirm that you can be trusted with sharp objects. You'll need to write a sign a contract requiring you to keep any sharp objects in a locked container, and then submit an application with your form, affidavits, and receipt for the locked container to the local sheriff's office, plus a $50 processing fee. You'll get your permit in three to six months, as long as the sheriff's office doesn't have any problems with your documentation. Having unlocked sharp objects in your home is a Class A misdemeanor. Just imagine how guns are handled.

Fires at home aren't allowed. No grilling, no gas stoves, no wood/gas furnaces, no fireplaces, no campfires, no candles, no lighters, no matches, period. Cooking with fire has to be done in a properly-licensed commercial restaurant. Home heating has to be done electrically with ceramic heating elements. Smoking is obviously banned as a consequence.

The black markets that all of this would create would be absolutely insane. This could make for a very interesting cyberpunk-esque dystopian setting.
