My understanding is that Venezuela already works like that. Almost everyone has semi-illegal side jobs, often farming currency in MMORPGs, which give them US dollars to buy food and other necessities on the black market, as official sources for those things are woefully inadequate. They have electricity and internet - except when they don't - but the stuff you actually need to live? All obtained illegally.

For a while, the actual Bol√≠var - Dollar exchange rate was recorded and maintained by [[https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-12-01/venezuelas-currency-value-depends-largely-one-guy-alabama-home-depot][one dude in Alabama.]] That's how bad their situation is.
