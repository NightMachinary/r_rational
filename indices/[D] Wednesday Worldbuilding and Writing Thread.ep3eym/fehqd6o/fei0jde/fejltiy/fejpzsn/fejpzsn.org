But what the antisocial warlock does is what leadership does. What leadership does, people will get used to. What people get used to isn't really much of a taboo. Antisocial warlock without taboo is just antisocial person giving orders. Antisocial person giving orders quickly gets shanked. Is there a new antisocial warlock riding new taboos?
