Given your restrictions, the best way to make a worse Earth is to add more bureaucracy.

Add layers between problems and people capable of solving them. Certifications are required to legally do things, like putting out fires. Copyrighting and patents are more restrictive and abstract. Some general patents were deemed too broad, but specific categories were not. Mega-conglomerates are still at war over keystone patents like "educational films" and "heart surgery".

Add layers between reality and people making the big decisions (an absurd example would be having a pyramid of bean counters gathering statistics from each other. The leaders make decisions based off of the numbers from the bean counters directly below them, like a giant AI neural network with no training and improper feedback.)

However, for such a society to be miserable and deadly, I think you would need something to balance it out to explain how it doesn't end itself. Something like an AI who makes sure everyone at least has gruel to eat and makes sure enough test tube babies are grown to maintain population.

Edit: Kafka's works would be one of the best examples of this.
