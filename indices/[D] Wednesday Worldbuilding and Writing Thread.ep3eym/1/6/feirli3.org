If you want to make a situation worse, you could always add more Nazis.

The Nazi regime wasn't going to be stable no matter what they did. Their central tenets just violate humanity's empathetic drive too much. If they had managed to force the UK's surrender and been able to turn inward, maintaining their reign would have required them to recruit more psychopaths into important positions than exist. The Europe they left behind would be a shell of its former self.

This would have significant knock-on effects. Eugenics would not have been so harshly rebuffed as a science, as the Nazis could have kept the extermination camps an open secret rather than a heavily-advertised blight and international shame, known to every schoolchild in nearly every nation. Eugenics efforts against native populations the world over may have continued far longer. In the US, the civil rights movement would have been far weaker, as returning black soldiers would be seen as failures rather than heroes. China, Korea, and the rest of the South Pacific would be a depopulated, smoking ruin due to the depredations of Imperial Japan...

I don't really care to imagine this world further, but you can if you want.
