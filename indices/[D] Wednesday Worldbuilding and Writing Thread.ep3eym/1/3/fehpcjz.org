For historical crummy examples: Classical Sparta and (more than two thousand years later) the Antebellum American South had very similar crappy systems. Permanent slave caste stuck in place doing agricultural labor to free the upper class up to do something else. In both cases the upper class put a lot of work into keeping the slave class down, and spent a lot of time worrying about revolts. They had a tiger by the tail. But the two societies had different terrible add-on effects.

In Sparta, the upper class were soldiers, and built up an invincible-warrior mystique because they spent all their time drilling. If contemporary accounts are to be believed, they were a kind of police state where all the boys grew up in barracks--assuming they weren't exposed at birth for being sickly. Paranoia about Spartan aggression (versus Athenian imperialism) was a contributing factor to the Peloponnesian War that tore Greece apart for decades.

In the South the ruling class were expected to be a more leisured kind of aristocrat, and that upper class was itself subdivided into different social classes. Since the big landowners tended to buy up all the land, everybody else was stuck squatting on a few acres apiece, with no hope of social mobility. The system wasn't just bad for black people--most whites had far worse economic prospects than their northern counterparts. But they supported the slave system anyway, because free labor would have entailed accepting social equality with blacks, which was intolerable. A good part of Northern hostility to slavery stemmed from their recognition that there was no place for free white labor in a slave system.

(I write [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/][a serial]] set in a horribly dysfunctional society as well--and post updates on here--but it's not modern or cyberpunk and the world is drastically different from ours)
