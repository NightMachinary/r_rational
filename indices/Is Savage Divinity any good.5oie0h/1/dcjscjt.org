I read through Savage Divinity recently, and my 1 sentence review would be "I had trouble wanting to finish the story". It was right at the cusp of being interesting, but often was boring instead. The prose and writing for Savage Divinity is above average, and the world-building is merely average. The story tends too far into the Mary Sue trope though, with no serious negative events or outcomes for the protagonist. The characters in the story tend to be interesting and aren't one-dimensional, but this fails to overcome the weak story and plot. Overall:

- Prose: 4/5

- Plot: 2/5

- Characters: 4/5

- Worldbuilding: 3/5
