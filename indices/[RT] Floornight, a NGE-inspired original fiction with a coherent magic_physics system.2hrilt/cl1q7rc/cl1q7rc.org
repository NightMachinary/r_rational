I'm really enjoying this story! I like the characters and the disconcerting nature of it. I feel more emotionally invested than with Ra, both in the world/science and the characters. My only complaint is the "Ratio" character seems a bit too much like Sherlock from the BBC mini-series, it's hard to divorce the two in my mind.
