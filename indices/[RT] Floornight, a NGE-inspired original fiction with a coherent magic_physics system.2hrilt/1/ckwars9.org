I'm on chapter 10 now, and quite enjoying it so far. Is this complete?

Edit: No, it is not. And while I liked it, I think it "suffers" from some of the same drawbacks that /Ra///Fine Structure/ suffer from, which is that the story is told without a coherent narrative thread - we are instead given the story in bits and pieces and left to figure out things for ourselves and fill in the missing gaps through inference. I think that more or less works for psychological horror, where part of the point is keeping the reader just slightly off-balance, but it's a style of writing that I like better when I can engage in a running commentary with other people so we can clue each other in.
