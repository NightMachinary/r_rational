Hi, author here! I appreciate all the comments here and am flattered by the attention.

Until a few days ago Floornight was being posted only to my tumblr -- then I dumped it all on AO3. The updates are in 1-3 chapter blocks, and the schedule is erratic and based on when I feel like writing. If you want a sense of what the schedule has been, see the tumblr page [[http://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/fiction][here]]. (If you click on an individual update, you will be able to see when it was posted.)

The first update was posted on July 5 2014, which works out to a rough average rate of around 1.5 chapters per week, but of course I can't guarantee that will happen reliably every week.
