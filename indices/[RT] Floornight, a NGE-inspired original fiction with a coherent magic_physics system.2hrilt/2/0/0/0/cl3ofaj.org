Yeah, Ratio is supposed to be short (though I'm not sure I've explicitly stated that), with big curly hair (color unspecified so far). He's also described as "pudg[y]" in Ch. 20, which is not a word that would apply to Benedict Cumberbatch.

Behavior-wise, I do think the characters are drawn from similar broad "types," but I feel like I'm trying to write Ratio as less arrogant than BBC Sherlock, at least under the surface. It's been a long time since I watched that show, but IIRC Sherlock is quite confident that his unusual thinking style is simply /better/ than ordinary thought, where Ratio realizes that his unusual thinking style has its downsides, and has a fair amount of insecurity attached to this (see Ch. 20). He's also somewhat less distant than Sherlock -- the kind of guy you could imagine going out drinking with and having a good time if you didn't already find him annoying (cf. his friendship with Cecelia as depicted in Chs. 5 and 13, or his relationship with Jorge as depicted in Ch. 20).

I hope that helps, and I hope I don't sound defensive in trying to distinguish the two characters. I guess I feel like one of my goals here is to write an intelligent, socially inept character with an unusual thinking style /without/ doing a rehash of Sherlock or other notorious instances of the type, so it's important to me that the differences be there.
