I have! I read the entirety of what you've written so far in two sittings. I'm sorry you've been ill, hope you feel better soon. I'm really enjoying the alternate worlds you've got going on; I'm excited to see more of what happens with the rebellion in the plane where beings use pneuma producing slaves as a main power source.
