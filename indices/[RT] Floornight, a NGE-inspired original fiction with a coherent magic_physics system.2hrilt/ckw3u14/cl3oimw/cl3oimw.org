Very good point. This is one of the main things I need to clear up if I ever go back and edit the story: Maria is one of the relatively few people who can actually be split at all. She's a power source for the same reasons she's a pilot, and this is not common. I kind of explained this by having Maria's waking routine in Ch. 6 begin with checking for reintegrations, when Ratio's waking routine hadn't in Ch. 5, but it needs to be more explicitly stated. (If any of the scientists could split, they definitely would.)

(I should probably also specify at some point that the amount of energy gained from integrating two branches increases with the "distance" between the branches, to explain why they don't just constantly split and integrate one person over and over again very quickly.)
