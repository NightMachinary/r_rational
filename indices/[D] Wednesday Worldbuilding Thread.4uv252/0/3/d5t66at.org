As [[/u/alexanderwales]] suggests, it probably wouldn't affect architecture much, since buildings need to be accessible and safe to people who can't jump at all.

Humans don't jump very high. The best athletes get their centre of mass a little more than 1m into the air; the real trick in jumping over things is more to do with how you move in the air than with how high you can jump.

With that in mind, can you double-jump sideways or backwards? If in mid-air, you brace yourself to jump off an invisible wall, can you quickly change direction? Can you repeatedly jump between an actual wall and your double-jump to run along a vertical or near-vertical wall? What if you're vaulting over a brick wall, and you use your hand to push off the wall - do you count as "grounded", and can you still double-jump?

This would dramatically affect the development of parkour.
