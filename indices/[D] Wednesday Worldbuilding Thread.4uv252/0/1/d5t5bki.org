The arbitrary nature of this power and more specifically its introduction should be immediately obvious to any even halfway decent armchair physicist. Expect to see society swing towards the much more religious as interference by an intelligent and powerful entity is more or less confirmed.

This would probably not be the case if the power was introduced in prehistory rather than the mid-1800s.
