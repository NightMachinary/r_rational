It would have virtually no effect on architecture; regular architecture is designed without the use of /regular/ jumping, so I don't see how double jumping would change anything. This is in part because some people can't jump due to age or infirmity, and buildings need to be accessible to everyone (this applies even before the ADA and similar).
