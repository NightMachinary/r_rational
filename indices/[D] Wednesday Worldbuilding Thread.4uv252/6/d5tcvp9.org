/(spoiler warning?)/

TL;DR: tazers; net guns; variety of disabling gases; [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverRecycleYourSchemes][thick walls and doors; trapped rooms;]] trained dogs (maybe also rats and the like); drones; think-tanks for terror act and covert act scenarios; fitting law enforcement training scenarios; competent law enforcement; no plot armours; better and more polarized public opinions regarding ajin; prestigious government positions for psychologically stable resident and non-resident ajin; [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruitment][head-hunting]] for non-resident ajin in developing and undeveloped countries; voluntary experimentation, (and maybe) death games, etc for ajin; secret involuntary experimentation only on psychologically unstable \ criminal ajin (no chance of rehabilitation and cooperation respectively in either case); more original experiments and of a much wider variety.

/TL;DR

- in advanced stages of a game (again, spoilers) the largest body fragment technique can be used to capture an uncooperative ajin: make an explosion with only enough energy to blow their limbs off, transfer those limbs into 2×2×2 empty cells, make another explosion near them but this time with enough force to blow them into chunks. They will respawn in one of the empty cells, and all you have to do is to not miss the moment first and to properly hold them caged later.
- the head-contact effect of two ajin-mummies could possibly be used for information extraction, brainwashing, reprogramming, group-mind building, etc.
