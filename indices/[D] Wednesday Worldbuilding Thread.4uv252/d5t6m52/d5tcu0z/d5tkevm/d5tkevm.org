  Even self-proclaimed experts can't easily tell them apart (though actual experts can).

Once the algorithms are good, I doubt even actual experts would be consistent in identifying true hand crafted just by their creativity... it would probably come down to tiny features and differences resulting from using machines, and I think if the machinery imitated human artisanship closely enough, not even the experts could tell (for example, a machine using a robotic hand to smooth wood with sandpaper might look exactly like a human's polishing, unless experts go to the trouble of figuring out any slight differences in the robotic hand vs. a human's and then comparing them, but even that might have false positives from humans that hold the sand paper differently than normal...).

  Larger organisms can be simulated at the neuron level.

I think we still don't know enough about everything neurons do to simulate a larger organism even if we had the computational power. I don't know a good review off the top of my head if you want citations, but I am pretty sure I can find papers illustrating some of the ways are knowledge is lacking (if you want sources)... for example, we still don't entirely understand the role dendritic spines do, and although there are some models of their activity, I don't think we have a model that we could just plug into an overall neural computational model that would accurately capture their function. Also, even if we had a mouse connectome, for example, this might not capture all the information we need. To go back to the dendritic spines example, they can demonstrate plasticity on timescales on the order of minutes, so a connectome made by plasticizing and then cutting up the brain may miss information.

  Virtually every task that is currently computationally expensive but solved would become trivial.

I think there are some tasks that grow large enough that even with ridiculously cheap computing the standard "solved" algorithm might not be good enough... don't know of any good examples off the top of my head.
