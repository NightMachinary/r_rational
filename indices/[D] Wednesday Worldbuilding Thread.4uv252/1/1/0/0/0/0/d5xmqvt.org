I suppose it would be a lot easier if you /start/ in hard vacuum too, and a shallow gravity well always makes space flight easier! . If we assume that rockets are the only means of non-ground transport (fair, I think), it could be done well before the twentieth century equivalent.

If there's a home atmosphere to leave, I stand by my comment. The technology for space is /hard/.
