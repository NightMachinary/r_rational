Probably depends on speed and body shape, as well as if there are any military around checking their radar (which, for the southwest, might be likely.) We can almost certaintly see them (The F22 radar can see something on the order of 1cm at 10 miles or something (I'm underestimating)) so it's less of a question of whether they can be seen and more of a question of whether they think it's a cruise missile/aircraft versus large bird.
