Drones as well as state of the art satilites would have a decent chance to detect as the hero would be quite visible should they be watching.

Another key point is encroaching development in the deserts of the south west (even though there isn't enough water long term do to drawing from fossil aquifers they still build because people are short sighted) This development could certainly limit where the hero could enter without being seen by the general public as one cell phone video would spread viral on the internet.

If during the night time Astronomers would have a fairly high chance of discovering the hero due to multiple all sky surveys predominately looking for Near Earth Objects(NEOs) which the hero would likely be detected if caught in these sweeps. However these sensitive ground based surveys would only be operating during the night so they would be unable to spot him entering from a sun ward inclination during the daylight. This is how the asteroid that exploded over Chelyabinsk

An additional key point is that unless this hero has some miraculous power to stop it the friction of reentry would cause the hero to become a massive fire ball. The hero is sufficiently strong might survive via superpowers but they would certainly produce a fireball on reentry. Thus the question is whether anyone is there to observe the fire ball on reentry.

The last major source of detection is the nuclear weapons test ban treaty monitoring which has in the past detected 26 asteroid impacts between 2001 and 2014 through the resulting energetic entry. Because the hero's reentry would have similar effects on the atmosphere there is a good chance that they would show up as a detection. The question is whether they would be identifiable as a hero on reentry which is unlikely unless heroes are known to exist.

Occam's razor would after all otherwise suspect either space debris or an asteroid.
