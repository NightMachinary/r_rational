If you have the ability to do so via super powers or equipment and are able to account for the huge amounts of energy required sure...(or once you have gotten past the high altitude atmospheric winds have a really really big parachute to save on that last bit of energy... scaled to account for how heavy this guy is... also remember that because the earth is a rotating oblate spheroid orbiting the sun going directly downwards will not lead you to land where you would think because of the earths rotation so you would have to account for that as well.
