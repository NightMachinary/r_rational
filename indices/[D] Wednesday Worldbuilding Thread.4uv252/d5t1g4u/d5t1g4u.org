Double jumping was a thing in real life, what effect would it have on society? Certain sports would be different, sure, but what affect could it have on architecture or military formations?

Let's say all of a sudden in the mid 1800s, double jumping became a thing. If you jump in the air and extend your legs to land properly, your legs meet with a force enough for your muscles to propel you even further, but only as far as you can normally jump. If you don't extend your legs fast enough, the force gives way and you fall again.

If you don't have your legs in a position to jump a second time, it won't activate, so when you do have your legs in position, it will activate.

The source of this power is irrelevant.
