Over on the discord server, [[/u/nighzmarquls]], I, and a few others having been working on revamping a bunch fantasy/D&D creatures and phenomena to better fit our personal tastes as well as a sort of psychological theme we've developed. If you visit the server, our (long and rambling) discussion is in the re-mythedfantasy channel, and we have a google doc where we've been dumping ideas, available [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lDDTh1F80oiQy82DtKQcEilFgYfBgxwaOvLnIabAMO8/edit?usp=sharing][here]].
