Makes sense I guess it is harder for me to think that way as I tend to put rules in place for magic (even if said inhabinants of the world don't know them)

When I read through your page it seemed most of them are alterations of humans or other creatures based on psychology making the mental state far more important which is interesting as it forces the worlds inhabitants to pay more attention to such things.

It does make an interesting contrast to how I tend to go about fiction where when doing what if scenarios I try explore every possible ramification or path that I can think of. This tends to make a multiverse like aspect where I get two ideas from one and mesh ideas that fit well together into each other which tends to create further offshoots.

For instance I have one fantasy idea where everything is closely grounded in biology and physics. This has created some unusual ideas such as demons really being various types of parasitic worms that alter their hosts behavior and physiology in order to maximize their odds of passing on their genes.

I understand the urge to bring outer space into play(You must have written the vampire idea :) ) one of my main fantasy ideas involves extraterrestrial lifeforms hitching a ride of a remnant fragment of their former planet (it is still a pure fantasy however) but in the prologue I hint at a gravity assist to shrink the orbital pass to allow them to shrink the orbit thus return quicker after a failed attempt to take control.
