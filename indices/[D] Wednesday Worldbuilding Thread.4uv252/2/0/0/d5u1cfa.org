For me personally I mostly tack on some magical like principle like "ghost are real"

or "magic happens" then try and find how that can fit into chemistry, physics and psychology as I understand it.

Since a lot of this stuff starts with "what is the theme/feel of a thing" and then goes from there it really depends on "what if" then play through ramifications.

The magic and the science being blended together in odd ways is an intentional feature, but the selection process is very much to taste, I really like science so I tend to find most of the universe cool, I just also want to put dragons and star beasts and unicorns in it.

I also lately work from a basic principle that most forms of magic are assumed from the start to be a source of potential infinite energy.

On the psychological thing, it's mostly just a 'mind will effect body will effect mind' feedback loop that is sort of just an assumed principle of this universe and thus results in "things".
