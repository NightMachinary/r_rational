Immortal monarchy.

I did a brainstorm with people over at discord over how an immortal might hold on to rule a country for two-three centuries well into an analogue 20th-21st century for a recorded history of only about a thousand year.

There were couple of ideas:

- Matrilineal succession - This is a requirement since the immortal in question is a female.
- Symbolic office - I don't know how to best describe it...but when someone succeed, one must become a symbol. That means dressing and acting in some way according to tradition. So it becomes acceptable for the person to wear a mask.
- Mask culture - In the imperial household, all the royals wear mask. Everyone, such as servants and guards, who works with them also wear masks. However, the royal family are total unknown. Nobody knows their face.
- Only the family knows the truth about the immortal empress.
- There are fable and tales alleging immortality, which some thought it might be immortality.
- There are conflicting tales about the nature of immortality in the royal family. Some says reincarnation based on taking the crown. Others say that the empress impersonate her daughter or sister from generation to generation. Another says that the spirit adviser is passed from one generation to the next.

I got no clues about how one might justify monarchy.

For context:

Yipang is an liberal monarchy, ruled by a secret immortal and is a world power. Parliamentary politics exist, complete with a nobility class. The right is a stronger supporter of monarchy yet don't support her majestcy's policy as much as the left. The left has stronger parliamentarian bias, but is stuck with a monarch that support their ideas and policies.

Sorta like Japan, but not really. It taken on the whole East Asian, mostly Japanese aesthetic. Regardless, one should not invite a Yipangese to a Japanese gathering, as there will be just as many social impasse and gaffe committed by them as any westerners.

Setting is a world called Gaia, an analogue to our Earth, yet with a different world history, nations, and so on. Time period is around their version of WW2. You may have read previous worldbuilding thread about my idea for a trans-dimensional story. This is where that story take place.
