A sapient species that can survive vacuum builds a city on an airless planet. What unique challenges and opportunities would this present? What details might stand out to a human reader?

Aerodynamics are irrelevant, so vehicles can be whatever shape keeps their passengers from falling out. No windscreens needed. They might be able to build faster cars/trains with no air friction to slow them down.

Controlled flight is only possible with rockets. No birds, airplanes, copters, or dandelion seeds. If plants exist, they may need to launch their seeds (ballistichory).

Cooling is much more of a problem.

Meteors and cosmic radiation are a hazard.

No sound, so people will need some other way of talking. (sign language? built-in radios?)

With no weather, there's no material difference between indoor spaces and outdoor spaces. Walls are for privacy and to keep out intruders, not for shelter. Roofs are still useful if you need shade.

What else?
