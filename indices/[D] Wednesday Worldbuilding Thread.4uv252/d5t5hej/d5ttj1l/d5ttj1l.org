Dust is going to be a serious problem, so walls are still a thing. This also causes problems for vehicles - maybe lightweight tubes around tracks are worthwhile? Static electricity might be useful.

Roofs protect from sunlight, including the problematic non-visible bits that our atmosphere filters.

There are no volatile compounds (water, biological, etc) on the surface - they'd sublimate into an atmosphere. Many implications for geology and geomorphology - expect something like Mars or the Moon, with fairly loose material at the surface.

A magnetosphere would be very useful regardless for radiation management.

Vacuum-welding makes metal equipment a (relative) liability.

Can we use nanoassemblers? Grey goo?
