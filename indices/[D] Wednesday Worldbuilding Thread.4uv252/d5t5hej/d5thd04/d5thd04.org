Ballistic travel would be relatively safer, since there is no wind to introduce unpredictable influences over distance, and you can precisely calculate how you will land. Everything would be engineered for temperature extremes, either to tolerate or prevent them. It would be easier to maintain temperature extremes, so cryogenic applications including superconductors would be common. Refining processes might include ultra high temperature plasma separation, particularly in the absence of liquid water. All liquid water would have to exist in pressurized vessels.
