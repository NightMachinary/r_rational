I assume that a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick][flying brick]] superhero /can/ do this, at least if he or she is able to survive and travel unaided above atmosphere in the first place! The heat and acceleration would be manageable even for a normal human if spacesuits can with a reactionless drive (assumed equivalent superpowers); see [[https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/40886/could-someone-jump-from-the-international-space-station-and-live][here]] for some relevant discussion.
