They'd show up on military radar, as a small flier built from non-metallic materials. But a radar that sensitive would also get a lot of false positives, from flocks of birds and things like that, so the superhero might slip through.

They might show up on a spy satellite, if a spy satellite happened to be watching the area they flew over at the right time.

While they're in space, they'd look like an unusually large piece of satellite debris. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris#Tracking_and_measurement][We already track a lot of those]], but I'm not sure how well those tracking systems work for objects that aren't in a stable orbit.
