I read it as well. I'm a huge fan of the Martian, so I wanted to like it.

Pros : He mostly thinks through the technical details of his proposed colony and all the details of the setting fairly well. Some of the solutions the colonists use are dumb - 100% pure oxygen, open loop? Really? - but it mostly feels plausible.

Cons : Yes, the character is annoying. It's the same character from The Martian with a gender change, and certain scenes just don't feel appropriate to the gravitas of the situation. Moreover, the ending is not a plausible outcome and a certain negative consequence doesn't happen, despite it being basically guaranteed in any reasonable scenario.

If the Martian is a 10/10 for me, this book is maybe a 6/10.
