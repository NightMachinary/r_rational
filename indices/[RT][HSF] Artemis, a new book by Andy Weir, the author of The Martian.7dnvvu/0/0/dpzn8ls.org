I'm about 1/3 of the way through the book, and this review feels on point. The character is annoying and her relationship with sexuality and femininity is uncomfortable.

I'm also just kind of /bored/. At this point, I know that the character wants a lot of money, which is why she's doing what she's doing, but it's not clear to me /why/. The stakes are unclear, so I'm not invested, and that's the biggest strike against of all.
