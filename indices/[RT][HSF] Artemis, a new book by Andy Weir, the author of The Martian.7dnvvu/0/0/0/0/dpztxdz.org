I agree. The Martian didn't actually have great writing, at least in my opinion. For one thing, the descriptions of the location just weren't that great. And Mark Wattney never /really/ seemed to suffer from his months of total isolation. Things like that. The concept and execution of a man stuck on Mars was just so well done that the lackluster writing didn't hamper it. Moving away from what Weir is really good at seems premature. For me, I liked the world building in that interview posted in this sub a few days ago, but the genre and description of the plot didn't interest me.
