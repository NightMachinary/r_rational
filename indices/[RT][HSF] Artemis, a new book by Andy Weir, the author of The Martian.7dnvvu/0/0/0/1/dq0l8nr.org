Authors don't necessarily want to write books that sell, if they've made “enough” money to get by for a while. Weir might just be exploring his own competencies (you'll never know what you /can't/ do until you try), or trying to expand them.

Consider: a sci-if story written by an author with /experience/ writing a crime thriller, will probably be better than a sci-fi story written by someone who has only ever written sci-fi stories.
