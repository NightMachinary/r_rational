Yeah, I've seen a number of negative reviews on Goodreads, and the core of many of them, as well as the review you linked seems to be that Weir did his woman wrong. And I'll grant you, there were annoying places where a supposedly straight female narrator seemed to channel Male Gaze a little bit. And maybe there's some shades of Mary Sue with how hyper-intelligent she is. None of that was a deal breaker for me. As I said in another comment, I like Mark Watney's "voice", and I don't mind that it's chanelled by a woman.
