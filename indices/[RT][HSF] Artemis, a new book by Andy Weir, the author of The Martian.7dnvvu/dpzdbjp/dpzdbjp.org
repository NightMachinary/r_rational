As a counterpoint, check out the [[https://www.avclub.com/the-follow-up-to-the-martian-should-be-shot-into-space-1820231886][AV Club's very critical review]] of the book.

I haven't read the book yet, so I can't speak to the accuracy of the review, but if it rings true it certainly moves the book from a "buy and read now" (based on how much I enjoyed /The Martian/) to a "borrow later and/or read once I've finished some other stuff on my list" category for me.
