Honestly, it sounds like he should have stuck with another "man with (and/or vs.) technology vs. nature" story. I'm guessing he doesn't want to be shoehorned into that genre, but there's something to be said for sticking to your core competency - at least until you have more than one published book to your name.

Writing a /good/ crime thriller is not easy, and it's certainly not in the same wheelhouse as writing speculative survival fiction.
