I don't think Andy Wier requires much introduction in this sub. For me personally, /The Martian/ is one of my favorite books. My impression is that /Artemis/ is very good, although possibly a little bit less interesting since the plot is pretty mundane, just transplanted into an exotic setting. It has the same unique tone of the narration, the protagonist is basically a transplant of Mark Watney, I for one consider it a good thing.
