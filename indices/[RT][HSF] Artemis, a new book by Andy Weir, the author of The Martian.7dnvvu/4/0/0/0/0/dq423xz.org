Right. You'd basically just co-opt all shipbuilding industry on earth, creating these big welded plate monstrosities. The heavier they are, the more stable they would be. Then you just have Pantax hack some of the nuclear devices in the arsenal to have the yield you need. You use really high yield devices once in orbit for the circularizing burn and a really small one from the launch pad. For reasons that are too complex to go into, the performance of Orion actually is fairly crappy in space, but it works incredibly well in the atmosphere.
