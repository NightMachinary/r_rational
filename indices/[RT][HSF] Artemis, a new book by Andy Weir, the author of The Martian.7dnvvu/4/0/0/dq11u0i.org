Also, in Seveneves, nobody even mentions the /word/ Orion drive. Maybe it would have failed, but if you wanted to get as many people and supplies into space as fast as possible, and you had about a year to do it in, launching crudely built spacecraft with nuclear pulse propulsion is the obvious answer. Even if there was a 50% attrition rate during launch, each Orion spacecraft could have massed thousands of tons to orbit.
