I haven't read the others, but I'm not a huge fan of /Seveneves/. The main reason being its last third, which got /weird/, taking us on a tour through the author's bizarre sorta-utopia build out of seven Planets of Hats and two anvils about evils of social media and augmentation. The actual plot of the third part is also highly questionable, narratively speaking, the protagonist does a tour through the utopia, then goes on another plot-demanded trip, they get sidetracked, but happen to stumble upon exactly what they wanted to find, and then some, big revelations, the end. But even if it wasn't for the last third that kinda soured everything, call me shallow, but I found /The Martian's/ survival situation more engaging.
