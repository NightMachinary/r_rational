Honestly, I sort of dislike the Martian. I think taken purely on its own, I would love it, but I read it right after finishing up quite a bit of Neal Stephenson, including Anathem, the Baroque Cycle, and Seveneves. And while it was definitely enjoyable, the quality of writing and number/magnitude of interesting ideas was just so much worse in comparison. It felt like (and effectively was) a young adult adaptation of books like that. And yet it got hilariously more popular.

Not that "less than stellar writing" disqualifies a written work from being good, there's plenty of stuff posted here with pretty poor writing skill but which is nonetheless very enjoyable. But when both are in the specific genre of "humans in the mostly-normal human world working out problems with occasional science/history info dumps", and one is just of so much higher quality, I can't help but feel like the Martian isn't deserving of so much praise.

(It doesn't help that I always hated The Egg)

Somewhat off topic, but what do you guys think? Am I wrong about the quality disparity? Should that be irrelevant when evaluating The Martian?
