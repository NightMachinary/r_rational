This helps to elucidate my observation that the more familiar I am with a comedy, the more the original comedic joy of watching it is replaced with an entirely different-feeling nostalgic joy.

Comedic timing is both very universal and utterly lost in text-based comedy. I don't think it's ever the sole active ingredient in a joke, but it's very commonly a vital one, intensifying comedy severely.
