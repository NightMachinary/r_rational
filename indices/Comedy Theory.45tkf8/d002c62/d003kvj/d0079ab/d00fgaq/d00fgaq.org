Timing and delivery are distinct elements. Consider the following unthinking utterance, and two potential responses:

- A: "... had a bite, then ate my laundry before setting out, but I missed the 5:40."

- B: "Yeah, that'll happen. Remembered your ticket, right?"

- A: "Yup, got it right her-"

- C: "Wait, wait, back up a second. Did you just say you /ate/ your /laundry/?"

- A: "No...?"

- B: "Actually, I think you did. Hadn't had your fill, eh?"

- A: "Sod off, I meant I did my laundry. Let's get going."

- C: "Right-o, laundry-boy."

- A: "... had a bite, then ate my laundry before setting out, but I missed the 5:40."

- B: "...You ate your laundry."

- C: "Oh, no, not again."

- A: "No, I didn-"

- B: "He's done this before?"

- C: "Yes, don't you remember? Just this Tuesday last we had a long, insightful conversation about it over the phone."

- A: "Of course you did."

- B: "Ahh! How could I forget! Now we know he wasn't just confused when he ate the bear rug."

- A: "I don't have a bear rug."

- C: "Yeah; you ate it."

The first scenario relies entirely on delivery to be even remotely funny - it's belatedly timed, and context alone won't elicit much of a laugh if the initial absurdity wasn't noticed straight-off.

The second scenario has a timing-sensitive witticism at the end, which would be funny with any delivery said in a conversational tone - granted, fine delivery could improve the rejoinder's hilarity, but without proper timing C's will flop, making timing a distinct element from delivery.

Everything after your first three sentences I agree with, for what it's worth.
