  The difference between a good joke told well and a good joke told poorly is the difference between a good speech delivered by a master orator and a good speech delivered by someone who needs a public speaking class.

Oh, that totally makes sense, I can agree with that. I guess that for my practical purposes(crafting funny jokes for writing and for my webcomics) this wasn't necessary, and that didn't seem to be at the core of what comedy IS, what makes it work, what is the central thing that makes things funny.

  Are you by any chance on the autism spectrum?
#+end_quote

I don't know that I am, but I kinda wish I was)) It's just that all the autistic people I know are geniuses and I really want to be like them. I do have some asperger-like traits, but I wasn't diagnosed with anything, so for all I know it's just my personality.

I completely agree with everything else that you've said, from that perspective I also think that timing is important, I just disagree when people say that this is what makes things funny.
