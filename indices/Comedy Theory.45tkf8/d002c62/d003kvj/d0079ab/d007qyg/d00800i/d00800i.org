It's not "what makes things funny" in the sense that it's the base ingredient of everything, but it is an important ingredient that is very common (absent from all non-realtime sources of comedy, omnipresent in all realtime sources of comedy) and enough to sink or sell a joke. Analyzing your timing-based reactions to comedy is important even if you're only writing non-realtime comedy, because it helps you to understand the comedic theory.
