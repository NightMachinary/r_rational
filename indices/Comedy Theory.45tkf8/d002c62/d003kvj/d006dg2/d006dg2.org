Jokes made in a social environment in which their purpose is to lower someone's status by shaming them, or to diffuse tension by making light of a previous offensive/controversial/insulting comment, etc.

In all those cases, the jokes must come chronologically close to the issue it addresses. In those cases, a large portion of the humor and impact of the joke comes from the quickness of the person responding-- hence the expression "quick-witted".
