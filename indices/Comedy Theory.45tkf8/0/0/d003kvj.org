Thank you for your reply!

The framework I'm talking about does completely ignore the issue of timing. To me personally, it never seemed to make sense.

Here's my argument:

In my experience, most of the jokes I've encountered, don't change much when the timing is removed or messed up. In my opinion, the transcribed stand up routine won't lose much of it's essence. I mean it's certainly more entertaining to watch than to read, and it's better when it's performed/delivered well, but when the jokes stand alone, they are still recognizable as jokes, and have pretty much the same effect. I think that timing may affect the mood and quality of the delivery, but the essence of a good joke will remain the same, and will still generate the response even if told by a person who has no idea what "timing" means.

But I am very interested in talking about this. Can you come up with some examples of the jokes where timing is crucial?
