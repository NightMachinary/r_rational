Both of the other replies are missing the point of what "comedic timing" refers to. It's not a macroscopic context issue. It's a microscopic delivery issue. The difference between a good joke told well and a good joke told poorly is the difference between a good speech delivered by a master orator and a good speech delivered by someone who needs a public speaking class. The difference between a bad joke told well and a bad joke told poorly is the difference between a fun dumb movie and an unfun dumb movie.

Are you by any chance on the autism spectrum? That's very common around here; I am myself. Difficulty grasping certain aspects of communicative skills is commonly associated with such a condition. In terms of your comedic theory, the skill of telling a joke is the same as any other communicative skill. Once you've established the series of ideas you want to convey, you need to figure out how to convey them.

Writing the joke is one level of this communication, but there's a finer level still involved in communicating it - by telling the joke at the correct speed, with pauses inserted appropriately and so forth, you can further maximize the percentage of your audience who get "hit" by the joke at the correct points in their train of thought. You need to see things from your audience's perspective and hit them with the punchline at the point when it has the best impact. One of the most basic joke formats non-communicable in text is an interrupted pause, and there must be an exact science to figuring out how long to let the pause go on before interrupting it.
