I think we can break down "unexpected" here into related but discrete concepts. It's hard enough that I can't do it spur of the moment now, at least not cleanly, but the fact that the audience expects advice to stop masturbating to be discussing it in general is distinct from the fact that the audience expects the person not to be masturbating while consulting with their doctor. And where the activity in question can be most anything for the first one, it matters a great deal for the second. Working on mathematics in your doctor's office might be a little odd but isn't really /out there/; fire juggling might do better.

There's also an element of plausibility in set-up. A doctor advising someone to stop doing maths is strange enough on its own that it might fail to establish an expectation.
