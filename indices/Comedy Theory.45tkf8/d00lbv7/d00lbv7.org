I think you should qualify that this theory is only about 1 type of comedy, while there are many more(i.e. situational comedy, the fact that some words are just inherently funny).

And this comes into play even in one of the examples you gave,

#+begin_quote
  Doctor's appointment. The doctor says “You're gonna have to stop masturbating.” The patient says “But why!?” The doctor says “So I can examine you.”
#+end_quote

When going over my thought process about this joke for example, i found the "unexpectedness" of the suggestion to be hardly 10-20% of what was funny, while the situation described itself is much funnier.

In a way I could see how on a lower level part of what makes the situation funny is the "wrongdness" of it, which again in a way is "unexpected". but i think it is still missing a lot, because plenty of things which are "wrong" or "unexpected" will not be funny. in this example, if you replaced the action of the patient with "jump rope" it would still be somewhat funny, on the other hand if you replaced it with "solving mathematical equations" it would be significantly less funny.
