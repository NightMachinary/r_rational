Your method is similar to some techniques used in /Comedy Writing Workbook/ by Gene Perret. I highly recommend it if you're interested in practical aspects of writing jokes.

Also Scott Adams' Six Dimensions of Humor could explain some things.

  My observation was that you have to use at least two of the six dimensions to be recognized as humor. You can use more than two dimensions for even better results, but two is the minimum. And it does not matter which dimensions you combine. I have written extensively on this topic, so today I will just list the six dimensions and tell you that you need two of them: Naughty, Clever, Cute, Bizarre, Mean, Recognizable

So, according to this formula, taboo jokes are easier to make because they include two dimensions before you even start writing.

There's also defense mechanism aspect of humor that many types of comedy exploits. You laugh because alternative is being angry or terrified.
