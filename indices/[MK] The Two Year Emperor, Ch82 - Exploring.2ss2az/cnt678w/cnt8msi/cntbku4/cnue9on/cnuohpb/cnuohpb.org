Well, if I /were/ planning something that heinous, I would probably respond by saying something about "just getting over a mental breakdown", or...ah...oh, "one level higher" (that's always a good one around here), or maybe "Jesus, just enjoy the +movie+ book and say ten MST3K mantras and have a nice lie-down". (Well, ok, maybe not that last one. (*))

Of course, I am absolutely categorically NOT, I repeat NOT, planning anything that heinous as far as you know for sure.

(*) I've been watching a bit too much of the ridiculously funny and VERY foul-mouthed (NSFW) "zero punctuation" channel on YouTube and apparently I'm channeling Yahtzee. Sorry about that.
