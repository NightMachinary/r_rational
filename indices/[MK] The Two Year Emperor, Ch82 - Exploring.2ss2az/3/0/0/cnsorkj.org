Stands are from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, whole Personas are from... Persona. Basically, both are sets of themed superpowers embodied in spirit guardians, designed to counterbalance each other, one power per card per wielder. They're part of sort of a subgenre of story setups where the protagonist gets a power and then is told that X other people in the world also got different unique powers and now they have to fighht to the death because reasons- very Highlander-esque.

Generally, works in this slightly nebulous genre have powersets which tend to be slightly more unique than regular comicbook characters. For example, one character in JJBA basically has the power to turn anything he touches into a time-delayed explosive. Another character can attack your reflection in a mirror, inflicting damage to you without being near you. The appeal of the genre lies partially in how the protagonist works their way around such seemingly OP powers with tricks and clever utilization of their own card, which is partially why I was reminded of the genre.
