The entirety of JJBA can be found as a manga if you google it online. The latest anime adaptation of JJBA, Stardust Crusaders, is pretty cool too; it's the third manga volume, and the first to introduce the concept of the 'Stand' as a framework for explaining the powers. Here's a video that, I feel, sums up the entirety of JJBA's appeal to people in a very short clip:

If you laughed your ass off at this like I did, I bet you'd like the rest Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

As for other works. I... honestly can't think of anything else offhand that matches every requirement, but the basic idea of 'sets of weird powers with the same fundamental source fighting against each other' shows up a lot in japanese works, I've noticed. I may get back to you if I think of something else in the near future.
