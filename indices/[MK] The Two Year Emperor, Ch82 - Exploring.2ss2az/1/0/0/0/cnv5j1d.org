Thanks for letting me know. Book 2 is very different from Book 1 -- I'm trying to stretch my writing abilities in new directions, so it's probably going to start off a bit rocky.

Hopefully the upcoming few chapters will be more satisfying for you; Suze started off a bit batty because of the strain of her new senses / powers / worship requirement, but is starting to get a handle on it and I'll be going back more to the problem-solving part of things. Please do let me know periodically; it's hard to improve without feedback...ideally constructive-but-negative feedback.
