My interpretation has always been that the rules say "if you put a Bag of Holding in a Portable Hole...." They do /not/ say "if you put something that works like a Bag of Holding in a Portable Hole...."

I did this for GrÇ«fhamr as well -- the whole place is made of Portable Holes, but the Landguard walked in with their Handy Haversacks no problem. Albrecht hadn't even /heard/ of Bags of Holding or their bad interaction with PHs; he was appalled that anyone would invent such a thing.
