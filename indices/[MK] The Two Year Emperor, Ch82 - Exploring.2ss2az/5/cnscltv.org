This is one of those things that depends on interpretation, but I always thought that for a handy haversack: "each [pocket] is like a bag of holding" would mean that it responds similarly to portable holes.

You might be able to place a bag of holding in a handy haversack. Rope trick states that "It is hazardous to create an extradimensional space within an existing extradimensional space or to take an extradimensional space into an existing one." But, bags of holding are nondimensional rather than extradimensional.

Anyway, aside from rules lawyering, I enjoyed this chapter, I think the pace is picking up again and you're back into the swing of things.
