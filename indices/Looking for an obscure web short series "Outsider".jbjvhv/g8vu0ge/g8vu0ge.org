I'm familiar with it. It's been linked to on this subreddit, [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/43zh8p/rst_outsider_ep_16_first_contact_visual_novel/][here]]'s a past discussion thread.

But it appears the videos have been taken down. I'm not sure if anyone has backups. Perhaps we should ask the author, [[/u/danielrpa][u/danielrpa]]?
