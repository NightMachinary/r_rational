Hello all, thank you very much for the interest (and, wow, finding the original thread!). I had nothing but poor experiences with youtube due to the background music that played along the text. Constant nagging for copyright claims on music that was freely usable (even for commercial applications) AND for which I had permission from the author, to whom I even donated some money.

That story was condensed to begin with. I need to revise it, find new music, but unfortunately life has made it hard for me to find the needed time. Covid didn't help either, which sounds counter-intuitive but true nonetheless. But worry not, I haven't forgotten about it!

Thanks again!
