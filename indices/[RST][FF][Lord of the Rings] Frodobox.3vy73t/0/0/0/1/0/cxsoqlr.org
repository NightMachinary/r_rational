I feel the same way. I was thinking about it one day: how it is possible to destroy the One Ring in this universe? My best solution was to recruit Saruman and genetically engineer dragons with a flame hot enough to melt the One:

  It has been said that dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of Power, but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the One Ring, the Ruling Ring, for that was made by Sauron himself.

This passage isn't very encouraging per se, but it leaves the possibility of creating artificial superhot flame sources (maybe with dragon and some sort of industrial scale bellows).

Also, did I mention that Balrogs are Maiar, so Durin's Bane is a creature form the same tier as Sauron, Gandalf and Saruman? It looks plausible that Balrog could melt the One... or decide to keep it to itself, and then wreak a havoc on a Middle-Earth.
