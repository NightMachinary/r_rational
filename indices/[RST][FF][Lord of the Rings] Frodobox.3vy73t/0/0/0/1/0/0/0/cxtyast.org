Unless "fast enough that it can't be intercepted" means /exactly/ fast enough so that you have to speed up for 100% of the trip, you should be able to speed up the rocket, toss the ring out, and slow down/change trajectory. The ring will continue on the trajectory of the rocket as of the time you thrw it out the window.
