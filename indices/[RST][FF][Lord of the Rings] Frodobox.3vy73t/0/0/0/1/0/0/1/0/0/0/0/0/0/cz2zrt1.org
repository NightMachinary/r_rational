I didn't mention it, but at least one (large) continent /was/ removed from the world as well. And placed... somewhere. Except you can still sail to it. Provided you are an Elf or a Wizard. Or Bilbo or Frodo, who get special permission. Or Sam or Gimli, who /maybe/ do. If anyone not on the list sneaks on board of an Elven ship going there, it'll just sail around the world. See above re magic. [[/twipbbt][]]

  but I'm sure people would have noticed when they started needing to update all their maps...

Oh, they did notice it /was/ possible to sail around the world now. The weird thing is that the geography of the continent LotR takes place on apparently didn't change.

Sorry, no way to talk to him while remaining inside the universe unless you happen to be the chief angel (and if you can get outside, you'll kind of die). On the other hand, it's possible he already did this while turning the world round, though not explicitly mentioned (as you say, it /is/ supposed to become our Earth eventually).
