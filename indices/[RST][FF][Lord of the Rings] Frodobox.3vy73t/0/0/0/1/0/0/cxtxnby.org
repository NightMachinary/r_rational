  I feel the same way. I was thinking about it one day: how it is possible to destroy the One Ring in this universe?

Simple. Throw it into the Sun.

- The Sun is hotter than Mount Doom. If Mount Doom is hot enough to unmake the Ring, then so is the Sun.
- The Sun has a surface area about ten million times the surface area of the Earth, and any point on that surface will do. Sauron cannot /possibly/ have the troops to guard even a tiny fraction of a percent of it.
- Gandalf's magic can throw things around. This can be used as a reactionless thrust for steering the rocket.
- Ten minutes' conversation between Gandalf and a Ring-bearer should give Gandalf enough information to create a simple rocket, suitable for a single one-way trip to the Sun. (Gandalf already has fireworks).
- The rocket will, of course, need to carry a small crew, in case Sauron has some surprises prepared in orbit. Fortunately, since he would be expecting either an expedition to Mount Doom or the use of the Ring on the battlefield, he is unlikely to devote much resources to this remote possibility - especially since, as the rocket can launch from anywhere, it is hard to know where to intercept it.
- The crew will need to consist of, at the very minimum, Gandalf for steering purposes, a Ring-bearer, and a few others to keep an eye on each other and make sure that the Ring gets destroyed. If the crew is /extremely/ lucky, Gandalf may be able to find some way to turn the rocket around after the Ring is dropped into the Sun; however, it is almost inevitable that the crew will perish with the Ring. (I doubt this will stop the Fellowship from making the attempt).
- Once the rocket /has/ launched, it will be necessary to keep Sauron's Eye fixed firmly on the ground for as long as possible; a single glance skyward might easily result in the frantic construction of interception rockets all through Mordor. (Sauron will /not/ be expecting the craft not to turn around and come back, so he's likely to design any intercepters to try to catch the Fellowship only after they try to slow down - by the time he figures out that they're not planning on slowing down, it'll likely be too late to intercept them)
