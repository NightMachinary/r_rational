  Consider a triangle with vertices in far-distant places, like the Shire. Mordor and... um... Lothlorien. (Or any three far-distant places on the same continent which are not colinear). In changing from a flat to a spherical world, the three angles of that triangle must change.

Of course. What I meant is that changes weren't large enough to be mentioned by Tolkien, not that it didn't change at all.
