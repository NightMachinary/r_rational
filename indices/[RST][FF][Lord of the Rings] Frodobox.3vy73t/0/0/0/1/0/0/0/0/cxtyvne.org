While a force large enough to prevent the Ring being thrown into the Sun can't exist, a small contingent of orcs with perhaps a single Nazgul to provide steering /could/ wait in fairly close orbit around the Sun and intercept anything on a ballistic trajectory - assuming they have enough time to see it coming. So the Fellowship of the Ring will want to maintain the ability to see what's around and steer around it until they're close enough to the Sun to be sure that the Ring can't be intercepted.

At the same time, if Sauron ever catches wind of this plan, one or more orcish space programs could start up - they just need to accelerate /more/ than the Ring, catch up, and launch the Ring away from the Sun (another set of orcs can pick it up and return it to Sauron). Speeding up 100% of the time /dramatically/ reduces the odds of interception (at the same time, it increases the fuel requirements and thus reduces the initial acceleration of the rocket - some calculation would be necessary to find the optimal amount of fuel). Turning around requires carrying extra fuel without increasing the odds of destroying the Ring.

  Also, depending on how magic works, you could conjure some U-235 or antimatter. Nuclear explosions are hotter than volcanoes.

You would need to know about the properties of U-235 or antimatter. I don't see anywhere that the Ring provides extra knowledge about physics, it merely (and dramatically) increases intelligence, and I don't think Middle-Earths physicists have got that far yet.
