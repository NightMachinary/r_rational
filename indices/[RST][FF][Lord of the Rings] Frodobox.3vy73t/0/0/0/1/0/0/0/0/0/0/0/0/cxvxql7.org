[[/hmmm][]] You might be able to skimp a bit on the infrastructure by using magic - such as, for example, having Gandalf act as the steering rockets - and you can of course skimp a lot more if you don't care about being able to launch a second craft, don't care whether your launch site survives, and don't bother to include any means for the astronauts to return... then you just basically need an airtight box and a whole lot of gunpowder.
