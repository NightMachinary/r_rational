Keep in mind that the scene in the movie with Elrond telling Isilidur to throw it in is an invention of the movies and it didn't happen that way in the books...

Also, what is the backstory to this alternate universe? Gollum I can imagine makes sense as he planned the optimal strategy for keeping the ring was to hide in the mountain. But I can't imagine how the rest of the Hobbit would have played out. Did Bilbo manipulate Smaug with the plan he formed with the ring? If the ring is as super corrupting as this version is, why did he ever take it off? How did Sauron lose in the first place... actually thinking about that question I wonder if Gandalf does have some move for destroying it and if Frodo isn't being outplayed.
