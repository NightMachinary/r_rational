  The weird thing is that the geography of the continent LotR takes place on apparently didn't change.

[[/twiponder][]] That's not weird. That's geometrically impossible. Unless (a) the LOTR world was previously on some positively-curved but non-spherical geometry or (b) it ended up becoming a torus instead of a sphere.

Consider a triangle with vertices in far-distant places, like the Shire. Mordor and... um... Lothlorien. (Or any three far-distant places on the same continent which are not colinear). In changing from a flat to a spherical world, the three angles of that triangle /must/ change.

(Or, (c), the continent remains flat and just grows really big cliffs on all sides, but then the direction of perceived gravity on the outer edges will shift somewhat, rivers will start to flow towards the centre of the continent, and people will have to find paths down the cliffs in order to use ships at all).

  Sorry, no way to talk to him while remaining inside the universe unless you happen to be the chief angel (and if you can get outside, you'll kind of die).

[[/a23][]] Ah, that at least is no problem, The persuasion does not have to be /verbal/, the Ring-bearer simply needs to arrange for the universe to be such that God will turn the Sun into a giant nuclear furnace. This may require persuading the Chief Angel to have a word...
