Okay, I can see what you were going for here - a cautionary tale of a boxed superintelligence escaping from said Box.

The thing is, I don't think you quite got it. To be fair, I'm not sure that it's /possible/ to quite get it.

I think - and this is purely my impression - that if you want to get what I think you were aiming for, then the impression you need to leave with your readers is not "the Council was tossing around the Idiot Ball" but rather "okay, I can see that they made the wrong decision from my privileged position outside the story, but I can understand /why/ they made it" (or, better yet, "okay, I can see that they made the wrong decision, but they didn't have any choice").

As it stands, I can see a lot of very simple ways by which the Council could have stopped the Ringbearer. First and simplest, is for Gandalf to stick with what he said - that he will not unparalyze Frodo until the Ring is removed (that is to say, to make Gandalf's precommitment binding). A second important point is raised by Elrond - "This idea depends solely on the word of the one who wears the Ring and one who wore it" - and /never answered/. Instead the word of one who /wears/ the ring makes promises - tempting promises, but the core objection, that their source is /one who wears the Ring/, is discarded and laid aside. One would think Elrond would spot that; one would think Gandalf would see that. That both of them promptly forget that point, /after/ it has been brought up, seems a clear indication that there's an Idiot Ball in the room.
