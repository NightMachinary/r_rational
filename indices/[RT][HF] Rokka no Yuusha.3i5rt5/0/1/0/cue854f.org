My process was:

1) Deduce that you've probably used Reddit to share or promote your book.

2) Click your username

3) See a post in [[/r/Fantasy]]

4) Assume like most authors you would have your book or name in your flair.

5) Click context on a [[/r/Fantasy]] post

6) See that I was right about 4

At this point I wanted to know the book so:

7) Google 'Andrew Rowe'

8) Assume you don't play professional hockey

9) Google 'Andrew Rowe writer'

10) Find reddit post about book from author Andrew Rowe

11) double check usernames to verify
