You know, it occurs to me that only Iliya's enemy died without Nathan's direct involvement. Nathan dealt the killing blow to the frogs who killed Alexander, and downed two others himself early in the ambush. The runner is Lilly's first opponent.

If Nathan kills the runner, /he'll have five PvP kills/. That may well give him a heck of a reward.
