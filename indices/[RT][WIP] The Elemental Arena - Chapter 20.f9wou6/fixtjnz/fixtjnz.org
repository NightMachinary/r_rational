That played out a little different than I expected. As soon as the croaking started I knew they were gonna be players (since wandering mobs haven't been a thing this stage) but I was thinking they would slaughter them all and Nathan would only figure it out afterwards from the Analyze Enemy profile.

It's too bad he had to use Snare, I'm guessing he didn't use analyze on the downed enemy (before realizing they were players) to save up for a possible First Aid.

For a first encounter they did pretty damn well given the range of possible outcomes. The frogs seemed to be better leveled for combat given almost all their members had either a defensive or concealment skill. Trying for a diplomatic route could have gotten them all killed by invisible ambush.

Now, if I had to guess I would think that the Languages skill will actually be pretty important in future stages if it's upgrade allows the player to speak all the /other species'/ most common language, not just their own. Every group will have a designated diplomat or something.

It'll be interesting if Nathan tries to rally the group and hunt down the runner. It's probably the best possible option that would even keep diplomacy in the future open, if none of the frogs know their first contact ended in a slaughter. Just one more hunting party overwhelmed by the wave...
