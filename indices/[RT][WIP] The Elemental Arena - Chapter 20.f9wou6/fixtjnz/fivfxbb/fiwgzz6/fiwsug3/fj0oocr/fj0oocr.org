I was expecting the settlement to continue growing and simply fill up with nameless strangers who stay off-camera. From a narrative perspective, I agree that it makes sense to focus down to only the handful of people closest to Nathan.

Speaking of which, I'd love to see more Asahi. If that guy had been with Nathan's group, the PvP would have been a complete victory and Alexander would still be alive.
