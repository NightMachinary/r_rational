Another new game facet unlocked, but one we all knew was coming.

Obviously, chasing down and ending their last enemy is a huge priority. Once this is done, Iliya needs to be helped.

Instant death seems to have a mechanism involving a connection between the brain and the heart. When this is broken, either by severing the head, or else by sufficient damage to the neck, heart, or brain, the creature immediately pixelates.

Depending on the award for PvP, healing Iliya by gaining a Physical stat will probably be possible, but will cause horrible scarring. /First Aid I/ could help with this, but would take some time and EPs that Nathan currently lacks.

Nathan is very close to being able to pick up /First Aid II/. NP awards for PvP have got to be substantial, and they've just defeated five, maybe six (the runner should count) enemy players.

- It's likely the game will give them 5+ NPs and a random reward for their first PvP encounter on top of this.

- On top of this, there is almost certainly a per-player NP award.

- /Wood Mastery I/ skill should grant Nathan 2+ additional NPs and bump his Mental stat to 124.

- /Camouflage I/ (pretty theoretical) skill will hopefully do the same, raising Mental to 125.

- Nathan would then be able to obtain /First Aid II/ skill, reducing the cost. If it scales down like /Attack Up II/, the cost would drop from 20 down to 16 EPs.

- Alternatively, Lilly could apply analgesic mush to Iliya's face, gain /First Aid I/ skill, and activate that on Iliya. She probably lacks the EPs as well, though, since she created the outhouse and used her defensive skills in the fight.

- Maybe both could activate /First Aid I/ together, allowing them to pool EPs?
