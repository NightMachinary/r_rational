The first building is only a benefit for those humans who participated in it, not the entire region's members of the species. (Side note: they really need to recruit more people to create their settlement. This will give more people the reward, give new people the one-time 5 NP bonus for contributing to a building, and finally, reduce the NP cost per person to make a settlement.)

Now that we have a better idea of what region 14's layout is from Ava's /Maps I/ skill, we know that there are eight racial starting areas arranged around a central area with the dungeon.

Naively, the odds are about 62.5% that a species' starting area would include an Obelisk. It's still incredible fortune that Nathan and his crew happened across one when they did, and that it was as close as it was to their camp.
