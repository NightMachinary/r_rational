I'm really not getting that vibe. The human population of the Arena is continuing to go through a collapse. There are two achievements we've seen, and only one - the Obelisk of Fire - goes to Team Human. We don't know about the other four implied obelisks, but we've seen at least one other species is aggressively exploring the region.

The frogmen themselves don't seem particularly impressive, but still appear to be physically superior to humans. Their strength is on-par with ours, and they have better natural weapons and armor.
