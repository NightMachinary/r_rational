As the author, I won't confirm anything one way or the other or even say if I'm misleading or not, but will put some ideas out there based on what the players know or don't know, so I won't spoil anything.

If there is a 12.5% chance of the humans gaining any one particular achievement (1 out of 8 competitors), that means there is a 87.5% chance that any other given achievement will go to a different alien species, all else being equal. Since there hasn't been a single notification regarding anything any other alien group has been doing, its very possible, statistically likely even, that humans just don't receive notifications about aliens and their achievements. Of course, until they receive confirmation either way, its up in the air. Tygerion's game design style tends to air on the side of making the players figure things out for themselves.

About the only theory crafting about achievements that happens in the text is by Maya, who suggests that the aliens are likely gaining their own achievements too since humans hadn't gotten a first reward for anything else before buying a building (not counting the Obelisk mini-game).

We've only seen one of the seven enemy species so far and they weren't pushovers. They had an array of combat skills which they didn't hesitate to use, two gladius style swords not seen yet, strong natural defenses, and some stealth abilities the humans don't have or had no idea even existed. That's all the human players, and by extension the readers, know yet in how they compare to their rivals.
