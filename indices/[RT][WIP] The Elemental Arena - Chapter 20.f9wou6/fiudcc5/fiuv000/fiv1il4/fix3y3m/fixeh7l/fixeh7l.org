I've been thinking over the frogmen. The crocodilian features - claws and teeth - suggest they're carnivores. A food foraging party makes sense - but they were not following the creek to get crayfish. The nearby forest is human starting territory.

The most sensible explanation I can come up with for the frogmen's activity is for them to be /hunting humans/. Securing their border might also be sensible, but they seemed fairly oblivious. Maybe their senses aren't as good as a human's?
