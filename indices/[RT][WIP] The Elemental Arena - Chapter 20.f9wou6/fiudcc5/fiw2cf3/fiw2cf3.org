I thought he was at 39 EPs before the ambush and used Attack Up once at the start for a cost of 13 EPs, leaving him with 26 and enough to use First Aid?

Edit: Oh, whoops I forgot he used Snare, so he's only at 10 EP, meaning it will be ~15 minutes until he can use First Aid, unless the rewards were enough for him to level it up like you said.
