Iliya herself may be able to learn and use /First Aid I/, but it would be incredibly traumatic, and she'd have to somehow avoid picking up a new physical skill (which the game may simply reward for winning a PvP encounter).

/<Element> Mastery I/ is looking like a big priority for pretty much everyone.

- In particular, /Equipment Fusion I/ skill will probably produce even higher quality weapons while reducing the skill's cost.

- /Buildings I/ may well see a reduction in EP cost for collapsing structures for movement as well as initial activation.

- /Advanced Healing I/ may see an increase in the healing rate acceleration.
