The human players we see don't know about any other 1st-time benefits obtained by anyone else of any species in the region. They only know about the first building and Obelisk of Fire. There isn't much there to inform an opinion about who is getting the most rewards.

Regarding /Buildings I/:

- Frogmen don't need shelter, especially if they sleep in or under water, or not at all. Other species may also simply not need buildings the way we soft-skinned humans do.

- Competitors could be hyper-aggressive, having the attitude that they will simply take what they need from others.

- Competitors of huge size may be so desperate for food that they must constantly hunt.

- Competitors could be faring even less well than humanity. Smaller, less physical beings could well have been eradicated by the first Horned Beaver to spawn on them.

Heck, the only reason humanity even tried building shelter in the first place is Harrison's desire to get himself a little love shack.

The game /is/ rigged to favor humanity. Tygerion is human, and may well know something about the competitors. This is part of the overall plot, much like Nathan's knowledge of game balance and design.
