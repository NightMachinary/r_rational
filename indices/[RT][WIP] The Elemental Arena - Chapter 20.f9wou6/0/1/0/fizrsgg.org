Speaking of PvP rewards, I can see a few directions to take them.

- A flat NP award per kill. This doesn't reflect variable enemy strength, so I doubt it's being used.

- A percentage of total lifetime NPs earned by the victim. This seems more sensible to me, but ignores skills and other rewards earned from the system.

- Gain one or more game reward (i.e. skills, affinity, armor, weapon) the victim was benefiting from. Armor and weapons pixelated on the victim would be resized.

- A ranked PvP ladder with periodic rewards for the top positions.

- Any of the above, and gain a copy of the victim's Wristband Interface log. This could make /Language II/ or higher far more important to pick up, especially if their log contains info from their victims.
