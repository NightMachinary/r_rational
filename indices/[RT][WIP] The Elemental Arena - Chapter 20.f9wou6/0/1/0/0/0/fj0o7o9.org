There are a few mitigating factors.

- The percentage need not be that large. 25% of lifetime NPs might be huge, but 5% of Nathan's NPs would be close to the full NP award for defeating a mutant bear.

- PvP is far more dangerous than PvE. Enemies can ambush you, run away, fight dirty, and in general be far more versatile than the usual monsters. Higher NP rewards for this increased risk make sense.

- Healing is at a premium in the Arena. Maimed players might rapidly recover from trauma, but scarring or missing limbs will remain an issue (on human players, in any case).

Ultimately, things come down to the uncertain goals behind the Arena itself. Only one species from each starting region will survive, and the philosophy behind the game looks very similar to an MMO RPG. Big rewards for PvP look to be in line with what we've seen before.

Also, consider that early builders got a free rank in their prime elemental affinity. The game seems to be set up to greatly reward early innovation.
