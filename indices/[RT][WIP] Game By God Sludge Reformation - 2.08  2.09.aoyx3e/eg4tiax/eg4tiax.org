Maybe I'm not understanding something, but the FAQ talks about Brick Nozick as if it's something well-understood and a common meme. A google search for "Brick Nozick" yields nothing except the FAQ themselves (except a review of Anarchy, State, and Utopia by Robert Nozick, which I'm assuming is irrelevant but could be some weird inside joke thing). Anyone have any ideas if this is a weird clue or something?
