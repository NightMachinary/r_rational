Hmm. I have an idea.

--------------

[[/u/teddy_teddy_teddy][u/teddy_teddy_teddy]], we're not sure what Brick Nozick is: we know neither the nature of this meme, nor its origins. You have previously stated that questions about Brick Nozick upset you. Consider the following:

- If you will continue to not answer these questions, it will only lead to more questions of this nature in the future, as new readers come in and start asking what "Brick Nozick" is, and as old readers continue to /speculate/ what it is, trying to find clues in the story.

- If you will answer /one/ of these questions --- for example, this one --- the readers' curiosity will be mostly satiated, people will link to your explanation whenever someone starts asking what it is, and I personally would assist in convincing other people to stop making jokes regarding Brick Nozick.

- Even in the edge-case where "What is Brick Nozick?" is part of the Brick Nozick meme --- which, I repeat, we honestly do not know, a possibility you must at least consider --- answering our question will only decrease the amount of future Brick Nozick jokes, as memers become satisfied or possibly stop pestering you directly and start joking among each other.

As such, I would like you to post a reply to this comment, with the following properties:

1. It contains an explanation regarding what you believe Brick Nozick to be, such that it would give us as thorough an understanding of this concept as you yourself possess.

2. The reply is posted within the next 168 hours.

3. The reply won't be deleted or modified after being posted.

To motivate you further:

If you will not comply with this request, I will be asking you to switch the site to Brick Nozick every 1D6 weeks. Neither of us wants that.
