I ended up reading all the novels up to the fourth and really disappointed by it due to MC's squeamishness throughout the entire series. It doesn't help the fact that he knows nothing about anything unless its guns because he doesn't know any sort of fantasy or comic books to draw from in a fantasy setting. Its frankly annoying. Not to mention thats there's slightly NTR. ugh
