Not quite "modern human transported to alt earth," more "extremely competent and well-trained modern humans try to bring back magic using time travel": /The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O./ by Neal Stephenson.

A professor of ancient languages is recruited by a secret branch of the US military to translate scattered fragments that seem to point towards magic having at one point existed in the world. Also written as an epistolary novel which is great fun.
