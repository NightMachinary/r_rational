Can't find a book by the name of A Hero's Journey, did you mean [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329][A Hero's War]]? If not, then that's a recommendation from me.

Here on Reddit, there's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/61ya08/oh_this_has_not_gone_well/][Oh This Has Not Gone Well]], a story that started strong enough but kinda... changed its mind on where it was going multiple times, and every turn made it less appropriate for this topic. I mostly lost interest around chapter 80, but keep reading out of habit and because the chapters are really short.

More stories of similar quality are listed in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/6amn32/meta_looking_for_stories_like_this_has_not_gone/][this]] post.
