Most books by Eric Frank Russell could kinda qualify, starting with Wasp.

I see Dr Stone has been recommended already. If you like it you might also love The Blue World by Jack Vance, it is a short read, about descendants of spaceship-wrecked humans figuring out science on a world with no land at all (no obvious, mass mineral resources whatsoever).

And then there is the Tschai series (Planet of adventure), by Jack Vance too, where a near-future human astronaut ends up stranded on a multi-sentient species alien world and works his way towards going back home. Not spoiling it but he ends up having a huge effect on the present civilizations.
