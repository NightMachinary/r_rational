I'd clarify that A) someone else already came and did as much uplifting as they could, but that was five hundred years before the story starts and B) the present-day of the story is roughly equivalent to 1930s in most respects, so there's just less room to uplift and C) most of the uplifting that's left to do hasn't happened in story yet, since what's left takes longer, there are unique circumstances, and the focus is on leveraging first-mover advantages rather than generally improving society and D) yes, so far most of it is off-screen.
