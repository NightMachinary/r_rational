You might like this then: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic][Dao of Magic]] It doesn't really take itself seriously, bordering on crack-fic, but not completely. The world of qi is getting progressively more fleshed out by way of implications and interaction with physics and other energies, rather than adding a Thousand More Even Higher Spiritual Quality Plants and Ancienter Beasts. Personally, I dropped it recently because it's not good enough to keep track of its plot together with other web serials I'm juggling, but it's a fresh take for sure. MC is mostly using modern concepts and science to make most of qi, not, like, building factories and industrializing plebeian masses, if that's what you were looking for, but there are uplifting themes too.
