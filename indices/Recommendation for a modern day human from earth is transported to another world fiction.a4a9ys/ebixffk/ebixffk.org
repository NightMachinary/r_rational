[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-song-of-ice-and-fires-that-werent-all-my-fault-asoiaf-dresden-files.336499/][A Song of Ice and Fires That Weren't All My Fault]] is a pretty good ASOIAF/Dresden Files crossover which does a fantastic job of showing how the Dresdenverse magic system can revolutionize a sufficiently unadvanced world. You do at least have to have read the Dresden Files to get it, though I have not read ASOIAF and still enjoyed it quite a lot.
