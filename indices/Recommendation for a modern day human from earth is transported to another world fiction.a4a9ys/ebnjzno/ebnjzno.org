I like the Wandering Inn [[https://wanderinginn.com/]],

Though a lot of what I like about it puts it at the edge of your category as most of the impact the main character has is relatively local rather than world warping, and is social/cultural not industrial.

​

The Schooled in Magic series [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/128629-schooled-in-magic]] is also good and more directly what you described.
