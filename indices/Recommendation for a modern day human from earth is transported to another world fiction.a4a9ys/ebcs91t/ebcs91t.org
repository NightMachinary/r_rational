- Dr. Stone: The main character is a very precocious teen who has to rebuild civilisation from the ground up, with plot arcs running in parallel with the completion of different projects. This definitely meets your criterion of having other people involved with their own skills, and I enjoyed how they presented the ways different technologies are interlinked, but you may find the larger-than-life personalities, rapid pace of development, and strokes of good luck off-putting. First chapter spoilers: This doesn't strictly count as transport to another world, because the characters are instead petrified by a mysterious cataclysm and reawaken after millennia.
- How to invent everything: Subtitled "A survival guide for the stranded time traveller", this book by Ryan North is nonfiction but might still appeal to your tastes

Also, you might want to take a look at the TvTropes pages for [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManIndustrialRevolution][One-man industrial revolution]] and [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GivingRadioToTheRomans][Giving Radio to the Romans]], which have a lot more examples that I haven't read
