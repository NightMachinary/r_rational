I'be read it and i'm impatiently waiting for it to come off hiatus, but I wouldn't classify it as "xianxia." Soft xianxia maybe? I want the full cultivation package, which comes with a lot of assumptions DOM breaks. The MC has a massive advantage over everyone else in the setting, the magic system intentionally divorces itself from the roots, etc. I want to see an MC in an actual cultivation world who's major advantage is out of context knowledge fighting a system with the general kind of ideals found in the rational community, in a realistic way afforded by the freedom available to long lived, powerful individuals influencing a normal (ish) society.
