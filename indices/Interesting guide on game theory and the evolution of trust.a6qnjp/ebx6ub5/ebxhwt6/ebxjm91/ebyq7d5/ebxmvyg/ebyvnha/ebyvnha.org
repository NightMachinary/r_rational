Not to be a jerk, but how many people did you send these links to; and among them, how many got back to you?

Personally, I find it awkward to break a conversation with "read this 20min article and get back to me", and I don't think it's ever lead to me having more interesting conversations with someone afterwards.

I think people just aren't interested in long articles they didn't find themselves.
