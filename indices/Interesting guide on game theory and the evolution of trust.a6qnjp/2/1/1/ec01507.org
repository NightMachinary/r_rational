This seems unnecessarily aggressive. I can see scenarios where what [[/u/Marthinwurer]] said is a totally reasonable thing to do. Obviously, telling somebody "before you can be my friend you need to read this" is being a dick. But if, eg, somebody expresses interest in how you think and your life philosophy, and wants to learn more about you, it seems perfectly reasonable to give an actual answer? I can definitely think of friends where I'd be interested in this kind of thing from them (and at least 2 who've done something vaguely like that, in a way that felt perfectly socially appropriate)
