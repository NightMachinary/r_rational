I show affection by sending people links to stuff that I think /they'd/ be interested in. So if they're a math person and I find a good math thing, sent. If they're a meme person and I find an extraordinary meme, sent. If they're a cybersecurity person and I find a decent cybersecurity blog, sent. You get the idea - I may not be enthusiastic about music theory or geography or photography, but I have friends who are.

In reciprocation, I've had stuff sent to me that other people thought I'd be interested in. But in order for that to happen, they first need to know what kind of stuff I'm interested in. This comes up in conversations naturally sometimes, but at other times I just bring it up abruptly to spontaneously start or change the subject of a discussion when it's getting a little dull. For example, I might share a quote from something I recently read, along with a reference in case it piqued their interest enough to warrant a deeper look:

  One reason people may share stories, news, and information is because they contain useful information. Coupons or articles about good restaurants help people save money and eat better. Consumers may share such practically useful content for altruistic reasons (e.g., to help others) or for self enhancement purposes (e.g., to appear knowledgeable, see Wojnicki and Godes 2008). Practically useful content also has social exchange value (Homans 1958), and people may share it to generate reciprocity (Fehr, Kirchsteiger, and Riedl 1998).
