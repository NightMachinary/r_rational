I'm eager for this story to get through the obligatory character introductions and start in on the rules for the game. The stakes have /mostly/ been established, but the mechanical nature of the conflict is unclear for now.

I'm also not sure how I feel about the meta elements, though I think it's best that they're worn on the sleeve early on so that readers can calibrate. What particular /kind/ of meta remains to be seen; meta for the lampshade hanging, meta for postmodernism, or meta for deconstruction/reconstruction? I'm /interested/, but I'm also a bit leery, if that makes sense.
