I definitely appreciate the story being upfront about what it is. I think I've probably talked about signaling to the audience ahead of time, and how important it is, because getting the wrong audience is frustrating for both them and for you (and in turn, can give bad reviews and/or word of mouth, which makes it harder to build an audience).

And yes, when I wrote my thoughts, I assumed that we had another few chapters of character introductions, which I'm fine with (but would be more fine with if I could just read them now rather than waiting).
