Well, starting (second chapter, but still the start) your murder mystery web serial with a meta chapter where a murder mystery web serial writer talks about all the difficulties of writing murder mystery web serials is...an interesting choice. It's definitely piqued my interest, like a lot.

I'm not sure how the meta narration by By is going to work in the rest of the story, but so far I like it. It's fun. Especially the barb at including religious arguments in a story while doing exactly that.
