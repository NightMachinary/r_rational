Sarah wouldn't know the vital name, even if it can still be used. We don't know exactly what the vital name targets, and neither would Sarah even if independent-humans had the vital name applied to them and didn't know how to apply it to other things or what the exact requirements of human involvement were. So even if Sarah managed to get a lot of computing power, Sarah might not know how to move itself onto the bigger cluster.
