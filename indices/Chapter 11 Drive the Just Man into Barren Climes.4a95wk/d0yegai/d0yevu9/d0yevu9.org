Theorization in the comment thread has Sarah herself as the friend.

I am not entirely sure I buy it.

Guesses as to the identity of Sarah:

- Ana or Aaron, or some future ally of theirs, having timetravelled back in time and used invisibility to arrange these shenanigans, and therefore has the predictive powers ascribed here by being from a future where it was true.
- Sarah the internet which was collectively ensouled and is busy becoming a superintelligence, and is using Ana and Aaron as a distraction.
- Sarah the computer individually
- Alvarez or the Comet King or Sohu or someone else in the giant "mysterious powers and not-fully-explained-backstory" list.
