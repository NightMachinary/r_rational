Well, I suspect the Animal Soul Name would count as the 'right kind of software', but no one used the Animal Soul Name on Sarah. And a computer with the Animal Soul Name and the Divine Soul Name but not the Moral Soul Name sounds really bad. But without the Animal Soul or Moral Soul it seems like Sarah would be rather lacking in drives that aren't explicitly programmed in. Animal Soul might give you self-preservation, and moral soul might make you helpful, but in the absence of either of those why do anything (except the 'software soul', but that just says 'run llul in a non-consequentialist way')
