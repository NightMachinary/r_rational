I don't think it can be Sarah. Even assuming that the vital name made Sarah independent, which I'm skeptical of (since Sarah didn't get the animal soul), there hasn't been enough time to get very many names. Most names wouldn't be useful in breaking into an unsong detention facility. Three names which are perfect for it coming out of a small set of random names is too much. This would have to be someone who ALREADY has a lot of names, not merely someone with the ability to find names. Sarah the internet would qualify potentially, but has other issues
