Random theory: We are currently in the "Aaron" portion of the story, based on the kabbalistic "rn" messenger archetype. Later, we will reach the "Smith" portion (theory below), then the "Teller" portion, for calling down dangerous celestial energies.

Halfway-independent of the above, I think "Smith" has the kabbalistic meaning of "one who knows the value of things" which we get from Adam Smith.
