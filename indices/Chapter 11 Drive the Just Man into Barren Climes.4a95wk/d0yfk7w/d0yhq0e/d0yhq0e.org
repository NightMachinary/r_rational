My theory is that a soul can only be split three ways. Aaron 's is him, Ana, and Sarah. Ana's is her, Aaron and (whatshername, from the first marriage test).

I may be mixing my mythology, but I got it from Father, Son, and Holy Spirit

Edit: my other theory is that the Name ensouled "computer-kind" in one go, and that the original use ensouled "humanity" in the same way.
