  do you think the original 1st Century Christians held to the Actual!Death or Theological!Death interpretation, and do you think that matters?

A simple reading (supported by the untranslated text and context) was that they were talking about actual, tangible, bodily resurrection and expected it within decades. This was a common end-times trope at that point, so Jesus coming back was a pretty clear sign that the end was nigh.

Does it matter? On one hand, it's crucial to an accurate reading of the text. On the other, presumably there's a justification ready either way and it /has/ been a very long time.
