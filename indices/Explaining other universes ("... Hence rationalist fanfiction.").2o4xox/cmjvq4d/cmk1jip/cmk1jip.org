Oooooh, this is fascinating! Am I correct in guessing you were raised Catholic? I was raised in an apocalyptic protestant sect (Jehovah's Witnesses) so they taught the Christ-conquers-Actual!Death interpretation (with the caveat that he's gonna do it in the 20th century, not the 1st). I am curious if you still consider the everyone-goes-to-hell-Theological!Death interpretation more plausible than the Christ-conquers-Actual!Death interpretation, now that you've (I assume) exited the religion.

As a related question, but not directly pertinent to the previous question, do you think the original 1st Century Christians held to the Actual!Death or Theological!Death interpretation, and do you think that matters?
