  Am I correct in guessing you were raised Catholic?

Not in the slightest. I was raised Jewish. But I did go to university in a state full of Catholics, and am engaged to one.

  I was raised in an apocalyptic protestant sect (Jehovah's Witnesses) so they taught the Christ-conquers-Actual!Death interpretation (with the caveat that he's gonna do it in the 20th century, not the 1st). I am curious if you still consider the everyone-goes-to-hell-Theological!Death interpretation more plausible than the Christ-conquers-Actual!Death interpretation, now that you've (I assume) exited the religion.

Honestly, I just want to thank the Church for inventing the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libera_Me][Responsory Libera Me]], which thus gave the world the song they play when [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT6LFOIofRE][/you really are/ defeating death]].
