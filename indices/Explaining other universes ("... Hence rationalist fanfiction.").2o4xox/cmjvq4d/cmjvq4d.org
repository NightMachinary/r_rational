  Can you imagine how loudly people would have screamed “Plot device!” and “Oh, come on, that is way too convenient!” and “That isn't right at all, transhumanism isn't something you get from your parents, it's not something you inherit like a royal bloodline, it's a decision we make for ourselves!”

Wait. I /did/ scream that. I actually had not known this was the Potter family motto in canon, and in canon, it's a /fucking terrible/ family motto, because it turns the whole thing into Harry Is Jesus In Purgatory. That freaking quote refers to Christ conquering capital-D everyone-goes-to-hell Theological!Death by sacrificing Himself on the fucking Cross!
