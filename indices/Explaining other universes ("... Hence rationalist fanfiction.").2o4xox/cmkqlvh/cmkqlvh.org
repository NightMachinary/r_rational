Hehe, I'm actually sort of [[http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=145791.0][attempting this]] right now with [[http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=89267.0][/my own Dwarf Fortress mod/]].

It's a Homestuck mod that's been cobbled together over the years with nary a thought towards meta-world building. The story was supposed to be a standard somewhat silly CYOA, but then one of my first traveling companions had an analytical ability of over 3500 (where 1000 is average and the top percentile of humans is 2000) and a memory of 5000 (which is perfect memory in DF terms, so she remembers everything), so I ended up having to think about stuff because I felt like someone /that/ smart combined with two intensely curious traveling companions means that stuff has to be questioned, analyzed etc.

So it's sort of odd. Contrivances in-story actually come from the game, or at least how the game /should/ be working at the time, so explaining that ends up seeming kinda off-the-wall, but the fact that the game does it makes it better. But /I made the mod that way/, even though I didn't do it while planning to write this story. This piece says that "There are authorial decisions that you /cannot/ make yourself and that /only/ another author can make for you", yet here I am making a story that relies on the constraints of something I made, using storytelling strategies that I would not use if the game weren't telling me that that ought to be happening.
