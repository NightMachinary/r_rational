This is a post about politics.

There are a lot of referenda on the ballot this year in California. I put together a guide of my opinions on all the state-wide CA votes this year. You can view it [[https://blazinghand.tumblr.com/post/152135832558/blazinghands-california-election-guide-2016][(here)]] if you'd like. Bear in mind this is a document specifically covering politics, and a lot of it is high-stakes statewide California politics.
