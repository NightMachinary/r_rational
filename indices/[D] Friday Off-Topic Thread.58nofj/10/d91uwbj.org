While browsing 4chan's "/m/ - Mecha" board, I stumbled across [[http://i.imgur.com/Qht0vjJ.png][this hilarious screenshot]]. You can tell from the format (multiple images per comment) that its original source is 8chan rather than 4chan (I can't tell with certainty the specific board, though "/pol/ - Politically Incorrect" seems likely, given the topic), but someone posted it (maybe by accident) on an entirely-different site and in [[http://archive.is/mKzed#selection-2497.0-2501.20][a thread]] to which it was totally off-topic. Seeing such a diffusion of ideas between vastly-different locations (from Less Wrong [to FanFiction.net?] to 8chan['s /pol/?] to 4chan's /m/) is interesting, I think.

--------------

On the topic of anonymous-imageboard screenshots, I find it somewhat interesting that I'm rather bad at predicting the popularity of 4chan screenshots that I submit to [[/r/4chan][r/4chan]].\\
- I found [[http://i.imgur.com/DsZktli.png][this image]] moderately funny--and [[http://np.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/585f0u][it received 1000 upvotes]], which was a little higher than my expectations but not at all outlandish.\\
- I found [[http://i.imgur.com/Dr1Zvya.png][this image]] barely funny--but [[http://np.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/565123][it somehow received 5000 upvotes]]!\\
- I found [[http://i.imgur.com/8s4lpd0.png][this image]] absolutely hilarious--but [[http://np.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/52tdo2][it received only 100 upvotes]]. Maybe [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/49403][the /A Wrinkle in Time/ series]] and the [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=CPT][colored-]]/[[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bpt][black-people-time]] joke aren't as well-known as I assume they are. (I read the first four /Time Quintet/ books about a decade ago, and my father--of African descent--has made many black-people-time jokes while running late to family gatherings.)\\
- I found [[http://i.imgur.com/0BV0Hgq.png][this image]] moderately interesting, though only barely funny--and [[http://np.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/54im6v][it received only 20 upvotes]]. I expected that outcome, however, since [[/r/4chan][r/4chan]] is mostly focused on humor, and neither /[[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Zeta_Gundam][Zeta Gundam]]/ nor /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who%27s_on_First%3F][Who's on First?]]/ is particularly popular nowadays.
