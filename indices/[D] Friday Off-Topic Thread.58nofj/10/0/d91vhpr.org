So much of reddit's system is reliant on time posted and whether or not a few early up votes were received--ten upvotes in the first ten minutes do more for its ranking than 50 upvotes in the following 50 minutes. And then once something is high up, the bandwagon effect kicks in. And on top of /that/, redditors follow the 100:10:1 rule, where for every 100 people who view a link, 10 will vote on it and 1 will comment, which can introduce a huge disconnect between popularity and people who enjoyed the content.

And in spite of all this, it's /still/ probably one of the better systems out there, which isn't saying much.
