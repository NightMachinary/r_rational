My first Nuzlocke death was well into my Sapphire game, when my Claydol got hit by Self-destruct from the Eletrode in Team Aqua's base. I had even bent the encounter rules a little with the Repel trick to make sure I got that Baltoy.

Sometimes it's just harder than others. My Sapphire game went with only two deaths the entire time. I tried Platinum afterwards and got about twenty. Most memorable out of that is my almost team wipe against Candice's Froslass. The key, though, is that when my Gastrodon won when four other of my Pokemon had died, it was such an amazing experience. I never expected a Gastrodon to be the MVP of my game, but that's what the Nuzlocke brings.

Keep at it. Take chances, and see if you'll find your game unfolding into a proper /narrative/. Even among the pain of losing team members along the way, it makes the whole experience worth it.
