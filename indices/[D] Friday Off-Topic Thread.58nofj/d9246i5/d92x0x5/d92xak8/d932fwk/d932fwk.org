Hmmm. Fair enough.

But if we assume that a suitably accurate device will be created one day, then the German Bullet Incident could have already happened...

Here's another question. Let's say I take my time machine and a prominent physicist. I drop him off in a well-secured lab at some fairly unremarkable point in time, with plenty of food and supplies, and skip forward twenty years.

On arrival, I meet the aged physicist. I take a copy of his notes, and leave him there.

I go back to twenty seconds after I dropped him off, and pick him up again. I give him the notes to read through, and leave him back in the present (by which I mean, the time he was taken from). Sure, it'll take him a while to fully understand the notes, but I think I've just allowed him to compress twenty years worth of theoretical work into a couple of months of reading through notes...
