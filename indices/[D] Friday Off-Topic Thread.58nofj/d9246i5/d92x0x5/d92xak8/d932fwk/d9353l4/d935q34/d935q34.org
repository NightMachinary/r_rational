[[/twiponder][]] ...here's a thought.

Let's say I take my time machine and send John Smith back in time to the sixteenth century.

I then go one day back in time, find John Smith (who has not yet time-travelled), and send him back to the sixteenth century.

I then go one day back in time, find John Smith, and send him back to the sixteenth century.

Repeat to taste.

Can I, in this way, create a vast army of John Smiths in the sixteenth century (or, well, any other century), none of whom are going to vanish at any point?
