It is very similar. The main difference, which I didn't touch on in my comment due to its complexity, is that all the "affixed" versions of you are true copies (apart from all but one of them being doomed to stop existing).

So if I travel to 1935 and kill Hitler before WW2, my other copies after 1935 will make a completely different set of decisions (all according to my knowledge and preferences at the time in my life they are affixed to).

Similarly, if I travel to 5 minutes before a major mission and give my past self a note saying "no go", they would abort the mission and spend the time doing else (perhaps try a different tack, or just make the most of their limited remaining life).

The idea is to enable some of the plots that canon took part in, like multiple versions of the Doctor cooperating in a new endeavour.
