You are a writer who wants to write about a protagonist who can manipulate probabilities. However as a dedicated commentator on this subreddit, you want to be able to give some pseudo-scientific BS about how the power works to best detail how it functions and interacts with the world. What sort of explanations/hypotheses would you give for this power?

It can be something overpowered like being able to see all possible futures and selecting the desired future. This would be possible due to the fact that all possibilities are true and all universes simultaneously exist, you're simply 'choosing' which universe to exist in.

Or being able to manipulate parts of the world that people can't observe as long as the change is plausible. such as being able to change a face-down card from an Ace of Spades to a King of Hearts as long as those two cards have not been drawn from the deck. The power would not allow a card with the image of an elephant on it to be drawn since no such card exists. This would be a macro-level instance of the observer effect in quantum physics where a hidden object exists in all possible states simultaneously before being observed.

Yet another one would be the ability to be lucky as long as you do good deeds to balance out the scales, because Karma is an actual scientific force in the world like electromagnetism and gravity.

What sort of probability manipulating powers can you come up with, and how would you explain why it works at all if your character is an inquiring scientist investigating it?
