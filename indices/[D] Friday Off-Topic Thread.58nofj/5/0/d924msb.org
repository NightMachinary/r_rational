Fundamentally, luck is when the result of a situation is determined, to one extent or another, by variables the person has no access to. So rolling a die is a matter of luck because not only is it hard to control the exact motion of our hand upon rolling it, but we also can't predict or, more importantly, manipulate or account for other factors like the motion of air and slight imperfections in the die or the table.

Manipulating luck is all about taking the variables other people cannot see, and manipulating them to your own ends. You could control the result of a roll of the dice by telekinetically adjusting the /exact/ motion of the hand that rolls it. When shuffling a deck of cards, you can control which card ends up where by telekinetically adjusting the precise motion of the cards and have them end up in a different spot.

The key to this is that it is all very minor-scale, and subconscious. You cannot use this telekinetic power to shove someone around, since people are far too large to be meaningfully affected. But you can use it to make a die land on a 6 each time. As well, the power is subconscious, so it operates only knowing what you want it to do, or perhaps even what you would want it to do. You cannot by yourself track which card is being shuffled where, and decide how much force to apply to change that, but if your power knows what you want on top, it can apply the relevant telekinesis. Regarding it doing what you would want it to do, this lets you do things like 'improbably' be missed by a gunshot, because your power knew you would not want to be shot by it and telekinetically adjusted the aim of the gunman to make sure they just barely missed.
