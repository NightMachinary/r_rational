My proposal title was something like "The Development and Application of Statistical Phylogenetic Methods to Human/Primate Morphological Evolution". Main two projects involve 1) expanding upon existing model-based methods of inferring phylogeny using continuous and discrete morphological traits while borrowing heavily from the quantitative genetics literature, testing everything extensively in simulation and against "assumed" trees obtained from nucleotide sequence alignments and more established methods, and applying the new methods to fossil taxa (for which aDNA is unretrievable; most paleontologists don't really go in for model-based inference of phylogeny), and 2) exploring popular questions of human biological adaptation using particular sorts of phylogenetic comparative methods where you model trait evolution "explicitly" instead of just "correcting" for phylogenetic "confounding" (probably just fitting a buncha models with rjMCMC and reading the relative fit off directly -- generally people like using information criteria or LRTs or w/e for model comparison, they have been shown via simulation to be biased in a phylogenetic context). Plus a few side projects/papers here and there. :]

More broadly I'm a bit interdisciplinary, but generally say I'm studying paleoanthropology, evolutionary biology, and computational statistics. Split across two EvoBio depts and a data science group.
