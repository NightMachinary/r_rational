Totally crushed my Qualifying Exam! And ultimately had a lot of fun with it! (contrary to my earlier worries, I was not asked super obscure questions about systems my examiners study that I'm completely unfamiliar with). Though my wrists and throat were certainly a bit sore after twelve hours of typing/talking. Scheduling the thing was a pain (we had to reschedule four times! I was initially going to take it in April ha!), but once that was finalized everything fell smoothly into place. And my committee was super excited about all my projects!

Feels good to have some breathing room (had to cut back on some hobbies in the weeks leading up to the QE -- e.g. essentially had to halve my lifting/running, did no programming unrelated to my work, cooking devolved to throwing veggies and tofu in the oven and seasoning them with salt lol, barely had time to read for fun or play games, and didn't go on any hikes or do any artsy stuff at all. Now I can get back into everything!). Anyone else here nearing the QE make-or-break point? (my program doesn't do any formal defense, so I shouldn't have to take a proper "test" for a while yet!)
