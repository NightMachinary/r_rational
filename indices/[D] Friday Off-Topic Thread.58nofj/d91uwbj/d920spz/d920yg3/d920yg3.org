Gundam generally is centered around the conflict between Earth and its colonies in various locations around the Solar System, and [[http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Paptimus_Scirocco][one of the main antagonists of /Zeta Gundam/]] was a native of Jupiter, so discussion of planets in general is just barely relevant. The OP featured Jupiter specifically.
