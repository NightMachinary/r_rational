With regards to the first screenshot, the answer is "whoever's tribe has more money," so the guy on the left for all four entries.

People like to get all edgy and talk like there's ever been a political or philosophical issue that came down to who could win in a fistfight, but if a libertarian policy backfired and as a result a lowlife gangster could rape an upper class white woman, murder her upper class white husband, steal their house, and get away with it, the society would just become more authoritarian and massacre, torture, and/or imprison all the gangsters, along with anyone who looks like them, plus anyone else the majority thinks ought to die while they have the guillotine out. Violence only works in the long run if the people-like-you can build more tanks and neutron bombs than the people-like-your-victim. That's why liberal/democratic societies always win in the end; if you optimize for being a strong thug, I just optimize for having a million tanks and crush you.
