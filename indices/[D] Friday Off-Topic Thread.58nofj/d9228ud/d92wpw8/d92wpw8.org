There are a number of possibilities.

Terry Pratchett, in /The Dark Side of the Sun/, postulated Probability Math - a mathematical system which could be used to make extremely accurate predictions of the future, given sufficient processing power. And then he included one character - a robot - who was deliberately /designed/, using Probability Math, to be "lucky". (The specifics of how that worked, under the hood, were never elaborated on beyond that - and never needed to be. The effects were obvious; a gun fired at him would jam, a blaster fired at him suffered a highly unlikely field inversion and disintegrated the user instead).

--------------

But, if you want to actually know how it works, there are a few major possibilities.

- The character is somehow able to affect small, hidden movements telekinetically and subconsciously. This will work when rolling a dice, but is less likely to help make someone pull out your number from a hat in a lucky draw if you don't know where in the hat your number is.

- The character is able to select an outcome, and make universes containing that outcome more probable. This will work for both the dice and the lucky draw mentioned above.

- The character is simply able to observe possible futures (consciously or subconsciously). He can win the lottery by seeing the numbers that will be drawn, and then picking those numbers. He can't force a die to land on a six, but he can very successfully make a bet on which number will be thrown.

- The character does not, in fact, have any luck-based powers at all. However, another character has extremely strong luck-based powers of the "only universes that match my selected outcome can exist" type, and her selected outcome requires that the protagonist survive and be reasonably happy until such time as he performs some task for her. (This luck-based power will abruptly and unexpectedly vanish once he has performed this task, which could be anything).

- The protagonist has an ally (possibly unknown to him) who is invisible and/or able to affect the world at long range. And possibly intangible. (Fae, ghosts, demons, and genies are popular examples). This ally wants the best for the protagonist (at least for the moment), and can do things like grab a die in mid-air and turn it so it lands showing a six. In this case, the protagonist will be luckiest when he is vocal about what he wants to happen.
