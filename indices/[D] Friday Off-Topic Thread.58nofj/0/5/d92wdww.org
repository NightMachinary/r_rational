Hmmm.

There would have to be limits. If you're getting more energy out of your song than you're putting in, then you have a free-energy society, which is even /more/ different to our world. So, let's assume that the musical simply makes things happen in the /most efficient/ way, while at the same time getting anyone who gets caught up in the tune to help out to the best of their ability.

- Major construction projects would be accompanied by music; and, in fact, construction equipment would be designed to produce musical sounds (so a bulldozer would double as a musical instrument)

- Factories, mines, and sweatshops would play suitable music on a loop at all times while people are expected to be working.

- During war, if an enemy soldier is captured, he would be interrogated by surrounding him with large numbers of allied soldiers, who would all then start a song about spilling secrets. Some of the allied soldiers would mention their secrets (generally personal - no-one with really dangerous secrets would be in this song) and thus trigger the prisoner to spill all he knows. (To counter this, high-ranking military personnel might intentionally deafen themselves).

- Versebreakers would be an accepted but not exactly prestigious job - probably much like rodent exterminators. You know society needs them, but the average private citizen doesn't exactly ever want to need them personally.

- High-end scientific laboratories would all include an on-call orchestra. Large laboratories (like the Large Hadron Collider) would incorporate an excellent sound system, allowing the same song to be heard all around the accelerator ring.

- Anyone wanting to pursue a serious personal project would have even more reason to collect a few friends and do so as a team.
