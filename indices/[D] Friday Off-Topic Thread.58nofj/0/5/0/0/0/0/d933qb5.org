  I think the angle I'm going with is that singing does count as a musical instrument for the purposes of a musical, but everyone knows you'll get better results by singing /and/ playing an instrument.

Okay, that's reasonably sensible.

So the sweatshop workers would all be singing about making T-shirts, led by one guy with a musical instrument, to get most of the effect for minimal capital outlay.

And your average office block would be sound-proofed to prevent interfering with the neighbouring office block.

Hmmmm... one way to sabotage a factory, then, would be by introducing a discordant note. A "screech bomb", perhaps, could be a tool with which a saboteur could really mess with the bottom line.

  Obvious follow-up is the idea of having an efficient, scaled up free-energy machine that you keep fueled with a musical. And, well, maybe? I mean, I still can't see it usurping real energy sources, but maybe there's a power plant somewhere that works like this?
#+end_quote

Hmmm. Permanent power, no worries about coal or other energy sources, you've just got to keep the orchestra happy? Sounds good. (Multiple orchestras, actually - they'd have to work in shifts).

Would be expensive, because you have to have a permanent on-site orchestra, but would probably be able to produce all the power you'll ever need...

  The interrogated soldier would know, logically, how they got the info, but at the same time he would have been steeling himself to not let anything slip, to make sure he didn't betray his country, and then the music starts and all of that fell apart. It would be disturbing, on a level.
#+end_quote

Eeyup. Like a super truth serum. (A captured soldier could try to resist this by means of deliberate versebreaking, but given that he's captured, he's at a pretty serious disadvantage here...)

  I'm getting the feeling now that most industries would be trying to 'music-optimize' the workflow so that every worker can count as playing a musical instrument. The musicals would be that much more potent from it, of course, and it produces the requirement for people to know how to make music as well as sing along.
#+end_quote

Makes sense, yes. Being unable to keep time would be a serious disadvantage here.

#+begin_quote
  I'm also interested in the implications on using musicals to help teach music. I mentioned having a musical build up to one extraordinary feat, right? So a kid who has trouble singing or playing an instrument could have a professional musical made with the purpose of a climactic moment in which they surpass their major roadblock.
#+end_quote

...that works, yes. The professional musical would be kind of expensive, especially when you consider that precisely the same effort could be used to find a cure for cancer, discover the solution for world hunger, or figure out how to make a space elevator. You've given this world a /seriously/ powerful hammer, and now every problem is a nail...

But there's also the psychological aspect to consider. Can Villain McEvil persuade the hero to pilot Villain McEvil's giant robot on a deathly rampage through the streets by means of a sufficiently catchy tune? This could easily become borderline mind control.

...and it makes the Phantom of the Opera's song "Past The Point Of No Return" even creepier.
