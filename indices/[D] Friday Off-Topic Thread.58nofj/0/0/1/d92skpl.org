Tone deafness isn't quite as common as people think. Most of the time the people who think they're tone deaf haven't had any sort of training besides the little self-taught ability they have. In this fiction, tone deafness might be equivalent to having to get physical therapy for a torn muscle. It'll take anywhere from a few months to a year or two, but most everybody can be trained. There is medically diagnosable tone deafness (congenital amusia), but that is pretty rare and isn't treatable.

Kodaly (and Orff) instructors would also be beyond valuable. Kodaly is one of the prominent methods used to teach music to children. These instructors would at the very least have the same social status as coaches for the NFL, with opera and choir singers being the players.

Speaking of which, singing competitions would take the place of sports. Not like American Idol mind you, it would be 1v1 or team competitions kinda like the Songs of the Ainur you mentioned, just with lots of improvising. What effect would singing opera have? I have no idea but it's probably different than a musical number.

Something else to think about would be the affect of modality on music. The two most prevalent modes are Ionian (major keys) and Aeolian (minor keys). There are five other modes (Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, and Locrian) that aren't used outside of the classical music word, and even then they're hardly used. Locrian by far is the hardest mode to sing in because it's so strange to western ears. Music in those modes would probably have a strange effect.

A big question would be how popular opinion influence musical effects. Music has changed a lot over the part 400ish years, sometimes due to composers like Beethoven rejecting the "meta" and other times because the public opinion has an effect on the evolution of music, such as vaudeville in the early 1900's.
