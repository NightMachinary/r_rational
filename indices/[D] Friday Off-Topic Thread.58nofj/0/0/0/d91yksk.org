A Montage, I guess, would be a series of musicals in close sequence, from the same musician(s) and sharing the same intent. The effect would then accumulate so that at the end of the montage potency has significantly increased.

With singing out of tone, I expect the supermajority of the population would be taught how to sing from a young age, with the express intent of making sure they can at least participate in musicals. Given how career-affecting that would be, I expect a lot of research and effort would go into reliable methods to teach proper singing. Similarly, vocal tutoring would become much bigger business and music would be a core part of school curriculum (The kids would love the concept of musicals because of how magical they are).

Of course, that doesn't rule out sabatoge, but I expect governments would consider intentionally interfering with a musical illegal, as long as the musical has official documentation behind it (such as being hired to produce musicals for desperate surgeons or the contract between a music company and a client). The world would also develop with a cultural appreciation of musicals, so the idea of intentionally ruining one would be reprehensible at the very least.
