I think you're underestimating children's ability to be bored. They love the idea of just being able to do whatever they want with music, but then they discover just how much work to takes to be good at it and lose interest. They'll go in expecting that you can just magically whip out a tune and warp reality, only to be disappointed when they need to learn sheet music, scales, aesthetic standards, and more AND have to constantly practice. It's not that different from learning science.
