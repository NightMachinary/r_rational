This scene from Disney's /The Little Mermaid/ reads very differently when you consider that musical numbers actually happen in the story.

The seagull's atrociously off-key singing doesn't do anything and just draws a sarcastic comment from Eric. While Sebastian (who's earlier established as a famous conductor) can create a specific mood he's aiming for on-demand. And far from sarcastic comments, the protagonists don't seem to consciously hear his music at all, they just respond to the mood.

And then the eels come along and play Versebreakers.
