Well, one of the things that I mentioned is that the lyrics that everyone follows would form from the intent behind the song. So you could argue that when a musician starts making music, the effect of a musical starts because the musician recognizes it as music, and the people who join in the singing reinforce the effect when they recognize it as singing. From there you could say that the song's intent involves an objective or set of objectives that the musical not only optimizes behaviour for, adjusting the angle the construction worker positions his arm at or manipulating the lines of thought of the mathematician, but also produces lyrics befitting the intent and the people involved in the song.

For songs cancelling out, well, a musical works best when the song itself is loud, clear, and uninterrupted. The more immersive it is, in a word. So if you take two separate musicals next to each other, the external sounds from the other musical would diminish the 'purity' of the first, and vice versa. If the people trying to sing along start having a hard time making out the music, they stop being able to produce the same lyrics and the extra productivity leaves them. So I suppose a good way of cancelling a musical is to simply drown it out with other sound, and if you make your musical loud and powerful enough it would disturb a musical with quieter notes or a weaker sound.
