I'm still doing some planning for my rational Doctor Who fanfic. I've settled on what I think is an acceptable time-travel (henceforth TT) mechanic, but it doesn't totally line up with canon (which is extremely inconsistent on the topic).

Ultimately, this question is a little academic, so feel free to ignore this whole comment. Doctor Who, despite being about a man and his companion(s) as they travel through time and space, mainly uses TT to, well, travel. For the most part it isn't a problem-solving device. I intend to stick to that premise (and possibly explain why the Doctor might end up behaving like that, story permitting).

As a long-running soft sci-fi show, Doctor Who canon is somewhat flexible on the topic of TT. Sometimes changing the past creates a paradox that causes monsters to appear to devour the affected people. Other times it has no noticeable effect at all, even when a gigantic robot is defeated by a man in a hot air balloon in the middle of 19th century London. Sometimes the future is fixed, and what has been seen to occur must occur. Other times the future is in flux.

A lot of the time there's an excuse that means you can't use the Tardis to TT while part of events, but then that gets ignored when the plot demands it. Sometimes they neglect to use the Tardis as a regular space-craft, even though they use it like that in other episodes.

I'm hoping to make that a little more consistent. If there's a reason the Tardis can't save the day, the reader should expect this.

The premise of my mechanic is this: when you travel in time, the temporal relationship of the passenger before and after the trip is severed. I.e. the fate of pre-travel!you does not affect the fate of post-travel!you. Pre-travel!you will cease to exist at the moment of travel, even if in this new timeline you don't end up TTing. Effectively, TT creates deletion event for pre-travel!you and a creation event for post-travel!you. The terminology I use for this is that pre-travel!you is truncated and post-travel!you is affixed.

So if you went back in time and killed your grandfather then truncated!you would never be born, but affixed!you would continue to exist unchanged. Likewise, if you went back in time on your 25th birthday and rescued your parents from a fire, then truncated!you would grow up with both parents alive and at age 25 (when you TTed in the original timeline) would cease to exist. Affixed!you would not receive any new memories or relationships as a result.

This sidesteps the problem of paradoxes---if you travel back in time and destroy your time machine it doesn't matter. Otherwise, virtually any trip into the past where the light cones overlap would result in a paradox.

It also enables what I think is an interesting technique: you can repurpose a trunctated version of yourself for a new task at the cost of undoing your truncated self's actions. So if you spend 10 years building hospitals for orphans then TT, if a war breaks out you /can/ bring along two or more yous to the fighting, but those hospitals won't get built. And if you try to build up lots of "useless" time to spend on duplicates, your TTing enemies will have free reign to reshape the universe and/or assassinate you.

The other main paradox-free TT mechanics are "single consistent timeline" (see HPMoR), "self-correcting timeline" (used now and again in Doctor Who canon), and "branching universes" (see Branches on the Tree of Time). Briefly, why I didn't use them:

- A single consistent timeline doesn't fit with canon at all. They routinely change the future, something which is impossible with this mechanic. Creating a single consistent timeline with anything even close to the quantity and impact of TT in Doctor Who canon would be impossible.
- The self-correcting timeline would work, but it devalues the characters' choices. I /could/ save the world from a Dalek invasion, but since that never happened in the future the universe would just correct it out of existence (or wouldn't, if author fiat says so). It adds an unwanted element of fatalism. Also, again, it's inconsistent with large parts of canon (e.g. entire races being wiped from existence).
- Branching universes dilutes the impact of characters' actions. It works really well in Branches on the Tree of Time where engineering the perfect timeline is literally the goal, but I don't think it's a good fit for the story I want to tell. It's certainly not an element of canon at all, except when alternate universes come up (and it's never implied such universes are created by TT).

In this framework reality is deterministic and there's no such thing as the present. If I TT to the past, kill Hitler, and TT back to 2016, the world will have instantly updated---no time ripples or fluctuating timelines.

The big flaws I can see with my version are these:

1. There need to be additional limits on the utility of TT to make the story entertaining. I have some in mind, but nothing concrete. Currently, the solution to virtually every problem ought to be "TT and do it better". This is mostly the same in canon, except with inconsistently obeyed rules of "can't interfere with our own timeline" and "some events are fixed".
2. With multiple TTing agents there needs to be a clear explanation for who TTs when. My current solution is basically a meta-time queue; if I TT once and then again a year later, every other TTer gets a year of meta-time. This could be very confusing for readers, which is partly why I suspect Doctor Who avoids TT-abusing enemies (they mostly travel to a time, enact their evil plan, escape, repeat). I'm going to try to avoid a situation where this is important.
3. When a past version of you ceases to exist at the point when you TTed, the definition of "you" is based on human reasoning, not physical concepts. I.e. if Bob TTs, it's new-timeline!Bob that will disappear, not old-timeline!Bob's component quarks/atoms/molecules (take your pick). The alternatives within this TT framework are (a) it /is/ the physical components that disappear, with disastrous results, or (b) nothing disappears, leading to permanent duplication.
