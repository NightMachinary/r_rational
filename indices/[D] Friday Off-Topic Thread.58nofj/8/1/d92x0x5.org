Hmmm. This "affixed" mechanic leads to some interesting results.

Let us say that John has a time machine. John wants to go back in time and kill Hitler. But John is aware that there are other time travellers; if he just goes back in time and shoots Hitler /before/ the Holocaust, then some other well-meaning time traveller might turn up with a forcefield to save some poor innocent boy from the time-travelling assassin.

So, instead of personally travelling back and shooting Hitler, he time-sends a bullet to coordinates that overlap with Hitler's heart. So, a bullet appears in Hitler's heart, and he dies.

--------------

Sam is a time traveller. Sam has found out that a time-travelling assassin very successfully killed a young boy by the name of Adolf Hitler. Sam wishes to prevent this.

Sam cannot prevent the original bullet from appearing, because it is affixed. In fact, in this new timeline, Sam cannot even figure out which bullet it is. (There's a man at a shooting range, in the new timeline, who is a little surprised when his bullet vanishes halfway to the target). However, Sam can save the poor little Austrian boy, by preventing him from being present when the bullet appears. He sends back a stone, which appears just under young Hitler's foot,and causes him to stumble and not be present when the bullet appears.

After several iterations of this, people in 1920s Germany notice bullets and stones appearing, apparently at random. Many of them have badly bruised feet, and those who are unlucky enough to stand where young Adolf stood in another timeline may have fairly grevious internal injuries. The theory that this is a weapon, invented by former Allied sides to punish Germany for their role in WW1, is easily believed by many Germans. Later historians blame the bullets from nowhere as being a major cause for WW2. Future time travellers cannot prevent the bullets from appearing, and cannot understand why anyone would want to deliberately instigate WW2. The more thoughtful ones wonder what could be so bad in the future that triggering WW2 looked like the /preferable/ option.
