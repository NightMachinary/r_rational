You absolutely could provide a scientist with his future self's notes. In fact that's part of my setting.

The Daleks, canon's most recognisable antagonist race, were created by/from the Kaleds (not the show's greatest naming effort). My take on it is that this development took the Time Lords by surprise because they acquired a basic time-travel device and used that to iterate on their tech and, later, to create an enormous army. They became a galactic superpower in the span of about 80 external years.

The breeding program is a particularly interesting use of the mechanic. If A and B create C, when C matures you send C back in time and use them to breed. But you /also/ reallocate A and B into different pairs, since they don't actually need to produce C anymore (or otherwise manipulate them to produce D instead of C). So provided your supply of resources is sufficient (including the exorbitant energy cost of non-Tardis time-travel) you can effectively grow several orders of magnitude faster than without this strategy.
