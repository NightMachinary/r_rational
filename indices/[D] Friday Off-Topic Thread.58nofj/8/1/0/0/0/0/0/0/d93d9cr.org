....hmmm. So, if John really wants to kill Hitler, in a way that no-one can retroactively prevent, he needs to send /Hitler/ through time to someplace really lethal (like, say, directly inside an active volcano). Then there's no way anyone can save him; younger Hitler vanishes no matter what you do, and older Hitler is instantly killed by the volcano?
