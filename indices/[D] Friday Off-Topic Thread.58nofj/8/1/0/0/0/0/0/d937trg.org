No, every John Smith (except the first one to time-travel, who hasn't been "truncated") would live only for one day. Of course, one day may be more than you need depending on just how many John Smiths you make---there's a little over 8,000 days between age 18 and age 40, so it could be a tremendous force multiplier.

I think I am going to introduce something to counteract this a little, something about the interactions of temporal duplicates in proximity causing instability. A little hand-wavey, but there need to be /some/ limitations or risks to counterbalance the huge benefits and bring it in line with canon a little more.
