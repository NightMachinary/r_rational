...now that could make for an interesting story. Someone figures out the basics of time travel, and sets the building he's in to do this to watch out to any evidence of other time travel - and then he looks out the window and sees (a barren wasteland/a society ten thousand years more advanced/a city inhabited by aliens/emptiness with stars in the distance/dinosaurs)

Orrrrrr..... they do this with an entire planet. Then more time travel happens, their entire race is prevented from ever evolving, a completely different intelligent race evolves on their planet... and they develop the ability to detect time travel just in time to figure out that their entire planet (and species) is just going to vanish in a month's time. And no amount of further time travel can fix or prevent it.
