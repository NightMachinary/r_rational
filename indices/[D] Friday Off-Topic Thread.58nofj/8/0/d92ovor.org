I'm not sure that I see a functional difference between this and the standard paradox-free version, the "rewind mechanic". Essentially whenever you go back in time, all of the stuff in between gets erased and starts re-recording from the spot you emerge, with the change being that you seem to appear out of thin air in the timeline. Whenever you go forward in time the universe just keeps recording without you until it eventually reaches the time that you wanted to show up. It's not really consistent with multiple travelers, but other than that it's pretty much the same as yours.
