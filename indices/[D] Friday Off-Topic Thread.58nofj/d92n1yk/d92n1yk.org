Yesterday's [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/immortality-3][SMBC]] reminded me of HPMOR. Not much to say, I was hoping someone at least 3x wittier than me would comment on it somewhere but there isn't a dedicated place to discuss SMBC that I know of.

I also started reading Pokemon: The Origin of Species and am really enjoying it. I'm about a third through and Red seems to have discovered the special attack stat, which is pretty meta since it doesn't exist yet in gen 1.
