This is ridiculously awesome. What would a Montage be?

There would be a huge social stigma against singing out of tune. Large projects would spend time vetting people for tone deafness. It would take a genius to solve that issue in someone with a musical, because every time the "star" joins in it saps some of the power of the song.

A lot of the war music (and any competitive music in general with two sides that want a different outcome) would be about incorporating the other side's tune and making it look like /they/ are the bit piece in /our/ song. See the Song of the Ainur in the Silmarillion, where Eru manages to make Melkor's cacophony sound like punctuation to his own song.

There would be a pretty funny inversion of college degrees: the "real" degrees would all be liberal arts, while STEM would be this special snowflake "I just want to understand the world" kind of thing that only idiot kids get into.

Hmm, there would be a certain amount of sabatoges, professionals who ruin a harmony in just the wrong way to ensure a song doesn't go as right. Getting caught with a kazoo is asking for it.

And of course since so much of music is cultural, learning different worldwide styles is kind of a catch 22, in that they're only effective in your native land if they're popularly understood, but only enter the cultural consciousness if they're used.
