Some authors have actually written fanfiction of /Friendship is Magic/ investigating this very phenomena. Here's a [[https://www.fimfiction.net/group/209758/tales-of-the-versebreakers][collection]] of 5 stories which use this concept in some way. Note that the stories are mainly focused on the damages such musicals would do, because they have interpreted it to be caused by /one/ pony singing, but then everyone else in the surrounding area are forced into singing along without a choice to opt out.
