One of the things I worked out from the other replies is that musicals are only started with the actual musician who makes the music recognizing it as music. They can't declare something like regular speech as a kind of music and start a musical that way, and they also can't take something like ambient bird calls and declare that a song either. On top of that, the musical loses potency the more interfering sounds there are.

So speakers wouldn't count as an instrument, I think. You could make the argument that it's no more of a black box, as far as producing sound goes, than any other instrument, but it's not something the musician plays, and thus would be just sounds from a piece of technology. You could still propagate songs across large areas, but that would be more a matter of amplification of an existing song.

I'm not too concerned about the free-energy thing, as well. Since you can't pull off a musical without a physical musician present to play music (which would be a costly thing), even if you /could/ get free energy in some way from the increased productivity I don't think it would be comparable to other forms of energy production, which can be upscaled. Maybe it'd be important at the end of the universe with entropy and heat death, but that's not in the timeframe of the setting.

That interrogation song is a perfect mental image, though. You've got the soldier tied to a chair, surrounded by enemy soldiers, and they break out into boisterous song about interrogating him while interrogating him. By the end of the song, the soldier's given out all of the info and doesn't know exactly how they managed it. Turning construction equipment into musical instruments is a good idea too, as long as you can make sure your construction workers are good enough to play them properly and won't just interfere with the musical. In such cases, I expect the equipment would come with a mute function to just try and run silently.
