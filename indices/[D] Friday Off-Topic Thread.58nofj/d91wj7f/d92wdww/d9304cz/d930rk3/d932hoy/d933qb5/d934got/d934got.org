Villain McEvil, assuming in-universe movie where this would happen, would possibly be able to sway the hero with a musical at the right timing. Like, if the hero's feeling unsure about his convictions because of something that happened half-way through the story, Villain McEvil could arrange for a musical to culminate with a decision to join Villain McEvil. Of course, the counterpoint musical from the friends of the hero would convince him to be a hero again. (This would work best with non-black-and-white morality, but it'll happen a lot with black-and-white morality anyways.)

More realistically, I expect musicals during debates to be considered horribly rude if only one-sided. So if both sides start going back and forth, with dramatic proclamations in tune with the high points of the song, that's fine, but you don't go and start a musical if your opponent doesn't.
