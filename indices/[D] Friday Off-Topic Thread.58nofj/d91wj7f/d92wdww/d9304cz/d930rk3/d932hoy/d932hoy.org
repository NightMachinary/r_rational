I think the angle I'm going with is that singing does count as a musical instrument for the purposes of a musical, but everyone knows you'll get better results by singing /and/ playing an instrument. The difference between speech and singing is that one is 'obviously' musical and the other is 'obviously' not. We see things that way, so the effect takes hold for singing but not speaking. Chanting would work too, I assume.

I imagine sweatshops would be all about getting someone with decent musical talent to work for them, given how a musical is a productivity amplifier for all of the workers. But other than that, yeah, hire someone to force all the workers to sing along in a never-ending musical about making T-shirts.

And for free-energy machines, I'll just phrase this as musicals can do the 'impossible', but the regular rules of the universe only do not hold when a musical is actively interfering. I could maybe use a musical to lift a heavy object with less energy than I'm giving it potential energy, but I couldn't make a machine that does the same in silence. Obvious follow-up is the idea of having an efficient, scaled up free-energy machine that you keep fueled with a musical. And, well, maybe? I mean, I still can't see it usurping real energy sources, but maybe there's a power plant somewhere that works like this?

The interrogated soldier would know, logically, how they got the info, but at the same time he would have been steeling himself to not let anything slip, to make sure he didn't betray his country, and then the music starts and all of that fell apart. It would be disturbing, on a level.

I'm getting the feeling now that most industries would be trying to 'music-optimize' the workflow so that every worker can count as playing a musical instrument. The musicals would be that much more potent from it, of course, and it produces the requirement for people to know how to make music as well as sing along.

I'm also interested in the implications on using musicals to help teach music. I mentioned having a musical build up to one extraordinary feat, right? So a kid who has trouble singing or playing an instrument could have a professional musical made with the purpose of a climactic moment in which they surpass their major roadblock.
