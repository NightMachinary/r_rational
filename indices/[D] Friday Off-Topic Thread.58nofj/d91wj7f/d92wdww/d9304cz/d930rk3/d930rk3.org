  One of the things I worked out from the other replies is that musicals are only started with the actual musician who makes the music recognizing it as music. They can't declare something like regular speech as a kind of music and start a musical that way, and they also can't take something like ambient bird calls and declare that a song either.

Hmmmm. Can they start a musical with nothing but a well-sung song, or do they actually need an external instrument?

Because I can hum a tune, and recognise it as music; and there are ways for a human, with zero equipment, to at least approximate the sound of a guitar...

  So speakers wouldn't count as an instrument, I think. You could make the argument that it's no more of a black box, as far as producing sound goes, than any other instrument, but it's not something the musician plays, and thus would be just sounds from a piece of technology.

Fair enough. So sweatshops would have some minimum-wage guy with a triangle and a singing voice sitting there, then.

And something like the Large Hadron Collidor would have state-of-the-art amplification systems.

  I'm not too concerned about the free-energy thing, as well.
#+end_quote

I was thinking less free energy from the extra productivity, and more using a song to create a free-energy machine (which then, presumably, continues to work even after the song is over).

  By the end of the song, the soldier's given out all of the info and doesn't know exactly how they managed it.
#+end_quote

If he's grown up in this world, then surely he knows all about songs, knows exactly how they did it, and was simply powerless to stop them? (Then they start singing that song about defecting to their side...)

  Turning construction equipment into musical instruments is a good idea too, as long as you can make sure your construction workers are good enough to play them properly and won't just interfere with the musical. In such cases, I expect the equipment would come with a mute function to just try and run silently.
#+end_quote

Ah, but in this world a construction worker who can't play his equipment is worse than useless... the ability to get good music from your bulldozer is probably more important than the ability to steer it in a straight line.
