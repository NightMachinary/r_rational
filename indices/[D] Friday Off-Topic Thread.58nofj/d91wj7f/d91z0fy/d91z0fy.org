My rationalization of musicals has been that songs are just a way that people communicate, the only tangible effect it has is organizing people's behavior. Your version requires musicians to be present in-universe to construct a narrative that the universe itself obeys, which has a whole different set of implications. Is there anything that can prevent a song from taking effect? If songs conflict, does one dominate or do they cancel each other out and why?
