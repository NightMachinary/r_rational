One idea I haven't been able to get out of my head recently is the idea of a world in which musical numbers have tangible effects on the world, much like they appear to in movies and other media. So if you start playing an instrument and sing, everyone who starts singing along will all join in with the same lyrics, assembled out of the intent behind the song, and for the duration of the song all activities will be more efficient or successful. Construction workers could place beams of wood in a single stroke and hammer each nail completely into the beam with a single swing apiece, all in tune with the song and at the same precision they'd get if they spent time measuring. The better the music, the more potent the musical, and some musicals would, instead of increasing efficiency, lead up to a climactic finish in which one extraordinary feat is accomplished, anything from finally sticking the landing on your gymnastic routine to figuring out the solution to the complex mathematical problem that you've been agonizing over for days, if the musical is good enough.

What I'm trying to piece together is the repercussions of a world like this. Of course, the field of war would be noticeably different with generals conscripting musicians, with the intent to assemble orchestras on the battlefield so that the musical would magnify the strength of the troops' attack. Companies would form with the purpose of hiring musicians and sending them to clients who need a one-time productivity boost, and places like hospitals with vital time-sensitive tasks would try to keep a musician on hand in case the surgeon needs a musical to save the patient. But apart from that, how else would society change as a result of this power?
