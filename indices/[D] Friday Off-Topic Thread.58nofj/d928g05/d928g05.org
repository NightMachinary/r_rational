Looking for a webfiction that was recommended here about... a year ago. Some kids learn how to master their universes version of magic, which is basically calling upon and overlapping alternate universes into the characters reality.

This of course has the unfortunate side effect of introducing neuphytic organisms all the time.

They start by building a house and shaping everything around it, and want to start up a glass making buisness.
