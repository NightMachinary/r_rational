I have oscillated between about 4 different projects over the last 6 months or so. None of them are reaching public status quite yet, but one thing that I have been fascinated in since a child has been games and game programming, especially low power systems such as consoles. My favorite console since I was a child is the Nintendo 64. Recently, discovered that the N64 developers kit is available online, and work in a 32bit winXP environment. Since then, on the off weekend, while taking a break from school work I worked on doing various things using the official software/libraries. ([[/r/n64homebrew]])

Recently received help from someone on [[/r/gcc]] to get nearly the entire build process working in windows 64 bit. (windows 7, 8, 10) Now we have to recreate the effects of a program called mild from 1997.

Once we do that, people will be able to run the whole process without requiring a 32 bit system! The day that happens, I will be a very happy computer nerd!

In contemplation of what to do afterwards, I have considered (thanks to [[/u/ketura]] and their paper on rational game design) following the ideas behind the rational video game essay and implementing those in my own minecraft-style N64 game. The very system itself requires significant planning due to limited resources (4 mb without memory expansion!), but with modern cartridge tech like the 64drive or everdrive, I can insert an SD card (>8 GB!) and use some of that for swapfile.

Anyway, the idea is to either make a game directly (Let's call the hypothetical project 64craft) or find a suitably slim (or configurable) 3D game engine with public source code and port it over to the N64. If my goal is to kind of jump start the homebrew N64 development scene, which do you think would get the most media attention to attract developers?

Doom on the N64 is old news at this point so I'll probably go for something else. Thoughts?
