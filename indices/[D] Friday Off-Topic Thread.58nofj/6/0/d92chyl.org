If your goal is publicity, "Hacker Runs Minecraft on N64" is a pretty catchy headline. You're on the right track, I think, in attempting to take a semi modern, well-liked, unique title that didn't exist way back when and get it (or a clone) working. Portal would be another candidate that would fit the bill, tho that one might work even worse within the hardware constraints.
