It seems weird it'd work /that/ badly? Is there a reason other than balance for this?

Also, my suggestion was never that you'd use a remote computer that way, it was that you'd have a ship that jumps back and forth to keep up communications, updating it's info about coordinate in both locations faster than they change. Then, once you have data about what'd going by the battle and coordinates at HQ, you can put the /entire/ kinetics handler there.
