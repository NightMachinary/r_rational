The point is not to be faster than the rendering cycles; I estimate in the /best/ cases the latency would be 4 of them. But coordinates tend to stay the same for several hundred cycles at a time right? Maybe another example is better; you send a tiny unarmed scout, trailed by a tiny unarmed messenger, and if something happens you can port in hundred of big ships from half a galaxy away, and they don't all need to have independent drives or carry their own realtime zones.
