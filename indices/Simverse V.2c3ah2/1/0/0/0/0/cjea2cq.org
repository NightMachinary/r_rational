I'm not talking abaut unmanned ships except for ones to be used exclusively as disposable and subservient near a manned ship. The "one stays behind and one swaps" is exactly what I'm describing, although the people are on separate ships they are staying near enough to each other to be be in the same realtime zone. The fleet would indeed stay in the exact same place, probably on an actual planetary surface with stabilizes the position. This is economical because you might have hundreds of scout-messenger pairs all over the galaxy and the chance of even two pairs needing the backup simultaneously is vanishinglly small.
