Well, first of all you can check /my/ account on RR. I'd ask you to please ask for clarity before making suh accusations, unless you think the author decided to write 300 pages of bad xianxia for a single review. UnstoppableJuggernaut is an alt, though, and I'll see if the author is okay with sharing his other account privately. You can even check our writing styles if you want. Hell, check out my other reviews. You think the author has 50 alts and 50 different stories? Whenever I review, I always look for the good in a story. You'll find that consistent over pretty much all my reviews. That's just my style - you can disagree with it, but don't accuse me of being an alt because of it.

And look, yeah I get that posting so early sounds suspicious. Like I said, I've read further than is currently up. The author even asked me to hold off on reviewing right away for this reason, but he hit trending earlier than expected so I decided to post it now. No, I'm not the author's mom or anything. I'm just a reader and friend who wanted this guy's first delve into progression fantasy to succeed. I'm not blowing smoke up his ass or anything - I genuinely fucking liked the story. I mean, of course I would if I liked his other shit, right? You guys might not like it as much as I did. That's fine.

Look, if I'm really pissing you guys off I'll leave. I don't normally read rational shit because that's not really my style, and I probably came into this sub less knowledgable than I should have been. I just wanted to hype up this dude's story because I genuinely believe he's combining traditional fantasy with progression in a great way.
