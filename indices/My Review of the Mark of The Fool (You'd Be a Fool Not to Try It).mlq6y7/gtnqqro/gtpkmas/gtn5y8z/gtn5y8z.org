Regardless of whether you've read ahead, I think you're jumping the gun posting a recommendation for a story with only 17k words out. No one who reads webfiction regularly will get out of bed for anything less than >50k words. Maybe even >100k. It takes more than 20k words for frodo to sell bag's end, let alone leave the shire!

Also, it's always kinda suspicious when someone's first post in a community is such a strong endorsement of a niche/unknown product. You say you read the sidebar but your story isn't tagged, and you made a new thread instead of posting it in the monday recommendation thread. Not a good look friend.
