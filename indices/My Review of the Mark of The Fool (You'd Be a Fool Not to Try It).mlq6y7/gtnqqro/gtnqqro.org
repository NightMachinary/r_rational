The top post comes across a bit negative, which I want to counteract. Welcome to the subreddit, and we could always use more new & different recommendations, even if some of us are jaded by the number of serials that put up 20 chapters and languish unfinished indefinitely :)

I read to Ch 4, and it hasn't shown any major red flags so far, and has managed to catch my interest to read further. However, I will be putting it aside until there's over 20 chapters out.
