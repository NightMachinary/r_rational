I don't think anyone's pissed. Everyone here likes a good sincere recommendation. But your review doesn't pass the smell test because like a rational whodunit let's look at what we know:

1. Your review is long and fervent for a story with only 17k words published

2. This is your first post to [[/r/rational][r/rational]]

3. New thread promoting a new story

4. Sentences trying to build hype around a new product

5. You mention the author's previous works but his RR account was made in February and has 1 story. For all we know, he could have 50 alts.

6. Your own story was officially ended 2 months ago

If someone had to bet, one explanation seems more probable than the other.

If you're really just a fan, then the moral is to be more patient and sound less like a shill.
