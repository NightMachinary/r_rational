This is the third time I happened across this post, and I decided to try reading the story despite an issue that bothered me with the review: there is a clear lack of a plot summary or blurb to tell us what's it about. I suggest adding one of those in future reviews. Telling us various characteristics of a story is fine and all, but it is not particularly attractive in anything but a purely analytical way, one that is slightly attractive by the promise of a lack of problems, rather than the presence of features.
