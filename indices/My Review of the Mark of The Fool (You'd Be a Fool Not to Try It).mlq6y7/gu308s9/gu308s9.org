seems not bad. certainly better than similar stories that came out recently like Blessed Time or Pen is Mightier (less interesting worldbuilding, better execution).

bold choice to take the sister along. generally there are good reasons authors don't put little kids in adventuring parties. 8 chapters in and she's already been in significantly more danger than if she had just stayed with their adopted family.
