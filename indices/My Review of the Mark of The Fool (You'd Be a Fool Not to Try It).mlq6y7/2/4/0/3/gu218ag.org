Hi, I just wanted to let you know not to let trolls make you feel down (just in case it helps to hear this from a third party like me).

This subreddit has been experiencing, in recent years, a slow increase in the proportion of subtly rude (without swearwords) and/or pro-hate-speech comments, which unfortunately remain unmoderated.

Also, I clicked open the profile of the person you're responding to, and found that this sort of troll-like hostility seems to be a general pattern in their recent comments across subreddits (edit: specifically, I saw him accuse someone on a completely different subreddit of the same thing), so it really isn't anything you said.
