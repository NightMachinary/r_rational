I know both Nameless and the author of Mark of the Fool and just thought I'd quickly weigh in. They're definitely not the same person and this is a legitimate case of a fan and fellow author wanting to support great writing.

I haven't personally read MotF yet since I tend to binge stories all at once, but I *have* read the author's previous work, which in my opinion is some of the best on Royal Road. Based on the strength of their previous work I would be very surprised if this turns out to be anything less than stellar. It's on my read list for the near future. :)
