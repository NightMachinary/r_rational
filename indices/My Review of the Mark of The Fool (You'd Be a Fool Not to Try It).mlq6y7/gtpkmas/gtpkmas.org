Normally I would leave something like this on Read Later till it gave me a nice long archive binge, but I got bored last night and this caught me at the right time.

So far, I'm taken with it.

The writing, mechanically, is solid. No obnoxious tense-switching, no glaring errors or nonsense word choices. That right there puts it a step above a lot of the unedited junk on RR.

The characters are sound. Each of the three main characters has a goal of their own. Even the ten-year-old little sister has a goal: to get over her fear of fire. The female lead isn't a mindless cardboard love-interest; she's a wannabe adventurer still trying to decide if she wants a family or adventure more.

So yeah, this post may or may not strike you as sus, but I certainly don't regret having binged seven chapters of this story. Go ahead and put it on your Read Later lists of nothing else.
