I think that downvoting is intended for exactly this kind of post. "go fuck off" and the general arrogant attitude of this post are things I want to see less of on the internet, regardless of the actual opinion expressed.

Also, regarding the update itself, does the fact that it was mostly crowdsourced matter that much? On the long run, I expect most readers of this fic won't have read the crowdsourcing thread.

EDIT: Holy crap, I am a third of this thread's responses. Come on, people who are not me! Be more talkative so I can feel less guilty about spending my time on reddit!
