Here is some hopefully more constructive criticism.

This interlude broke with the convention of previous interludes, because there is no omniscient narrator. I think this damaged my sense of immersion somewhat. However, I think the problem might ultimately be that your change was not dramatic enough. I can imagine the break in convention could have served to emphasize the seriousness of the events that just occurred. The format change, if executed to its fullest potential, might have caused disorientation in the reader that would mirror the confusion faced by the in-universe world. So, possibly, I think the weaknesses in this chapter come from the guilt or shame that you're feeling. You should never write scared or half-heartedly.

It's very off topic, but i feel compelled to recommend you watch a specific creepy YouTube video. The sense of fear and confusion it evokes in me is identical to the sense of fear and confusion I feel your unconventional interlude might also have been able to evoke if executed just slightly differently: [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mw_HKzo9Ync]]

Applied to your chapter, aiming at this kind of feeling might have meant putting a big EMERGENCY notice at the top of the page, for the sticky? And increased general disorder would have been nice as well, so perhaps you could have chosen a "sort by new" display and shown some panicked, idiotic, low effort, or heavily downvoted comments as well.

Just spitballing here, obviously, as I am not actually a competent fiction writer myself. Much of this plausibly would not have been workable for you. My aim is just to use these examples to help better convey to you the state of mind I'm feeling.

Also, it's possible I might have had my reactions negatively biased by reading the fake thread first, so add an additional grain of salt to how you interpret all of my feedback.

I'm glad you edited my comment to make my point in a way that was more graceful, thank you for that.

I found myself wishing you had changed more of other people's comments, however. Again this might be due to bias, but a lot of the replies in the fake Reddit thread seemed off to me, in the same kind of way that bad actors sometimes seem off due to tremendous overexaggeration of their facial expressions and vocal dynamics. I'm guessing you tried to preserve the originals as much as possible, in order to convincingly simulate writing by multiple different people. But the reactions were never authentic in the first place, and I think additional editing would likely have made them seem more believable, rather than less.

I really liked my alt's username! Thank you!
