So... I would like this update a lot more if I didn't already know most of the individual pieces from heavily participating in the IC reaction thread. Even so, the overall idea is very good, a very nice way of crowd sourcing. If it was my first time seeing it, it would be very fun, like the best of the PHO updates from Worm. Even knowing a lot of the content already, it was still a net positive reading it, and the expansion on the last comment was absolutely brilliant. I feel like my in character response was insensitive for not offering any condolences or such, it was a really great way to give the audience a sense for what all the deaths meant (otherwise they would just be a statistic to the reader).
