Hey---I actually wish you weren't being downvoted so much because

- This means you were looking forward to the update, which means you're somebody who likes the story, which means you're somebody whose opinion I care about.
- If you felt this way, then other people did, too
- Your criticism is maybe a little harsh, but it IS valid.

I hope if you get through to the later half of it, you'll start to see that I /did/ put a lot of work into it ... it's not just a copy-paste of the Reddit thread. As for a full update, it's coming soon---the last two weeks were consumed by the fact that I had to run a CFAR workshop, and there aren't any more workshops for the rest of the year.

tl;dr saitselkis has a point; I know because I already felt a little guilty.
