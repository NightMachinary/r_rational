If Esplin morphs Alloran he's technically not losing the Alloran brain, but then you kinda get an issue of not much changing at all, especially if Esplin keeps his Alloran morph conscious. Which leads to an interesting question...if a Yeerk were to morph, would they keep the morph unconscious the entire time, or would they get 'creeped out' by the silence?

This is kind of a fascinating ethical question. If you give Yeerks morphing tech and they morph sentient species, are they still technically infesting them?
