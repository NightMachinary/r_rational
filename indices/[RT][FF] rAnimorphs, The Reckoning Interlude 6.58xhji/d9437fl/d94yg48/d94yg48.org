Morphing tech for Yeerks has been discussed around here once in a while, but not explicitly mentioned in the story. Unless someone convinces me otherwise, my current take is "it'd work on a single Yeerk, but then break when that Yeerk diffused back into the pool," meaning it'd work on Esplin for good (and his time limit would be RIDICULOUS, given his mass, but he probably wouldn't want to lose his Alloran brain).

Without saying yes, no, or sideways, I like the way you think re: politics, especially regarding the Andalite homeworld.
