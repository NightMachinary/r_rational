Typo: User countingcards refers to himself as countingcards52 in his own comment.

Very interesting chapter. I'm glad to see myself represented in it (yay!) and I can see where my comment's been edited to make the central point more clearly (good job). You definitely hit the nail on the head when it comes to the point of having a lot of different voices in this chapter. And I can see where a lot of the points came from.

I especially liked TroubledTrousers' long diatribe at the end, there.

I notice that most people are treating it like it had little or no emotional impact on them personally - which is probably not entirely unreasonable, given how most people probably didn't have relatives or people that they know in Ventura - and Troubled's long post at the end goes a long way towards countering this.

I liked it.
