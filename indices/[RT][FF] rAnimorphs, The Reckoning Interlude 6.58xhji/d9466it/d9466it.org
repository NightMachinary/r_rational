Random thoughts on this chapter, and other recent ones:

- I wonder what Telor and its hosts think of Esplin's speech. I can totally imagine controllers going "Wait, these guys are sentient?" "Sure. You didn't notice?", and hosts thinking "Does that mean they're going to treat us with respect now? ... Ha. Ha. Ha. :(".

- One of the possible goals of Esplin's speech that hasn't been suggested so far could be memetic vaccination. If he visibly betrays humanity after this speech, cooperation between any group of yeerks and any group of humans will be much more difficult and unlikely going forward. "Oh, you regret enslaving us? Yeah, look at what the last guy who said that did!"

- This chapter seems to imply that there is a complete information blackout from at least the American and the Estonian government, probably many more. That's weird, I'd expect that governments would want to be as open as possible, and official should make speech after speech after public conference to reassure the public. Shutting the media out sounds like something that A would get the media very angry, B would get many, many people to riot out of fear that their government is working for the alien invasion, and C would be missing political opportunities to show your value as a leader by taking visible measures in difficult times.

While I'm at it, the list of mangled pseudonyms:

- GrimHarvest7876 = I thought he was a PHO Bagrat cameo, but after checking, nope; [[/u/reaper7876][u/reaper7876]]

- countingcards = [[/u/keeper52][u/keeper52]]

- PumicePrimate = [[/u/ObsidianOrangutan][u/ObsidianOrangutan]]

- creatureoftheglade = [[/u/creatureofthewood][u/creatureofthewood]]

- HeartScribe = [[/u/MugaSofer][u/MugaSofer]] (?)

- entroprising = [[/u/chaosmosis][u/chaosmosis]] (clever)

- cognoslutty = [[/u/philophile][u/philophile]] (haha)

- hagar = [[/u/ketura][u/ketura]] (?)

- WetnessIsTheEssenceOfBeauty = [[/u/Anakiri][u/Anakiri]] (?)

- SabreVerte = Moi-mÃªme (he forgot the accent on the second 'e', though)

- GSVOrangeYouGladIDidntSayBanana = No equivalent, I think; also, I love the idea of the thread with 100+ responses about "by the way, what the fuck just happened to the laws of reality?"

- AskMeAboutDwarfFortress = [[/u/PeridexisErrant][u/PeridexisErrant]] (?)

- Cosmic_Crayon, dontcallmeishmael, ElliotPhoneHome, m073cu73, rampant170, ArcaneFerret = No equivalent (?)

- CQCQ_037 = [[/u/CCC_037][u/CCC_037]]

- KillroyIsHere = [[/u/royishere][u/royishere]], and, finally

- TroubledTrousers = [[/u/KnickersInAKnit][u/KnickersInAKnit]]

Also, this chapter made me re-read both Worm's PHO interlude and Pact's Execution 13.4. I guess I'm a sucker for alternative formats.
