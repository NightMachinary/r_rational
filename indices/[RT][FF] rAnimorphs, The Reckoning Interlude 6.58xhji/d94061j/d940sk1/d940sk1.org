Which is the recommended way to read this chapter:

#+begin_quote
  Author's note: I did what I could re: formatting, but yeesh. Fanfiction is great, you guys are great, but this one interlude in particular may be worth reading on aooo instead (work number is 5627803) or by downloading the pdf (woo!) available at goo gl yLCvgK
#+end_quote

Chapter is a reddit thread, AO3 has the correct indentation. Makes it much easier to read.
