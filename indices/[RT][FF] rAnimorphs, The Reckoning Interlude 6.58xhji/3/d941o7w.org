The real tragedy here is that the last post only has one upvote. Come one, fictional reddit, you can do better!

Also, I think SabreVerte should be SabreVert (also, squeeeee :D).

Anyway, everything about this update is awesome. I liked it a bit less than the PHO Worm update because I'd already seen most of the contents, but otherwise it hit all the marks that PHO did: the formatting, the abbreviations, the typos (beware the Andalight menace), people being assholes to random internet strangers, and so, much, sarcasm. The last message really hit a note too.
