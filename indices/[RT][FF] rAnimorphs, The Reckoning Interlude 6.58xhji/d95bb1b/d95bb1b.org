Woohoo, made it in! Literary immortality via ratfic!

Question: how did you possibly make the decision on which posts to keep and which to cut? You could have easily made the chapter three times as long, and I admire your restraint, but I am interested to know your methodology. Was it mostly by feel, or was there a more logical component? Did you try to limit yourself to one post per facet of the situation? Was any of the humor worked in in earlier drafts?

One criticism as well -- perhaps it's due to the fact that I read through the source thread several times over, but I found the dissonance between the crowdsourced content and your writing somewhat jarring. Perhaps predictably, you didn't quite manage to capture the feeling of a hodgepodge collection of internet voices as well as the actual hodgepodge collection of internet voices did. I will try to be constructive and suggest that the more effective method would have been to fight the instincts that have invariably produced wonderful writing and try to, well, write worse.
