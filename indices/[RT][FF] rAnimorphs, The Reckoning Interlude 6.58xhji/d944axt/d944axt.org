I like this chapter. Yurk/Andalight spelling confusion is cool, obvious in retrospect but easy to overlook in advance. The last guy's lament, that Ventura's going to just get overlooked, is especially strong contrasted with everyone else talking about strategy and analysis and physics and the state of the economy.
