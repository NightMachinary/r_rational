I am really looking forward to seeing how the Animorphs deal with this.

Lets say that the world receives true confirmation of the aliens, and the resolution of the Fermi Paradox becomes fact. Then naturally the smart thing for the Animorphs to do is come forward with Ax, and tell their side of the story.

Only then they have to admit to having the morphing technology, which, in the hands of the Yeerks, would give them an unprecedented advantage. (Side note; wouldn't morphing tech allow Yeerks to stop taking hosts? Sure, it would limit how far an individual could go from the pool, but it would remove their dependence on awake, sentient minds. That is, if a yeerk collective can even acquire the ability in the first place. ).

And this would also put them at the centre of the international media storm that would follow, which some of them might find objectionable, considering that quite a few would blame them for the meteor.

And perhaps, most importantly, the andalites. In canon, the andalites thought the animorphs were lying when they said their home world was being invaded; in this case they already know, and their go-to plan when it came to stopping an unaware humanity from serving the yeerks was to scorch the planet.

If they caught wind that humanity might start willingly cooperating with the yeerks? Earth literally might be forced into an alliance with the yeerks, just to survive that first wave of andalite aggression. Especially considering that the last individual who the andalites might listen to (Ax) was last seen letting a yeerk infest him.

In fact, that could actually be Visser- Ones plan, if my model of the andalites is correct.
