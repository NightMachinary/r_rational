It was mostly a feel thing. I went through the 238-comment thread and selected one comment, first (This Must Go In), then went down again and selected the next most important, then the next most, then the next most, stopping as soon as I felt I could. Basically, I tried to do the one-post-per-facet thing, and nodded to the remainder in "show more replies."

Heh---I /did/ try to write worse, while at the same time saying all the things that needed to be said. Ah, well.
