Serious response - a sort of living vicariously feeling. I'm not much of a writer, honestly. I'm kinda your stereotypical STEM major who can nitpick on the ridiculousness of CSI managing to get forensic DNA results back in 2 hours (come the fuck on, PCR takes like 3 hours to run esp with a manual plate load) and other such nonsense, but writing? It doesn't come easy to me.

I know that you and I comment a lot on [[/u/TK17Studio]] 's updates here on [[/r/rational]], and you consistently comment on 'where things are going'. I mostly comment on 'biology things the author got wrong' and 'how I can break the rules of the world next'. Don't get me wrong, I truly love this fanfic. I just can't read and immediately see all those literary devices that other fans of this story can. I can appreciate, but not articulate.

So seeing the author dedicate about 1/5th of an interlude to expanding on a comment of mine that came from a place of personal experience (bitter, bitter grief at the unfairness of the world) is frankly...well. I feel like I've 'made it' in a strange way. Achievement unlocked: KnickersInAKnit inspires someone else to write something.
