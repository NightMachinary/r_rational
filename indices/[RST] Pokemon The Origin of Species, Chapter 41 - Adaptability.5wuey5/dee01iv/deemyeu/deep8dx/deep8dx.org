I see. There's quite a lot of content to look forward to at least. You're doing great. Your writing is supreme, your story is excellent, and those Mewtwo sections are pure gold.

I am one of those that really enjoy worldbuilding, both doing it myself and read about others who does it. Fanfiction can be really good at this, as we don't have to start from scratch. This can be both a boon and a curse, but it's what I really like about it. So, yes. I did enjoy the shopping scene. It was really interesting.

And if automation works out, then I too can start writing fanfiction full time, praising the robots that do all my work for me. Hopefully that can happen to you as well.

My own fanfic is a Naruto and Bleach crossover. I know. It's the most cliche combination imaginable (perhaps after Harry Potter and Naruto), but I really enjoy both of those series. They have their problems, but that's why I'm writing, isn't it?

The story is named Bleached Whirlpool. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11459500/1/Bleached-Whirlpool]] It's about... well, worldbuilding itself, I think. I made my own urban fantasy world and tossed the Naruto and Bleach verses into that one. I don't classify it as a rational fic, but I try my best to be as logical and consistent as I can. Because none of the main cast are particularly hardcore rationalists, quite the opposite really. People will be people, and they don't always act rationally, but the world is at least self-consistent. Or at least as self-consistent as my monkey brain can make it.
