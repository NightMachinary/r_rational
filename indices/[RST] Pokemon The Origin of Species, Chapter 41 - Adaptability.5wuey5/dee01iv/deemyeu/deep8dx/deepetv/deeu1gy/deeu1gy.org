If you don't mind me jumping in with a few suggestions, I'd like to recommend [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/][The Waves Arisen]] for when you've finished Naruto. It's my favourite Naruto fanfic, and also rational on top of that, /and finished as well/.

(Also check out [[/r/NarutoFanfiction]] if you want some non-rational stories)
