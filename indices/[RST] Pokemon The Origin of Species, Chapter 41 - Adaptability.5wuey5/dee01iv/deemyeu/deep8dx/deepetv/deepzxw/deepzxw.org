Yeah. I update really slowly though, so it's not really productivity as much as it is a style of writing. Naruto is good. It's not great, but certainly good. If there was any Naruto fanfic I would recommend above all others it would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine][Dreaming of Sunshine]]. That one is really good. In fact, I think it's the best fanfic I have ever read (no offense to you, yours is really great as well).

I find that I really enjoy 'rationalist' fiction, but that is only a way of classifying the story. What I really enjoy is consistent worldbuilding and a logical framework for how the world works, and DoS certainly has that.

Time Braid is... well... I guess it's fine, although I have some major problems with it. I have never read Marked for Death, I'd have to look into that.

And don't really bother with what is cliche. That's just an arbitrary label anyway. Anything can be good as long as the author is good. I had a really hard time finding a pokemon fic I liked until I found yours. And now I'm more than satisfied. I thought I would have to write some myself, just to scratch the itch that is was there from this fantastic world existing with so much unfulfilled potential. Now I just enjoy the feeling of that potential being realized and knowing it was done much better than I ever could.
