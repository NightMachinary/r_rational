Wow, 110k words in 5 chapters! But good on you for working at it. I don't know enough about fanfic in general to know what's cliche and what's not (other than generic trope stuff) but I'm currently reading through Naruto and enjoying it, so maybe I'll check it out sometime after I finish (and finally get around to Time Braid and Marked for Death as well!)
