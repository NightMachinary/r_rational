Great chapter as always. A rather broad question, how long do you expect the story to be? I mean, it's already at 41 chapters and 300 000+ words. It feels like it's somewhere around half-finished based on the developments of the plot threads and such, but fanfiction is much less restricted to the normal rules of storytelling than other books. So it can go on for years and years without stopping. I mean, Red, Blue and Leaf is only at cerulean, and I don't know if you want to continue until Blue actually does become the champion (if he does) or not. So, what general timeframe are we looking at here? This is just pure curiosity though. I'll continue reading this as long as you keep updating it. And I'll probably read everything else you publish as well, supposing I am even remotely interested in the subject.

PS. Do you need a beta? I don't know how much help I would be, but I do write my own fanfic, and I think it's decently written.
