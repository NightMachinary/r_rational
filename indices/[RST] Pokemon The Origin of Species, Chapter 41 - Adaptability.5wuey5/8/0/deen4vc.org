Stones exist, but they don't work quite the same way as in the games or anime. As for trade evolutions, I've pretty much completely scrapped that, since it seems really gimmicky and is totally unexplained in the games, not to mention not making any sense (what, did Gengar and Machamp just not exist before humans invented the technology to trade pokemon?)
