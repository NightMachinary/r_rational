Why not make the trade evolution requirement to be more like...'world traveller' experience or something. So a Haunter, Kadabra etc that lives a quiet life in a small town with an introverted trainer is not going to evolve. But the individuals who visit the many cities in Kanto, or even the regions beyond and meets many trainers and other pokemon will.
