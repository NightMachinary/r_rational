So the list of pokemon who evolve through trading sans item is as follows:

Kadabra, Haunter, Machoke, Graveler, Boldore, Gurdurr, Phantump, Pumpkaboo

Alakazam is one of the smartest Pokemon, on par with...I think a 5 yo in this universe? Let's compare that with a parrot. Parrots get pretty miserable if you don't socialize them, spend time with them, give them lots of /novelty/...well, I think that travel and lots of new experiences would encourage a Kadabra's maturation into an Alakazam. Also, note that Kadabra's dex entries say nothing about its intelligence (just power) compared to Alakazam. How does it become smart? Learning new things!

Haunter's Pokedex says that it tries to steal souls...don't think that's happening in this universe (what does Red think about souls?). Phantump and Trevenant live in lonely forests and trap visitors. Pumpkaboo "is said to carry wandering spirits to the place where they belong so they can move on" - travel requirement pretty much right here! For the others, I think they'd need a wide variety of tasty victims to be able to evolve.

Machoke...more people to fight, nuff said. Sparring the same people over and over doesn't teach you anything. Gotta be the very best!

Graveler eats rocks (preferably moss-covered). Going to new places would ensure a steady supply of a balanced diet of minerals, assuming the trainer doesn't already live on a mountain.

Boldore is a tough one. Leaks energy constantly according to the dex. Maybe poisons its own environment if it doesn't keep moving, like a fish living in a tank with poor filtration/inflow of clean water.

In conclusion, this proposed 'travel requirement' wouldn't be a hard one, but it would speed up growth and evolution of the evolve-by-trade group.
