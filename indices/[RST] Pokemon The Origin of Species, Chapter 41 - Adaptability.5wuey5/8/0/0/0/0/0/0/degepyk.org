Trades between two people and regions I'd view like...well, the concept of voltage! The greater the total difference between person A and person B, the more likely it'll result in an evolution.

Screw the trading with an item idea though, that's dumb. Just give the pokemon the item and wait until they figure it out imo. Maybe it wouldn't work immediately like the evo stones if you want to differentiate the two.

I see your point though, ultimately probably not worth it to keep the trading requirement nod to the games.
