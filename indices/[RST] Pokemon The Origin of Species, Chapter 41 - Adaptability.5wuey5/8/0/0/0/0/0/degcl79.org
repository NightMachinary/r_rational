I thought of a number of ways to try and rationalize the trading (not just the travel requirement idea, which you expanded on wonderfully, but also things like loss of their parent-figure or forced changes in allegiance), but ultimately I just realized there were too many holes in all of them. For this one in particular, what about trades between people in the same region or location? If two people in Kanto trade haunter and graveler, they'd have no reason to evolve. It also throws into question the whole "trading with an item attached" evolution question, which clearly focuses on the item and not the trading itself.

So if I went with that, now I'd have to make up a new rule that the trade has to occur between different regions to speed up evolution, and come up with an explanation for why the process of trading matters for those that need an item. And if I'm putting in new limits or coming up with new rules to make the "Trading causes evolution" still work differently from canon anyway, then I might as well just scrap it altogether.

Maybe I'll think of something that works as a good nod to the game's rules without adopting them fully and implement it later though :)
