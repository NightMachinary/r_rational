True, you'd need some wildly ad-hoc reasoning for why certain items essentially trigger a bug in the storage/retrieval code, and yet also that bug has a consistent and beneficial outcome.

Either that, or posit a /separate/ set of outcomes, where pokemon get horribly spliced with random items... which would probably be something of an urgent priority for them to fix
