It means a lot to me that we're seeing Red manage his emotional well-being. The passage about going outside, how it feels both good and taxing, made me notice my appreciation for having this depiction. Like most everyday tasks, we generally skip past emotional maintenance in fiction, but as someone who has to do it all "manually" and with friends and a life partner who struggle with that stability, it means a lot to me to read a protagonist go through it in a realistic and relatable way. So thanks.

Oh, and it's also great that even though it's connected to his psychic abilities, it isn't the thing generating them or empowering them as happens so often with impaired heroes (see: Daredevil).
