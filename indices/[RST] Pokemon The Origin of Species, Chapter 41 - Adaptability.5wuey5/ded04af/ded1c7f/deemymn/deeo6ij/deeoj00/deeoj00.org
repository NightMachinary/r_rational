I use that sometimes too, but sometimes when looking over text the same word or name shows up too often and it starts to bother me, so I switch up how things or people are referred to :)

Since the sentence only has one subject besides Blue (who's clearly male) that was already referred to in the feminine, I think it's okay grammatically.

"The next gust of wind knocks the *squirtle* from *her* feet, and Blue finally points *her* dive ball forward."
