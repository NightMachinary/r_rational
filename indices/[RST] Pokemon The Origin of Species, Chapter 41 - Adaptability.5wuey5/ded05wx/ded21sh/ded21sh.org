I thought it was a great chapter! I'm definitely curious about how Red's psychic powers will develop, and what the endgame for that looks like, since that is something the games did not spend much time elaborating upon. I also find it very satisfying to see Blue grow as a trainer while also seeing the difficulty of his gym battles rise in roughly equal proportion. It's a great way of gradually building the world (at least as it pertains to combat and gym bureaucracy) while also emulating the difficulty curves of the games.
