You're right, there isn't much on the whole. Actual swearing, an average of less than once per chapter. Milder language, much more often. I just like to have none :). And I like the challenge of doing it without disrupting the flow. My ideal state is that unless you do a side-by-side comparison, you wouldn't notice that it was altered. I can't /always/ achieve that, of course, but I'm pretty pleased with the result thus far. Almost finished a typo-oriented reread, too.
