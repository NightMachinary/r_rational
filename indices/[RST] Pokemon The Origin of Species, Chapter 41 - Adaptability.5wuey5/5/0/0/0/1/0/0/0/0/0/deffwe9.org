Yep. Mostly for my own use and immediate family members, though if anyone else wants a copy, they're welcome. It's an interesting challenge to replace words while still preserving the tone.

I'm actually tracking changes with Git, with typo corrections on the master branch and the "airline version" on its own branch. So I could in theory produce a copy with a bunch of fixes but the original language. My baseline was an ePub produced via ficsave.xyz
