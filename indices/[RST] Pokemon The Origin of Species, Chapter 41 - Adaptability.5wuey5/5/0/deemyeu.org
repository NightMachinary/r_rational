So, my common response to this is to simply say "I'm not sure" and estimate that it will certainly be more than 100 chapters, but probably less than 150. However, we all know how optimism bias operates, and I would not be terribly surprised if, five years from now, I'm looking back and sighing at my silly past self for thinking that I could get through most of the story I have in mind in just 100 chapters.

/However./ I have been making an effort recently to step the pace up, and I think I'm getting at least a little better at it. What's also helping with that is that I've always known the early parts of the story would take longer than the later parts, because it's where details on the world and characters need the most fleshing out. Once they're established, far less time needs to be taken going over them again (if any needed to be taken at all, by some perspectives). As an example of this, there will never be another chapter on Red and the gang going shopping. That chapter is probably one of the easiest to cut, if I ever have to choose chapters to cut, but it's also one that I think did a lot in building the world and society, for those that enjoy that sort of thing.

Hope that's a satisfactory answer, and I'm glad you enjoy the story enough to keep reading it :) Who knows, maybe I'll hit it big someday and be able to quit my day job and devote myself to writing full time. That would certainly make the ~150 chapter estimate less daunting, divorced from the pace of one chapter per month @_@

PS. Thanks for the offer, but I'm okay for now! What's your fanfic about?
