Great chapter; I want to say, I really really love how you're handling Red's grief. Bravo to Red being a big enough man to go back to his therapist- a /great/ therapist, too.

The last section with Red thinking about how he's handling the Abra as a way to 'answer' the grief genuinely touched me, I'm still tearing up thinking about it. Wonderfully done. As someone who's lost a parent (and is very far away from the other) that way of projecting them into the situation and gauging their response (as a means of dealing with the overall depression) is something I do a lot, and do find it to be a positive experience- I've never seen or heard it somewhere else.
