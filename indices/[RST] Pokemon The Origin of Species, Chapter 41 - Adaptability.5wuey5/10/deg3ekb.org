Poor Red experiencing all the emotions from his dad's loss, but it's also good he's finally working through them, instead of bottling 'em up. I can see you're blending the 'carries a Pikachu about' character aspect Red and Ash are known for into it too, due to Pichu (and, once it evolves, Pikachu) being a fluffy friend he can cuddle with for comfort who's not particularly dangerous to hug.

It's really quite sweet, and a lovely idea, imo.
