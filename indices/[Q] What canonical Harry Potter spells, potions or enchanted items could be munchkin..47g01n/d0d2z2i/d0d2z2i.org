Harry Potter magic is full of exploitable loopholes that could basically make you an overpowered munchkin.

Transfiguration is probably one of the most powerful disciplines that we see in canon yet the main cast barely uses it to its full potential.

HP magic is incredibly versatile (especially since it appears to be conceptaul instead of anything reductionist) so if you have some skill and can think creatively you will go far.

For example think about the Confundus charm which basically makes the target believe almost anything temporarily. Not only is this a great mind control spell it could also be used in other novel ways. What if you perform a Confundus charm on a computer to trick it into giving you administrative privileges, you could basically hack into computers whenever you want.

And that's just off the top of my head, there are lots of possible uses for even the simplest of charms.
