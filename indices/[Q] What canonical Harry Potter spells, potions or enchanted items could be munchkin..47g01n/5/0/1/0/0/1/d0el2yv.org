It's from one of the works of H.P. Lovecraft, who is recognised as having essentially invented the cosmic horror genre just under a century ago in the 20's. His works have had a bit of a resurgence in popularity, becoming the go-to inspiration for people who want a crazed, indifferent or otherwise horrifying greater power in their universe. D&D, LoL and countless books and stories use his ideas, really they pop up all over the place once you know what you're looking for, and his writing still holds up well today.

That line in particular is from The Call of Cthulu. It's all public domain by now you so you can [[http://www.dagonbytes.com/thelibrary/lovecraft/thecallofcthulhu.htm][freely read it online]] if you like.
