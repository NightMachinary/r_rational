Sorry, I figured it broke one of the "laws of magic".

On a more changing thing, Use Pensieves for witness testimonies. It is a simple matter to determine memory modification, as can be seen in both the books and movies, but if one uses obliviation, then there may be issues.

Seriously, this would probably change up the magical justice system.
