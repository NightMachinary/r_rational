Just curious about what constitutes the bare minimum of a functioning wizard brain by magical standards - and therefore how much of a live wizard isn't technically required to be present, either physically or psychologically.

Endless rows of lobotomized brains in jars churning out spells or simply gathering/channeling magic power, anyone?

As for muggles, it depends on what they can and cannot use. If you can create a spell (or spell framework) which artificially churns out artifacts that muggles can use, there are an /awful lot/ of muggles compared to wizards. 100,000 artificial stunner spells could do a lot in a wizard/muggle battle.
