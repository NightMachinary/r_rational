Most magic items and potions don't seem to care who the user is; the bottleneck is making them, which requires a wand-user. Even the stuff that's wizard-only (mostly locations) seems like you can make exceptions. It's really just spellcasting that's special.

Now that I think of it, there /is/ mention of severe emotional trauma potentially knocking out spellcasting ability, so brain damage messing up wizard-ness sounds plausible.

HPMOR's system doesn't work in canon, but it does seem suspiciously ... genetic. (Muggleborns being descended from wizards is canon.)
