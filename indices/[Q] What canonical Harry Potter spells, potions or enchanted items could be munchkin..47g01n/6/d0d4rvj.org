I don't know all the myriad technicalities of the Potterverse, but two points of attack I'd consider are whether muggles can use/wield/cast any kind of magical device/effect/spell whatsoever (even one which is completely useless), or what canonically separates a wizard from a muggle - something in the DNA, as per HPMOR? Are there wizards with brain damage who can still cast or use artifacts? Ones who are effectively brain-dead but still register as 'wizard' to some kind of detector?
