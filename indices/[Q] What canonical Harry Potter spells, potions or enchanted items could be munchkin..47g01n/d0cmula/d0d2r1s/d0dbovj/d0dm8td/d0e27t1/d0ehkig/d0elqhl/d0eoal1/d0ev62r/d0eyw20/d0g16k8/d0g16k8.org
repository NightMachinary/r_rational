The Anti-Alohomora Charm exists in canon as a way to use magic to prevent the use of Alohomora. I don't entirely know how said charm works, but there is a chance that it doesn't negate the spell itself, but uses an alternative method to make it useless.

Plus, how would you get any useful information out of the lock if you needed to know the answer to make said lock in the first place?
