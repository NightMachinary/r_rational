There aren't many magical laws in canon. Of those there are:

- Cannot create food from nothing - ok, just /engorgio/ a dust-speck and transfigure that into food. Or a thousand other ways.
- Can't raise the dead - I know you said no time-turners, but canonically, they're a more stable (read: can travel back further) container for the Hour-Reversal Charm, which can be learned.
- OK, OK, going back and replacing your friend with a convincing fake isn't /technically/ raising the dead. Neither is creating a portrait and teaching it to convincingly mimic you. Horcruxes aren't exactly commonplace ... consciousness in Harry Potter does exist in the brain, since transfiguring someone into an animal gives them the animal's brain; and spell research is possible; so I'd suggest this as a possible avenue to Transfigured clones. (Or if you just need a quick conversation, it's worth noting that Avada Kedavera stores a semi-tangible "echo" of the target in the caster's wand forever.)
- Incidentally, Horcruxes are created by the evil-ness of killing someone, and un-created by remorse; so you've just got to drive someone to murder in a convincing simulation, make a Horcrux, and then tell them it was fake so they don't feel bad about it. May or may not have harmful side-effects.
- In terms of social collapse: mind-modification is easy, so getting away with crimes is also pretty easy. Also, it's not that hard to control someone and put them in power. Both of these happened in canon, though.
- Since magical labour is basically the only scarce good in the wizarding world, and they have mind control, anyone who enslaves people is going to have an insurmountable economic advantage. I'm pretty sure Rowling didn't think of this.
