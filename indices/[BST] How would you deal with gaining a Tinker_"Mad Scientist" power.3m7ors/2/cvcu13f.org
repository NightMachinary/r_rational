The "can't break the laws of physics" restriction seems a bit arbitrary. I mean, this is mad science. And odds are if it follows the laws of physics, anyone /should/ be able to work out how stuff works with math and a working prototype.

Besides, it might not break the laws of physics, but it might use them in a way we can't conceive of yet. People used to think that heavier than air flight was impossible to achieve for humans.
