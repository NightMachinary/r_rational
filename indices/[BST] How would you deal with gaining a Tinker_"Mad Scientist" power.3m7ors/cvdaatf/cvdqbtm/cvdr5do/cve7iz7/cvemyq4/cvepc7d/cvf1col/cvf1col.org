And here I thought Brainfuck was the worst....after a little research, I have concluded that Brainfuck is actually the BEST of all the more... /esotric/ languages such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_%28programming_language%29][Whitespace]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE][Lolcode]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTERCAL][INTERCAL]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befunge][Befunge]], and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbolge][Malbolge]].

After all, Brainfuck is only using 4 characters while the other programs are using crazy things like only three types of whitespace characters, Internet memes as commands, two-dimensional coding where you have to 'map' out a program instead of writing it linearly in one-dimension, or actually self-modifying it's own code to make it difficult to understand.

I said it before, and I'll say it again...freaking programmers...and I'm in training to become one.

I'm a fool!
