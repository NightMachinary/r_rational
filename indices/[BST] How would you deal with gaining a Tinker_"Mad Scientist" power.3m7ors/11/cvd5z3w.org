  Nobody else understands which parts of your process are essential and which are incidental, and it's too complicated for you to explain.

I feel like if you built many different designs, you might be able to show via example which parts mattered and how they worked. This is device A that does X, this is device A1, this is device A2, etc.

Also, despite the rules of Worm, it makes little sense to say that all tinker devices must break over time and thus require maintenance. Just build something very robust, or something very modular and simple that doesn't require understanding to be maintained. What kind of idiot genius are you, anyway?

As a last resort, you could possibly build repair robots that are designed to also repair each other. So long as they don't all break at once you should hopefully be okay, and have indefinitely maintained technology.
