How's this prohibition on explanation work? Am I struck mute when trying to write down or discuss how I've built things? Can people observe me while I work extra slowly on my technology? Do I understand how any of it works or which bits are essential and incidental, or am I building stuff in some sort of dissociative fugue or magically summoning them from the aether or something? Does understanding of the technology require intuitions concerning 97-dimensional hyperphysics or w/e, or is it in principle graspable by merely human minds?

Anyway, I'd try integrate myself into the broader research community. Maybe make something marketable and use it to make a bit of startup capital or persuade investors, and then hire scientists from all the fields tangential to my persuasion. If I don't understand how my tech works but I do "make" it myself, I'd try to iteratively vary the construction process and distill the important components from the unimportant. No single human has complete understanding of how, say, a laptop works. Science and engineering are a collaborative enterprise, and hopefully I could work alongside the great minds of many fields to reverse engineer, bit by bit, how all the components of my magic tech work. Reed Richards, when partnered with researchers far smarter (in a real sense, not a technomagic sense) than him, won't be useless for long.
