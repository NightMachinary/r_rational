Some fiction uses the idea that mad scientists and tinker types don't actually create devices that use scientific principles at all--rather their own mind is unconsciously powering the devices psychically. Is your mad scientist character like one of these, or is he building devices that work based on normal science, but just doesn't understand them once he's done making them?
