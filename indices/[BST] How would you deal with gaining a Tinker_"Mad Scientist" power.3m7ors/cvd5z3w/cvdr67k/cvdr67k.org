  Also, despite the rules of Worm, it makes little sense to say that all tinker devices must break over time and thus require maintenance. Just build something very robust, or something very modular and simple that doesn't require understanding to be maintained.

That's possible. I think the idea in Worm was that focusing on that as a design goal meant sacrificing other things - and of course everything breaks down /eventually/ - but there were characters who did stuff like that. Containment foam worked fine, for instance.
