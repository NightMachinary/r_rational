I would focus on robotic systems capable of building and maintaining each other. Who cares if no-one can copy or repair my designs? I'll just make the whole thing do that by itself. Then it could von-neuman and create dozens of factories from my technology, making whatever it is I programmed it to make. Super advanced materials, computronium, whatever.

There would, of course, be safety protocols to stop it pulling a skynet.
