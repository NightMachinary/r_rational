Many, many problems have faster solutions with computational tech that is generations ahead. Creating an extremely powerful computer would allow me to push computational chemistry ages forward. Advances in medicine, materials, etc.

Self-replicating robots also sounds fun: conquer the rest of Sol, build self-replicating ships from asteroids and conquer the Milky Way.
