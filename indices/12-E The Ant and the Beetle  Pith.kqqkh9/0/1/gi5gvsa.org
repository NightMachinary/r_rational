  Commonplace killing parliament feels like a mistake, but I can't precisely say why.

Did they kill them? I assumed they died mostly in the crossfire or as a sideeffects of the seizures that revealed they were hijacked? Maxine never made a "call" to kill them as far as I can tell. Doesn't change the political calclulus but I think it changes the emotional/moral calculus.

  There were over a thousand of them, packed into one half of the dome, and all of them lay on the floor, their eyes open, spittle foaming from their lips

Max POV:

#+begin_quote
  He twitched and shook, and rolled over on the floor, his lips blurting out incoherent syllables.

  Ronaveda recoiled. “He's been hijacked. Badly.”

  No surprises there. The hardline loyalists would be kept under a tight leash.

  “Next,” said Max. She took Ronaveda to Esau Westlake, a political moderate who sympathized with Commonplace, but voted with the loyalists most of the time.

  He rolled over and had a seizure too. Another victim of Paragon's hijacking.

  Max clenched her teeth. “Next.” The building shook, and she led Ronaveda to Joyce Fulmer, a strong pro-Commonplace MP. She voted against Paragon's interests almost every time.

  Fulmer twitched, shaking and babbling nonsense. No. “Scholars,” breathed Max. No, that's not possible. She had expected a large conspiracy, yes, but this?

  Ronaveda tested another one. And another one. And another one. And another ten. Loyalists and Commonplace sympathizers and everything in between.

  All of them had the same reaction to the truth aura. All of them seized up, shivered, lost their ability to speak.

If anything I would guess its an inadvertent reaction to being forced to tell the truth, their minds/bodies can't handle the contradiction between the pith driven (Ronaveda + whoever hijacked them) orders so they die. I wonder if they have to plan around it when/if parliament members go on her show, or if they just never go.
