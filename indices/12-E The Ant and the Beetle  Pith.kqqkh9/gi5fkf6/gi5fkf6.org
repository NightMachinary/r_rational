  One of us would come out of this intact, and the rest would be cast aside, to be scorned or banished, doomed to live out the rest of their lives in resentful mediocrity. A brutal competition for a name, a body, a family, a pardon. Citizenship in this country.

  That was the deal my mother had offered us, that Paragon offered everyone, to some extent. Forge the stars in your image, or drown in the mud with the pigs. It wasn't kind, it wasn't fair, but it was the world. What power did we have to change it?

  If it came to it, I would have to fight Ana myself. /What a bloody farce./

Reading things like this as they fight tooth and nail to save Paragon will never not be frustrating.

Commonplace killing parliament /feels/ like a mistake, but I can't precisely say why. It certainly weakens their reveal that parliament was hijacked, but Paragon was going to suppress and discredit that anyway. It gives Paragon an easy opportunity to go mask off and be even /more/ oppressive and authoritarian, but again, they were going to do that anyway. It feeds the narrative that Commonplace are just violent thugs that want to burn the country to the ground, but a failed revolution already does that. I don't know, it still feels like the wrong move somehow, but I can't really justify that feeling with anything concrete.

Not entirely sure why Wes decided to let Kahlin live (it's not like he's never killed people before), and frankly the whole Kahlin thing is falling a bit flat for me anyway. I just don't really care about him as an antagonist at this point, there's bigger fish to fry. It doesn't really feel like he matters when Tunnel Vision is burning down Paragon and Pictogram is running off with Jun while Kahlin is just sort of... there. Plus, all the tension of the whole "Wes getting his life back" thing has shifted from "can he catch Kahlin and prove himself worthy?" to "will he take the deal even if it screws over Ana?" so he's not even really relevant to Wes' personal arc or plot. His presence feels weirdly vestigial at this point, which makes it odd when he's the focus of so much of the chapter.

Sucks to see Jun go, but getting Hira back at the same time eases the sting of it a little bit.

Overall a decent chapter, but it suffers from following on the heels of some really great, climactic stuff. The previous chapters focusing on Max and TV were fantastic, so when the chapter immediately afterwards is "just okay," it stands out even worse than it otherwise would.
