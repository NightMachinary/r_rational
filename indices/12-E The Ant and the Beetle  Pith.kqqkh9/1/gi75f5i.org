I'm with everyone else who finds our POV characters increasingly frustrating.

Seeing Wes and Ana fight over who gets to be a martyr for an institution they've both acknowledged will keep treating them like garbage feels kind of pointless.

(Especially since it's pretty obvious Ana was always going to win at that game, both because she's sneakier and because she's martyrier)
