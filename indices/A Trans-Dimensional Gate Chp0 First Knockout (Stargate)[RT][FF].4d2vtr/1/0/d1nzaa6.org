Currently betaing your first post of the reboot on SB - Going to send it as a PM message when I'm done.

If you like it, I might be up to beta more. It's not like I have more productive things to do while waiting for calls at work. Reading nonfiction can get draining after a while.

Edit: Done, with a pass-through that took around half an hour. Check your PMs on spacebattles. The most 'comma-en'(hue) mistakes are misuse of commas(mostly overuse) and incorrect tense/word choice(Had/have/has, etc.). The early parts of the chapter have a higher incidence of mistakes than the later parts.

Make whatever changes you desire, then strip the color formatting I used.
