I really need a beta, but I never found any longstanding volunteers to give the feedback as I needed, in the times that I asked for one.

It's going to take ongoing feedback to get my technical writings up to notch, and I am afraid that's too much time for the vast majority of people.

So I write blind. And it will continuously annoy the hell out of people.
