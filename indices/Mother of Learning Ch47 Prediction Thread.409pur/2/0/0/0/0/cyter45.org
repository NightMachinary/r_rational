His part of the soul implant is damaged. There's no reason to assume it will behave differently whether it's manually or automatically triggered.

And either way, this has the potential cause a significant change in the plot. If it ended the cycle early, Zach is going to start looking for why. If it didn't, Quatach-Ichi is going to be onto Zorian.

Edit: So, it seems you're right. At least Zorian thinks you're right...

  A possible issue was that the revert switch might affect Zach and Red Robe as well, not just him. Was their restart cut short as a consequence of his action in the previous restart? Probably. It must have been, if the switch worked like he thought it did. There was a chance they'd failed to note the abrupt end, since he'd activated the revert switch very close to the time it usually ended at anyway... but since he intended to keep using the revert switch, that wasn't going to last very long.

So expect Zach to be on the alert.
