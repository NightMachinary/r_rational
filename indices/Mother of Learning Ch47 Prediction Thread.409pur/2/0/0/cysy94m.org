It's explicitly stated earlier on that Zorian's death didn't terminate the loop, that only happened when Zach died early. So it seems likely to me that it would get his soul out of the way, but leave his dead body behind. Maybe necromancers don't do brain magic.

If it /does/ break the loop early, that's going to get Zach curious.

I'm also wondering now if there's anything that Zorian can do with those switches to make him wake up at the start of the cycle instead of a few hours later, and maybe try and save the spiders.
