I'm concerned that he didn't really get clean away from the necromancer. When he triggers, it just sends his soul back to the start of the loop (or puts it on hold until the loop starts over). So the necromancer has his dead body to play with until the restart, and might be able to get some information from his dead brain and communicate it to Quatach-Ichi.
