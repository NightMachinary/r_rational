I was about to start this exact type of thread. It's amazing how the hype for each chapter seems to grow every release.

I predict that it'll get closer to the wrap up of this arc. (perhaps hinting at the big change to signify it) I /hope/ that we learn more about these soul-marker functions as well as Zorian getting some sort of power multiplier.
