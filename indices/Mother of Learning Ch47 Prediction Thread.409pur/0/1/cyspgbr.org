The only theory I have is that Magnitude rating is affected by the age of your physical body. As you grow older, your body can't cope/process the mana as efficiently anymore and therefore it stop growing/grow in a very insignificant amount.

Zorian body didn't grow older in the loop so therefore he can keep on growing it.

However I haven't read any talk about older people losing their mana capabilities so I'm not so sure about this theory.
