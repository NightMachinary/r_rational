I enjoyed the fanfic without having any knowledge whatsoever about the source material. If you're asking whether it is good to someone who hasn't read the books but likes ratfic, then the answer is a definite yes. (Though you should know that it is not yet complete and only has a few more chapters to go, so you may want to wait before reading.)

BTW, after catching up to the latest chapter, I decided to have a quick look at the original books to see just how different the author made it and was surprised to find that several things that I had assumed were only in the fanfic actually had correlates in the canon books. The source material apparently had a lot more depth than you might first assume from looking at the book cover illustrations.
