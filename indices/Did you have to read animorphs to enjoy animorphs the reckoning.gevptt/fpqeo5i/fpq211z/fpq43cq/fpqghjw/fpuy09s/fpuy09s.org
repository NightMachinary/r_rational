The original touched on rationalist themes, but I really wouldn't call it rationalist.

The characters rately made plans more complicated than "find yeerk plot and smash things", "bureaucratic incompetence" is another way to say the villains made the same mistakes week after week, etc.

It was very much a saturday morning cartoon in book form, with graphic violence and occasional transhumanism added in.
