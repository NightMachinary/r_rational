It had one incompetent main villain (who was the Peter Principle meets “you have failed me, so die”), and one competent main villain, who is hamstrung by the first villain getting to take over her magnus opus, and by bureaucracy, which leads to the incompetent villain having her executed setting off the final arc of the series.

A big overarching theme was actually the way that bureaucratic incompetence and prejudice that the Yeerks inherent from the Andalites who uplifted then from semi-symbiotic hunter-gatherers leads to their downfall. The original series is quite good if you like rationalist fiction.
