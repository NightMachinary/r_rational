Hey everyone! I just found this subreddit and I'm super excited to find other people who love the same kind of fiction as me.

My story definitely counts as rationalist as Brandon Sanderson was one of my major influences, especially in creating a consistent magic system. I also strive to take fantasy monsters and present them as real animals that exist in a ecosystem.

Check it out and tell me if I'm breaking any of my own rules!
