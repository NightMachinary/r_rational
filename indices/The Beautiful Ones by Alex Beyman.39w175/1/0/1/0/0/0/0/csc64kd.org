So from an in-universe perspective, what value was there in starting with such extreme characters? Assuming the journal is truthful (which I doubt a word is), they're trying to get people to not give up or wipe out. Why start that game on hard mode? Even a genuinely random selection of humans from the planet (let alone a single continent) would have a better chance at success than such a group.

I like the idea of your alt ending far better, as it addresses the biggest theme/question of the setting. The where-are-we/is-it-all-real bit is the engine, but the cultural disparity is at the heart of the piece's discussion. The ending gives zero resolution or acknowledgement of that.
