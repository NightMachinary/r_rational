Great story.

The thing I found most confusing was the discovery of the records in the office. So many red flags there that would alarm me if I found them:

1. The crazy large 'attempt' count.
2. Coupled with (1), the duration of each experiment.
3. Why the hell would records be stored IN the experiment.
4. Assuming the records were placed there deliberately, you have to assume other groups found and removed them. Which means they were replaced by the overseers deliberately.

I assumed they were a diversion until the, uh, contents of the utilidor were discovered.

That raised even more questions. Why weren't the contents cleaned up? Oversight, deliberate, or falsified?

My assumption ended up being that this was a simulation. Loved the ending though, great point to quit.
