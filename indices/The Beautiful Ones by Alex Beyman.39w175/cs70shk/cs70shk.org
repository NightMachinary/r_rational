It seems to that, while it certainly wasn't what they were expecting, it's a lot better than it could have been. Unless they're dealing with some 4d geometry and they accidentally just mined into the other side of the same store, they've just doubled their supplies and space. Pretty valuable. Depending on whether or not its enough to attract honest work (and whether the rock is easier or harder to mine than concrete, and whether or not the PriceCos go on forever), they might be to hit a stride where they can expend less than all of the resources of one PriceCo to reach into another fully stocked one, and thus have a net positive.

An odd existence, but probably better than the doom that they were apparently guaranteed otherwise.
