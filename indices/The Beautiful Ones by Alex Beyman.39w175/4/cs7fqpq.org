This reads like some sort of combination sanity/stubbornness test. One of the characters actually mentions close-quarters psychological testing experiments early on.

This also feels in many ways like 'Under the Dome' by Stephen King.

The existence of the records is not an accident. The shadow-people can disappear, there's no need for them to keep records physically present where the humans can find them unless they are intended to be discovered.

The new store at the end of the tunnel is an interesting twist though, but in story terms what does it mean?

I see two completely opposite potentials here. Either something very good or very bad.

Good: Benevolent actors are controlling the experiment. Is this an alien race trying to preserve humanity at some far future date after we've gone extinct, based on archeological remains and randomly grabbing humans out of time?

Bad: They have tunneled back into the original store. The experiment is malevolent in some way. They are assessing humanity's weaknesses.

Sure, there are lots of other interpretations possible, but there definitely seems to be some sort of experimentation occurring, and the notes about past experiments are odd.

Then again, perhaps the notes were written by a very bored writer from a prior experiment...
