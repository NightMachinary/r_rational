I'd assume that to model five humans that they don't know they're AI needs five human-level AI and an environment simulator, the complexity of which may be roughly on the level of the AI themselves, but is unlikely to be much above. If the hardware you're running it on gives a reasonable amount of simulations per units of time, that is entirely reasonable.
