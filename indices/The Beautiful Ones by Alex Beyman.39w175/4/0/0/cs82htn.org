This does seem to fit the details of the story reasonably well, but I'm having difficulty imagining why one would subject AI to this sort of experiment.

I mean, an AI good enough to think it is human? Why not make AI that don't think they are human, and who are more rational? For that matter, why not create AI that think they are human, but give them a mostly homogeneous background?

I suppose the experimenters might be using AI as a way to study human mental processes, without harming real humans. But if they understand human mental processes well enough to duplicate them... My head hurts :P
