My personal assumption was that the participants were probably software of some kind. It's the only way I could readily resolve the apparent longevity of the experiments, the multiple attempts, and the apparent lack of care exhibited by the controllers. The controllers aren't particularly evil or good from their own perspective, they're just bored and trying to make a stable microsociety that lasts longer than a couple generations.

To me, the whole thing stinks of a science-fair project concerning minimal crew-sizes for generational starships. If I woke up inside this scenario, I would probably start to wonder if I was an off-the-shelf AI asset at some point.
