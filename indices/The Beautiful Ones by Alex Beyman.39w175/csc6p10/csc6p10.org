Fun story. The characters were certainly extreme, but not unbelievably so- these people certainly exist somewhere in America right now. All of them being on a train together would have been silly, but 'blatantly selected to be dumped together' is acceptable. All in all a great read.

My two biggest criticisms:

1. Andrew the Rationalist seems far less fractured and extreme than the rest; as Rationalist promotion it's great, but the character feels glaringly lacking in faults compared to his (mostly) extreme compatriots. Being a stickler for maps is not the same as Crazy Christian Redneck, Hyper-SJW, Otaku, etc. I'd like to see Andrew's faults being at least nearly as dangerous to group success as the rest.

2. There's no resolution to the big question of why these people were chosen. Not just any people, /these/ people. Why such extreme characters? If the goal is to get humans to establish a stable population, why start with such a giant handicap? What practical value or knowledge can that produce? Obvlously the handlers are at zero risk of discovery (what are the odds they'd be detectable by simple light tricks, dumb enough to walk into Andrew's trap, and just so happen to leave their past records in plain sight /In English/? The latter bit means that a. the files are completely untrustable, or 2. these are modern american/british controllers with hyper-advanced technology and a near infinite amount of time and resources. Very convenient.

But overall, loved the story. Definitely going to seek out more of the author's work, if possible!
