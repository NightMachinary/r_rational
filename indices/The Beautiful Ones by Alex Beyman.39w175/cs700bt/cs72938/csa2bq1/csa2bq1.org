Let's see, there's an absolutely unbearable weeaboo, a euphoric atheist, a hair-dyed SJW, a vegan veterinarian, a religious conservative libertarian no-gummint survivalist (although he doesn't agree to rationing, what kind of survivalist is he?!). And then there are two relatively normal people, a no-nonsense old dude and a spiffy if somewhat emotional entrepreneur chef.

If I had to guess, I would say these people were selected by their overall conformity to internet stereotypes. :P

Oh Jeffrey, Japanese doesn't have a plural form. You poor boy.

One thing I find strange and pretty typical to these sorts of scenarios are that things like Hell are serious hypotheses for their situation, and they're complaining about first-world problems like vegan meals, walking, and being thirsty WHEN THERE'S A FUCKING WATER FOUNTAIN RIGHT THERE, GODDAMMIT MELISSA.

Nice story!
