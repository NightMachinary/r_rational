See the bit about "minimal crew sizes for generational starships" and "science fair". I just assumed that the characters were all human-based or human-derived AI running on the equivalent of the Sims.

In fact, if this story were to become popular enough, I could see it being a favored scenario in a Dwarf Fortress or Sims-like game.
