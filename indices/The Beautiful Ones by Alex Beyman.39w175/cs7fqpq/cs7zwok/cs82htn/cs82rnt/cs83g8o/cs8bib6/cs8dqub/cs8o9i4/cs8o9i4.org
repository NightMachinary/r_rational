I don't quite see what makes AI different. More specifically, if your premise (that a system understood well enough to be suitably modelled on a computer is understood enough to make a simulation of it unnecessary) is false for simple systems (e.g. phase transitions of the Ising model in three dimensions, or in polydisperse hard spheres), my prior is on that premise being false for AI.

You could say "yes but that's not a small sample size". Fine, take 5 bodies in gravitational interaction.
