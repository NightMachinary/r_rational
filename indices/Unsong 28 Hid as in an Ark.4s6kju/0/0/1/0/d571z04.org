I guess my confusion comes with the cultural association. In our world, Sarah Michelle-Gellar is/was a geek icon, so it makes sense that a geek like Aaron would have her as his wallpaper, as opposed to some other pretty actress. In the Unsongverse ... it would seem slightly out of character for Aaron to pick an actress from, for example, a summer horror movie from the late-90s.

(Buffy was also a movie, but Sarah Michelle-Gellar wasn't the star. And I'm not sure that Buffy could/would exist in the same form given that a lot of it was about angels and demons.)
