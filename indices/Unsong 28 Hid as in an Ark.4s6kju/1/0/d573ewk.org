Huh, I took that as acted shame rather than actual shame; Sarah (if it is Sarah) said it because it increases the appeal for Gadiriel and is a way to ensure secrecy/compliance. Same reason that Sarah phrased it as favor/gifts rather than a transaction. I'm not sure whether I'm being paranoid or not, but it seemed canny rather than genuine (and fit in with Gadiriel's schtick).
