  So could they just tell Esplin about the assassination deadline? He doesn't want Earth destroyed either, and if he's in on it they could possibly fake an assassination successful enough to be convincing.

Keep in mind that Esplin knows the Earth won't actually be destroyed on time due to the Z-space barrier. It may not even be destroyed at all, since the destruction has to be targetted to a particular point in Earth's orbit. The Animorphs don't know Esplin knows, so they can't actually use that to make a decision, though.

However, Esplin would have good reason to let the people of Earth know just who it was that screwed up. Since he knows that /he/ didn't leak the information, he can work out who it really was. That'd be a pretty big propaganda victory for him.
