Tell the Chee and let them know that convincing the andalites that V3 is dead is the only way to save the planet (and thus all its dogs), just incase they have some ability to trick them and give us more time that doesn't run afoul their programming.

More ideally maybe they can help nonviolently capture him so that no trick is necessary, presuming the andalites are okay with a captured-in-stasis V3.

Getting to his ship or getting him down to earth seems the main hurdle. If humans can't jumpstart their tech fast enough or make use of the bug fighters on their own, the chee are basically our only hope to bring V3 out of the immunity of space.
