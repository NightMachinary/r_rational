In no particular order:

- Inform the USA military. They have slightly more experience dealing with threats of global annihilation through WMDs than the Animorphs do.

- Don't even consider Lirem's blackmail. There's no proof of Esplin's death they could present to him that he couldn't (reasonably) claim is fake. Besides, he decided to kill everyone on Earth in twenty seconds, and thought up his "Kill V3 and we'll talk" in the spur of the moment. His reasoning probably is "Let's see if we can't get some use of this asshole cadet (and the humans) before we blow up the planet. If it works we'll have both defeated the Visser and eliminated this new threat!"

- Try to contact Andalites again, this time with preparation. Either civilian channels, or other officers. Lirem might be an extremist, and other generals might not allow him to blow up a planet with 7 billion people on it without at least /some/ consideration. Try to convince them that the governments of Earth have the situation under control, and will not be easily consumed.

- Tell Telor about this threat. They might know how to protect a planet from spontaneously becoming a Z-space pi√±ata, or how to retaliate against the Andalites. (though this runs the same sort of risks as directly telling Visser 3)

- By the way, isolate Marco's dad from any tactical decisions until he makes his trip to Telor.

Also, not exactly related to the meteor threat, but use the Serenity Z-space detector and Ax's ship to map out the yeerks' supply lines, and coordinate with local police forces to capture / take out all of their bases at once (or only some of them, for added "you don't know how I got this intel" flavor).
