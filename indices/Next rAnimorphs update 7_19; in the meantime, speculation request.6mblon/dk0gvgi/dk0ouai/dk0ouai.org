The Chee might just be advanced enough to create the illusion of Earth blowing up, as seen from outside the planet, at least...

But this is definitely something that's worth asking Chee advice on, at the very least. They've either got useful suggestions to make, or they'll tell you straight-up that they don't; significant potential benefit, as against a few minutes' time (they have Eric's phone number, right?).

I don't think they can capture V3 directly. This might go against their non-violence programming.

The downside of that is that, once the threat has been neutralised, the Chee might have to take steps to prevent it happening again. But even then, the threat will have to be neutralised /first/.
