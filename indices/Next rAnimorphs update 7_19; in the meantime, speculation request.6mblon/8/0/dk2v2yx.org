  They should make a space-ark, or several space-arks.

Good idea, at least as a backup plan, but... how, in 21 days? Humans can't, we haven't had any evidence the Chee can, and I'm not even sure Telor can (and it definitely can't without betraying its rebellion.) The only vaguely-possible way is to hijack a Yeerk ship, and that'd be far too risky given that you're foreclosing a lot of other possible courses of action.
