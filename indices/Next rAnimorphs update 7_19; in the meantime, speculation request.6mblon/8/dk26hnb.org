Honestly? They should make a space-ark, or several space-arks. Get a collection of humans and human culture and history, and shoot it into outer space. Send several in various directions, and send one towards the Visser and ask him to protect it or infest it or something, and send one towards the Andalites, and get the Chee's help to send another one with some dogs aboard. Essentially, I think they need to plan to lose, but to lose in a way that minimizes the damage done to their values, or at least in a way that maximizes the amount of harm done to the Visser's values. I can imagine Marco thinking this way, at least.

I can also imagine Marco or Cassie choosing to morph into Elfangor and remain in morph past the time limit in order to bring the group needed reinforcements. Maybe even Jake, as he's already died once. Or Rachel, since she doesn't belong anyway? The possibility of resurrection via morph backups would be salient. The most important thing would be winning the war. Losing 22 days in an attempt at improving one's odds at living 1000 years seems like a potentially good bargain.

I'm assuming that if you morph into someone past the time limit, the new version of them doesn't get a copy of all their old morphs? If they don't, would the new version of them instead get a copy of all /your/ old morphs? This seems testable at the cost of only a couple hours of personal identity. If morphing Elfangor past the time limit would give them access to a large new library of morphs, it would definitely become worth it. Seems unlikely. Still worth trying.

Feeding misinformation to the enemy would potentially become possible if you were willing to overwrite the minds of toddlers or willing volunteers in order to gain clones who could be given incorrect information about Animorph plans before being allowed to fall into Yeerk custody.

I don't think there are any ways to win. I don't even think there are any good ways to minimize losses. But I'm sure that there are no good ways to do either that don't involve taboo tradeoffs. Sorry, Cassie.

Apologies if I've forgotten anything important in the story that contradicts what I've suggested here, it's been a long time since I've read through the earlier chapters.
