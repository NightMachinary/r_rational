Work out the spaceship paths with the Z-space scans, take a pilot, morph them or a lice on their head, get to the pool ships and blow them the fuck up. If they can headshot V3 the better, but right now there's no time, and no ways to win a battle, the enemy's gate is down.

/Afterwards/ salvage tech, conscript freed hosts, anything and everything to get humanity off world, save everyone you can and run.

And grab Ax's extraterrestrial combat morphs if he has any. I can't imagine a spacefaring race skipping on a morph that can survive in space for significant amounts of time.
