Just spit-balling here.

So could they just tell Esplin about the assassination deadline? He doesn't want Earth destroyed either, and if he's in on it they could possibly fake an assassination successful enough to be convincing. Of course then Esplin has to keep the secret but that might not be as challenging as I think it is? I would think that he would have to let the Council of Thirteen know he's just faking, but I'm not sure how good Visser One's information gathering is, or if she'd really tip off the Andalites and have them blow up Earth just to screw Esplin despite the cost to the Yeerks. Especially since if the Yeerks realize it's her it's treason +then+.

Alternatively, can they just do what they did in canon and [[#s][very late canon spoilers]]

...and re-reading the conversation between Lirem and Ax and Ax and Rachel I just caught that Lirem asked about whether Earth had shielding technology in relation to blowing up the planet, then lied about there not being a counter-measure to Rachel. And thinking about how Garrett did something similar is making me want to re-read the Jake chapter where he tries to stop everyone taking unilateral action without consulting anyone else because you think you know best...

Speculating for this story a bit hard, because with a story this complex I'm pretty sure I'm missing a few things. I keep having thoughts about things that happened earlier that I would need to find and re-read to properly address, and if I let myself go down that rabbit hole suddenly it'll be three in the morning.
