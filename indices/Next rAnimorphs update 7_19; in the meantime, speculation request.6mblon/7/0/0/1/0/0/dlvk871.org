"Skinner Box" is the popular name of the "operant conditioning chamber", which is a type of experiment developed by B. F. Skinner where you put a rat in a box with a button that delivers food under certain conditions.

"PREQUEL", or "Prequel Adventure", is a popular webcomic fanfic of TES:Oblivion, that has been in a hiatus for almost two years. Despite that, many people are still checking the front page regularly and commenting in the last comic's comment box.
