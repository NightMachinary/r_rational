Thank you again for criticizing the cliff-hanger! I was pondering how to fix the issue, and I realized I was missing the obvious: the last chapter of a manga always takes place 5 years later!

- [[https://notamanga.com/volume-2/5-years-later/]]
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23126/my-life-is-not-a-manga-or-maybe/chapter/569816/5-years-later]]

I kept things intentionally brief, and couldn't resist that last little bit (which maybe undermines the whole "not a cliff-hanger" thing...), but hopefully that will offer a bit of closure for the characters of Volume 1, at the very least.

I'm going to leave the resolution open for the Volume 2 characters; I might well write a spin-off featuring some of them at some point, because I really like that world and didn't explore it nearly enough.
