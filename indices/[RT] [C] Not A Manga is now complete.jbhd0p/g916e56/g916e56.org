There's something odd at the end of chapter 39 of part 2; several paragraphs just repeat for some reason.

Aside from that, I think my main disappointment with Part 2 is that things wrap up just a little smidge /too/ neatly. The entire point here is about trying to force real life back in on a narrative - the narrative doesn't want Xavier to go home, and real life should /not/ end that neatly, so it's kind of... it just doesn't seem to work, from a metanarrative viewpoint.

Some examples:

- The World Snake is powerful, that's fair enough. But at the same time, the World Snake never seems to have to face the narrative going /against/ it; there are never conflicting aims for it to have to worry about.
- Princess. As Xavier predicted, she's an example of the narrative trying to tie him down, to force him into the new world. But given that, why is it even possible for the World Snake to modify her so that she can survive without Xavier? I was honestly expecting some sort of terrible choice at the last minute, with a strong possibility that Princess would go back to the real world with Xavier (and in a world full of nulls, she should have no worries about losing control). As a bonus, it means that Xavier and Princess would be in a perfect place to act as minor side characters in someone else's manga later...
