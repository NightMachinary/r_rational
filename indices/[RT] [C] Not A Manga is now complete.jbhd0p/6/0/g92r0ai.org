Yeah, I agree and this is something that I'd like to address if I end up revising Volume 2. Fun fact! When I was planning out the main arcs, the plot from Volume 2 was supposed to cover two volumes (the first predominantly from Xavier's viewpoint, and the second almost entirely from Rachel's). However, near the midpoint of Volume 1, my motivation was flagging, the readership had basically plateaued, and I ended up deciding to compress Volume 2 and 3 into a single, longer-than-I'd-planned volume.

One of the big casualties of this is that Rachel didn't get to spend much time on screen figuring out how the heck nima works, so the ending (and Princess's final arc) turned into a little more /deus ex machina/ than I originally hoped (and you're right, the world snake didn't get /nearly/ enough time embodied, as a result).

This kind of happened to me at the end of volume 1, too, actually. Unfortunately, the core premise that my characters are actively working against me meant that as soon as they spotted a way to exit the narrative, they'd go after it as fast as possible, which /really/ screws with the narrative timing (and I as the author colluded with them in both volumes, because I needed them to end). For future revisions, one of my big goals is to try and take a step back and consider "the author" as a character in the story with their own ongoing motivations and narrative behind the scenes. I think things would work out a lot more interestingly if once the tropes start to fail, the author starts to become desperate and throws more and more ridiculous road blocks up until they finally have to give up and just end the darn thing.
