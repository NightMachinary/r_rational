Read a few chapters, it seems pretty fun. So far the protag seems clever/genre-savvy enough to make him a good rational actor, but occasionally thoughtless enough that tropey developments can slip by him regardless.

I had some slight dissonance reading from every Japanese term being explained to me even though I already know them (I'm a bit of a weeb myself) while instead having to google american things I'd never heard of before (like what a "mudroom" is - I first thought it was a eupherism for toilet). EDIT: Store names as well, especially since they've been changed. I know some, like "Barnes and Noble" -> "Barnes and Novel" and "Victorias Secret" -> "Elizabeths Secret", but I'm not familiar enough with US shops to decipher "Big 6". Not that it matters to the plot at all, but the whole thing is similar to being new to manga and not getting the japanese cultural references.

EDIT2: Finished the first volume and a bit into volume 2. The story seemed to be going somewhere interesting, but then then everything was quickly dropped in an anticlimax and the story just sort of ended with no feeling of having resolved the conflict. Volume 2 then completely drops just about everything from the previous volume, it might as well be a completely new story with a similar protagonist. Like a lot of webfiction unfortunately, interesting idea for a premise that sustains the beginning but seemingly no real plan for an actual story arc which makes for an unsatisfying end. I suppose everything could theoretically be tied together and neatly wrapped up by the end of volume 2, but it doesn't seem to be heading in that direction.
