I just read the first 30 chapters and I can see why people like it but the protagonist manages to be just as frustrating as the normal protagonist in these type of stories. I kept expecting him to take some advantage of his genre saviness rather than go against everyrhing for reasons as contrived as in the source genre. Nonetheless, that kind of thing clearly works for many.

I'd have much rather read about his dad, who acts and thinks closer to how I thought the protagonist would.
