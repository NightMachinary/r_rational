Heh, you're not alone! A lot of people were unhappy with the transition to Volume 2 (including myself, to some extent). A jarring switch was actually my plan before I wrote a single word of volume 1 (because I wanted the reader to feel the disconnect that the protagonist feels when they're suddenly cut off from everything familiar, which is normally glossed over in isekai), but turns out there's a good reason for other books to avoid that! It's not a comfortable or fun thing to experience, even vicariously.

The anticlimax of volume 1 is something that I struggled with. On the one hand, it's entirely appropriate because the protagonist is actively trying to escape his own story the whole time, so of course as soon as he finds a way it's going to collapse around my ears. On the other, I didn't quite accomplish what I was aiming for with all the heroines. Samantha and to a lesser extent Paula ended up about where I wanted them, but I totally botched Jill (her entire arc will be getting rewritten when I have a chance to revise), lost track of Ms. Carino, and I need to drop a few more hints for Rachel's behavior to make even marginal sense.

In any case, thank you for your criticism!
