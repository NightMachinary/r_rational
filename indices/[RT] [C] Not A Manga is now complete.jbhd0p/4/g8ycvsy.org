Wait, what? You ended it there?! With no denouement, not even a confirmation that Xavier and Rachel actually made it home?

I've been mostly enjoying this story until now, and would probably even have recommended it to people interested in manga tropes, but, if this is how it ends, I'm going to seriously reconsider that recommendation.

If this were a cliffhanger going into Volume 3, then sure, this would be fine, showing the frying pan they're leaving before resuming the next volume to show them the for they've ended up in (I still think, under those circumstances, that it would be improved by an epilogue wrapping up the viewpoints of some secondary characters, but I'd be willing to excuse its absence). But knowing that there's "No plans for a volume 3 at the moment" at all, I have to say that this ending has significantly soured my impression of the work as a whole. It would be like ending /Avengers: Endgame/ immediately after Tony snaps his fingers. Sure, that action /should/ resolve the main plot, but not actually seeing things resolve, and the aftermath, just leaves me feeling unsatisfied.
