If you could increase/decrease your mass, that could be munchkinned. Instant potential energy increase. Not to mention you could lift things to the top of skyscrapers all day for the energy input of a normal-sized meal.

If there was no lower limit, you could probably walk through most materials/barriers by shrinking to the point where any microscopic flaws were gaping chasms. Atomically pure crystal could be a problem, though, as by the time you got small enough to squeeze between the molecular lattice, it'd take you lifetimes to walk from one side of the crystal to another.

Would anything in your stomach also increase/decrease in size? (Consider shrinking to 1 inch tall after you'd eaten a big meal.) If you then barfed it up, would it stay that changed size now that it was external to your body? Could you, for instance, change one glass of water into a lake? Or shrink a microprocessor to a tenth of its former size? How about shrinking a mountain-sized automated factory to something you could hold in your hand?

Could you smuggle things by growing to 100 feet tall, swallowing the item, shrinking to near-microscopic size, and hiding away on a transport?

Could you shrink a thousand tons of nuclear waste into a thimblefull? Would it still put out as much radiation as the original mass?
