Putting satellites into geosynchronous orbit would become a lot easier, provided that your size increases but your mass remains constant. Still, it might not be easy, since it sounds like you'd like to restrain power output to, let's say, the amount of power generated by one ordinary working human. Still, for satellites less than 100 lb., it would be pretty handy.
