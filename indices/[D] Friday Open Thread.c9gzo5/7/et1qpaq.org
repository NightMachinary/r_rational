What sources do you get your news from?

I used to use NYTimes and the Washington Post, but they've both gotten more annoying about reading for free and they represent a very specific perspective. I read Arstechnica for technology related news and The Atlantic just because, but I don't feel like I get a comprehensive picture of what's going on with just these.
