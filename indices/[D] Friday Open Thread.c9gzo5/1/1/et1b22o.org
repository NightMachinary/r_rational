Have you tried making it an ally or make use of it? [[http://www.structuredprocrastination.com][Structured Procrastination]] is the only technique I use (now also a [[https://www.amazon.com/Art-Procrastination-Effective-Lollygagging-Postponing/dp/0761171673/][book]] that I +haven't+ read. Here are [[https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/c9zory/structured_procrastination/et5t62x/][my notes]]). I find this quote hilarious:

#+begin_quote
  The observant reader may feel at this point that structured procrastination requires a certain amount of self-deception, since *one is in effect constantly perpetrating a pyramid scheme on oneself*. (...) This is not a problem, because virtually all procrastinators have excellent self-deceptive skills also.

Have you heard of [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9514605-the-procrastination-equation][The Procrastination Equation]] by Piers Steel? I've read just Alex Vermeer's [[https://alexvermeer.com/how-we-use-the-procrastination-equation/][blog post]] about it. He also created this poster on [[https://alexvermeer.com/getmotivated/][how to get motivated]] based on the book.

The work of BJ Fogg is helpful for starting new habits: [[https://www.tinyhabits.com/join][tiny habits]], [[https://www.behaviormodel.org/][behavior model]], [[https://www.behaviorgrid.org/][behavior grid]], [[https://www.foggmethod.com/][Fogg method]]. Or watch his [[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bj+fogg][short talks]].

I heard good things about the [[https://solvingprocrastination.com/start-here/][solving procrastination]] site. Discussion [[https://old.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/c42txr/til_human_procrastination_is_considered_a_complex/][here]] and [[https://old.reddit.com/r/science/comments/bqagww/mindfulness_which_revolves_around_focusing_on_the/][here]].

EDIT: I've added [[https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/c9zory/structured_procrastination/et5t62x/][my notes]] from the structured procrastination book.
