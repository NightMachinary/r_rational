Tough to handle this stuff when you are away in france for 6 months. Yes, many people would benefit from therapeutic attention in some way or form. People get regular physiological checkups from trained professionals. Makes sense to extend that to psychological checkups.

No good advice for you on the partner issue unfortunately. Call friends and have them give your partner an intervention if they are so depressed?

EDIT: in the depth of the lesswrong archives theres a comment about someone attending an ivy league university. What struck the commenter about their fellow students was that they weren't smarter, or harder workers, but the overwhelming majority of them was just so incredibly well adjusted and free of these minor psychological hickups that impede everyone else.
