Ah yeah, for me my therapist was kind of the same -- although he was 5 dollars and a student practitioner, haha.

I'm still working on sorting out boundaries and such myself because this is the first relationship I've had in years. I may be moving in with them some time after they move in together. Depends on how things go with my visit coming up, I suppose!! Exciting things in my life, at least.
