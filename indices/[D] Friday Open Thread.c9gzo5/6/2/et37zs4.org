You could consider asking him to think of it like a checkin to someone outside of his immediate circle to keep him held accountable. It's how I treated the therapist when I went, which was basically for the same kind of motivational thing that I believe you're implying he has. (Though I mostly convinced my therapist to play Celeste :P)
