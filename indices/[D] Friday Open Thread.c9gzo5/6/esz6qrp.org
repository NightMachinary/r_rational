tl;dr: is therapy good for neurotypical people ?

--------------

What are people's opinions on seeing psychologists / therapists for /non-diagnosable/ (i.e. minor) psychological issues?

There's probably little disagreement here that if you have OCD, a phobia, or are a pedophile or something you will benefit from seeing a therapist; but what about if you just have trouble dating, or feel like you're not being productive at work, or just maybe your life could use some basic improvements?

I ask because - long story - I was given a relationship ultimatum to see a therapist for issues I didn't think merited therapy. And then my psychologist proceeded to spend two years making me not hate myself (which I didn't even realise I did), and also incidentally improved the relationship ultimatum type stuff.

Given that it literally took a relationship ultimatum to make me go, I'm shocked at how resistant I was to it, and furthermore I'm shocked by how little I can say in support of therapy in general. If you were to go back in time with the mission of making sure I went into therapy, and you had a whole day with me now to work out the strategy for how to convince past!Weasel to go to therapy, I'm not sure I'd be much help - nothing I've just written would convince past!Weasel, she'd just say "yeah but my life is fine I don't need therapy", or "I don't hate myself; I'm lazy at my job, so it's perfectly reasonable for me to think thoughts about how terrible I am for being lazy".

So I'm wondering: should everyone get therapy, in general? Maybe not the intensive weekly sessions I started getting shortly before my sabbatical (from a different therapist who specialises in my specific problem: still seeing my original therapist because she's better), or the ten subsidised sessions a year I get from my "main" therapist, but I feel like the average person would benefit from seeing a therapist once every 3-6 months just to check in, discuss any key problems they have, etc.

Obvious caveats: some therapists suck, and I think that's why I was so resistant at first. The first one I ever saw was provided through my employer's assistance programme, when I was living in a town of 30,000 (+edit: dropped a 0, it's 300,000+ edit2: wait no, actually, it was that small) people: at the time I was struggling with emotions that were coming from my childhood sexual trauma, and the therapist they sent me to was very accomplished but.... he specialised in eating disorders and stress from shift work. He kept on trying to bring it back to me having body image issues as a result of the abuse, which I don't. So.... you know. That wasn't.... the best introduction to therapy.

Related: my partner has very severe OCD that is well-managed on medication, and he used to see a therapist regularly, but now sees her once every 6 months. He's acting depressed a lot, and I'm trying to convince him to go back to his monthly/bimonthly schedule so she can help him with that, but he's being very resistant to that. IDK why. And I guess I think that if I benefitted so much /when he forced me to go/, why can't he face that he has benefited before, even if he's got no "real problems" left because medicine is magic (which it is and it isn't), he can still benefit just like I have. Weirdo.
