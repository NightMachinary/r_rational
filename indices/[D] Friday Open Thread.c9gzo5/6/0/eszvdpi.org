Ideally, literally everyone should see a therapist periodically. We should get mental health checkups like we get physical health checkups. However, the calculation isn't necessarily, "would it be better if I had a therapist," its, "is the cost in time and money of going to a therapist worth the benefit?" To which I would posit, usually no, at least for people who don't have an obvious issue or are unhappy with themselves. The exception would be people with a lot of disposable money, disposable time, or a healthcare system/job that allows them to go to a therapist with relatively little opportunity cost.
