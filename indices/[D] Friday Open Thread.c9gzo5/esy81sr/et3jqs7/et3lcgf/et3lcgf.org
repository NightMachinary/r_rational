  So I decided to go ahead and read /Classroom of the Elite/ Volume 1 and was disappointed.

What's worse is a lot of the reviews and fans especially like volume 3 (which is where the anime goes through) as it's supposedly where the MC's "Machiavellian nature" and true genius is revealed to the reader! So I forced myself to read to at least that point. Again, I'll recommend that you not do that ;)

  - The homeroom teacher and administration's motivations were confusing.

This was probably my biggest beef of all. I hope for fans' sake things are better explained at some point but up until where I read, the setting and staff actions made no sense.
