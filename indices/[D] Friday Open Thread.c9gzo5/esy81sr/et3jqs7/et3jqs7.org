So I decided to go ahead and read /Classroom of the Elite/ Volume 1 and was disappointed.

To those not in the know, the story is about a mysterious prestigious high school that provides it's students a stipend and guarantees opportunities for it's alumni, though neither of these turn out to be as easily provided as they seemed.

While reading I found that I was occasionally hit with the feeling that the characters felt a little bit too unreasonable or socially awkward, that the prose was trying a little too much to be intellectual, and that some of the implications of the setting seemed to be ignored. It was only later that I realised that I was being put off by how juvenile or rather, how similar to children/young teen novels it was.

There were some neat concepts and it managed to get a few chuckles out of me but I feel like there were too many major issues holding me back from being satisfied with it.

- The point system didn't feel really important.
- The homeroom teacher and administration's motivations were confusing.
- The MC is supposed to be absurdly capable but I didn't really buy it.
- The school didn't really feel that different, just a regular high school + point system.
- The fan service didn't feel tasteful.
