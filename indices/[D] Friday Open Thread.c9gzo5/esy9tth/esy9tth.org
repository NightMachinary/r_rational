I'm reposting my comment from [[/r/starslatecodex]]'s Friday Fun Thread, because our Friday Open Thread starts pretty late for me ;)

--------------

This week I strongly recommend the [[https://publicdomainreview.org][Public Domain Review]], an online magazine dedicated to showcasing works that fallen into the public domain.

It doesn't shy away from sharing the strange and beautiful. Doesn't matter whether it's this [[https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4787/39875300915_69417f90d1_b.jpg][Egg-man with a goat-dick]] (that'll haunt me in my dreams) from [[https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/the-drolatic-dreams-of-pantagruel-1565/][The Drolatic Dreams of Pantagruel (1565)]] or [[https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/the-bakemono-zukushi-monster-scroll-18th-19th-century/][The Bakemono Zukushi “Monster” Scroll]] by an unknown artist.

It's a great place to find images for your blog/story/site, "learn" [[https://farm1.staticflickr.com/978/40962666254_a8919a49c9_b.jpg][how to build a fox trap]] (by [[https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/utagawa-hiroshige-last-great-master-of-ukiyo-e/][Utagawa Hiroshige]]) or go back in time and browse [[https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/the-art-of-book-covers-1820-1914/][old book cover art]] (I hope [[https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7823/46348542094_20d30c5b48_o.jpg][Mr Sweet Potatoes]] is a children's books. See this beautiful cover of [[https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7926/47020121602_46511f733a_o.jpg][From the Earth to the Moon]] by Jules Verne).

Lastly, the amazing [[https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/photographs-of-models-of-the-moon-1874/][photographs of (models of) the moon from (1874)]] (made not by a professional astronomer but by "a leading entrepreneurial engineer of his day") must have been a trip to see back then.

If anyone can recommend a similar site, I'd be grateful.

EDIT: fixed a bad link.
