Can I just say that the /Classroom of the Elite/ LNs are probably one of the worst highly-recommended (not on this sub, thankfully) works I've read in quite a while. If you haven't given it a try yet, do yourself a favor and don't.

Also, I just started [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve][Delve]] which is amusing so far, but I'm not all the way caught up. Give it a shot if you're in the mood for some rugged litRPG.
