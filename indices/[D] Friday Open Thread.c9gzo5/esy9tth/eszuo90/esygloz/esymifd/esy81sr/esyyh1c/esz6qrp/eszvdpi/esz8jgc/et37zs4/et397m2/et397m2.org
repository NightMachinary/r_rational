I view my therapist as my optimal (as opposed to best) friend.

She:

- only cares about my wellbeing
- doesn't make me listen to her life
- won't put up with my shit
- talks about me and only me when we see each other (never tries to talk about herself)
- is trained in how to make me better at being a person
- will never tell anyone my private secrets
- doesn't give a shit if I am short with her or tell her her ideas are stupid
- she's available at my convenience (debatable: she's quite heavily booked but I book my appointments 6 months in advance so i always get the appointment right after work)

It's.... really the perfect friendship. And "all" it asks from me is ~$150 an hour (after my government rebate - yeahhhh she's pricy).

Like don't get me wrong, I do have a Best Friend, and we both help each other a LOT with the same sort of stuff therapists do. But there's stuff I won't even tell her that I told my therapist on one of our first sessions, and although I can say to my best friend, "i really want to talk about this, can we sit down and go through it", that's a harder favour to call in and it's reciprocal, so it's very neat to be able to see someone ~monthly for a full run down of my shit.

Yeah, I've been polyam since... 2011? So it's been a while for me - long enough to be boring. I've been with my husband since 2007 and my other partner since 2013, and have no other partners (though I've just started dating here in Paris so that may change - hmu any Parisiens who want to date me based on my vivid descriptions of what a basketcase I am).
