I haven't "beaten" my tendencies, but by dint of long effort over years, I feel that I've had notable improvement. No one step was a game changer, but I just kept picking myself up, shaking off the failures, and trying again. And as much as I can see vast ballrooms for improvement now, when I look at the me of 5 years ago, he seems like a distinctly inferior lifeform. Momentum builds.
