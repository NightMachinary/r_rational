The best thing that worked for me is [[http://www.beeminder.com][www.beeminder.com]] - you tell it your goals (they have to be quantifiable though) and then you report your progress. If you don't make progress, you pay them money (which is how the website makes money).

It's great, the team of admins is nothing short of excellent (very responsive to emails, I feel like they're friends). I have acheived SO MANY GOALS thanks to it - like I had a book on my bedside table for about two years without ever picking it up (my dopamine farm - aka my phone - was always somehow more appealling at bedtime). Once I put "pages read" as a beeminder metric, i finished that book - and a second book only it was /in french/ and had been sitting on my bedside table three years that I also created a goal for - within six weeks.

I've used it for everything from exercise to studying (it integrates with anki wonderfully, and has completely improved the way i use the service) to writing and probably a bunch of other things.

The thing that helped me be more productive at work was, funnily enough, going to see a therapist (see my long top level comment below) as well as signing up for [[http://www.complice.co][www.complice.co]] (which integrates with beeminder, but I haven't used it for that purpose).

Another technique I enjoy: promising myself I'll only do 3 or 5 minutes of the task and then will stop. It's a flavour of "focusing on starting" like you stated, but it works really well for me. It's weird how just telling yourself you'll stop, even though you know that you don't intend to stop, works so well.

My husband (who has ADHD) is always saying in awe how impressed he is because of how driven I am, how I set goals and acheive them, and how I don't seem to get distracted. I don't /feel/ this way at all. I feel like a hideous procrastinator. I feel disorganised and forgetful. I feel like I've just managed to put all those negative self qualities into a scaffold of discipline, finally, mercifully.
