I read the headlines from the Washington Post. I (begrudgingly) listen to NPR. I'll read David Roberts articles on Vox and cleantechnica for environmental news. I go to 538 for politics. I'll occasionally read Haaretz for Israeli news (from a liberal Israeli slant). Ezra Klein at Vox used to do thought-provoking pieces, but he aged out of being able to write the news effectively. For economics I'll read Brad DeLong, Paul Krugman (NYtimes), Noah Smith (Bloomberg), and others as warranted. Occasionally I'll take a glance as Ross Douthat to see what mental contortions he's up to. For tech news I read Ars Technica. For local news I read the local paper's website (which does a good job). For a very liberal perspective I read Digby's blog; she writes for salon now too so there's some cross-posting. For political science news I'll read Crooked Timber. My favorite commentator, who usually has a level head, is Kevin Drum at Mother Jones. He's usually has a pretty smart take, even if we sometimes disagree, and at least tries to make his points in numeric terms.

​

My news reading habits are both compulsive and kinda part of my job. I'm going to be honest though; there's no great source for all news and I'm unhappy with large parts of many of the places I go. The only sources I'm terribly happy with are 538, Kevin Drum, David Roberts, Crooked Timber, and Ars Technica. I would recommend that you go with the Guardian or BBC world for a comprehensive picture of World News, but that lacks an American perspective. Once we pay off student loans, I'll probably get a subscription to the Washington Post, because it remains the best overarching news source I've found. (Even if the opinion page is a little to prominent and not fact-checked.)

​

Many of the places I listed are riddled with flaws.

NPR is full of both-sides fallacy and incredibly self-indulgent;

Vox is incredibly trashy and obviously false at times (Matthew Yglesias isn't their biggest problem and that's a problem);

Krugman and Klein have visually disengaged from the news cycle, since keeping track of it is unhealthy;

Mother Jones is niche, sometimes experimental, and best read for its investigations.

Haaretz paywalls their most interesting articles.

NY Times seems to want to make news more than report news.

Johnathan Chait has started tilting at everyone to his left and has gotten embittered after he lost two high profile spats (Te henisi Coates and Cory Roberts of Crooked Timber), and the political failure of charters in the face of his uncritical defense.

Ross Douthat has gone from contrarian to deliberately eliding the truth so I've stopped reading him.

Digby's blog is rightfully hysterical, but I can only take so much of that and function. Undercover Blue does great NC coverage though.
