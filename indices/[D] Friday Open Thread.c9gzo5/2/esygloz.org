[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/99y6l2/d_friday_offtopic_thread/e4rch59/?context=3][Nearly a year ago]] I shared some of the photos I'd taken recently (also on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/99xgx4/friday_fun_thread_for_august_24th_2018/e4ra1lf/?context=3][r/ssc]]) and wanted to post a followup now. Still on the same camera / lens / software / etc (hoping for a major upgrade in a year or two). Let me know if you have any suggestions re: editing, composition, etc.! I tried to go for different things in different photos, with mixed success.

(also, apologies for any compression artifacts / resolution issues -- a lot of these are reuploads from FB)
