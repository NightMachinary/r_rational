Just got caught up with Delve. I'm enjoying it so far, and updates seem to be coming every few days. The protagonist has believable flaws, thoughts and motives and is likeable. No narcissism or Mary-Sue tendencies. The world is largely familiar fantasy / RPG tropes but the specific characters and environment avoid feeling unoriginal. The magic system seems pretty solid and is central to the story. I feel like it's definitely going somewhere but can't tell exactly where. The writing is doing a decent job of making the reader part of the journey of figuring out the new world and its rules.
