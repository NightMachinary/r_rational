Because our universe has a maximum speed of causality (speed of light) and a conservation law for mass-energy. "Munchkinism" is usually/often based on exploiting a piece of worldbuilding that allows for unbounded growth of something-or-other using nonconserved basic resources.

Almost any universe in which the basic /stuff/ of existence is nonconserved is going to be massively fucking Munchkinable. In fact, you'd expect our kind of conservation-expecting life to never even evolve, since evolution would find the Munchkinable Thing /first/, in a Cambrian Super-Explosion of life-forms capable of exploiting whatever allows them to generate /more stuff/ to sustain themselves out of literally nothing.
