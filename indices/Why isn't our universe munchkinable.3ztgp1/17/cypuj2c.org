Around a year ago I was thinking about how to conquer the Earth. There weren't any real good ways to go about it, supervillian-style or otherwise. Even getting your hands on a nuclear weapon won't make your faction a minor danger. Hell, even several hundred, you're only in a state of MAD with the other major powers.

It took about 3 hours for the phrase "Efficient Market Hypothesis" to reworm its way into my consciousness.

The only solution I could think of was a particularly dangerous X-Risk in my control (Grey Goo, Bioweapon) or somehow get an FAI in my control.

Neither is particular easy or wise.
