Rolling with your edit from "exploitable" to "breakable", I went to the same conclusion as Khafra: anthropics. If the universe was easily breakable, it probably would have been broken already.

Fiction tends to take that stable reality and add a new layer to it. These fictional universes haven't been rigorously vetted for instability. You take Earth, and add magic, but without billions of years of evidence that magic won't spontaneously explode everything.

Or maybe comparable planets out there explode all the time - cue Fermi paradox. I dunno.

I try to design stable magic systems when I'm worldbuilding, because I like my stories to be fantasy allegories of our society more than explorations of exploitation. But it's difficult to give someone even trivial powers without it immediately leading to the reformation of society as we know it.
