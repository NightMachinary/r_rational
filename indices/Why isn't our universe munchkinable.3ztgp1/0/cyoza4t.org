In addition to what's already been mentioned, the reason there /are/ all these very powerful exploits in fictional worlds that fanfic protagonists can munchkin is that often in fiction the author takes humans or something roughly human that can do things we can do in reality and adds abilities (magic, ninjutsu, futuretech, whatever) on top of that. Those abilities are going to be something extra that in many cases is going to be easy to munchkin because millions of people haven't already spent their entire lives trying to break them - only the author has spent a couple years of his or her life trying to plug the most obvious gaps, if even that.
