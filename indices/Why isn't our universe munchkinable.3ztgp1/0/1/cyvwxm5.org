That's a great way of framing it. It's almost like a new superpower (magic/ninjutsu/etc) was added to the world and the world hasn't yet found a new equilibrium. Eventually some rational entities with strong ambition will come along and carve up the world in their own image.

I tried to think of a real world example. The best one was "human-level intelligence". And sure enough, the humans went and "took over the world", bending it to suit their preferences. It's a single superpower we've munchkined into doing all /sorts/ of things.
