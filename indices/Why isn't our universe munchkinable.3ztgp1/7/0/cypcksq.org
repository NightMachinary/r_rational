This. I remember a story who made the e-press, about a boy in a poor village in Africa who built rudimentary generators from scrap technology for his village. Imagine the same kid, startling insight in electronics, incredible intellect, whatever, who tries to innovate as middle class in a developed country:

The majority of new technology is already out there, the bit not yet invented has inaccessible costs of production or distribution, and he will have to sell himself to a company to make his stuff. I.e. kid was the inventor of the computer, you try and build one at home.

What about ideas? Ideas have to spread to gain value, and nobody listen, truly listens to neighbour Larry when it comes to important stuff. Unless you go into politics, but then your hands are cuffed.

What about money? Well, you can't gain money without having an amount to start, and I would say that the average person in a developed country has /less than zero/ in their account.

tl;dr, you must start from a vantage point on your first flight.
