Ah, that's the answer I was looking for. Or at least it's an adequate one. Thank you wise sir/madam!

I suppose that a certain number of agents of roughly equivalent intelligence working on exploits eventually reaches an equilibrium when the fruit within their grasp is taken. Then it takes a collective effort as has been enabled by information spreading technologies(printing press, internet etc) and the improved methodologies to begin standing on one another's shoulders to reach the higher fruits we're grasping now.
