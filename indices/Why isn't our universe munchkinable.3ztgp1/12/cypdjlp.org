It is worth noting that fictional universes, when they diverge from our own, tend towards differences that are interesting and exploitable from the perspective of our own value system, further refined through our tastes and sense of ideas needed to be expressed. Where they are coherent enough to define, this forms a very, /very/ small subspace of possible realities.
