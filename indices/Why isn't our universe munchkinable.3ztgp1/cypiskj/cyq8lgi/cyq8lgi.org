It occasionally occurs to me that if someone /really/ wanted to spread science, naturalism, rationality, etc., they'd find a handsome 2-meter-tall male and a (somewhat shorter) voluptuous, silken-haired woman - both with pleasant voices - and train them as propagandists, especially by outfitting them with the various wearable signals of respect and authority.

It's amazing the shit people will eat up if someone tall, rich, and well-dressed says it with confidence.

But you definitely never heard anything this straightforwardly evil from me.
