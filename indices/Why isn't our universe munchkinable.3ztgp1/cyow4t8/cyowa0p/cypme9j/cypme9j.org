Well, we do, but it just becomes part of the background.

Take the example of the infinite money hack. Let's say that I figure out a way to make gold out of a cheap, common ore. Well, what happens? I become rich! Well, I become rich if I can keep the innovation to myself, which I probably can't. But in either case, the market then adjusts, gold becomes common, and things change. A hundred years later no one really thinks about it; that gold was a precious metal is a historical footnote.

This really happened, by the way, just not with gold. Instead, it was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_process][the Bayer process]] of turning bauxite into alumnia which is then turned into aluminum by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall%E2%80%93H%C3%A9roult_process][the Hall-HÃ©roult process]] (invented at nearly the same time). Fifty years before that, aluminum was more expensive than gold or platinum and one of the precious metals. Bars of aluminum were proudly displayed by royalty and Napoleon had a prized set of aluminum cutlery. The Washington Monument was given an aluminum cap!

Today, aluminum is used for cans of soda. We make airplanes and fishing boats out of it. Children use bats made of the stuff to play games. Aluminum trades at $0.70/lb while gold is something like $16000/lb. Yet this is now just the way of the world and few people remark on it.
