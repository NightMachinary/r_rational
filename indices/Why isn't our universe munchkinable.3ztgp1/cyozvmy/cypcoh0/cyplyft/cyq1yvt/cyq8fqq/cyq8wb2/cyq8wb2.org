That's definitely true as a thing-that-happens. Does it track the Flynn effect, though? I can definitely imagine city populations, as statistical aggregates, looking gradually more sane as e.g. individual mold-filled /buildings/ are torn down and replaced---but improving e.g. restaurant health codes (and enforcing them), or passing sanitation laws for businesses (and enforcing them), should result in big per-locale jumps, rather than distributed slow increases.

(Unless, like lead, it's the exposure to these things over time or at a certain age that causes the real problem; in which case each improved sanitation policy would show up as a longitudinal change in the first generation to never be exposed to the regulated vector. A constant stream of these policies could add up to a smooth curve as a child born in each further year is exposed to fewer and fewer vectors. But you'd think that we'd /notice/ anything that worked like that in the data, in the same way we noticed lead.)
