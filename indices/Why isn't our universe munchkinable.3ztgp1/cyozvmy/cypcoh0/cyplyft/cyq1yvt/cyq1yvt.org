It feels to me that abstract language engaged our brains enough to take us most of the way to being intelligent, but being "rational" or "sane" by modern standards is a product of writing---and especially of the printing press and its effects on the /accumulation/ of knowledge over time, and thereby the /expectation/ of knowledge.

Shamanism used to be a thing---a respected role in tribal society for people who "think differently" to play. People in biblical times seemed to still be not-all-there, frequently prone to hallucinations and manias that they thought of as apotheoses---God speaking through them---and other people just /accepted/ this idea, again treating these people with reverence. People would explain the world in terms of their subjective reality, and /seek/ subjective experiences that diverged greatly from the mundane---because this was how you found your spiritual self. In fact, "reality" was thought of as the illusion; the divergent subjective experience as the tearing-away of a veil.

It seems like this mode of thought went on in much the same way in nearly every culture (excluding, interestingly, each culture's equivalent to ascetic monks) until pretty much the Enlightenment. After that, people began expecting one-another to be increasingly well-read and school-taught; to be able to engage with the "fashions" of an intellectual culture that just rose and rose in prerequisite knowledge. And this forced an agreement that "objective reality" was now the good: it was what people could agree on enough to argue about, and it was those debates that informed thinking and culture more generally. The average person was expected---required---to be "sane" to participate. The touched were now rejects, rather than respected, because they couldn't engage with the ongoing intellectual discourse; and the public now saw clarity of perception of "truth" as the desirable state, with divergent subjective experience relegated to counterculture.

In short: humans seem to be getting less prone to psychosis with each generation. This might explain the Flynn effect. My hypothesis for a cause: books.
