What's the basic status for the real world? What was the "reality" of living thing ever for hundreds of millions of years?

Be born, scavenge, hunt, eat, sleep, fuck, maybe at some point realize you can use a rock to break a coconut.

Then some bozo had the bright idea to grow shit on the ground. It's not an inherited adaptation or a new propagating gene or anything so biological and natural. Just some good idea that somebody had in the right place and time for it to work. And then everything changed, for the earth and pretty much all of life. Even if mankind discovered the secret to immortality tomorrow it would still pale in comparison to the hack that was basic agriculture.
