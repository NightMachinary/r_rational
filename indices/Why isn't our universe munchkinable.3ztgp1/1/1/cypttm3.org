Not only that. The way you munchkin reality is basically "science", but /science itself is a technology/---just like "the checklist" and "the calendar" are technologies---and it has, itself, advanced over time.

The "scientific method" is easily described, but /science/ is not. /Science/ is constantly expanding: double-blind experiments, replicated studies, statistical analyses (itself a huge swath of technologies, including things like "excluding outliers" and "deriving significance" and "predictive power"), causal models, longitudinal studies, simulations, and even things as simple as /clean rooms/ and /writing down predictions in advance./

If a person from 3000BCE somehow put themselves into "the scientific mindset", they might be able to realize that "experiments can teach you things!"---but they wouldn't have any of these tools. They'd be like the Ancient Greeks, thinking they could [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/nf/the_parable_of_hemlock/][prove Socrates "into" being mortal]], or /think out/ whether the building blocks of matter are water or fire or quintessence. "Be empirical" isn't a helpful thought to think if you don't first think a bunch of other things, like "there is an objective reality" and "Cartesian dualism is false; /everything/ in my causal model exists within the world accessible to my senses", and "knowledge cannot be immoral", and "things that would be more surprising if true are more worth finding out", and so forth.

Now, if you could take /today's/ scientific process and bring it back to 3000BCE, it would be very easy to discover tons of things very quickly and turn them into a workable "bootstrap" for Becoming God (relative to 3000BCE people.) But people 5000 years ago would no more be able to implement the prerequisites for the "technology" of science than they would, say, the "technology" of modern sanitation. Their /thinking/ would be all wrong for it. You wouldn't be able to /explain/ it to them without basically requiring they live their lives over in the modern day. (Look at early alchemy for an example of some people trying to explain chemistry, and other people not understanding and receiving the words as cargo-cult mysticism: the /subjects/ get held as sacred, but the /process/ is mostly discarded as unimportant, or only performed with specific subjects for ritual significance rather than with /arbitrary/ subjects as a method of /learning things./)
