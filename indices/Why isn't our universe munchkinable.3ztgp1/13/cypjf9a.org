Obviously the first answer is we did. Westerners conquered and colonized most of the world with their superior technology. Oxygen using microorganisms killed most anaerobic ones. Numerous lifeforms have become dominant across the planet at one time or another.

The second answer is that the universe obeys logistic growth, not exponential growth. When some new trick is found and some group rapidly expands and spreads they eventually hit some new boundary like amount of food or land space and stop growing. Multiple realities or planets make world exploitation easier.

The third answer is the complexity and social context of technology. To make more advanced science and technology there's a complex chain web of requirements around it, which is required for new things to work.

The fourth answer is copying tech. Scientists leave nations, scientists get captured, any world breaking tech gets copied soon enough. You can get a temporary advantage, but it'll vanish after a couple years.

The fifth answer is that the world is really big. If you produce some toxic gas it'll just kill a few people around you, not everything. Good technology use requires a large group working together to do it and overcome barriers to it's use. No single scientist can make much of a change to the world.

The sixth answer is that the universe is old. Oxygen got around, most of the rocks around are fairly stable and we can't do much with them. Most of the radioactive particles are done with. Nothing big sciency is going to happen without a lot of work.
