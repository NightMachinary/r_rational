Ok, /now/ I'm just wondering if you're reading my mind.

#+begin_quote
  Public discourse falls irresistibly into the rhetoric of risk and safety, beyond my ability to stop even if I refuse to participate
#+end_quote

See, this is what disturbs me about people.

Also, it must kinda suck watching the whole public discourse go on and having to play at esotericism because the general public /just isn't going to get it/ if you explain what's actually going on.

  there never was any way out of this except solving the technical problem and grasping the sunlight.
#+end_quote

Totally with you there, partially because it's true, and partially because YAY, HIGHLY COMPLEX TECHNICAL PROBLEMS TO SOLVE WITH MASSIVE PAYOFF FOR DOING SO!

Though, by the way, I was wondering if "grasping the sunlight" is a phrase, so I googled it, and it comes up with /one/ techno-remix song on YouTube, and /one/ pornographic anime fanfiction, and nothing else relevant.

So, uh, nice to see what you're enjoying these days ;-)!

(Actual point being made by the phrase is quite understood... I think.)
