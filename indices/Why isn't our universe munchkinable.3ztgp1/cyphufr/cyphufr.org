To your second edit - the most important characteristic of a reality or story that would contribute to the ease of world breaking exploitation is the intelligence/power gap between the protagonist and the other characters, as well as his ability to influence others. A powerful new discovery, whether in itself world breaking or not, obviously amplifies the effect of the former elements.

For example, if someone that was incredibly more intelligent that most of the people in the world (multiple times smarter than the smartest person) was alive now, they would be able to discover all sorts of things on the cutting edge of science and technology that would be world changing. However, if he a lived in a world where no one would listen to him, he still could not easily break the world (I.E. if he was transported to medieval Europe where new knowledge was treated as heretical at times). If a person of average intelligence and knowledge from today's world was brought to a world full of pliable idiots, he could break that world without too much trouble. See Idiocracy as an example (though they are perhaps not as pliable as would be useful, but still, one man of average intelligence solves one of the world's greatest problems and potentially saves millions of lives).
