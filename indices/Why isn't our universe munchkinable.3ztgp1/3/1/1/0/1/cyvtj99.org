  if any, qualities of our reality have made world breaking take so long?
#+end_quote

It hasn't.

- The universe is 16 billion years old.\\
- The Earth is 4 billion.\\
- Sapient life has existed for, what? 500,000 tops?\\
- 1000 years ago everyone was a peasant farmer and we thought the sun was a magic lamp.\\
- 300 years ago we started inventing really significant machines.\\
- 50 years ago we put a guy on the moon.\\
- 30 years ago we invented a world-wide repository of all human knowledge.\\
- 10 years ago we invented always-available access to all human knowledge (smartphone), and also the ability to always know where you are in relation to anything (GPS).
- 5 years ago we invented a 3D bioprinter

Humanity hasn't been around that long, we've been breaking the world since we got here, and the rate of worldbreaks is speeding up.
