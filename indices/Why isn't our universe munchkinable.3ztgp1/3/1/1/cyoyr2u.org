Let's say you build endlessly self-replicating nanobots (that also happen to ignore entropy, for reasons), that will take over the world. If you just let them go, you can be pretty confident that you've caused the apocalypse, but that doesn't mean everyone's dead in the first thirty seconds.

We've found and are exploiting the munchkinable technology, but it's taking a little while to thoroughly overthrow everything.
