Two years ago, I went to Australia (I live in San Francisco); while I was there I paid my PG&E bill using the app on my phone.

That sounded banal, didn't it? Let's run that down.

1. I use electricity (tame lightning) for light and heat in my home...
2. ...and that electricity is generated hundreds/thousands of miles from my home...
3. ...and I paid for it without talking to a human being...
4. ...while standing in line for coffee...
5. ...using a computer I literally keep in my pocket...
6. ...that connects to an always-available repository of all human knowledge...
7. ...and, oh yes, at the time I was *on the other side of the world*.

And yet, you probably didn't blink when you read that first sentence, did you? When I posted this on my blog as a 'wow, this is amazing', I literally had someone leave a comment saying "uh...yeah? Welcome to the 1980s? 1950s if you allow wire transfers." This simple act was the result of an incredible amount of munchkinry, yet it was so banal that someone reading my blog literally couldn't understand why I thought it was amazing.
