Your comment begins by saying we have already broken reality but only really argues that we are on our way to doing it and even that conclusion isn't really justified without a debate about the assumed inevitably of the singularity. One could argue for a looser definition of broken reality that includes the present but then we're just arguing semantics and ignoring the clear intention of the question.
