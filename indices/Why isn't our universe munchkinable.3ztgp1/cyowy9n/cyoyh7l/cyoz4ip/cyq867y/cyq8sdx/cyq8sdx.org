Sorry, I am painting in broad strokes here. I am referring to already existing stuff stuff like Insulin (GMO produced since 1978), citric acid. Stuff in the pipeline, hundreds of projects to get gasoline equivalents from biomass, pigs that have immune respone-tailored organs for donations, experimental gene-therapy in humans. And the long term outlook of still exponentially falling genome sequencing prices and the (in)famous CrisprCas9 technique, which is revolutionizing the biotech research.

All in all very good signs for a longterm stable economic growth in that sector. Main problem for adaption are consumer objections, signaling objections to "improved" organisms, and regulatory objections. All of these have so far not prevented a slow creep into real world adaption.
