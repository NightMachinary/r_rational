We already have broken reality. Just think about computers-- we develop one technology tree, and suddenly we're advancing so incredibly fast our world is basically unrecognizable from a few hundred years ago. Once we're done with the transition phase and finally develop FAI, reality pretty much will already have been munchkined.

Well, that's assuming we don't kill ourselves first; the central conceit of munchkinry is that people generally munchin for relatively moral reasons.
