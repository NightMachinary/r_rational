Theory: Munchkinism appeals to geeks because we're used to the experience of being the smartest people in the room, but being curiously unable to translate that into lasting advantages. (Exception: specific job markets.) We're on the tail of an intelligence sigmoid, but we want to be at the start. Secondary factor: most fiction is not about this; hence opportunities are commonly left on the table. Hence: fiction where intelligence (and/or our native interests, compare /Wizard's Bane/) gives us access to previously inaccessible opportunities.
