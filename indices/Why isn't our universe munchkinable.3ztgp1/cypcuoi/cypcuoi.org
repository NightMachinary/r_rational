Part of it is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias][optimism bias]], so fiction writers (and everyone else) have a tendency to overestimate how easy it is for the protagonists to do things. On top of that, there's also the issue of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_license][artistic license]] for the purpose of dramatic storytelling.
