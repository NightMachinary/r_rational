I think the answer is that it is munchkinable (in ways that compare to fantasy, not "Donald Trump exploits human gullibility" ways), but only by sufficiently intelligent entities. Humans are intelligent enough to eventually bootstrap to that point through science and engineering over many generations, and individually intelligent enough to contribute to science and engineering, but are not intelligent enough to consolidate the necessary understanding of rules. At least not within their naturally allotted lifespans.

That said, I'm expecting a major exploit to occur soon, when someone figures out how to turn asteroids into useful machinery, and actually sends the equipment up there to do it. This will naturally result in an explosion of industrial activity around the sun with a much sharper exponential curve than we are used to measuring as economic growth, because the energy availability is higher (a function of how much sun-exposed area you can spread solar collectors over), and the cost to form viable structures is lower in the absence of gravity (so the amount of materials that need to be moved to tap more energy is lower).

There's also the prospect of bootstrapping AI. It's just that our intuitions about how to program intelligence into computers have tended to fail for quite a long time, indicating that our brains are poorly adapted to this task. (We'll probably brute force it sooner or later, but I'm more sanguine about replicating space robots because it's easier to brute force something with a lot of resources than a little.)
