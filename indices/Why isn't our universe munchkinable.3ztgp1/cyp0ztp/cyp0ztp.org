Fictional universes deal in concepts. You can get infinite HP, or infinite gold etc. Real life doesn't. We figured out a trick to release vast amounts of energy from a small amount of uranium. Useful if you want to blow up a city. Not great for much else. You /can/ use it for power, but it's complicated and not the fun munchkiny stuff. You can also use it for rocket fuel, but that's still fairly complicated.

I can think of all sorts of munchkiny things you can do in real life. Unfortunately, they all involve steps that are physically possible, rather than things you can just do. Munchkinry tends to involve a lot of complicated things, which in real life means that you have to research advanced technology for each step.
