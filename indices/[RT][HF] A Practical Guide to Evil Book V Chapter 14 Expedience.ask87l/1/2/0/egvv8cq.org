It would be awesome to get an Epilogue Book. Like Book 7 could just be ten chapters exploring the future of Calernia after Catherine Foundling has passed. How society was changed and all the other consequences of Catherine's path to a more sane Calernia.

That would be neato and prime fodder for us fans to start writing fanfic sequels.
