Originally only 5 books were planned, but we know now there is at least one more after this. It may have changed to two more but I have not seen a direct quote from EE on that so I don't know what the plan is. Regardless, there is a planned end.\\
Book 1 has 30 chapters including prologue, interludes, and epilogue\\
Book 2 has 61\\
Book 3 has 97\\
Book 4 has 107

So guesstimating and assuming the trend line stay the same I expect book 5 to have ~100 more chapters and then a ~130 - 150 chapter book 6 unless it gets broken up into books 6 and 7.
