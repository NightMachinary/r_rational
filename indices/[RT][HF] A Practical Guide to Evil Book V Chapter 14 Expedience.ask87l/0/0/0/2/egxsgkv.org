Oh gods this would be fantastic. Instead of an Arthurian legend - where the missing king shows back up in the time of greatest need - it's a Callowan legend, where the limping, snarky mistress of violent chaos shows up if you fuck up too much to spit spite in your eye. And then stab you. How could anything be more Callowan?
