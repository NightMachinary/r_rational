different kind of mortality, villains don't age it's a perk that comes with the job, they are however just as mortal as everyone else otherwise, so when she was back to being mortal she was no longer a abstract concept given form but have a actual real body of flesh to call her own.

but i don't think she currently have a name so i don't think she have the agelessness unless the night boon her with it, something it clearly can do if you look at the drow.
