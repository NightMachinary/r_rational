I think you have a weird and not entirely correct picture of this sub. There's some confusion about this, but this sub has not been meant to be dedicated solely to rationalist fiction since the earlier mod [[/u/seraphnb]] made this post 2 months ago:

  There are only so many rational fics in the world. For this reason, this sub is also for hard science fiction, hard fantasy, and deconstructionist fiction (see the sidebar).

That's why we have those tags. The meaning of "rationalist" is not getting diluted because currently most things posted here are not under the [R] rationalist tag.
