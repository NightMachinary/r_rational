Optimized probably was a poor word-choice. But what if I wrote a story where the world or at least the protagonist's community already consisted largely of Rationalists. Something like the Beisutsukai series by Yudkowsky, or a story about the Cooperative Conspiracy.

(I think you know what I'm getting at, even if I don't explain it very good.)

Surely such story would qualify as rationalist fiction (as long as it's teaching you something, at least).
