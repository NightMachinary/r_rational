I agree with you up until this:

  embracing being the lone outcast

I'd say it's the exact opposite. You make it sound like they double down on being the lone voice of reason: some of the best parts of rationalist fic to me is when the protagonist attempts to spread rationality, or suffers consequences from attempting to do everything alone.

I'm writing my rationalist fic for myself, because exploring the pokemon world rationally brings me lots of fulfillment and pleasure, but I also do it for others, because discussing the themes is enjoyable and spreading science and rationality are some of my values.

No matter how brilliant, I wouldn't respect someone who decided to stay a "lone outcast" nearly as much as one who attempts to teach (and continues to learn from) others.
