Problem being this way of thinking is shared by extremists of every stripe. "Women are mad and the world is mad, I should start up The Red Pill!" "Cis people are all deluded scum and I'm the only one who can see the Matrix!" "The world is mad and we few Scientologists must save them from themselves!"

So while it works in various narratives, you probably do not want "People Are Crazy And The World is Mad" to be what you're known for.
