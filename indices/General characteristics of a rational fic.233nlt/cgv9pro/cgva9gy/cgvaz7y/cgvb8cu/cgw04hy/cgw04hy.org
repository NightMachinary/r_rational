I'm not qualified to do meaningful research, and I'm not in school to learn how (for reasons. Maybe bad reasons actually. Nevertheless...). I do give some money regularly to people who are doing the research. But I'm worried that really defeating death may take a Moon-Shot level of societal coordination & resources, and there is no social will to do that right now. But I think you and I may define "helping someone" differently. :) If you mean something like "help provide people with housing", well, that's my day job (sorta).
