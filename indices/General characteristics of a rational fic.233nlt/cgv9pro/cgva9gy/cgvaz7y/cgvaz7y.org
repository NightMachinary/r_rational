From extensive speaking with "the normals" (oh god, there's no way this line won't come back to bite me in the ass out-of-context later), it doesn't matter that this /shouldn't/ be counter-culture and that it /isn't/ visionary. In theory, yeah, it's [[http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/simplified/][just simplified humanism]]. But in practice it (sadly) is counter-culture, and only someone willing to be considered as such will spread these memes.
