Characters in HPMOR who've been, or who've considered themselves, the Only Sane Person in Hogwarts and/or Magical Britain (so far):

- Harry
- Hermione
- Susan
- Daphne
- Professor McGonagall
- Professor Quirrell
- Mad-Eye Moody
- Amelia Bones
- The entire Chaos Legion

It's a pretty good bet that Draco is thinking this in Ch. 74. And that this is how Lucius Malfoy sees himself. And that Professor Sprout would consider herself to have a pretty good claim to the title. And so would Filius Flitwick. And then Dumbledore is just plain complicated.

A good rule of thumb is that any agenty character is, from some perspective, at some point in the story, the Only Sane one.
