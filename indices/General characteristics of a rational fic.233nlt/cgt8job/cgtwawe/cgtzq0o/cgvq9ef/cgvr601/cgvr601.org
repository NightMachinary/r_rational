The sub's content will inevitably be whatever appeals to the people who make up the sub. The name, however, is simply misleading, although of course it is that very name which appeals to the people who make up the sub.

I think the sub should want to send me lots of money and women. If you're going to restrict me to a more narrow range, I'm perfectly happy with the sub the way it is. That the meaning of "rationalist" should become diluted as the movement grows is predictable (and something I predicted). Since I'm not part of said movement, I'm not particularly bothered by it, and so I'm happy to have a sub dedicated to funny, charming fanfiction about smart ponies.
