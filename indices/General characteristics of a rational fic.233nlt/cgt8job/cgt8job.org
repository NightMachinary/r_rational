Most of the stories posted to this subreddit don't seem particularly /rational/, which is probably the wrong word anyway. They may (may) be smart, have interesting ideas, and make you think, but I'm not how they qualify as /rational/ fiction.

As I've said before, four of the five bullet points on the sidebar lists staples of good fiction in general. It's the four "bonus" bullet points plus the bullet point about the story being like a puzzle that make more sense as a definition of "rational" fiction. But how many stories posted to here have been like a puzzle? For that matter, how many people really think HPMOR is solvable in a manner analogous to a jigsaw puzzle?
