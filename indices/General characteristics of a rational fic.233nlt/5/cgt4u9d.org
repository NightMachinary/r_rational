It's always important to remember the difference between /plot/ and /story/. Too often rational fiction is concerned about the plot only, and the narrative as a whole suffers as a result. The story is the emotional undercurrent of the work, and is ultimately the most memorable component.

I hadn't realized it, but now that you've said it that way it makes a lot of sense. Rational fictions /must/ take their premises as far as possible, and to do that they will likely evolve into a Man Versus World plot, with whatever character serving as the antagonist is foremost the ultimate agent of said world.
