Chimpanzees are about [[https://www.livescience.com/59615-are-chimpanzees-stronger-than-humans.html][1.35 times stronger]] than a human of equal muscle weight.

Meanwhile, male silverback gorillas appear to range between [[https://www.animalwised.com/how-strong-are-gorillas-43.html][4 to 9 times the strength of a human]].

The strength/endurance trade-off, mentioned above, seems to be a direct effect of the differences in the structure and protein composition of the two different types of muscle fiber. That might be a limitation you want to consider.
