I'm currently plotting out a story where the protagonist has the power to passively take on some of the qualities of the organisms he consumes. This is subject to the square cube law and other such realisms, so eating a bunch of ants will not make him tens of times stronger.

The power will generally make the character into a sort of optimum combination of the things he's eaten, but he'll never become very inhuman. At most, he'll be a sort of beastman that looks mostly human but with a few animal traits.

Example: Eating snails for extensible eye stalks, eating cats to gain claws, lyrebirds for vocal mimicry, etc.

What are some interesting traits for him to gain from his food?

Bonus round: What are some interesting supernatural/alien organisms from other settings for him to consume?
