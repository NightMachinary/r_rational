I have a shared universe type setting in which there have been at least three events that have generated exotic matter that found its way into one or more stories. Given very generous filters on the development of intelligence, and using the worlds I threw in before doing any actual research for comparison, I've estimated that Milkyway-like galaxies would tend, on average, to host somewhere between 10 and 100 civilization-bearing worlds during the interval where these supplies of handwavium would be most readily accessible.

But then I run into the Fermi Paradox again. At least two varieties of this stuff enables FTL. However, FTL has been developed only 3 times, each with major consequences. I kinda want the galaxies in question to be "far" apart, but not so far apart that it would imply that FTL between them on a sane timescale would make it practical to circumnavigate the observable universe for vacation. So I'm currently looking at the 10-100million lightyear range (which would put them in the same supercluster but whatever). If there are 3 such events within a sphere with a radius of just a few dozen megalightyears, then we'd expect it to have happened enough that there should be other civs with intergalactic-practical FTL. Where are they?

I have two possible solutions, and both seem dubious. First is that there might be some sort of cosmic Goldylox Zone for such events. This seems weak, because were it a thing, I'd probably have some example phenomena to point to for this filter, and I got nothin' that fits reality.

The other option relies on a mechanic in this Universe's physics. FTL is allowed, but it causes, for lack of a better term, stress to spacetime. Whenever a new method of FTL is accomplished, it causes the Universe to split into two. The precise nature of these events varies, but at least one case involved parts of the Universe becoming inaccessible to each other in one of the child Universes, but not in the other. For the most part, the child Universes are close to identical to their parent Universe, excepting changes like that one. Most of the fantastic crap that happens that isn't due to handwavium is due to side-effects of these splits (or a combination of the two). So it's possible that many such splits have happened in the past, and the cumulative effect is that the Universe where the stories take place is the one where all the others were taken out of play by one or more split. But that suggests that none of these FTL methods are similar enough that one split can handle multiple inventions of the same tech, and that seems implausible.

The Goldylox filter works if it can be brought down to 100ish exotic matter events. At least 90% of those would go unnoticed, and half of those that are noticed would be used by civs without the science for FTL, and if we say that the most powerful FTL is rarer still---I came up with 17% somehow---then 100 events resolves the paradox. 1000 gives me 17 intergalactic civilizations to deal with, and after that there isn't any filter other than splits that can resolve the Paradox.

If there is some believable way, in a Universe that looks as close to ours as the above changes allow, to believably bring the number of exotic matter events down to low enough numbers that we don't need a filter to explain the lack of intergalactic aliens all over the place, I'd very much like to hear it. If the nature of the exotic matter events is important, all I have set in stone is that two of these involved the destruction of ancient civilizations, in such a way as to destroy their planets. My original idea was some super freaky supernovae, but the more I think about it, the dumber that sounds. All that really matters is that it's late enough for civilization to exist, early enough that they could plausibly predate life on Earth, and that they can destroy planets to some degree.
