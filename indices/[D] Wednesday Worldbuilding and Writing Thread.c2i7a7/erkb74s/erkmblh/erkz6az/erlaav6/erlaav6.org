The most initially useful abilities are information gathering, and apparently the fastest skill growth comes with combat, so it seems like you should start with seeing if this world has any sort of bards or combat librarians and try to apprentice under them. Hopefully that leads to knowing more about what's possible in this fictional world.

Given that knowledge, try to learn the most powerful skill (like politician or dark wizard) and see if your experience mechanic lets you reach a sufficiently formidable level of that to just win. This is fiction so presumably it's not that exploitable, but you need to your due diligence.

Once you've confirmed that you indeed have diminishing returns on learning anything, choose combinations of skills that are unlikely to have been combined before and see what you get. You're more likely to uncover some outsized opportunity at the intersection of druidism and necromancy than you are at the intersection of swordsmanship and shieldsmanship - even though the latter pair is probably more synergistic, you'd expect someone to have noticed and the results to be a regular part of the world, so you can't get a comparative advantage out of it.
