The first thing to do would obviously be to hammer out as much details of the gamer framework as possible. Like in paragamer, the “max skill slots” mentioned will require a significantly different strategy than one without that feature, which I assume this would be.

Second is figuring out whether your Gamer-ness is internal only, or being imposed on the world. Are dungeons appearing, and do they interact with things other than yourself? If so, those are a natural priority for combat experience.

From there, the best thing that can probably be done is amass as many skills as you quickly can, since stacking passive skills freely is OP and making it so you can potentially train multiple skills at once. If “skill books” exist, determine if they can be used digitally. If so, start torrenting every ebook collection you can find. If not, go to the nearest book store and get all the ones you can identify, leveling your thief skills if the consumption is discreet and buying them if not.

Any further specific strategies are dependent on the details of the Game. Anything that increases earned HP? Probably go for that. Is there magic? Probably the best bet to invest in, but possibly not if “gamer's body” isn't a thing. Whether to go specialist or multi-spec stats depends on whether the benchmark benefits show diminishing or multiplicative returns. Search for any synergies, obviously, like if the Parkour skill gives a speed boost, then doing the occasional flip could let you run faster than not.
