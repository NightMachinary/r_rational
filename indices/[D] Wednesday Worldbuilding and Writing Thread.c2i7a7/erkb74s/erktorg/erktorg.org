One interesting thing would be creatures that alter his mind in some way. While humans have a variety of things that set them apart from other animals mentally (eg. language), there are other things that we are not so good at. One example would be processing multiple inputs - an octopus has a lot of its neural matter stored in it's limbs, and of course has to control eight of them. Another example would be processing other senses that might be picked up, like echolocation, which would need a specialised brain structure to be used more effectively. Other animals presumably have other things that they may be able to exceed humans at mentally (memory, maybe?) but google didn't help much with that.

One other thing to maybe consider is whether a sufficiently complex artificial circuit could be considered a very narrow organism. It may be kind of interesting and/or humorous to have the protagonist blend up a phone to eat, and then become slightly better at mathematics, or alternatively be somewhat disappointed.

Another thing to consider is to what level things become conceptually more like what he eats, and at what level his traits become literally like what he eats. Both bones and exoskeletons can be useful in certain circumstances, but will both become more developed, or will one start to outweigh the other? Will eating an animal with eyes more suited for night vision and nocturnal activity make colour vision and diurnal activity harder? Lot's of questions - and the issue of slowly becoming less intelligent if humans aren't eaten, because if I became more and more like a crocodile every day in order to get that sweet, sweet, murder rolling tactic, I wouldn't want to gain the brain of a crocodile in the process.

Will habits get imprinted? There is a useful element in the form of easy muscle memory for things like flight, climbing, and fang extension, but also the issue of getting very interested in an animals natural prey, or alternatively trying to get friendly with the same species.

That's all I can think of at the moment, though it is a very interesting concept.
