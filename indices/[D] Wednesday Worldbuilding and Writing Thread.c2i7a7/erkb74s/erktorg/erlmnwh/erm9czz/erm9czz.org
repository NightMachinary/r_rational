Wow, you raise a lot of good points. The way I'm thinking of doing it is relatively tame, in that the character generally (but not exclusively) gains positive traits, and there's a pretty low cap on how inhuman he can get - something like a beastman at most. I think it would be nice to have a chapter or arc exploring more radical changes, though. And I love the phone idea!

In regards to exoskeleton vs bones and things like that, I'm tending towards having the power take a "best of both worlds" approach. In regards to habits and neural changes, there will be some shift towards the more animalistic in some ways, but for the most part nothing too extreme. Finding raw meat appetising, lowered inhibitions towards violence, etc, but I still want to keep it in the realm of "animal qualities made use of by a human mind".

If you happen to feel like adding more, be my guest! Regardless, thanks for the great comment :)
