How about an elephant's resistance to cancer? Humans have 1 copy of the P53 gene, which prevents cells from becoming tumors. Elephants have 20 of them.

A cat's vastly more efficient kidney, which allows them to drink salt water and be fine.

Ability to see into a wider color spectrum and hear lower and higher frequencies? Many animals have those, some have both.

There's a lot of variance between people, even. Would you be able to eat another human and get their superior characteristics? Like faster twitch muscles, lactic acid resistance, greater intelligence?
