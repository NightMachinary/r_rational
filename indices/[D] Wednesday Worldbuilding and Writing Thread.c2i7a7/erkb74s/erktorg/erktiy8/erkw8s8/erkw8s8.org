I second echolocation mentioned above; certain humans are already capable of a mild form of it, and at the level of dolphins and bats, it effectively neutralizes most (natural) forms of stealth.

I'd also suggest navigational abilities - some migratory organisms are able to orient themselves based on Earth's magnetic field, and salmon are able to instinctively return to their birthplace for spawning.

Also, there's an octopus species (can't recall the name right now) that can not only alter its skin colour but also its skin texture, for amazing camouflage. It can easily deceive anything that relies primarily on sight for hunting (i.e., most primates).

A great source for more ideas would be the Tier Zoo channel on YouTube - virtually all the videos are about hightlighting the various traits and abilities of various animals, but in the context of presenting them as playable characters in an MMORPG.
