Octopus/cephalopod is definitely on the menu. The brain could become distributed somewhat throughout the nervous system, and camouflage skin is a go. I'm likely to limit it to around that level, though, since bones are so useful and aren't really compatible with tentacles. Still, even having just your skin be camouflaged is pretty great.

Photosynthesis is definitely going to happen, and there are some bacteria that feed directly on electricity that will be making an appearance as well. What do you think of eating trees and incorporating wood into the body? Wood is tough, right?

How would the spicy bioweapons be deployed, though? Spit?
