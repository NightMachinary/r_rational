have some sushi! octopus tentacles are on the menu. their skin has the ability to change color and shape, and their tentacles are extra brain matter. +intelligence +stealth. same for squid, which may let you double down, and their eyesight is quite good as well... downside, now you can poop ink when surprised.

you could have this be an early powerup, because of how easy this food is to get. as other fish is likely consumed at the same time, as well as seaweed, gills may be an option.

also- you eat your greens? photosynthesis. you use spices? bioweapon options- onions, black pepper, hot peppers, and so on.
