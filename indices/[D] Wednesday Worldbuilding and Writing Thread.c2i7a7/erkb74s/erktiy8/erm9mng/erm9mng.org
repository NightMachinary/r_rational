All good ideas, thanks! In regards to cannibalism (if it can even be called that when you have this power) I would say yes, but you wouldn't get the full upgrade and it wouldn't be cumulative. So you wouldn't get all of someone's intelligence after eating them, it'd be more fractional, and you couldn't get smarter and smarter by eating more people - you'd only be as smart as the smartest person you've eaten at most (more likely the average of all brain matter instead). Obviously this goes for the rest of the body too.

For obvious reasons, this probably won't be explored much or at all in the actual story, at least in a practical sense.
