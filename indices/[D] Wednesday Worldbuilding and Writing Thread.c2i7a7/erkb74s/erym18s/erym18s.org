Many birds have far more densely packed neurons than humans do. The main limiting factor [[http://www.research.ufl.edu/publications/explore/v12n2/extract1.html][seems to be]] that small neurons have short lifespans and neurons need to last for an animal's full lifespan, but you can always eat a larger, longer-lived animal or just keep your own neural hardiness.

[[https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/25/neurons-and-intelligence-a-birdbrained-perspective/][This scaling of neuron size is one of the main reasons why large animals need larger brains than equally complex small animals.]] Simply have your character buy and eat some finches and (if they are smart about which traits they gain, then) they should become far more intelligent.
