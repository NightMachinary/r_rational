In a lot of Gamer fanfictions the main character, the Gamer, can learn skills at a vastly accelerated rate. Most abilities in the relevant setting can be learned, including mundane skills and some supernatural skills/abilities. Skills generally scale linearly (i.e. if "Running 1" gives +2% to speed the "Running 5" would give +10% speed) however the learning rate is sublinear, meaning that the biggest return for time spent training is in the early skill levels. Further usually the learning rate is significantly boosted while the skills are used in combat. Stats can also be trained following a similar framework and at certain benchmarks(at some multiple of 50) a special benefit is unlocked, though there are no discernible pattern to the power and usefulness of these.

This is intentionally being kept somewhat vague because protagonists in these stories usually don't have access to detailed knowledge to the skills and abilities that are available to them.

Suppose you were in a position of the Gamer and you wanted to grow as powerful within a limited time span, what would your general strategies be?

I'll post a few character sheets for gamers as examples in the comments below
