Did you mean skill slots? I've never read the Paragamer, so it'd depend on how that kind of mechanic was detailed out. The biggest ones are if skills can be discarded, and if skills are automatically acquired and set.

With a no discard and autoskills, you'd basically be flying blind and trying not to crash into anything too worthless. Try to avoid doing anything too strenuously to trigger a skill acquisition, then guess where to go from there. See what a meditation skill gets you, then a physical skill like running, and maybe some kind of social skill. Brainstorm what kind of skills would be most helpful, building off of results of previous skill acquisitions until your slots are full.

If either of those conditions aren't present, first ascertain whether or not you can re-acquire a discarded/rejected skill. If so, you can more-or-less follow the intial plan while keeping a slot open for new skills, recording the previous ones to figure out an ideal build. If not, then a compromise between the two plans would be ideal, building up a skill base conservatively while not trying to trigger too many seemingly-useless skills that could be vital down the line.
