It's hard to know what limits I would be figuring out without knowing what those limits are, but generally speaking I'd try to see if there's any pattern in the skills I get and how I benefit from getting them. For example, if all the bonuses are physical, I'm probably unlikely to find a skill that'll boost my learning skills. Discovering the fact that skills progress linearly would also be important.

My first priority would be any magic that could help me learn faster and/or acquire more information and skills. After getting the first few levels of that, I'd focus on something to directly increase my power, probably something intelligence-boosting or defensive. At some point I'd be paranoid about being found out so I'd want to be strong enough to defend myself in case the wrong people find out. Probably stealth as well.
