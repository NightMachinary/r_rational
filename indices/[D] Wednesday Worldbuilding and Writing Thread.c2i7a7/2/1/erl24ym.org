Assuming it's our world, I'd study up on some mundane things on Wikipedia, then go to the library (probably run there to see if that unlocks the skill) and study some different mundane things to see if there's a noticeable difference in speed of acquisition based on quality of source. Depending on what I figure out, I'd spend more time trying to understand the system further and figure out its limits.

Once I figure that out, I study languages at the appropriate source in the hopes that at some point I just get instant acquisition. Probably study some self-help books and see if I can pick up anything that'll directly boost my learning/XP gain.

If that works, I'd get Latin and Hebrew and then start studying occultism/kabbalah/magic and see if anything supernatural starts working really well.

In my downtime I'd probably try out new hobbies that could result in skill unlocks, like biking, rock climbing, swimming, yoga, meditation, and fencing if I knew about the combat rule, though maybe that'd be how I would discover it.

To generalize to any world, I'd first try to learn what I can about the system by getting a lot of skills to level 1, then try to learn languages (large utility) and meta-skills, then go for whatever supernatural abilities that should now be easier to acquire.
