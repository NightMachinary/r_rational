Yeah, the protag will definitely end up being several times stronger than a normal human. I'm just not sure how far I can go with it while keeping it biologically realistic. Due to the nature of the power, I don't have to be beholden to what could realistically evolve and can instead incorporate muscle optimisations from loads of different species, but even still I don't want it get ridiculous.

What do you think would be a reasonable upper bound for muscle strength?
