octopus/cephalopods have been suggested already. another trait to them though is there eyes are contrast based, not colour making it easier for them to spot hiding things, also their skin has some receptive quality. and the blue ringed octopus (which might be hard to get) has great venom.

​

jelly fish could make it painful to touch and transparent if theres a use for it. lobsters claw strength and ability to keep growing maybe? im pretty sure there nearly immortal aswell. electric eels to generate electricity. and sharks have unlimited teeth (plus they have teeth skin so you could jank it up and let him administer venom through punches)

moving on to creepy crawlys spiders have venom, web, multiple eyes and some have hydraulic muscles. worms have two hearts. mosquito's blood sucking ability might have a use (i dont know what). cicadas can make that noise which would probably be deafening at the size of a person. and some species of grass hoppers have interlocking gear legs.

glow worms and angler fish can glow in the dark. help out whatever night vision you have. angler fish could have a way to hide it unlike glow worms though

poison dart frogs are nifty.

i cant think of anything right now, maybe termites? but something should let him eat cellulose.

and maybe if you can think of a way to implement it alot of creatures go through metamorphisis (tadpoles, catapillers, grasshoppers etc to go through multiple metamorphisis?).

​

maybe consider how much something has to count as food or you could just boil bones and drink boiled bone water to gain dinosaur/other extinct creature powers.
