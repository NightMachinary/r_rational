[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis_shrimp][Mantis Shrimp]] have some of the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom and are relatively easy to obtain (in comparison with some animals here). There's some other very cool stuff they can do, but probably won't work due to square cube laws. For example, they can accelerate up to 100km/s^{2,} hitting hard enough to create shockwaves.

[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_mole-rat][Naked mole rats]] are practically immune to cancer, caused by better DNA repair systems, which also serve to extend their lifespans. They can survive a very long time in low oxygen environments (though this might not translate to a larger organism). They also can't feel pain from capsaicin or acid.
