Nice! I've actually already got mantis shrimp on the list. Obviously there's the eyes, but if I remember right, the aspect of the arms that enables such acceleration is somewhat scale-able. IIRC, they have a sort of ratchet-like mechanism that locks the arm in place while the muscles build up force, enabling huge speeds when it is released. It basically lets you use the power of slow twitch muscles at the speed of fast twitch muscles once it's been "charged up". I couldn't find this on a cursory search of the page you linked, however, so it may be a different animal I'm thinking of.

Good suggestion with the naked mole rat, it's great to hear about new things :)

What do you think about ironshell beetles, limpet teeth, etc? Do you know of any other organisms that incorporate materials into their body like that?
