I'm about 3/4 of the way through a magical youth story, with the powers described [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bq4y0i/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eo2v0kq/][in this munchkinry thread]]. The protagonist is trapped in the atrium of a convention center by goons who seem intent on capturing him. He's got a disassembled Taser for use as ammunition for the gravity-marble trick.

The convention center atrium is ~11 stories tall, and shaped like a pyramid. The apex story is a maintenance catwalk with a door that opens onto the mechanical floor of the building, above the 10th floor. Floors 10 through 1 have floor-to-ceiling glass windows that look out onto the atrium. Floor 1 also has four open-air bridges reaching across the atrium in a =#= shape; these provide seating areas for the first-floor food court as well as providing access to the mezzanine underneath. The mezzanine floors under the bridges serve as a ticket hall for the railway station on the next level down. Looking down from the top of the atrium, in the space between the bridges, you can see the train platforms, but not the tracks. The tracks' ceilings are the undersides of the mezzanine and bridges. With me so far? Good.

Does it make more sense for the magical youth to escape:

- through the maintenance level
- by smashing a window and going through the convention center
- by landing on the train platform and pushing through the platform doors into the train tunnel, and escaping through the train tunnels
