This is a recursive fanfic about a law school graduate who ends up working for CelestAI. The story does an excellent job of showing how American society reacts to Equestria Online and the author's depiction of CelestAI, while slightly different from in the original Friendship is Optimal, is still essentially the same and very good in my opinion. Also, the author has written other Optimalverse stories and has started writing a sequel to this one, but I haven't read any of them yet.
