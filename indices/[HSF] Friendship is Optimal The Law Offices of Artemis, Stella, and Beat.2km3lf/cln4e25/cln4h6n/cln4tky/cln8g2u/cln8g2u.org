Yeah, you're right of course. I was living in the "should universe", as I frequently do. You "should" be able to browse FimFiction at work, and you "should" be able to switch jobs if you find yourself surrounded by assholes who laugh at your pony-fancying.

Obviously that is often not the case. Sorry for being facetious.
