Most stories focus on particular characters because they carry narrative power much more easily than broader containers like "society" or "the world" do. You could certainly have more epilogues that end with zoomed out, top down views on how everything ends not just for the protagonists but for the world, but that sort of hampers the potential of more stories between the end of the one you're reading and the utopian singularity (or dystopian one) the same way the epilogue in the canon of Harry Potter sort of restricted the possibility of any post-Hogwarts story between the 7th year and then.
