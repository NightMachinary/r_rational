I guess I'm trying to get at the broader adherence to common world-building tropes in fiction, especially related to protagonists. How many stories are out there that sit in "simplified 14th century Europe but with magic" or something to that effect? How many Sherlock Holmes-esque "deductive genius with major social issues" protagonists are there in mainstream media over the past decade? Like making fiction from established cultural understanding makes sense, it allows the author to bring their differences into greater focus, it cuts down on how much you need to do to establish the world, and the popular tropes are popular for a reason. But, and I don't know how much of this is wishful thinking, lack of finding such works, or some level of bias I've got going on, shouldn't there be more stuff that violently breaks from such molds?

Jabberwocky is a departure from the narrative norms and world-building taken to a grand level, but is the middle-ish ground between that and what is popular just thoroughly unreadable or unwriteable for some reason I don't know? Is Jabberwocky only functional as a piece of fiction due to its incredibly short length? I guess I don't know how much incomprehensibility or obtuse-ness a work can have before it becomes completely intolerable to either the author or the reader.

Polemics about building a better future kinda seemed like the type of thing that'd end up on this subreddit. But given the other commenter in this thread talking about how Eliezer Yudkowsky trying to do that and stopping because the work was incredibly depressing, all those stories sucking as fiction makes sense. I hadn't read any myself, and I didn't know if it was because they did indeed suck or if there was something else at play.
