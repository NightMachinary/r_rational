You seem to be using some hyper-specific definition of rational fiction. It's just characters acting rationally. That's literally all there is to it. They don't [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall][turn into idiots when it's convenient for the plot]], they don't [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatDeduction][magically deduce]] things that can't be deduced from actual evidence etc.
