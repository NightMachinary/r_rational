You're not wrong at all, it's just...

You know how "literally" has had its definition expanded to include it meaning the exact opposite of its original definition for the purposes of emphasis? It's got significantly less precedent to it's usage in such a manner, but came about through changes in the way it was used. I'm taking a pseudo-definition of rational fiction based on common driving themes in the body of mainstream rational fiction I've read because I'm personally inclined to taking the approach of defining language based on the way it is a part of a broader context. I could easily be wrong about how consistent these themes are in rational fiction as a whole and getting my definition wrong, and I'm probably more inclined to be accepting of such fluent definitions given I'm queer and a lot of language about identities in that whole community is more flexible/fluid/changing (hell, look at the change from "queer is a slur" to "queer is an identity" over the past few decades). Like there is no chance at all your definition is wrong, there is a chance my definition is wrong, but I think there is some justification to looking at definitions from my viewpoint even though I'm bias towards doing so.
