I could also wax poetic about some implications of AI leadership, but felt it'd detract from the (already scatterbrained) thread too much.

Like how if AI wipes out humans, does it matter that much? If our descendants aren't (our) flesh and blood, does that really matter? How fleshy and bloody do our descendants have to be anyway? Like if you don't have kids of your own directly, do you write off everyone else's kids? Does every species that predated our current species in the long history of evolution not count as our ancestors? What distinctions are you making between whether or not something is classed as a descendant?

Also, kinda what I was getting at with shoving "Pascal's Wager" in there, but how does this relate to the definition of "God"? If we make some ultimate arbiter by our own hand rather than by whatever scriptures a bunch of folks subscribe to, does that make the endeavor greater or lesser by association? Religion has been a popular sentiment across the world for millennia, even if I doubt that people reading this are too enamored with the idea themselves (and myself for that matter).

I don't know the answers to these questions. I'm posting this whole thread here because I don't know a lot of things and my head runs in circles thinking about these topics. Comments and thoughts and any resources on the topic very much appreciated.
