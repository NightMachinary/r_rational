When people talk about AI wiping out humans, we're talking of wiping out all sentient beings in this tiny section of the universe. Something like "wiping out" humanity by evolving us into a new race isn't the kind of philosophical issue I've seen come up in serious discussion (Then again, I could just not have had enough experience there), so I think most people agree with you on it being a non-issue (Of course, this also implies that /we'd/ also be non-humans, not just our descendants, because biological enhancements are a thing.

I don't understand your second point about God. Could you explain that a bit further?
