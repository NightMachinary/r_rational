Bit of a disconnect here on "serious discussion." You're taking it as "discussion worth taking seriously" (the categorisation of the current topics here I agree with though), I'm taking it as "discussion the people involved with are having seriously." Like if a genuinely misguided racist sits down and tries to argue their specific brand of bullshit (not just spewing hate one-sidedly), it could be done with the intent of being a serious discussion, even if everyone who'd end up in this thread/subreddit wouldn't take any of their points seriously.

This kinda leads into allegories to God, the more bible-thumping-y folks call things like abortion and organ donation "playing God," people which I think the both of us have actively avoided throughout our personal acquaintances, but their aim is looking at the things within the realm of possibility, putting it on a spectrum, then drawing a line between what they think we should and should not do. I was doing a poor job of conveying it, but I was trying to get at the idea that a large chunk of people (not just the hyper bible-thumpers again, the more progressive/middle-ground-ish folks who only loosely stick a religion too) would be vehemently opposed to the idea of elevating something to the levels a super-intelligent AI could reach. If there is something that, considering the spread of religion, the majority of the population would have somewhere from misgivings about to definite strong opposition towards, should we consider this opinion?

That question itself can be broadly made into "Do we allow people to make decisions that make their own lives worse?" and is easily applied when talking about the laws and broader legality of things like alcohol and gambling, and the general balancing act between freedom and well-being. Also the whole "we are an interconnected society and how much responsibility to we bear for living a good life?" as the next argument from that. These questions are a hell of a lot broader in scope than what this thread started from though.
