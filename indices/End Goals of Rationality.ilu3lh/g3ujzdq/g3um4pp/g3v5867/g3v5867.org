Eh, evolving into a new race could easily be an extension of Ship of Theseus arguments. It's not something I've looked into too hard, I'm sure there's arguments from people opposed to organ donation taking that tack, I don't remember when I looked into that stuff a while back on a whim, but it's not something that I am majorly interested in. It could be because I am far enough removed from the conversations that I don't know interesting debates are happening though.

Uh, it's more that God, in broad strokes from my only vaguely-sorta-not-really Christian-adjacent upbringing can be construed as the whole "Big guy in the sky looking down and moving things around imperceptibly to keep us chugging along and avoiding disaster." You could, once you got the whole AI singularity thing online, potentially have it decide that is the approach it would take to helping humanity out. It probably wouldn't, but the potential of an AI overseer/arbiter/whatever having the effective powers one would attribute to a modern day interaction with a God is the parallel I was drawing. Not the unknowable/unprovable afterlife stuff, or the timescale of supposed influenced from the dawn of creation, or the creating of prophets or holy scriptures. Just the stuff that a modern day believer would attribute to the designs of deity and not be able to be conclusively disproved over (unless they're overeager to ascribe things to His power, and likely won't consider any arguments about).
