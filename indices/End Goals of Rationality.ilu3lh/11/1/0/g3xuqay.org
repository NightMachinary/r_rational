Ok, yep, makes sense. I guess there's a big difference in sitting down and loosely plotting out a better world than the one we're in, and taking care and effort to construct and convey a thoroughly planned idea to others. I often get stuck in a mental rut trying myself thinking of that broad utopia topic, but chronic depression kinda normalizes thinking things that make you feel varying degrees of shitty and I've been like this for literally the majority of my life so I don't know how it is on the other side of the fence so to speak. Like when so much of your thoughts lead you down that path anyway, whether or not to avoid a single specific instance of that pattern isn't typically worth considering.
