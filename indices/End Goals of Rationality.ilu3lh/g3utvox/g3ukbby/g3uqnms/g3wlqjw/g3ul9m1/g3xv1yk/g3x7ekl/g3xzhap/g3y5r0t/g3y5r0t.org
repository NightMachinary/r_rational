I think the main reason why most fiction doesn't break the mold of its tropes is that most fiction seeks to use tropes. Invoke them for emotional freight, invoke them to save space and time, lean on them because it's easier than generating everything whole cloth, they're useful!

There's a /lot/ of utopian science fiction out there. The vast majority of what I'd consider utopian is queer, and basically none of it is even remotely commercially successful, even stuff that's been published through traditional means. Basically the only really successful example here is the Culture books, and a lot of people consider them horribly dystopian.

There's also a lot of "blueprint for a better future" type science fiction out there. The vast, vast majority of it is implicit; it's written set in a society that has done the work, and explores the themes of "okay, what now". (I count in this category Lois McMaster Bujold's SF, Becky Chambers's books and in particular Record of a Spaceborn Few, again the entire Culture series, and basically anything that came out of the "fully automated luxury gay space communism" meme/notion, a lot of which you'd have to delve into Tumblr for or find the various Patreon pages of people who write stories in that oeuvre.)

I would recommend ignoring anything E.Y. writes on the matter of writing, and would recommend looking for stuff by more widely-successful authors. The aforementioned Banks, Bujold, and Chambers have all written works that serve as a sufficient refutation, though what prevents him from being able to do what they did is something I feel no need to speculate about.

But here's the key: good fiction about the utopian future doesn't tend to be about the path there, and it doesn't tend to be about technology or structures or strictures. Good fiction about the utopian future, just like all the rest of good sf/f, tends to be about people. Specific people, dealing with other specific people, as a reflection of what it means to be human. That's sort of what SF/F as a genre is about.

("What is the path to the utopian society" is more of a thing in non-fiction. I find reading it depressing because I don't believe that good will prevail, but it's certainly out there.)
