  but shouldn't the focus be somewhat broader in the endings? Looking at the world reacting to the events rather than a culmination of the character/s efforts from a first person view?

HPMoR had epilogues regarding the futures of at least two side characters not directly bound to Harry as well. Draco and Snape

  "epilogue 2: here's how everything changed in the wider world." One first for the narrative to have a satisfying conclusion, one to reconnect the ideals expressed by the author to the reader themselves in a more explicit manner, talking about benefits beyond the individual.

  I mean why is humanity being in charge of everything something people see as set in stone? "Friendly AI" is something that is discussed (that I really need to read more discussions of), AI that helps humanity, but with the idea of an AI singularity being a thing that is being actively researched, AI that is (several times) smarter than humans seems a distinct possibility

There definitely is rational(ist/ish) fiction that ends up with a good AI. But you can't end all stories the same way, else it becomes unoriginal.
