A religious person would not consider a super-intelligent AI as God, I think. Considering that the more public definitions of 'intelligence' keep changing depending on whatever modern AI /can't/ do, I doubt that's likely to change. Already we have AI sufficiently capable of writing stories, and people aren't crying for its dismantling. Even when we reach the stage where AI can create new mathematical theorems on its own (A level where it can affect more change than nearly anything else), those people would likely not care about it in that way.

I do think people should be allowed to take decisions that make their own lives worse, but with a pretty big caveat to factor in the fact that many times, people simply aren't capable of making those shots. I'm not talking about intellectual capacity here, I'm talking about addicts who don't really have a choice about their own lives. There's a reason sex when one party is inebriated is counted as rape, and I agree with the logic.

Apart from that, I think a far more effective route in preventing the kind of problems that arise from letting people make their own decisions otherwise, is simply to make them smarter. The people on this subreddit likely weren't /born/ smart, and even if some were, that doesn't change the fact that this sort of intelligence is about Bayesian thinking and overcoming bias, which is mostly a matter of pedagogy.
