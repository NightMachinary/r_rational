  Why is humanity so front and stage in thoughts of the future?
#+end_quote

Are you asking why SF/F speculative fiction is about humanity and the human experience / condition, or are you asking why rational fiction doesn't throw off the shackles of the SF/F genres and write about aliens and incomprehensibility?

  but shouldn't the focus be somewhat broader in the endings? Looking at the world reacting to the events rather than a culmination of the character/s efforts from a first person view?

Sure, if that's what the story is about. But no, not if that's not what the story is about. Not every story is a polemic about how to build a better future, with a nice neat moral at the end about how the protagonist followed the polemical plan and made that better future (and in fact, almost all of those stories suck as fiction).
