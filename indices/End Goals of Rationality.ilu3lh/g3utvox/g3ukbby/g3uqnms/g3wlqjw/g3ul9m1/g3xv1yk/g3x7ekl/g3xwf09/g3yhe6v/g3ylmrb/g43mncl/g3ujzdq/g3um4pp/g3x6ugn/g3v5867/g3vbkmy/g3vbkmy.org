The Ship of Theseus argument would be valid if we were talking about slowly evolving the cognitive nature of our /minds/. We are not our body, and changing the vessel our body inhabits is no different than changing the clothes that vessel wears.

I don't mean to be snide, but I did say serious discussion about transhumanism. As far as I know, that's a pretty regressive opinion (If I'm wrong, feel free to correct me, obviously).

Well yes, a super-intelligence is as close to God as we'll ever likely come in real life. It /really/ depends on your definition of the term, however, and I suspect most religious people (at least, every religious person I know) would not consider an AI God. I don't think the name has much use otherwise, because we use these terms to better label things, and if we're capable of building a super-intelligence, somehow I doubt categorizing would be one of our issues.
