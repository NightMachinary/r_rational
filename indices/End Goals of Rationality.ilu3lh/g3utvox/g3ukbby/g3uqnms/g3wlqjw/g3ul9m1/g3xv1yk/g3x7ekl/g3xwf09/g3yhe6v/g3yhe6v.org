  I mean why is humanity being in charge of everything something people see as set in stone?

Eh, no matter how you turned it around, "we are now in charge of some non-human entity that does better than we would" would sound a lot like dystopia to many people. And I'm not necessarily one of them, in the hypothetical scenario in which I could have a genuinely benevolent, wise ruling AI, I'd probably be better off, and with no less control than with some President or Parliament that is always overwhelmingly dominated by the party I did /not/ vote for anyway. But a lot of people highly value self-determination for its own sake, and you can't ignore that.

By the way, did you read Friendship is Optimal? That one's basically about a caretaker AI.
