Counterpoints: Friendship is Optimal. The Culture series. In Greg Egan's futures the beings that are in charge of everything are often human-like in many ways but are not actually human any more. In Charlie Stross's /Saturn's Children/ and /Neptune's Brood/ humanity has been replaced by human-derived robot sex slaves. Karl Schroeder's Ventus and Virga series humanity is kind of living on the skirts of far smarter and more powerful beings, many of which are no longer self-aware because self-awareness is inefficient.
