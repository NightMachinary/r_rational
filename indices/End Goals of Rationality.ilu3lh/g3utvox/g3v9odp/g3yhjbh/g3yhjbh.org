  I'm taking a pseudo-definition of rational fiction based on common driving themes in the body of mainstream rational fiction I've read because I'm personally inclined to taking the approach of defining language based on the way it is a part of a broader context.

Usually here works that also focus a lot on spreading specific ideas about rationality are tagged not just as rational, but as rationalist. However yeah, I can see the point, you should just be a bit more specific I guess. Anime is not just about giant robots and magical girls, but if you're watching a giant robot or magical girl show it's almost certainly anime. Something like that. What you talk about is more like a trope that happens to be common in rational fiction (probably because it's been codified by early works like HPMOR, The Waves Arisen, etc.).
