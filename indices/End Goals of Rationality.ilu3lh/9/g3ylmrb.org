The reason why we do not have the Second Epilogue, is that it would either have to be blatant Mary Sue Land, or be realistically flawed, which would be a downer ending.

It is better to leave the final epilogue to reader's imagination.

Have you read Transhumanist Wager? Or Micro Gates? Or Atlas Shrugged? All these stories deal with the long term outcomes of transformative rationalism, and in both cases billions die in the inevitable 'birthing" process of the new rationalist era. This makes these books pretty off-putting in the end, because while the rationalist protagonists manage to build the foundations of utopias, they are built on bones of billions of irrationalists who killed themselves in a desperate frenzy to stop the optimization.
