Wow, I love this chapter. We really get a sense of Xvim's ruthlessly practical approach, as well as a new quest line opening up for grey hunter spider potion-making.

Re: Xvim:

Does this mean that Xvim has given his explicit consent to be completely mind magicked (it can't be mind rape if he says "yes")

If Zorian doesn't ask Xvim to be the first good/neutral arch-Mage he mentally interrogates, then I will be disappointed, since Xvim is the only person Zorian can really feel comfortable breaking to such a degree since he offered it as the strategy leading up to the final plan.

Re: Grey Hunter potions

Here's my guess of how what is to come... Zach will be the tempting bait and Zorian will just sneak into the spiders lair and steal some eggs. Then they use the potions and troll Xvim's most unsavory Rolodex contacts for power-leveling.
