Damn this chapter was intense. They confronted Xvim and Alanic and, as stressful as it was, seem to have made progress. Zorian knows how to talk to Alanic, Xvim's providing valuable advice and Alanic's unearthing some good stuff.

Zorian's plans look interesting too. It's about time he started recruiting other (human) mages and checking out enhancement potions (especially since they seem to have long-lasting effects). I was wondering when Nirthak (the combat instructor who blacklisted Zorian) was going to come up.

And lastly... well Zorian's in a pretty tough position huh? I think he should go through with it, but like Xvim says, it's probably a bit easier said than done.
