I strongly disagree for myself. The mobile version doesn't have margins (only relevant on large screens), uses Arial instead of Verdana (though that's personal preference), shows a lot more information in the top bar, the line length scaling is only an issue if you have a tiny screen (less than 768px wide), behaves nicely with zoom as long as it's bigger than the equivalent of 768px - so 300% zoom on my computer, and while the copyguard is annoying, it's a [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectable-for-fanfiction/jcidlhgdoojamkbpmhbpgldmajnobefd?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog][simple chrome extension]] to fix.

I'm sorry that you have evidently have a smaller screen than I do, but for many people, the desktop version is superior.
