When I say trained I mean he did essentially the same thing with the cult people during the invasion when he was trying to save the catshifter. Like clearly it's possible to smash and grab memories and leave them catatonic, he's done it both then and later on with the master of the mansion during his interrogation. So that's more my thinking, except he makes the comment about the spiders so ehh...

With the rolodex, I can't help but think Xvim has sent him other mages who are ALSO mind mages or that he suspects to have some research into that area. I mean if I were xvim they'd be the first names to go on that list. Get zorian the knowledge about his strongest play.

That and Xvim is good but there have to be people who are better, hell I'd be willing to bet there are a few contacts in there with contacts with the spiders. I doubt anyone's gone as far as zorian has with them but it's a big world and I wouldn't put it past mages or spiders to figure some kind of trade out. Granted I suspect in 80%+ of the time that 60 seconds estimate will be likely.

Again I'm not saying Zorian won't buckle down and do it. I'm just saying once you agree that there is a need. What if coming out of the loop the need persists? Will he do it outside the loop if the need is high enough? The mindset he develops in the loop won't just disappear once he gets out, and after that who knows what kind of justifications for "the greater good" will arise in his life even post RR?
