I'm just saying he also says the same about the spiders and how bad that feels. Yet we seem to get no hesitation even with the justification of him not caring. It makes me uncertain about the level of feedback that he does get whenever he rips through an entities mind. Or is the distinction because the spiders are psychic and thus feel attacks like that on a deeper level which he picks up?

I agree that most people won't be at Zorian's level but I doubt all of them are pushovers.

My wager is because the aranea have traded or kidnapped mages in the past. I doubt they've ever tried to interact with the taboo of mind magic and closing off of the web but there are always weirdos like the witch.

If anything I'd argue the reverse could also be applied here. Yes, he can act as he pleases because he knows the reset will fix things, and can't once he leaves. In another sense, the only attempt that matters is the one outside. The invasion, the primordial summoning, the mansion, everything that could go wrong matters a magnitude more because there will be actual consequences. If anything the justification FOR being ruthless to prevent the lich king or RR from succeeding is greater than anything in the loops. Last time pays for all.
