  he did essentially the same thing with the cult people during the invasion

Sure, he's capable of it. The difference is, he's already stated that he doesn't have sympathy for the invaders. They're an actual and serious threat, traitors to their country (and their planet), about to massacre a bunch of civilians, etc. He did an even more thorough job (though less destructive due to his increased skill) on Sudomir, and was quite happy with himself. What bothers him is attacking people who have done nothing at all.

  I can't help but think Xvim has sent him other mages who are ALSO mind mages
#+end_quote

They're quite unlikely to be at Zorian's level.

  I'd be willing to bet there are a few contacts in there with contacts with the spiders
#+end_quote

What are you wagering?

I doubt that there are any natural mind mages on the list who have trained with the aranea - and any aranean contact less than that is simply a useful tidbit of information for Zorian to scoop up.

  What if coming out of the loop the need persists?

The risks are massively increased. Currently, his reset switch makes him immune to prosecution, greatly protected from retaliation, etc. Plus, and perhaps most importantly, his victims will be unaffected and healthy in the next restart. Wrecking someone's life for real is a whole other level of callous. He'd need orders of magnitude more justification to drive him to this afterward.
