A high magic perception would make a sneak attack impossible, so it's hard to mind-read high level mages covertly. Still, the conventional defenses against it kind of suck even if you know you're under attack. A bit like kicking a blind man.

The only thing that keeps it from being completely overpowered is there's an absolute counter in mind blank.
