  empathy is trained enough

Er...isn't this backward? The more highly trained he is, the /more/ likely he is to know exactly what he's putting people through. And yes, he has trained the ability to shut out the emotions of a crowd, but I hardly think that applies while reaching into someone's mind and digging through it.

  what kind of defenses people who rank on Xvim's mental rolodex would offer
#+end_quote

Well, Xvim is an archmage who specialises in defence, with a virtually flawless mental shield, but being non-psychic, he still couldn't stand up to Zorian's assault. So unless some of these people are highly-trained psychics, their defences can only slow Zorian down and force him to attack from ambush.

A more likely scenario is that he'll be able to covertly bypass their defences, if any, in under 60 seconds.

  there's really no proof that he won't be just as bad as Red Robe
#+end_quote

Yeah, level-grinding on people is definitely unethical. Won't necessarily stop him, given a strong enough need. Aranea are people, after all. Many of them very decent people. He hated going after them, and he wouldn't have outside the loop - but inside the loop, with a big enough need, he did it.
