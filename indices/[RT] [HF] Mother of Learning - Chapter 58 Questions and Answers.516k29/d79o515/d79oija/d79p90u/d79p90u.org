Another plot thread related to Silverlake, is that she asked Zorian to tell Kael that he should bring his daughter to her; that she would pass on the centuries of Witch knowledge she knows to her, essentially taking her on as an apprentice.

This seems extremely interesting, and might allow us to finally learn more about why Kana is the way she is. Honestly, I sometimes wonder if Fria actually transferred parts of her own memories, or of Namira's memories, to Kana, which could partly explain her behaviour. Of course, simply having the memories of someone older wouldn't mean that she wouldn't act as a child regardless, but it could explain her intelligence.

So, who knows? Hopefully, Silverlake comes back at some point in the future. Meeting Zorian's grandmother could also be interesting.
