I'm skeptical about your basic theory, because Zach defeated Oganj /after/ Zorian entered the loop. At which point, Zach was already endlessly fighting the invaders, with no sign of any other plan and RR nowhere in sight. And quite possibly with holes in his memory already, although it's hard to be sure exactly how much of that was lingering damage from the lich.
