There has been a grim nose dive since they opened the memory packet, Zach even had a breakdown when he tried to attack the guardian and Zorian cut the restart short. As stupid as it sounds I think Zorian should really try and ask Raynie out to alleviate the stress, it could backfire but considering their previous meetings I doubt it.
