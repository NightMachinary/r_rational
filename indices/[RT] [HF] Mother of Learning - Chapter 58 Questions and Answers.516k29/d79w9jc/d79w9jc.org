At least Xvim doesn't bullshit. Gets to the crux of the matter quickly after the reveal: Zorian is just an average mage without his mind magic.

The task ahead is nigh impossible for someone of Zorian's experience and given Zach's (lack of) finesse (and possibly compromised judgment).

Curious to see what Zach makes of this. Does his alleged compulsion to avoid mind magic only extend to his own person?
