Zorian is in no way an average Mage. at ALL. he upset Taiven because he can beat her. he can make very good golems and very good with engraving, wards, teleportation, invisibility, you name it.

it's not that Zorian is an average mage but is far from sufficient compared to the task at hand if even Xzim is not confident, enough to the extent that he isn't even sure if he could get himself to tackle such a task if he were in Zorian's shoes
