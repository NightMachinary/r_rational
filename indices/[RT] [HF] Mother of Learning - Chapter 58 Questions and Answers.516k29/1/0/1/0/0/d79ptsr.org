I would more optimistically assume that there are minor details that will never appear in the story at all, as opposed to Chekhov's Gun being mothballed.

Plus, the grey hunter was brought up again when Kael advised Zorian to turn it into a potion instead of a familiar. And again, when Zorian wondered whether Zach would be able to defeat it without harming the eggs. And now Zorian is again wanting to transform into magical creatures. And Silverlake was mentioned in chapter 56, when Zorian decided that she hadn't taught him anything. No way is all that just getting shelved.
