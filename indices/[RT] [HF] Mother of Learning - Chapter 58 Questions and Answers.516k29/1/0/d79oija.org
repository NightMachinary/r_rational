The author's mentioned in his FAQ that a few plot threads might get dropped. I wonder if Silverlake is one of them. The Grey Hunter will probably end up being used for something, but we might never see what Silverlake had in mind.

Also, I think the Grey Hunter's general magic resistance would apply to Zorian's mind magic as well.
