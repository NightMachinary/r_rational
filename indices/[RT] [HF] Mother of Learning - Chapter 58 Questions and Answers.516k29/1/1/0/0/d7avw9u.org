It was never explained why he attacked the dragon. Zorian assumed at the time, at least in part because he wasn't too fond of Zach, that he just did it for shits and giggles, but we've discovered more recently that Zach isn't quite as random as that.

My basic theory is that, at one point, Red Robe was working together with Zach (under false pretenses) to collect the key. Zach might have assumed it was so they could more sufficiently control the time loop, but Red Robe's real plan was to obtain the powers over the time loop for himself. After obtaining the five pieces of the key (one from Oganj, who Zach is probably the only person who could take him down by himself), Red Robe quickly took Zach down using mind magic and wiped his memory of everything that had happened.
