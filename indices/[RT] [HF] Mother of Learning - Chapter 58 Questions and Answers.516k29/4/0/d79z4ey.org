The first time Zorian ever met Alanic, he learned that Alanic is a /battle/ priest, who believes in pursuing and dispatching fleeing enemies with lethal force. Obviously, Sudomir was firmly in the category of people he felt had forfeited their rights.

Perhaps he's just less familiar, and thus less comfortable, with mental violence. Plus training it is not necessarily self-defence. He's still a priest, presumably trying to make the world a better place, and having a trainee run around wrecking people's minds for training is not the sort of thing he would encourage.
