I actually didn't find this chapter that intense. Mentors' reactions to Zach's explanations were rather amusing, Zorian's training was relaxing, and that notebook, aside from Xvim suggestion of aggressiveness, will be incredibly useful. I feel that Zorian will withdraw his "worst vacation ever" after the initial shock fades.
