I /really/ like Zorian's rationale for not behaving like the loop is his personal playground, though. The consequences to his own character are the only ones that will remain in effect, and they could be severe. He's being selfish, but in a good way.

With every step down the slope of morality, you find yourself more willing to take more steps. Precommitment would be useful here, but I certainly wouldn't be confident in myself being able to remain true to it.
