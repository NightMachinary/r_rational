But if they can't get out, it's all for nothing. I imagine that it would take at least 1 restart per treasure for a total of 8 (iirc) for 8 treasures. Then probably a few restarts to optimize their collection strategy so that they can collect all 8 and return to the Gate all in one restart. That, by itself, is already at least 10 of the around 40 restarts left. Unless these researchers and libraries can somehow help ZZ do this, I don't like their decision making. Training for the big fight can always happen after you've ensured the big fight will happen. At least that's my view.
