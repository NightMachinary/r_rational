Does anyone want to bet that the Mesalian Order is not just "plausible cover story that won't be too thoroughly investigated", but rather a hint to future Alanic about what's really going on? I can't see Alanic just tamely following along and agreeing to be kept in the dark. Maybe the Mesalian Order is a sect that was dedicated to time research and was wiped out by the gods as punishment, or something.
