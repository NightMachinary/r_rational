So what you're saying is that the pixel width of your screen divided by the zoom multiplier has to be greater than 768?

That does seem about right. My screen is 1366px wide and I have issues at 200% zoom and above, but not at 175% which is the next highest zoom that I can get without fiddling with browser code. By your claim 178% should be the fail point for my screen. So yeah that fits.

I'm curious whether a larger screen would help me though. I'm already happy with how much of my FoV my current screen takes up. If I double the screen height and width, And double my zoom, but move the monitor farther away so that the relative FoV remains constant, won't the relative text size remain constant too?

Obviously what you have works for you, but I suspect you might just like smaller text than me in the first place.
