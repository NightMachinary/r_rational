This is a bit off topic, but can we talk about fictionpress/fanfiction.net for a moment? Has anyone noticed that the mobile version of the site (replace [[http://www][www]]. with m. in the url) is basically objectively better in every way, even on nonmobile devices?

Not only does it lack the ineffectual copyguard that prevents you from highlighting anything, but it also behaves more nicely as you zoom in and out, scaling the line length to fit your screen (whereas nonmobile seems to assume that I enjoy scrolling left to right as I read each line).

In fact... I wish they'd just make the mobile version the only version...
