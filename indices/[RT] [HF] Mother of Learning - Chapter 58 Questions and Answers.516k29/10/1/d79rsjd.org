I strongly disagree.

I do most of my browsing on a desktop. When on mobile, I use Firefox on Android, and have yet to come across a /single/ website where the mobile version is preferable to the desktop.

While the fictionpress/fanfiction mobile site is nowhere near as bad as most, I nonetheless, find it almost unusable because the text is so large as to make it extremely uncomfortable to read. As far as I can tell, it entirely disregards browser text size preferences. I do not know enough about modern HTML and CSS to say whether this is the fault of the browser or the site. On desktop, shortcuts to change the text size (i.e. Ctrl-scroll) work fine on the mobile site, so I'm not sure why this is.

So on mobile I use Firefox's "reader view" which essentially just extracts the text and displays it without formatting. It also provides the means to adjust the text size to something far more comfortable, and works equally well on the mobile or desktop versions.

Before I discovered "reader view" I used the desktop site on my phone. I had to zoom in so that the margins fell off-screen, but at that point it was comfortably readable and far superior to the mobile site.

On desktop the mobile site works fine if the browser is narrowed to a reasonable width, but is otherwise essentially unreadable. It /does/ scale better to narrower widths, but having such a size-constrained screen on a desktop is virtually unheard-of.
