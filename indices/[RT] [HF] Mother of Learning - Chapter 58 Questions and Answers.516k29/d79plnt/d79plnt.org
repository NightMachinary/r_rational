Previously I've discounted the idea that the time loop could have been initiated specifically to stop the primordial, since the primordial won't be released in the real world for another month. How would anyone know, at that early point, that it would be needed?

But if the Maker is a god of some sort, then it might well know what was coming, and activate the Gate ASAP to counteract it.
