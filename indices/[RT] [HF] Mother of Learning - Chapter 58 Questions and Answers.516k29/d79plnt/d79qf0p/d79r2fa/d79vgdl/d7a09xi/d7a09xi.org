Exactly. If iterations are what is cost prohibitive, you make ONE perpetual, non-looping simulation and let it run at a slightly faster rate just to mom monitor everything. You only need to remake the simulation whenever terrible event occurs and you need to intervene, so it's two to three orders of magnitude cheaper than the sovereign gate running a ONCE.

This way, you always know when you need to come around and fix stuff and it's relatively cheap.
