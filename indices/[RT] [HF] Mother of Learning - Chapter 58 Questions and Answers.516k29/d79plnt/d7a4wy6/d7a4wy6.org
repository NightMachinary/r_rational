  Previously I've discounted the idea that the time loop could have been initiated specifically to stop the primordial, since the primordial won't be released in the real world for another month. How would anyone know, at that early point, that it would be needed?

Better safe than sorry? If it really was initiated by some God, or his followers, then it wouldn't be too far fetched to assume they know the general state of affairs in the Cyordia, the Cult and that other country and come to the conclusion that they would succeed in their summoning.
