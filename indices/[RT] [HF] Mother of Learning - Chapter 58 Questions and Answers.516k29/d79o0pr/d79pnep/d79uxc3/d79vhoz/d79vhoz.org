  Zorian could just do things after the this specific month and Xvim wouldn't know about it.

True enough.

It could also be a test of whether Zorian is telling the truth about the loop. His willingness to do it, at what would otherwise be great risks - and his possession of their knowledge in future restarts - would be strong evidence.

Of course, it will also get more uncomfortable in future restarts when Zorian tells him, "I've been breaking into the minds of mages to steal their secrets, and oh, I just happen to know all about your contacts and the secret information you've collected about lots of important people - but I haven't been breaking into /your/ mind, honest!"
