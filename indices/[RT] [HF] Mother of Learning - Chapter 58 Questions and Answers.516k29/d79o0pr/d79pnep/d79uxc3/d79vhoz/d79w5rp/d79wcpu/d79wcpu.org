  Xvim actions would indicate that he probably believes Zorian

On his own, yeah, but he's been hanging out with Alanic, who's more skeptical...and Xvim didn't previously know that Zorian was a powerful mind mage. Although I agree that he does seem convinced.

  he'd at least add that it was Xvim himself who gave him the list

Of course, but do you trust someone who has already admitted to rummaging through the minds of a bunch of other people?

  Thought 1: But I saw the troll kill Hermione.

  Thought 2: Professor Quirrell Memory-Charmed me and set up the scene that Dumbledore saw when he arrived.

  Thought 3: Professor Quirrell can't do that, his magic can't touch mine. I saw that in Azkaban -

  Thought 4: Can I trust those memories?

  Thought 5: There was clearly some sort of debacle at Azkaban, we wouldn't have needed a rocket if Professor Quirrell hadn't fallen unconscious, and why'd he be unconscious if not -

  Thought 6: Did I ever actually go to Azkaban at all?

  Thought 7: I clearly practiced controlling Dementors at some point before I scared that Dementor in the Wizengamot. And /that/ was in the newspapers.

  Thought 8: Am I accurately remembering the newspapers?

  "Um," Harry said again. "That spell seriously ought to be Unforgiveable."
