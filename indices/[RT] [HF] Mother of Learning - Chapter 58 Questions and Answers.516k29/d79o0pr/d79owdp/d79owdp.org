Yeah, this is a rough road ahead for Zorian, but when I read this segment I ended up sympathizing with Xvim a bit as well. Xvim just sold out his whole contact list to save the life of his student. Decades of friendships and acquaintances. An Archmage's rolodex. It can't be easy inviting someone to invade their minds. I can only assume Xvim is doing this only because he understands the magnitude of the task Zorian and Zach have in front of them.
