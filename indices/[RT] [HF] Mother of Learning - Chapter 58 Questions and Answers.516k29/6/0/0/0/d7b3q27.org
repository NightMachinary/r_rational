Five treasures, actually. Theoretically they are scattered across the continent of Miasina - although since the Gate has been activated, there is a possibility that the Key was actually assembled and used to mark the original Controller.

And if you estimate that it would take 10 restarts to actually do the collection, then that leaves 30 restarts in which it's a good idea to raise skills and gather information.
