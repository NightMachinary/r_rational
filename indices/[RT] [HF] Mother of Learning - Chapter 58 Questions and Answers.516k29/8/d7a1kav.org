Wish we knew if Zorian's mind magic empathy is trained enough that mind-raping a bunch of people and feeling that won't permanently screw with his psyche or cause some kind of backlash.

To mention nothing of what kind of defenses people who rank on Xvim's mental rolodex would offer to prevent this exact kind of thing?

I'm in favor of Zorian not going nuts because there's really no proof that he won't be just as bad as Red Robe if he does go down this road, especially it if it really is that easy to go around just mind stealing at the drop of a hat once he gets out.
