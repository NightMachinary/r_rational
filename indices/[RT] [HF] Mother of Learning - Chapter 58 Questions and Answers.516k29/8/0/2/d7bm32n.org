  level-grinding on people is definitely unethical.

Ethics get weird when time travel is involved. For example, ordinarily murdering someone to get a library pass to look up a book in a library is pretty damn unethical. Hovewer, with time travel, it's not nearly as much of a problem, since you can un-murder them on demand.
