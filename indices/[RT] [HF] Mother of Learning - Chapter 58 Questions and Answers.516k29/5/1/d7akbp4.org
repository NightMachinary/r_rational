The way I see it is that the time loop is actually a backup solution for the world.

It only saves the last couple of months and when the Maker or w/e system deems it necessary to activate it, the time loop is run over that month time period that was saved up. However, going through that accelerated looping drains power while just saving the previous month doesn't take too much.
