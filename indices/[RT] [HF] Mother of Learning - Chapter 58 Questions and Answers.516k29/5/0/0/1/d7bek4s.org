But that might only be true since it doing thousands of iterations in a fraction of a second, maybe running a world simulation once a day to check anything bad happens in the next month is completely sustainable. (I imagine the gate has some way to recharge, that might not help much during a simulate-the-world-thousands-of-times-for-the-chosen-one-in-a-single-second mode, but it might recharge more than a single simulations worth in day)
