I started reading This Has Not Gone Well. So far it reads like someone trying to mimic rationalist fiction by having a main character with an insane memory (and that's it). I'm not even sure it qualifies as rational fiction considering how the plot has only moved forward by means of low effort foreshadowing and one massive idiot ball. [[#s][Spoilers]] I'll try to get through a bit more to see if it gets better but my expectations are low.
