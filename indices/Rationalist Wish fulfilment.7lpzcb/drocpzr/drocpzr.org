I'd say Pact, but it's only wish fulfillment if you're a relentless masochist.

Heros Save The World, but it jumps between viewpoints, only some of which fulfill your criteria, and is less wish fulfillment than existential thriller flavoured with superpowers and a rationalist bent. Imagine mashing together Dan Brown, Dan Wells, and Wildbow.

Twig: see Pact. If that's wish fulfillment for you, please never meet a genie.

Honestly MoL is probably best. It's a bit dry at times, but is popcorn-y while still being dense enough to be interesting.

UNSONG. It's... Not quite what you're looking for. But it's weird enough that it's just damn /fun/ to read, and the main character fits your criteria.
