On second thought I think your suggestion isn't what I want. I can relate to characters who are not like me in any aspect, and that's not what I'm talking about when I say self insert. I mean to put on the skin of another character, become them. And I think self insert is the best term for describing that. If people think that's sexual, then that's their problem.
