Ok, any phrase along the lines of "I self insert in <whatever> characters" sounds like talking about sex, so you may want to say it differently, perhaps something like: "I find that wish-fulfillment type of stories work best when the main characters resembles me, even superficially. Specifically, I find it easy to relate to characters of my own age and gender" or something like that.
