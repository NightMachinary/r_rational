For myself, I dislike having people in my communities who base their identity on oppression and/or hatefulness, even if my interactions with them don't involve those elements. For example, it would make me uncomfortable to receive a "wow, I love your writing" comment from a Nazi, neo- or otherwise. Turn that uncomfortableness up a few orders of magnitude if they actually started spouting their beliefs.

The red pill movement in particular is based on the idea that men should be uber-masculine and domineering, because it will make women submit, obey, and provide sex. That is an abrasive personality that I do not want to have around, and people who explicitly choose to be like that are people for whom I have contempt. It is also an irrational beliefset, which goes pretty strongly against the spirit of this sub.

It may be typical mind fallacy, but it seems likely to me that other people on this sub have the same feelings, and that's why we don't want red-pill types around.

EDIT ADDENDUM: You probably /should/ care if you come off like a red pill type, since it's a subcommunity that promotes strong reactions in a lot of people. If you aren't a redpiller then you don't want to get tarred with their brush. If you ARE a redpiller then it's still a good idea to think about if you want to lay it out there all the time, since it's going to close doors for you. If the goal is to make women sleep with you then it's probably better to save the redpill act for atomspace where you can at least theoretically reap the benefits. No woman online is going to be so impressed with your red-pill-endowed manliness that she's going to hop in her car and drive over to your place for a wild eight-second ride.
