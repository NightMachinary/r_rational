I'm somewhat conflicted on this. On one hand I think a place that tries to uphold the ideas of rationality is exactly the type of place we want to see Red Pillers come to, in the hopes that they can see reasonable non-sensationalized arguments against their point of view that might convince them to change their way of thinking.

However, this sub isn't primarily concerned with rational discussion and debate, but is more a vehicle for discovering and recommending rational/rationalist fiction. So such a debate about politics or gender relations would be out of place here outside of the context of fiction that explores those topics.

Ideally there should be a place where we can logically discuss these type of issues with the people who actually hold those opinions without dismissing their arguments and saying "You're wrong and we don't want you here". But it makes sense that this subredit isn't that place.
