I didn't like Waves Arisen (part of why I said I don't want fanfiction). This wasn't due to poor writing, but because the author decided to take a dump on several of my favourite characters, so I didn't like the plot.\\

As for HPMOR, I've only ever read (part of) one book, and watched part 1 of the Deathly Hallows, and it was so long ago, that I didn't have any attachment to any of the characters in the original Harry Potter series. This lack of attachment (and the way HPMOR was written) enabled me to experience it as original fiction.\\

I get attached to characters, so fanfics that don't treat my beloved characters well aren't very enjoyable.
