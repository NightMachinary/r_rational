I've been binge reading [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/][With This Ring (Young Justice SI)]] which I think meets most of your criteria. The author intends it to be SI, and even says it in the title. Not quite original fic as the protagonist wakes to finds himself in what seems to be a variant blend of different versions of DC universes, with an Orange Lantern power ring, but it is a rational fiction take on that which might have similar characteristics to what you appreciated in HPMOR. The main story line is interspersed with excerpts from a parallel story line in which the protagonist's handling of the situation is a bit more extreme, and a few other parallel story vignettes taking place in other parallel universes. The story is still ongoing, but the author seems very prolific. I am reading faster than new chapters are being written, but it will still take me a long time to catch up.

[Edit update] - BTW, I'll second the suggestions for both /Worth the Candle/ and /Mother of Learning/ which I finished the binge reads of and am now reading as new chapters come out.
