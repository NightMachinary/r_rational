Easy answer: Mother of Learning. Male teen character, original fiction inspired by D&D, though the knowlege absolutely isn't required, any spell more advanced than Magic Missile is explained. Not /quite/ high fantasy, but close, and has an interesting technomagical scene.

Main character is fairly easy to self-insert into, I know I have, he can be a bit stubborn at times, though.
