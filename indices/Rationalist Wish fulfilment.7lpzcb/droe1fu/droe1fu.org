Here's an original LitRPG I've been enjoying: [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/threadbare-original-litrpg.43430/][Threadbare]]. The main character is a golem made from a teddy bear. He starts at the bottom of the intelligence scale, but gets smarter as he levels. Lots of puns, instead of a manna pool everyone gets a bunch of pools for stuff like moxie, will, and sanity. It might not be along the lines you are looking for, but more original than most I've seen and pretty well written.
