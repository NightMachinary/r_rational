If you'll settle for 1-3, the MC merely more reasonable and educated than everyone around him rather than a rationalist super-genius, and the story being an amateur translation of a Chinese web novel that is the usual quality of an amateur translation of a Chinese web novel, try [[https://www.webnovel.com/book/7931338406001705/Release-That-Witch][Release That Witch]].

It's about a Chinese engineer who gets body-swapped into a body of a worthless princeling in a fantasy kingdom that's about to plunge into a whole lot of trouble, decides to use his knowledge to turbocharge this land into industrial revolution. He is helped in this matter by a witch (and then more and more of them) he decides to take a chance on and save from a stake burning, even though everyone in this land thinks they're evil incarnate. It's a very cozy, low-conflict, wish-fulfillment read.
