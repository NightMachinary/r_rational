Mmm, well, we know we're not the only case a life form has reached the level of intelligence of australopithecus, because we have chimpanzees and bonobos, and we know these two have the potential for abstraction and language, because captive primates can learn the sign language.

So that level of intelligence, at least, is not a single exception composed by humans. We can infer that the probabilities of intelligent life are not so incredibly low as to never happen but magically in us (like many theists seem to suppose), this the collective potential of the millions of species could give us a probability very close to one of multiple intelligent life in the future.

On the other hand, the probability of intelligent life in humans is one...

Well, is it intelligent life with many variations and differences preferable over a single type? And if yes, is this difference enough to justify the lost of a certainty over a (possibly) nearly-certain possibility? Mmmm, probably not.
