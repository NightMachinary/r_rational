What are your assumptions on the odds of some sapient form of life other than humans ever coming into existence? Is there a non-zero chance that humanity is the only form of sapience that would ever exist? If so, is there any utilitarian value to the extinction of all minds which can ever /give/ value to anything other than 'negative infinity', which would mean that the appropriate answer would always be 'keep humanity alive', no matter how much value there is in keeping other non-sapient species alive?
