The latter, obviously. That way, only mosquitoes and possibly some germs die because of how linked and twisted the food chain is.

Or if this is interpreted as saying that only those we can eat get spared, then the choice is a moot one because either one will end up with us dying because things we can eat will die because they won't have sustenance and depending on how quickly this happens, we won't have time to recover.
