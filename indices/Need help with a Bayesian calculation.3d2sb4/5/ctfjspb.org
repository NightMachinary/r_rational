Ok, it seems nobody else is trying to answer the question, so I'll give it a go.

The issue seems analogous to the argument for vegetarianism: There are a flagrilion more animals than humans. THEREFORE it is either the case that animals have significant moral worth which through the virtue of multiplication then eclipses all human moral worth, OR they have no moral worth at all.

Then to find your utility function you could look at your own revealed preferences: You (probably) currently act as if even just one animal has some moral worth, which means that the answer would almost certainly be that letting all humans die is preferable.

BUT the problem arises when you realize that human preferences are not consistent. We are willing to pay 1 dollar to save one bird, but not a thousand dollars to save a million of them. So something does not add up but the question is where the problem lies: Either we give up on trying to use math for moral questions OR we give up on trying to make our moral preferences consistent. Either way the prospect of moral progress becomes rather bleak...

Personally I think the second option is the better one, which implies that choosing for the humans to live is probably better, unless you're an extreme animal rights activist, since that is what most of us would intuitively prefer.
