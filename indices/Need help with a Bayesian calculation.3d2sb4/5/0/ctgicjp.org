Two weeks and thirty-four comments later we finally have a winner! Thank you, user who actually tried to find a solution instead of putting the question aside because it's impossible to answer or only bashing the op because he used the wrong terms, even if the meaning of the question is pretty evident!

I'll fondly remember your attitude towards problems, and I'll let you know that it's inspiring for me, even if there's only one person out of, well I don't really know how many read the post, but just one in the *rational subreddit* that's willing to use rationality to solve problems, even hypothetical ones.

I'll let you know that if I ever, in the future, were to build a giant company of whatever, I won't come short of proposing you a position as big-ass manager with a shitload of pay, because you're the one of the very few people I've ever found who's willing to use his brain to /really/ figure problems out.
