Well, I made this mental connection in which Mathematics is included in Logic, and Philosophy is also included in Logic, and maybe people good at logic would feel at home, like Einstein could feel dealing with molecular bonds.

I'm versed in philosophy anyway, so I think it was some sort of bias on my part. That's why I asked if there would have been a better place to pose the question. Thank you for answering that, by the way.
