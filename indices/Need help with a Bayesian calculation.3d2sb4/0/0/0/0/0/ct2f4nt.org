Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude! Your top-level post said this was a question about Bayesian probability calculations.

Determining the relative value of a human life and an animal life is /way/ outside the realm of probability theory. It doesn't even have an objective right answer; you'd need to ask an expert to get a good idea of the different perspectives. Maybe [[/r/askphilosophy]] can help?

And while I'm flattered that you consider this subreddit to be full of "smart people", being smart in one area doesn't make a person smart in everything. You wouldn't ask Albert Einstein for help with a plumbing problem, because he's a theoretical physicist. You'd ask a plumber. The people in this subreddit are generally pretty good at mathematics, but an important part of your question is outside our collective expertise.
