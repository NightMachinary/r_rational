Well I'm very flattered, thank you! If I ever get to realize my dream of forming a team of rationalists dedicated to improving the world, I'll contact you as well. :-)

I share your frustration with the rationalist community, largely because I strongly believe that rationalists should win: [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/7i/rationality_is_systematized_winning/]]

I've always felt that there must be a team of competent people working in secret to save the world somewhere, but somehow that doesn't seem to be the case.
