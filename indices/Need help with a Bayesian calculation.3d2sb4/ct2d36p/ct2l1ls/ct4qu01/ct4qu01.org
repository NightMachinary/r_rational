Appropriate username, thanks. Your scenario makes more sense than OPs.

Though even in your scenario, we get alien tech if we live? Then whether we continue to live depends on how good the alien tech is. If it never breaks down and is compatible with our style of life, etc., etc., such that we don't actually die within days of the change and may even survive for approximately the same time as we would've otherwise, I pick this scenario, since it shouldn't really make life that much different.

Plus, no mosquitoes or germs. No AIDS/HIV or any other viruses.

Honestly have no clue. Is it supposed to be some moral question about whether human life is more valuable or that of other organisms?

  Suggesting that humans can already synthesize food without the help of any living organisms

I read that as being set in present time, and OP being simply unaware of the percentage of organisms needed for sustenance. If it's set in a future when we can synthesize food without living organisms, I'd need a lot more details about that future to be able to answer.
