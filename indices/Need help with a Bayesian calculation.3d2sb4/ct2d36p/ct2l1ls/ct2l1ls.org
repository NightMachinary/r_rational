Omega whisks all humans away from Earth into a giant spaceship. It will either (a) kill all humans on the spaceship and leave Earth alone or (b) destroy all life still on Earth and provide a vast array of replicators that mimic farming in terms of costs, side effects, and output. (You miss out on truffles. Oh well.) Furthermore, we can ask Omega to provide more replicators at any location we want, and it will. In either case, it returns all humans to Earth, dead or alive, exactly where it found them, with no apparent passage of time.

Do you prefer it to execute plan A or plan B?

Or are you going to try to outsmart my revised scenario instead of probing the issue the hypothetical question is trying to probe? You /know/ what it's trying to ask, after all, and it's just a waste of everyone's time to try to work around the real issue.

And you misunderstood the original question in trying to avoid answering it. The original question said:

#+begin_quote
  humanity has no need of those for its sustenance

Suggesting that humans can already synthesize food without the help of any living organisms, making your objection null and void.
