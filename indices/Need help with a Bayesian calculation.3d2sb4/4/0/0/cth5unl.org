Me personally? I'd kill everything else. I believe that animals and plants have moral weight but I'm still going to side with humans. If I'm being honest, I'm siding with humans because I'm not perfectly rational. I could justify that decision if I wanted to, but the fact is that I would not be making it based on moral weight.

"What would you do?" wasn't the question I thought you were asking though -- you were asking about the optimal choice. I don't know that my decision is optimal, and it may well not be. It's probably not optimal from a moral perspective -- I /do/ assign moralons to non-humans, so the combined weight of all the other critters on earth might believably outweigh that of humans.

Even on pragmatic grounds, my choice might not be optimal. Objectively speaking, the only reasons to assign greater moral weight to humans is that we can create things (art, music, poetry, science....) and because the person doing the assigning is (presumably) human. If all humans dropped dead right now, it's not improbable that another sapient species would evolve and do a better job (for whatever value of "better") than we have. So, perhaps the pragmatically better thing to do is kill the humans. I don't care. I'm still choosing the humans.

Marginally offtopic: I once asked my co-founder "if you had the chance to sacrifice your life in order to save the entire human race, would you do it?" Now, to me, this is a no-brainer: yes, of course I would. He said no. This took me very much by surprise.
