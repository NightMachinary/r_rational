The question boils down to what you ascribe moral weight to and how much. If a human has 100 'moralons', does a blade of grass have any number of moralons greater than 0? How about an insect? A bacteria? A blue whale?

If you can set those numbers, the choice is trivial -- just add up the total for humans and the total for non-humans and compare them. You obviously end up with three scenarios:

- Humans have greater moral weight; kill everything else.
- Plants/animals have greater moral weight; kill humans.
- They are exactly the same. Kill all the non-humans because we are the ones making the choice and therefore we get to win ties.

How to assign moralon values is left as an exercise for the reader.
