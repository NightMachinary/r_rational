Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think your problem is a Bayesian calculation. It seems more like a morality question.

 

Remember that Bayes theorem states:

P (A|B)= P (B|A) *P (A)/P (B)

where A and B are events, P (A) is the probability of event A, and P (A|B) is the probability of event A given that event B has already happened.

 

A common example of someone using Bayes theorem is a doctor finding the probability that a patient really has breast cancer given a positive mammogram finding. [A would be the event of having breast cancer, B the event of having a positive mammogram finding. ] The best I can summarize is that bayes theorem let's us "update" our belief in the probability of some event after being given new information about the conditions that influence said event.

 

In your post you present a choice between two scenarios, one in which humans are made extinct, and one in which every life form save humans are made extinct--we're not given new information that let's us update beliefs on probabilities, but rather with situations that examine what we value.

 

I think the obvious choice would be the one in which humans live. Most people value their own existence. However, this existence might be pretty bleak. Though you tell us to assume humans would be able to live without other life forms, I imagine it would be quite difficult. Even if we ignore the problem of getting food without plants, animals, and fungi, human life would be very different without the almost unimaginable number of microorganisms that live on earth and throughout our very own bodies. (You may know that there are more bacterial cells than human cells in what you typically think of as "you"). That said, we would be freed from communicable diseases such as malaria, pneumonia, meningitis, etc. This scenario might make a pretty good story--would humans resort to cannibalism to survive? Could we synthesize enough amino acids, glucose, fatty acids, and vitamins using non living resources on earth? And what about the environmental effects? Without microorganisms and plants, the composition of the atmosphere would change--I think we'd eventually have to dedicate a lot of resources to splitting oxygen out of water.

 

Anyway, I hope this helps. Sorry for any spelling, formating, or factual mistakes--I'm typing this from mobile.
