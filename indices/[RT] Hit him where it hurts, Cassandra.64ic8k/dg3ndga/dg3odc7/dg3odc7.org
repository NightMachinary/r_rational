[RT] for Rational, not Rationalist. By my [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/why-rational-fiction-is-inherently-problematic.34730/page-54#post-7592741][personal definition]] this surely fits, and by the sidebar, it at least hits "characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources" and "the fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them" given how we see Cassandra abusing her vision to fuck with Apollo. Not bad for a 5-panel strip.

My definition includes "if it's upvoted by [[/r/rational][r/rational]] that's good enough for me" and it looks like it is.
