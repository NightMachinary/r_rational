I can kinda see that if you're willing to ignore the original legend, but it makes the whole thing feel ambiguous to me.

Does this mean that nobody believes anything she ever says regarding the future? If so that opens a huge can of worms. Basically everytime she tried to make an appoint with someone she'd have to say "I won't show up at 10am" or otherwise carefully word her sentences so that she either says the opposite of what she wants them to think, or doesn't make any concrete statements about the future.

Not that it would be impossible to live like that, but it just makes the whole thing feel more complicated.
