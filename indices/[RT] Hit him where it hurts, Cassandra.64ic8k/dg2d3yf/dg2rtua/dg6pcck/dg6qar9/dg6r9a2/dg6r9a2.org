That does create the issue of "sharing prophetic knowledge of the future" vs "sharing information about the future that has also been confirmed by prophecy". I think it's rather clear-cut, though- if she her prophetic ability tells her something, she will be disbelieved trying to tell others. They said "/if/ she sees her own death she can convince them it won't happen", meaning it doesn't affect statements that aren't directly supported by prophecy.

By extension, I would think that yes, given the rules as they seemed to work in the DC, you would be disbelieved if you accurately stated your time of arrival.

We can of courseâ€‹ imagine clauses like "the effect is optional if she has also learnt of it by other means", or "she can specifically choose to gain no knowledge of her arrival time, leaving her free to speak of it". But, there's no evidence to support that.

Of course, there are a number of ways around this. It's not even as bad as one might think. The easiest solution is- "I'll be there at 22:05" when in fact she'll be there at 22:00. Her future-seeing ability doesn't say this, since it's outright wrong, so the knowledge should be unaffected.
