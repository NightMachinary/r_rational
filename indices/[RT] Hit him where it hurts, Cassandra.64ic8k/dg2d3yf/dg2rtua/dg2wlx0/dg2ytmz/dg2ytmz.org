I think what he means is that she doesn't get to pick the prophesies. Unless she's lucky enough to get a prophesy about a winning horse, that won't work. On the other hand, you can bet on most anything, so as long as she gets enough prophesies she should be okay. Keeping people from killing her would be a problem, but she could hire guards and solve that with money instead of with prophesies.
