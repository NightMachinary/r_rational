I think it's the "always come true" part they've dropped, not the "only prophecies are disbelieved" part. That is, only after she's seen her own death can she make people believe it won't happen, but in doing so, she actually changes the outcome. In fact, the wording used in the comic is "see the future", not "make inevitable prophecies".
