I was specifically talking about the part where she prophesizes that the people who lost money to her in bets would kill her.

As described in the comic she prophesizes "these people will kill me". Then those people believe "I won't kill her". Then they don't.

But the way her curse should work is that if she prophesizes "These people will kill me" then they'll believe "I won't kill her", then they absolutely should kill her, even though they believed they wouldn't. Because her prophesies always come true.
