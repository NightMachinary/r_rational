The Dinosaur Comics one doesn't quite make sense unless no one believed anything she said, not just prophecies. Because her curse was that no one would believe her prophecies, but they would always be true.

So if she made a prophecy that somebody would kill her, then they would. Even if they didn't believe they would.
