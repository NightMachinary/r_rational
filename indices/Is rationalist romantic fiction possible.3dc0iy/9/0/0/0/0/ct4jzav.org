Dunno, I had exactly the opposite impression; I don't see romance as inherently sexual. Once can totally be romantically attracted to someone without being sexually attracted to them.

There's a difference between friendship, where you have shared interests and mutual trust, and romance; where you find the other persons personality and behaviour so captivating you cannot take your thoughts off them. Both can be combined with sexual attraction.
