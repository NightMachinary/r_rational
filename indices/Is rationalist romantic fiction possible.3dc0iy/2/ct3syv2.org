My general opinion of romance is that the "romantic subplot" gets an unfair bad rap. I prefer stories /with/ romance to stories that /are/ romances. The problem with the romantic subplot is when it feels shoehorned in (Harry/Ginny, cough cough), but this is generally a problem of the author giving the couple insufficient focus, not too much focus.
