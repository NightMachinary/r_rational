Absolutely possible. You can have a conflict between two characters that's driven by their values, where they have legitimate reasons not to be together which are nonetheless not strong enough to actually keep them apart. The plot is then about the resolution of that conflict through rational thought. (Alternately, romance can instead be about change and growth, which can certainly be rational.)

Have I seen it done? No, not really. There are almost certainly romantic stories that would qualify, but I don't read much romance.
