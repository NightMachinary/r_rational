As always, the correct answer is yesbut.

Yes, but the conflict turns to something surrounding the romance.

Romeo and Juliet, for instance. They meet, they fall in love (and recognize that it's infatuation, maybe, and likely to be ephemeral), they bemoan their family circumstances, they realize they can unite their families, Romeo maybe still fakes his death but finds a more reliable way of reassuring Juliet, they fight the prejudices of their respective families and engineer an uneasy truce and lead them through a denouement.

Luminosity. The love story takes much of the first book, and then it quickly switches gears once that's resolved and there's a whole mess of werewolves and vampire nobility causing problems everywhere.

Alternatively, you can have a one-sided romance, but if the person in love in that situation cares at all about the other person as more than a trophy, it's over very quickly. And if they don't, that's not romance.
