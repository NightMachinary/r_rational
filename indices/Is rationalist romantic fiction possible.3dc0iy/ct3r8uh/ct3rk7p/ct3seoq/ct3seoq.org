Romance as a genre is huge. I mean ... mindbogglingly huge. "Romance" accounts for 15% of the adult fiction market. It's bigger than science fiction, fantasy, horror, and mystery /combined/. It's also a very old genre.

The odds that one of those books would be recognizable as rational fiction, even through chance alone, seems really high. But the people who write romance novels are just like you and I, so some of them probably see all the irrational things that we associate with romance and think that they want to do something different. I'm reading /Shades of Milk and Honey/ by [[/u/MaryRobinette]] right now, and I would say that it comes close to hitting the genre/ethos requirements, which is about what I would expect from listening to her on Writing Excuses (though it's a romance in the same way that /Pride and Prejudice/ is a romance, and sometimes that's classified as a novel of manners). That's just me having a single toe dipped in the genre; I feel certain that if I had read every romance novel ever, I would be able to find something that qualifies.
