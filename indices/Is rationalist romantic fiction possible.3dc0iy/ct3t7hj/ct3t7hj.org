By the way, a particular idea has come to the surface of my brain several times over the past few years - the first time I thought of it was before I encountered the rationalist community, actually. The essence of the idea is a retelling of the classic Pygmalion story featuring an AI researcher and his project. I seriously doubt I'll ever get around to it - I have no shortage of ideas - and therefore I invite anyone to take on this nugget of an idea. It seems like fertile ground for rationalist romance to me.
