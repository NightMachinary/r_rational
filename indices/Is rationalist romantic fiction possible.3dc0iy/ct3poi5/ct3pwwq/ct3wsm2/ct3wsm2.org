You have a point. But even so, they do have some awesome romantic moments.

Like after the bullies-on-the-ceiling incident, they're angry at each other, and they seek council from other students, and then they give up on that and go talk to each other because /even when angry/ that's who they want to talk about problems with.

Or after the no-psychological-capacity incident, when some older student offers the tradition commiseration "Witches! Go figure, huh?" and Harry declares "Remove your hand before I cast it into the outer darkness."

Those moments capture the essence of a strong romance really well.
