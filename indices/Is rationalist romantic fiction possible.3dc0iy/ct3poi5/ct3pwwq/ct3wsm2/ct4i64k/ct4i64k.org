They are close friends. Why do people find it so difficult to see friendship between humans of different genders? Why do people insist on seeing romance instead?

This is part of the social background that leads to the so-called "friend zone" -- people with healthy ideas about interpersonal relationships see someone being nice to them and think it's a sign of friendship, but people like you assume it has to include sexual interests.

If that isn't creepy enough, people start talking about romantic intent when two infants of different assigned genders tolerate each other.

This whole urge to sexualize every interaction between genders is creepy and has to stop.
