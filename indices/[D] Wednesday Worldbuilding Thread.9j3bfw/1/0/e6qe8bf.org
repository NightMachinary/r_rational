Even though none of the principal characters are rationalists, I'd argue that Babysitter's Club as a whole is /rationalist/ fiction. There are painfully conventional moral lessons along the way (at the conclusion of most of the books, even), but much of what the stories teach their target audience is to avoid conventional argumentative fallacies, to question their assumptions, and to think and plan more effectively.

If you wanted a rationalist protagonist, just swap the ages of Janine and Claudia. She's practically HJPEV already. That said, I like The Babysitters Startup idea and have always enjoyed watching adult versions of kids' series characters come to terms with the dilemmas of real life.
