  For the first three at least, there's the opportunity to have the sitters explain better ways of thinking to their charges, and inadvertently give a lesson to the reader. There's also the opportunity for a reversal, where they can see their charges "behaving like a little kid" (i.e., irrationally) before the sitters realize they make similar mistakes themselves.

That's a great point. I'll think a about it.

At the moment I've got a bug in my bonnet about doing a one-shot where each of the babysitters is their own Bay Area rationalist stereotype, starting with Kristy taking the 10,000 hours quiz.

Maybe I'll see if I write something this weekend. Or in like two months time.
