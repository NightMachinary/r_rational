It sort of depends on the circumstances, the society/culture in question. Sure, a couple who's been trying for years with no luck that finally gets pregnant might be really put out by their baby being renacim, but if it was an accident, then probably not so much, especially depending on the specifics of compensation.

The Renacim League is a cooperative of renacim responsible for the messier legal and monetary aspects of renacim births. If a renacim dies, they're supposed to be notified, and if a renacim is born, they're the ones that show up to make sure that the baby is either surrendered to someone who wants to look after it, or given a proper home with compensation to the parents, depending on the specifics of the situation, the wishes of the parents, the wishes of the renacim (if known), and the legal framework they're operating under. That said, the League hasn't always existed.

Generally speaking, most people /don't/ think about the renacim, since they're a very, very small population that /can't/ grow very large, and there are two hundred some species that all have their own histories and biases as well. Their rebirth process is unfortunate, but there's nothing that they can do about it, not that that stops prejudice. There's also some envy mixed in, since the renacim get an infinite number of lives.
