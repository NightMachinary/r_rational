If a renacim grows old enough (as a total) and they keep training in their chosen subject, will their range of competency expand, i.e. after enough lifetimes of being a karate master in their thirties, will they eventually also be a karate master in their 20s and 40s, teens and 50s etc? Like, their skill overfloweth?

Also, does magic not work in hell, or are the infernals just strong enough that it doesn't matter? Can they use magic too? Or do they just hold the home field advantage?

ANOTHER question... If I recall correctly, on the horizontal plane Aerb eventually just loops back on itself right? Well, what I'm wondering is, how far along the vertical plane do things go? Does it loop there too? Are the hells deep underground and heaven high above but inaccessible?
