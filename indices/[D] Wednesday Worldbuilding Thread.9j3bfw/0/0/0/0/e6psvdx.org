I can also imagine a knightly order that takes specific care to train themselves in unarmed combat - masters of the art, and chivalrous to the point of being utterly self-sacrificing - who then commit mass suicide in a deliberate attempt to establish a beachhead in one of the lesser Hells, looking to eventually expand that beachhead into a full-fledged society. (Of course, they'd leave an ally with an infernoscope to watch the mission and learn from their experiences, if they were sensible).

Since there would presumably have been some mention of them by now had they succeeded, I can only presume that either they failed, or no such society of knights has yet made the attempt.
