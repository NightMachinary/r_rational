Depends on which legal framework you're talking about. In this specific world, there are lots of legal systems, and while there have been efforts to bring them all in line with each other, sometimes that's really difficult, or there are vestiges of the old ones, or simple cultural/social disagreement on the nature of justice.

Generally speaking though, yes, sending someone to eternal torture rather than oblivion is heavily punished, sometimes as a separate crime, sometimes as an elevation of the existing crime, depending on the justice system in question.
