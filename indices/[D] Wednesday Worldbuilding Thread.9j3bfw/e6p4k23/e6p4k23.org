Renacim are an immortal species that rebirth upon death rather than facing oblivion or the hells.

When a renacim dies, their soul is instantly transferred to the nearest fetal entity with a Knutsenlov development score of less than three. The physical changes occur in roughly three to five days, bringing the fetal entity in line with renacim physiology without regard to the host species. At the same time, physiological changes happen within the host species (or egg, development sac, et cetera) to prevent rejection and facilitate birth. Aside from those changes, nothing innately prevents stillbirth, miscarriage, abortion, or other-than-successful birth of the renacim, in which case they'll simply reincarnate into another fetal entity, repeating the process.

After birth, the renacim develop at roughly human rates, with an appearance that falls within the normal range of "baseline" human, though always consistent with their past experiences, and always with bright pink skin and hair.

The renacim can recall things that happened in their past lives, and learned skills have some degree of transference. Typically, the degree of recall is highest when renacim are at the same age as a past life, meaning that a renacim who has reached the physical age of 26 would remember all past times they'd been 26 quite clearly, all past times they'd been 25 or 27 less clearly, and so on, dropping off more steeping as they moved away from their "life age". Renacim have the highest benefit from skill transference when they repeat what they've done in their past life at the same life age, meaning that a renacim who spends twenty lifetimes doing martial arts in their twenties will have a strong natural aptitude at that age.

The renacim population is (roughly) static; attempts at reproduction will fail or produce more of the paired species, while a renacim's death naturally results in reincarnation. Further, renacim souls are highly resistant to alteration by outside forces, making them hardy (or immune) against most forms of "soul death" and/or mutilation.

--------------

Culturally, renacim can be divided into two camps. The first camp are renacim-raised, usually as a form of cooperative adoption, typically with shared values between parents and children (both of whom take on both roles for each other over time). Because renacim cannot breed with each other, there is usually a small population of some other species within their clans to provide birthing stock. These camps tend to be small and stable, capable of sustaining themselves indefinitely until some outside force comes along to disrupt them.

The second camp of renacim are raised in a foreign culture, usually adopting a fair number of their values. After two or three generations, reinforcement takes effect, and can help a renacim to become entrenched in a particular lifestyle, especially as certain skillsets and ways of thinking become easier and easier, lowering barriers to entry.

The legal status of renacim varies widely by country, especially considering the question of whether they're the "same person" for the purposes of inheritance/ownership, whether they're legal liable for the pregnancy of their host, et cetera. In modern (Third Empire) era attempts have been made to standardize the legal frameworks on the issue, but the renacim are few enough in number that the effort is seen as not quite worth it.
