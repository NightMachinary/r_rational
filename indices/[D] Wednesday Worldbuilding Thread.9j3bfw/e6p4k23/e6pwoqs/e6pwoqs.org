I posted last week about a rational /The Babysitter's Club/ and yesterday one of my friends bought me a "graphic novel" remake of /Kristy's Great Idea/ (the first novel in the series).

I don't believe in signs and synchronicity, but damnit, that's a sign.

I'm going to assume that the demographic of this sub did not read this beloved '80s-'90s series aimed at ~10-12 year old girls.

Basically, it's a pretty shallow romp with teenage girls going through typical teenage girl things: high school, boyfriends, fashion, and of course, babysitting children. It's pretty educational in later books as there's a Deaf child they babysit, a child with autism, topics like death and divorce, etc. It was my first exposure to a lot of these issues.

Characters:

Kristy: Ambitious, tomboy

Mary-Anne: Quiet, organised

Claudia: Fashionable, quirky

Stacey: Fashionable, maths geek, From New York (if you read the series you would know this is detail is about as important as the fact she has type 1 diabetes, so i.e. very)

So, if I'm going to write it - how do I do it?

- Fix-fic: go through the BSC series and write "what if" they did everything "rationally", like that one Stargate fic I really liked

- Rationalist SI: Make Mary-Anne into a rationalist. Everyone else stays the same. See what happens, like HPMOR.

- Modern retelling: Same characters (but make them more logical) and broad story, but make it set in 2018, so the teen girls all have mobile phones and have to deal with problems like a 9-year-old charge googling "boobs" and a 6 year old learning horrific swear words from playing Fortnite. Kind of like Animorphs: The Reckoning

- Modern retelling, aged up: Kristy is an entrepreneur who comes up with "Uber for Babysitters". The other "Babysitters" are not babysitters, but characters in the company (e.g. Stacey's a computer programmer; Claudia is a UX designer; Mary-Anne is, uh, I guess the secretary?)

I'm leaning towards one of the modern retellings, but I'm wondering how I can make it Rational rather than just BSC fanfiction.
