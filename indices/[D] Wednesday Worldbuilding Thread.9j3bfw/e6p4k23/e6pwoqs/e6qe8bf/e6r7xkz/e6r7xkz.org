I'm not sure which of those is best, although it looks to me like you roughly ordered them in increasing difficulty to write.

For the first three at least, there's the opportunity to have the sitters explain better ways of thinking to their charges, and inadvertently give a lesson to the reader. There's also the opportunity for a reversal, where they can see their charges "behaving like a little kid" (i.e., irrationally) before the sitters realize they make similar mistakes themselves.

For example, put one of the sitters in a dilemma-> have her charge while babysitting face a simpler or more ridiculous dilemma-> the charge fails to think of alternatives-> the sitter helps her charge come up with alternatives-> [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/erGipespbbzdG5zYb/the-third-alternative][the sitter realizes she should think of alternatives in her own situation.]]

I'd be interested in reading the story, whatever you decide.
