Yeah, it's made up. Fetal growth charts obviously don't work when you have 200+ species with their own gestational periods, methods of reproduction, physiology, et cetera, but individually tailored metrics are hugely onerous if you want to have them available for every single species, especially since Aerb is pre-computer.

So you get scientists and doctors who come along and try to normalize across species as much as possible. "Knutsenlov score less than three" means different things in different species and serves to give a reference point that anyone can look up on the relevant charts. That way all you need is a single number that gets compared with a single chart, and that's kind-of, sort-of good enough for eyeballing a lot of different things.
