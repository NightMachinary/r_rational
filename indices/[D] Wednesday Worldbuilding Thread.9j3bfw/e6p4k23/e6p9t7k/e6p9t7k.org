This further reinforces my sense that there would be major cultural traditions and institutions to make sure that nobody dies alone. With hell as a certainty for everyone else, soul removal within the necessary window would be essential. Renacim also would probably prefer to leave as little as possible to chance in that regard.

Suicide, then, especially euthenasia would be widespread among mortal races and absolutely commonplace among the renacim. Similarly all mortal races, renacim included, would be significantly more risk averse when it comes to the threat of a lonely death since they are all aware of the contents of the afterlife.

If anything, despite their immortality, the renacim might be /more/ powerfully afraid of death since the specific inconveniences of resurrection would be something they've already experienced... rather than the still relatively abstract infinite fear, pain, and torture witnessed through infernoscopes.
