  This further reinforces my sense that there would be major cultural traditions and institutions to make sure that nobody dies alone. With hell as a certainty for everyone else, soul removal within the necessary window would be essential.

You are assuming this would be common knowledge. It probably wouldn't be. Unless god tells them they'd have no way of knowing this. That's author exposition for us, we shouldn't assume his characters would have access to this information just because we do.

All the renacim would know is that if they die they come back to life, and that it's very inconvenient.

For all we know normal people could just assume they are renacim that lose their memories or some other normal human belief system about death.

They probably would believe renacim are blessed / cursed with retaining their memories because of some past good / bad deed or whatever.
