Yeah, there are some things that I think are really interesting to think about are:

1. Travel by ship comes with both extra hazard pay and cultural connotations, since a capsized ship in a bad storm will send everyone aboard to the hells. Same goes for almost any drowning death, since bodies tend to be recovered long after the fact.
2. Fast disaster response and body recovery has a higher priority.
3. People would make some efforts to invent auto-extractors that can be employed when you're in a position where you think you're likely to die alone. Give the requirements for soul extraction, it seems like a technically daunting challenge to make a device you could self-administer.

And one of the other interesting things is that the default position as shown in /Worth the Candle/ is not /necessarily/ where hexal society would end up on the issue of immortal souls that go to the hells unless there's some intervention. It would be perfectly possible for consensus to come down on the other side, especially if people aren't confronted by the reality of the hells on a regular basis, or if there's some plausible deniability about people going to the hells, or some possibility of rescue, et cetera. There was a time, in-universe, when the "only hells theory" was just a theory, so we're at sort of an end-state of conversation and discourse where it's generally accepted as correct that oblivion is better than torment.

(I've talked with a number of people on this subreddit that would favor any amount of eternal torture over non-existence.)
