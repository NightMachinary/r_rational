Since the soul extraction process would be fatal to somebody who wasn't already dead, I'd personally be pretty nervous about equipping something capable of achieving it.

And yes, it would be hard to get direct evidence of /every/ specific person who's wound up in the hells or hasn't, and finding somebody there who "shouldn't" be for religious or cultural reasons would be only loose evidence if there were also traditions that established how someone might have fallen short of requirements.
