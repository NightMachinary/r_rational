  I'd argue that Babysitter's Club as a whole is rationalist fiction.
#+end_quote

I wouldn't agree with that: I read the Kristy's Great Idea graphic novel and that was pretty rational, but it wasn't rational/ist/, I don't think, as it doesn't really teach critical thinking skills. Not that it's something I feel especially qualified to teach (but then again who does?). The moral lessons, while conventional, are stuff like "maybe don't be racist?", and "maybe be nice to your mother's new boyfriend?". Maybe they're appropriate for 9 and 10 year olds - they probably are.

It's been, well, 20 years since I've read the books, but I remember a lot of the "adults are useless" tropes, which are pretty bad, and I seem to think they got into surprisingly heavy stuff, and I bet you there are a lot of HILARIOUS MISUNDERSTANDINGS?

  If you wanted a rationalist protagonist, just swap the ages of Janine and Claudia. She's practically HJPEV already.
#+end_quote

I didn't finish HPMOR but I don't get Janine = HJPEV. Janine develops a lot through the series (in my childhood I would guess I read about 80% of the first 100 books?), but it'd make a pretty cool AU (though I don't buy 12 year old Janine being interested in babysitting, unless she wants to be an EA or something and "earn to give"). Janine was, I think, about 20 years old and a bit of a pedant, but the book where she got a boyfriend (a super hot theoretical physicist = my dream boy when i was 10) was really memorable.

  I like The Babysitters Startup idea and have always enjoyed watching adult versions of kids' series characters come to terms with the dilemmas of real life
#+end_quote

I think it'd be fun but I also don't think I'd be able to write it that well as a rational story, which'd be important to me for the project, unless I make them all a different rationalist/nerd archetype "inspired by" their BSC archetype. Also, I'd have to think up a whole plot.

Rationalist/nerd achetypes = "neckbeard in the basement", "overthinks and over analyses everything", "EA who is a little obsessed with earning to give", "bonobo rationalist", "the suspiciously normal one", "the obsessive QS person", "something something biohacker"

Stacy would be the biohacker, she'd have an insulin pump that she wrote a bunch of code for, and a bunch of implants like an RFID and magnets in her fingers

Mary-Anne would be the "obsessive QS person" because she's so organised

Claudia would be the "suspiciously normal one" or possibly the "bonobo rationalist"

Kristy would probably be the EA who is a little obsessed with earning to give: I can see it now, she goes on 10,000 hours, does the quiz, realises she should be a startup founder, and phones up her friends and says "hey, remember when we had that babysitters club? I'm going to make an uber for babysitters".

... maybe I could write it as a one-shot
