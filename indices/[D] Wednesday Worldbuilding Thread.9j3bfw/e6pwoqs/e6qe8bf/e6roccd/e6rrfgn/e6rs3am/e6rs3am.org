At the moment I'm learning towards writing a 1-2 chapter "one-shot" of the BSS (Baby Sitters Startup, great title btw, thank you) with each character being a Bay Area Rationalist stereotype that is more "inspired by" than anything else.

But I do love the idea of reading the wiki articles for each book in the series and re-writing them in a chapter or two, with the lessons carrying over.

I'm really trying to get /Vampire Flower Language/ sorted, though, so I'm not sure I can do with another distraction. (If anyone is reading this wondering what happened to it: my coauthor's computer broke, I went on holiday for a month, my coauthor /still/ doesn't have a computer but I'm working on that, and she just got dumped so writing romance at the moment is a bit hard. I've decided we've missed the update schedule badly enough that I'm going to wait until we have two full chapters in the buffer before releasing the next one)
