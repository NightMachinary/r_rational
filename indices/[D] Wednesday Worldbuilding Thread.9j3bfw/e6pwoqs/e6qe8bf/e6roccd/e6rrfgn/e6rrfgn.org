I reread a heap of the early ones when I was volunteering at a local library in college and was surprised by how much I enjoyed them. I think there's an argument to be had whether one can have a rationalist work with no rationalist characters, especially when everybody has to stay essentially the same from book to book.

I agree it's a high bar to clear and that there's some doubt whether it's really accomplished.

The series' goals (in the beginning, anyway, later things get formulaic and cash-grabby) were about living well and most of the solutions really are more critical thinking, planning, and preparation than they are traditional virtues like kindness, generosity, and patience.

Bear in mind, characters /do not consistently do the things they need to do/ and, worse, /do not learn/. They fail for the same reasons over and over again, but when they succeed they do so because they're thinking creatively and cooperatively rather than because they happen to have innate talents, or because they're inherently nice and good.

This... also changes as the books evolve and become more generic as the characters Flanderize and the authors run out of ideas.

I agree that an adult version might be too distinct from the original characters to do them justice and I really may have idealized Jeanine. Maybe just deconstruct or rationalize a few of the worst of the original stories? They're each short enough that they could fit into a few chapters apiece of the conventional web fiction scale, and I (at least) would find it fun to watch the characters develop instead of falling into their familiar ruts.
