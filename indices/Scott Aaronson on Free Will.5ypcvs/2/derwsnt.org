The only times when I personally argue about free will are with theists, specifically ones who try to use the existence of free will as a means of absolving God of responsibility for evil.

This is really cool and has convinced me that there's more to the debate of free will than I previously thought, but it doesn't help the theists with the problem of evil. This is because it isn't a model which addresses God's decision to make a universe where evil was likely and common. Sure, human decisions may well be impossible to predict in particular, but in general it is possible, for a being of sufficient computational complexity, to predict that beings with our general brain structures and histories will often make evil choices, and it should fall upon the being creating such beings to think about what he is doing beforehand. It also, naturally, doesn't help at all with the fact that horrific diseases exist which have nothing at all to do with human choices.

So yeah. I liked this. I was kind of afraid, going in, that I'd have to reconsider a ton of positions I hold on a bunch of different topics, but now I don't. Yay?
