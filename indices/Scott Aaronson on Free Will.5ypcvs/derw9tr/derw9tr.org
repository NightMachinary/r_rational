Whenever I hear about the debate on free will and the idea that if your actions are predetermined then you have no free will, I always think to myself that it doesn't matter. The idea that if someone knows what you are going to do in advance renders your choice meaningless is virtually gibberish to me.

Everyday I interact with people who know me very well and have above-chance ability to predict what I would choose for all possible choices. However, just because my best friend can easily guess that I would choose scrambled eggs for breakfast, procrastinate my course work by typing this comment on [[/r/rational]], read a fantasy book instead of going to a football game, and that I one-box in Newcomb's problem does *not* make the choices I made meaningless.

All my friend is doing is predicting the choices I make, not choosing /for/ me. It doesn't make a difference to my thought processes whether I tell her what I chose afterwards, or if she guesses ahead of time without telling me what I would choose. I would still make the same choice regardless of her knowledge about me.

People have this weird idea that predictions somehow lead to control. As if we were hapless puppets dancing to strings of an invisible puppet-master.

The only reason I can think of for this odd confusion is that people draw a casual arrow from prediction to choice as if the prediction caused the choice. However, even though the prediction occurs temporally before the choice, the casual arrow actually leads from choice to prediction, in the opposite direction of time. The choices you make are what causes the prediction, not the other way around.

Note that I'm only stating my thoughts on how free-will can still exist despite the existence of a perfect predictor, not the question of whether free-will can exist in a deterministic universe (Hint: Yes!).
