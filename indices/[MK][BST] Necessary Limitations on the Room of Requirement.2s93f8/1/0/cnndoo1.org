I notice that you didn't place any sapience restriction, so my first thought was to call on the Four Founders since they have passed through the Room before. (It seems like an AI-in-a-box problem where the Four Founder-AIs can't exist outside of the "box".)

For the following hacks, I assume the Rooms can conjure magical items that normally obey all of the laws of magic as long as they remain in the Room. Any indirect effects that is non-magical in nature will remain when leaving the Room and magical effects will disappear.

Conjure up healing potions or phoenix tears to make the Room into a hospital for near-death patients. Wait until all magical ingredients and magic has left the body of the patient and the patient can simply walk out. No magic potions that has a magical, or temporary, effect on you will be effective outside of the Room. But potions with a permanent non-magical effect will not have its aftereffects disappear.

There is also the opportunity to preform experiments with precious materials. For example, Snape can get as many rare potion ingredients the Room has seen before as he wants, and invent new potions through as many/wasteful experiments as necessary. Then he can walk out with a perfected potion recipe.
