The fact that you can stick things into the storage locker portion of the Room of Requirement, have it transform into some other form (like a bathroom), and then open up the storage locker again seemed to imply that the room had a memory of some sort, and more than that, that it wasn't actually creating all that much from scratch. Here's how I would change the RoR:

1. The Room can only create things that it's encountered before. If the book /Gamp's Antecedents of the Laws of Transfiguration/ had passed through the Room before, then you would be able to find that book on the shelves of the Room's version of a library, but you can't expect the Room to go grabbing outside information. (This means that the Room naturally gets more useful as time goes on.)
2. Nothing that the Room creates can leave the Room. This means that you can't use it as a factory, and even if it can create food, that food won't keep you fed once you leave the Room. (HPMOR transfiguration concerns apply - you would probably want the Room to have limits on what it will create, have it pump in air from outside, etc.)
3. The Room can "remember" old configurations which can be called up at will.
4. There are some limits on how large you can make the Room.

Then you just assume that the Room is mostly composed of a powerful matter creation engine and a requirement judgement engine, and you're pretty much good to go. No, you can't use the Room as a time machine. No, it can't change the physical laws of the universe.

Depending on what you want your universe to be - whether it's canon Harry Potter or whether you just want to steal the concept and have it be a seemingly abandoned room at the University of Montreal - you can enact a few tweaks. The canon RoR has a bunch of tacked on magic powers that allow it to hide from detection and things like that, but I don't think that's central to the concept.

(The obvious hacks to the above model are left as an exercise to the reader.)

Edit: [[/u/eaglejarl]], if you are planning to write a story about the Room of Requirement, I'd suggest that you just take the basic concept and pull it from Harry Potter canon - otherwise there are a ton of Harry Potter related bits of silliness that you need to deal with. Besides that, you get a lot more unique flavor that you can add in, since you can change the setting to be whatever you want. Set the Room in a palace during the Ottoman Empire, or at a corporate office building, and have it be a place of mystery to be explored rather than just another bit of magic tacked onto all the other exploitable bits of magic.
