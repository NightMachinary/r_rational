With regards to food, it is stated that it is impossible to conjure food magically. However it is entirely possible to transfigure something inedible into food, replicate food, and summon food. I don't think the room would have any trouble creating safe edible food for its students.

I'm more interested in whether the room could create sentient life. In the books it seems like its possible. Students regularly transfigure inanimate objects into animals. Plus the weasley car gained sentience after being charmed so that is more evidence. Even mirrors have some rudimentary speakinf skills. Magic makes the creation of nonhuman sentient life trivial. Although I'm doubtful the room can create a post singularity intelligence trivially.
