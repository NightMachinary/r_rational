The vanishing cabinet was in the same instance of the RoR as Ravenclaw's diadem and Snape's textbook. The Room of Hidden Things. I was under the impression that Voldemort told Malfoy about the room of requirement, though Malfoy or even Voldemort may have only known about the Room of Hidden Things. The main flaw in that theory is that would mean that Voldemort told him how to get to the place where his horcrux was.
