I've always been a sucker for lore about the Founders of Hogwarts, and the idea that the RoR was a creation of Helga's to genuinely assist the students who most needed her help, even when she was long gone is fun to me.

So, rules, in no particular order:

1. Gamp's Laws, there are 5, but we only know one for sure (food). We know food can be duplicated, so I'm of the impression that when we say food cannot be created from scratch magically, that food that is created magically isn't nutritious or doesn't give energy, it cannot sustain a person. That is, there is something about food that cannot be created from magic, it possesses some essence that is unique. Taking from that, let's say the five things that magic cannot create a genuine copy of are: Sentience, Love, Food, Precious Metal, and Magic. What does this mean? It means that while sentience can be preserved by magic, it cannot be created de novo. No creating genuine AI with the Room. Love is in and of itself a powerful substantive magical force in Harry Potter, and it's explicitly stated in the series to be impossible to create with magic (perhaps because genuine self giving love has a magic of its own). Food is as covered above. Perhaps there's some interaction between food and the magical force that allows wizards to regain magic, and diminishing returns prevents you from using magic to replenish magic. Precious metals is the one I'm least married to, with a handwave that states the Philosopher's Stone is okay because pure lead is the magical inverse of gold or something. And of course magic cannot create magic. We're not going to allow the RoR to make genuine phoenixes, wands from scratch, or potions that boost magical power, nor can we have the RoR making things from scratch which are magically powerful, like finished potions or artifacts.

2. The RoR may create something without an explicit description, but it has no sentience of its own. It creates as things are envisioned, drawing from the cleverness and inventiveness of the user, as well as the combined intellects of the Four Founders. It cannot, however, create something that the Four Founders together could not figure out how to make.

3. Physical limitations on size (no larger than 100 times than the floor it's on or something), atmosphere control (temperature, air content, gravity all close to Earth limits with some wiggle room), composition of room (always needs at least one circular wall and a ceiling and floor), and local time flow (always 1:1).

4. Nothing created inside by room can be taken out of it.

5. Only one person may request the room at a time, that person must be a student or faculty member of Hogwarts, and that person must genuinely need what they are requesting, as judged by a mental probe as if cast and analyzed by Helga Hufflepuff.

EDIT: Keep in mind that the RoR (and Helga) don't make value judgements. The RoR can and will give something that is harmful, fatal, dangerous, or traitorous, at least existentially (but maybe not physically). Dumbledore needed a place to pee, Harry needed a place to work and train, Malfoy needed a place to betray the school and kill Dumbledore, Marietta needed to find the DA. The only value the RoR assesses is genuine need, expressed in thought.

I think that takes care of all of the obvious munchkinry, leaving room for interesting shenanigans, and represents something that actually has reason to exist and fits fairly well with canon and fanon descriptions of the room.
