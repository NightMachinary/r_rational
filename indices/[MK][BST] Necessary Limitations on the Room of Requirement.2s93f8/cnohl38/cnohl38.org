RoR can only create things you can imagine specifically. I.E. it can only create what you can think of yourself, both consciously and subconsiously. For example, you couldn't get it to make you a faster than light spaceship if you don't know details about how the FTL drive would work. Another important constraint implicit in this is that whatever it creates has to be physically possible (within the laws of physics/magic).

It's the ultimate fabricator, but it can't design things for you.
