I don't think you should be able to ask the Room of Requirement for something you not only can't engineer but /cannot actually specify/. Of course, you could specify, "I need a software-implemented optimization process that minimizes my objectified regret with respect to my objective interests as detailed in Railton's /Moral Realism/" or "I need a piece of software implementing the Coherent Extrapolated Volition of my society". I suppose those are close enough to having a map of your request in your head for the Room to be able to use it without solving your philosophical problems for you.
