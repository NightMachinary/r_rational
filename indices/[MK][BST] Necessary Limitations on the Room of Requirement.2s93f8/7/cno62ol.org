How about:

*1 - Any given Room of the Room of Requirement takes its initial form from roughly sewing together rooms and items which exist /somewhere/ in the planet*. The room thus cannot create anything truly novel or directly implement creativity. Subsequent modifications to a given Room are retained, so you /can/ create novel stuff /within/ the rooms and leave them there, but you can't, say, visualize a unique painting and have it appear in the room unless you've specified the position of every drop of paint. (But you could say "I need to look at art" and you'll probably get a blended version of various art galleries...filled with commonplace paintings which have been duplicated often)

2 - Because the Room tends to sew together stuff it finds in the world, you can't really ask it to duplicate a unique object. There have to be multiple very similar versions of the object in existence before the Room can create that object. So you can make wands, but you can't create The Elder Wand or Harry's particular wand, because it's unique. Similarly, you can't create "Crookshanks" because he's unique, but you can create cats in general. You can get specific books if there are multiple copies of the book in circulation to sew together, but you can't get unique one-of-a-kind books. You can only make philosopher's stone's if there are a bunch of them currently circulating, and so on.

3 - For the same sewing reason, no "Show me my dormitory from college". No "Show me Malfloy's Manor". You can get information in the sense of creating a library, but you can't get information from the room in the sense of spying on the arrangement of furniture in someone's house or figuring out someone's location. You don't get a fine level of control over how things are sewn together, You can specify if you want rooms in an approximate lay-out, but with very limited detail.

4 - The room only gives you what you /need/ and not much more - that is, the room provides a satisficing solution to whatever you think you need, not an optimizing solution. You aren't automatically presented the best possible room from all room molds, just one that works.

5 - The Room of Requirement is "lazy" and tends to re-use Rooms when possible.

6 - No item generated within a Room may be removed from the Room of Requirement. Magical effects from generated items immediately halt upon leaving the room.

(Rules 1, 2, 3 all follow from the same "Sewing" property so obviously that is obviously the most munchkin-blocking. the rest are optional suggestions.)
