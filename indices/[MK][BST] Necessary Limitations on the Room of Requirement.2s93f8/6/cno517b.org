A lot of people seem to be listing things created by the room cannot be taken out of it. What then happens to the air? Either the founders built a large reservoir of air somewhere or people leaving the room suddenly find that their lungs are (mostly) empty of air, all the CO2 in them suddenly becomes very reactive atomic carbon and a whole lot of H2O in their body becomes H2.

Writing this I just realised that maybe the room simply draws air from outside. In any case you have to consider what exactly the room considers "made by the room" and what happens when real and virtual objects are mixed in some way. (As another example, can you mix real aluminium and virtual aluminium which when removed from the room becomes aluminium aerogel?)
