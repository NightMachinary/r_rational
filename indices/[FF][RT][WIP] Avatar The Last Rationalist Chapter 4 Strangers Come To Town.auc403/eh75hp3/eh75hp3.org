He can make /black fire/?

'Jet' is also a synonym for 'black'. So this leaves me wondering if he has some new variant of Firebending we've not seen before. or if the flame is like a little jet engine in his hand.

If the former, it would probably be best to go with 'jet-black blade'. If the latter, probably best to change it to 'jet-like blade'.
