To be honest, it was less "introducing Red Lotus late in the game" and more "making up Red Lotus on the spot late in the game". Foreshadowing is sort of like a literary proof-of-work. It's difficult on the part of the author, and ideally hard to decode for a first time reader, but provides direct, incontrovertible evidence that the story was well thought-out. I'm not willing to accept an author planned something unless they foreshadow it.
