No problem.

Also, nice job including the White and Red Lotus's early. It's nice to see that ancient centuries-spanning secret societies can be foreshadowed or at least mentioned early on in a series where they exist. The original writers did fine with the Whites, but introducing the Reds way later in Korra after so much stuff happened and expecting us to believe they had always been there was just silly.
