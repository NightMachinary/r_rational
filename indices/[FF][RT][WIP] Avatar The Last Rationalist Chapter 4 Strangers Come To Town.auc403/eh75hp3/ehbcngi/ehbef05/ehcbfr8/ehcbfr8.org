Sure, and no need to hurry I guess. Two more in Ch4 (New world, new rules --- does this need a comma?):

#+begin_quote
  Katara, do you know what you wanted to do that ice ball?
#+end_quote

“To do to that ice ball”?

#+begin_quote
  the fact that if the first law of thermodynamics held, they would have both died instantly or this was a universe that gave a middle finger to a fundamental law
#+end_quote

Comma before “or”? and maybe “or that this was”.
