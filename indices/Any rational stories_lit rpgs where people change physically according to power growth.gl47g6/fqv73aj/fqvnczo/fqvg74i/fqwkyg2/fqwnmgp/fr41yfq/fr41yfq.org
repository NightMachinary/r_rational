Nah, there was a reason for that. Spoilers for late in arc 01:

The reason the menus had so many problems (like having missing or incorrect information, not integrating properly with people or integrating with animals instead) was because the menus were initially calibrated for an entirely different species on a another planet. However that species had been wiped out by the titular Homicidal aliens and the menu systems that had been launched already had to be hastily re-calibrated and redirected to Earth remotely which led to a slightly malfunctioning system.

On the one hand, yeah, I like pangolins and liked the ideas of non-human characters coming to grips with this stuff. But I wanted some kind of rationale behind it besides just that. Rule of cool is fun but I think it's more fun if there's some kind of internal logic behind it too.
