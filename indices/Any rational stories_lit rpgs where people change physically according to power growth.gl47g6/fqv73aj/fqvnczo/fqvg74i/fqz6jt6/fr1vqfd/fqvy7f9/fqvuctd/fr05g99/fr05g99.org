The New World has the main character become taller and denser and less biological as he levels up. By the latest chapters he weighs like 500 tons and is about 10 feet tall. It starts off strong imo but slowly tapers off into something barely passable. I'd recommend just reading until you don't enjoy it anymore.

Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends has this. Cultivators get True Bodies, which change their body fundamentally, such as one of the main character's bodies becoming less affected by physics. Other characters become taller and stronger, get tougher skin, more organs, etc. It's very consistent and has proper character development so far.
