Disagree with it being important.

The game powers makes it completely seamless and the MC is indifferent.

MC basically forgets about it, occasionally mentioning:

"Oh, I'm pretty tall now. Weird."

"Why is she flirting with me? Oh yeah, I'm attractive now."

It has little plot relevance, and doesn't impact his decisions in any way.
