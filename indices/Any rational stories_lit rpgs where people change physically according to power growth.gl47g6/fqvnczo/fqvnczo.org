[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters][He Who Fights With Monsters]] your body literally turns into magic as you level up. In addition to the obvious becoming physically stronger and more resistant to damage, you get more attractive and depend more on magic and less on physical things. You don't need to eat, or even breath.

But it is more a side effect rather than the direct method of getting more powerful.
