That's not true. The pangolin undergoes significant changes as does another animal character who actually adopts the idea as a power set. This is in addition to a demon summoning character who allows his body to become more and more corrupted over time and the MC herself commenting on her new body type in the fourth volume and deciding to keep it. It's not a major plot point and was mostly included to display a dramatic shift in what the menu system in-universe can physically do but to say it's never relevant or pops up again isn't accurate.
