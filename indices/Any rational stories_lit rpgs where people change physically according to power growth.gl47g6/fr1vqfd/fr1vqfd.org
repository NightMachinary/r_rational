[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29145/creep][Creep]] has body evolution to an extreme degree, although it isn't LitRPG. It's more of a superhero drama a bit like Worm with transhumanist themes (his powers are like Darwin from X-Men).

Some of the cultivation litrpg type fics have it, but tends to be subtle. For example, [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31837/everybody-here-is-a-cultivation-idiot][Everybody Here is a Cultivation Idiot]] has some aspects of body evolution related to power levels. Written as more of a comedy (although with some dark themes). Gender-bender.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24709/defiance-of-the-fall][Defiance of the Fall]] also a combination of cultivation and LitRPG kind of fits. More serious and better written than EHIACI. The hero seems overly lucky at times, and bodily changes involved in power growth are mostly relatively subtle.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic][The Dao of Magic]] is another cultivation world example, with some of the bodily changes being not-so-subtle. More on the well written side IMO, with more comedy than drama. No specific system, but more organically defined.
