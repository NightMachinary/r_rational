I doubt that's what's going on here. The poor people in the Third Stage get only 8 hours awake at a time (I think? the time's a little unclear), but they aren't having a shorter lifespan. The cocoons appear to be suspended animation technology which explains surviving for 48 hours and allows for a longer life span.
