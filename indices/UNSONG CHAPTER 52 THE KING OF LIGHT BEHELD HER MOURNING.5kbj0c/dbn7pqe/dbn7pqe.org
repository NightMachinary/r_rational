I can see two leading candidates for the identities of the Other King and John (the /Not a Metaphor/'s captain):

1. The Other King is Rabbi Acher, John is the Comet King.
2. The Other King is the Comet King, John is Rabbi Acher.

I'm leaning towards number 2.

I think that the two kings may have voluntarily swapped places, as each had something the other wanted (the Other King was a threat to the Comet King's empire, now a powerful military resource, while the /All Your Heart/ was capable of giving the captain a chance to confront Metatron).

I'm trying to figure out how the Cometspawn would die cursing the Comet King's name, and I figure him assuming the mantle of the Other King would qualify (assuming it isn't precommitment shenanigans or anything).
