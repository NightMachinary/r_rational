Or they're depending on you not having the energy or time to seek out sources for everything they ask. Supplying sources is work, and if you can't supply the sources after your opponent has called for them, it appears to the audience that they've won.

The source itself is frequently unconsidered, as well. Debates I've seen on tumblr between transmedicalists and gender postmodernists had quite a few giant lists of sources on either side, sometimes simply pointing to tumblr posts themselves, and the reason they're trotted out so often is because it is so exhausting to take the time to address.

This (or a very similar concept) has a name, the [[http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop][Gish Gallop]], and it's even worse for sources than for simple arguments because you have to take the time to go through the extensive text of the source, figure out how it supports their argument (or how they believe it does), and address it.
