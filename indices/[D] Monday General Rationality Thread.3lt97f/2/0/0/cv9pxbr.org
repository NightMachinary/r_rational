I get what you're saying. But I'm so lazy :(

Legitimately though, it's annoyingly stressful to have an argument with someone and have to check sources left and right. An argument is a lot like a fight. And checking sources totally screws up your fight's rhythm. Not saying what YOU said is wrong. Just saying it makes things difficult. Argh.
