Have you ever been in a discussion/argument/informal debate and people ask you for your source? A valid question, as how else do you know if I'm not just making this stuff up? But, realistically, it's very rare that you have a source for each and every single thing you've learnt. For example, I know that some villages in Europe burnt kittens for entertainment centuries ago. I don't know where I learnt it, and I also don't know if there were deeper meanings behind it, simply because I learnt this random fact in passing years ago. I know it's a fact. But I can't source it. Does that invalidate my argument? (Let's pretend you're in a situation where you can't just whip our your phone and Google) And if the answer is no, WHEN should it invalidate my argument? I can't be unsourced about everything.

In addition, let's go a little deeper. As a human, how often do you update your beliefs? For example, just the other night, I learnt that the tonsils are little sacs on either side of your uvula. But, when I was a child (~12 years ago), I picked up the mistaken impression that the uvula WAS the tonsils, or contained tonsils. So my friend and I were discussing tonsils a week ago and that's when it hit me. I've seen tonsils (in pictures), I've known there were two, I've known the uvula is a seperate thing. All for years. But when my friend asked me if I knew where tonsils were, I opened my mouth and realized I didn't. Somehow, the belief that the uvula was the tonsils or contained them had persisted, despite how I'd learnt several things over the years that logically disproved such a thing. I found it to be a mildly disconcerting, but amusing realization. That then led me to wonder how many of the facts I know (I've built up what I assume is millions, by now) are dusty and out of date, or founded on beliefs I no longer hold true, or are just plain wrong.

So.....thoughts on either point would be much appreciated.
