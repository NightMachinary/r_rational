Think of it more this way - someone asking for sources is aiming for one of three things.

1) That point is such a strong argument in favor of one side, then if true, the other would feel compelled to change their stance (and thus if you're in a debate with someone, they care about what they're discussing and as such don't want to change their opinion purely on something you said without proof that it's true). In this situation, the timing hasn't been thrown off, because if proven, the debate is over and you "win".

2) They think that disproving that fact will convince you to change your mind on the topic, because you think it is such a strong argument. This is actually the case for many times when I do and when people have done the same to me, because some arguments are simply too central and the entire other side collapses without the existence of that fact. Thus, the timing again isn't interrupted because if disproven, they believe the debate will be over.

3) They don't think it will change either of your minds if shown to be false, but they still think the given fact has enough shock value to short circuit the thoughts of others, and thus feel like they may accomplish something even without getting you to change your mind if they can still disprove that one point. I see this most in political discussions, something like abortion or gay marriage, or any other topics that frequently include people talking past each other and one or both sides invoking more emotional arguments rather than logical ones.
