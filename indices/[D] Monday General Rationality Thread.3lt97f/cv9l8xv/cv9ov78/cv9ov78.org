I ask for sources (and expect people to ask for sources) when the argument rests almost entirely on the fact that's being presented. For example:

#+begin_quote
  Eighty-three members of the supposed Apollo team have come forward and said that the moon landing did not happen.
#+end_quote

If I am arguing with someone over whether the moon landing was real or not, and they come forward with this claim, it becomes the center of the argument that we're having. I immediately have to ask for a source, because if it's true it would probably cause me to update my beliefs. In this case, me asking for a source is a more polite way of saying "bullshit", because I don't believe that this claim is true (partially /because/ it would cause me to update my beliefs so largely).

Same for your claim about kittens. If our argument goes:

#+begin_quote
  You: "Medieval Europe was terrible to animals"

  Me: "I doubt that they were more terrible to animals than we are now"

  You: "Yes they were, it was common for village to tortured animals for entertainment"
#+end_quote

Well ... here we have a problem, because I have no idea whether what you said is true, and there's no way for us to take it further without me knowing whether it's true. If it is true, then I have to update my beliefs. If it's not true, then you need a new argument. And maybe some weaker version of your claim is correct, or perhaps your original source isn't trustworthy. But either way, if I say:

#+begin_quote
  "Do you have a source for that?"
#+end_quote

Then you say:

#+begin_quote
  "No, I just know it"
#+end_quote

Then our argument is dead in the water. We can't possibly move forward until we've established this matter of fact. I frankly don't trust your memory to have gotten the details correct. Maybe you misheard, or misremembered, or someone was just making things up, and I have no way of knowing but it's the crux of your argument. (I don't trust /my own/ memory either, which is why I tend to google things while I'm in the midst of an online argument and then cite my sources as I go.)

So ... it depends. If you're just throwing out a fact, I don't really care. But if you're trying to support or defend some position with a fact I find dubious, I will probably ask you for a source if ten seconds of looking on my own doesn't find one. I expect the same of you when I make a claim.

Edit:

Just as a small anecdote to add to this. I was talking to a very religious co-worker about abortion. Our debate was essentially about how seriously people take the issue, with me being on the side of "generally people who are pro-choice take it fairly seriously". Then he says:

#+begin_quote
  Pepsi puts ground up fetuses in their sodas and no one cares.
#+end_quote

And just like that ... this was what our conversation was about. I was polite enough not to directly say "bullshit" even with the immediate questions this raised in regards to supply lines. So I asked for a source, and he told me to Google it, which I think is a shitty thing to do if your entire argument rests on a single point, but ... I Googled it. Because /if it were true/ I would have to change my mind on the issue. This was a point of data that was so central to our conversation that it couldn't possibly be ignored or talked around. ([[http://www.snopes.com/politics/medical/pepsi.asp][Here's the Snopes article on the subject.]] But that's sort of not the point of the story; the point is that there was no way we could continue without a citation of some kind.)
