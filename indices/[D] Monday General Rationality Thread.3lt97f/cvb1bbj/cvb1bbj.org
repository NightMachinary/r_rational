I remember at one point reading a piece by Eliezer about how for maximum-impact nonfiction writing, you should write the specific example first, and then the theoretical principle, rather than the other order. Searching for it again now, all I can find is this one paranthetical:

#+begin_quote
  (Also, note how this post starts off with a specific example --- an instance of the concrete--abstract writing pattern in which you state the example first and the generalization afterward. This is one of the most common bits of nonfiction writing advice I dispense: "Open with the concrete example, not the abstract explanation!")
#+end_quote

Was there a whole post about this topic at some point?
