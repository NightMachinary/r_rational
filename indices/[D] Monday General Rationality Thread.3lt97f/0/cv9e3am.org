I just recently started reading Terry Pratchett for the first time. I finished /Good Omens/ (which was co-authored with Neil Gaiman), and I'm currently delving into his Discworld Saga starting with /Equal Rites/.

I wouldn't particularly consider his work to be rational fiction (there are more than a few things that happen "just because"), but the more I read from him the more I become convinced that he was a rationalist. It's just the way his characters act, and the way his stories are structured. In his worlds there is just no such thing as a mystery that is better left unsolved.

In any case case, I'm really enjoying his work.

Do you know any other authors like that? Authors that don't particularly write rational fiction, but still have stories that contain a lot of rational problem solving?

Also does anyone have any suggestions about where I should go with Discworld after I finish the Witchworld portion?
