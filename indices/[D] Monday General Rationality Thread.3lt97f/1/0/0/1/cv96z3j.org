According to [[http://www.livescience.com/24071-pterodactyl-pteranodon-flying-dinosaurs.html][this]] the pteranodon weighed about 55lbs and flew with an 18ft wingspan. So, maybe?

Even at your 66lbs you'd probably need a 20ft+ wingspan. Where are you going to put those when you're not flying on an otherwise baseline human?
