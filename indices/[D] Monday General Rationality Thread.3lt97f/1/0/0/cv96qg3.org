  Angel (from X-men) flies with his wings, for example, which is plausible if you assume a certain wingspan, hollow bones, lean musculature, etc.

I'm not so sure about that. Condors are the largest flying bird (according to google),they weigh up to 33 pounds. and their wingspan is around 10 feet long.

Even if you got a human down to 66 pounds (and good luck with that), that's still twice as heavy as the heaviest flying bird.

I'm no physicist, but I'd imagine flapping those things appropriately fast enough to fly would be well in excess of human capacity (/especially/ if they aren't muscular, and have fragile bones).
