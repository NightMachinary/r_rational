That's real life for you.

Superheroes as a genre are almost impossible to make realistic. The convention seems to be that all heroes and villains are MadeOfIron with unnatural healing and toughness even when they don't have any explicit such power. Because the alternative is heroes who die on their first night out or get a crippling leg injury and retire and noone wants to read about that.
