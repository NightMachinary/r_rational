The thing that makes Tony Stark implausible is the lone genius archetype. In real life, breakthroughs come from large groups of smart people working together. Just like how any AI can be improved by running it on a whole bunch of computers at once.

The closest real life example I can think of for a technological genius was Steve Jobs, and his real genius was coming up with products people wanted - he had a company full of people to work out the tech and logistics.
