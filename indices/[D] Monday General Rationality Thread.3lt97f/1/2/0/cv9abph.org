Eh, I'm not sure about that. I'm pretty sure that a head-sized, brain-wattage AI wouldn't have to break the laws of physics to compete with Tony Stark on engineering. The suit is probably another story, but Tony Stark himself is perfectly reasonable yet unquestionably superpowered. There are a similar number of implausibly-good-aim superpowers that would also be covered by that, and the Joker is nominally physically human. Also, Taylor Hebert, albeit with small robots rather than insects.
