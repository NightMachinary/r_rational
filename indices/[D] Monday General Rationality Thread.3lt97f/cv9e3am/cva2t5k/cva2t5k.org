After the Witches books, I'd likely go for the Death books, then the City Watch books, and then the City Development books, and ending with the wizards.

Admittedly, I also rarely start with the witches when suggesting the series, so I'm not certain that order works, but it seems likely the be right in terms of abstract to concrete idea ratios.
