Superpowers that are simple enhancements of things we can already do are fine. Lifting 1 ton, running at 30 m/s, seeing and hearing frequencies that normal humans cannot, accelerated healing factor, that sort of thing. Obviously all of these can be taken too far to be plausible (Superman lifting a building raises certain structural questions), so stay within the bounds of biology.

Some versions of telepathy. Having a two-way radio in your brain doesn't break anything important, and even if you can force people to reveal thoughts or memories that they don't want to it still doesn't crack the universe down the middle.
