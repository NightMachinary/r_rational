Yep, Tony Stark's science and engineering are utterly unbelievable for a human. If he'd only invented repulsors, or only invented the arc reactor, or only invented one of the innumerable things he'd broken ground on, it'd have been nearly believably human. Tony Stark making revolutionary progress in /every/ field he considers is a superpower.

That said, none of that breaks the laws of nature. It is plausible to me that, given the state of modern science+engineering, a near-perfect brain-wattage supercomputer could make revolutionary progress in every field it considers.
