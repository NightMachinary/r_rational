Steve Wozniak is closer to the archetype. He designed the hardware, circuit boards, and OS for the Apple I all by himself.

Tony Stark would make a lot more sense as a lone genius if he were on the forefront of some technological revolution, where there are fertile fields in every directions and innovations happening with every passing week. In situations like that, a single man working alone really /can/ make enormous, revolutionary strides. Isaac Newton would be another really good example; he was Master of the Mint, invented calculus, wrote the book on optics, etc.

The problem with Iron Man is that the fields he's primarily working in are not fresh and green at all; they're well-developed. I can maybe give him a little leeway with the arc reactor and the repulsors, but everything else should have been accomplished by other people ages ago, if it were possible.
