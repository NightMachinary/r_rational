Has anyone come up with a superpower which is both simple to explain and /doesn't/ result in breaking really important aspects of the universe? If you go with flight, you have to explain that the energy comes from your own body, and what control mechanism you use, and whether you can survive low atmospheric pressure. If you can do invisibility, we question whether you can see, whether the fact that you can see means you are detectible, and if you aren't whether this breaks quantum interpretations of photons.
