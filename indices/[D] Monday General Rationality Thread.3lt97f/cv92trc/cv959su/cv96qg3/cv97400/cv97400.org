[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzalcoatlus][Quetzalcoatlus]] might have been around 150 lbs. with a wingspan of 32 feet. Alternately, [[http://www.wired.com/2012/01/humans-with-bird-wings/][check this post]] for some math on wing span vs mass. The biggest difference between the comic books and a plausible reality is that the wings would be /huge/, large enough to make life really problematic.
