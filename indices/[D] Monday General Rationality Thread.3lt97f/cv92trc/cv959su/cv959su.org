A bunch of the crappy superpowers don't have problems with physics. Angel (from X-men) flies with his wings, for example, which is plausible if you assume a certain wingspan, hollow bones, lean musculature, etc. Breathing underwater is similarly something that is plausible for someone to be able to do with a divergent biology. "Invisibility" might just be active camo that works similarly to how an octopus uses their chromatophores to blend in with their surroundings. The implausible part there is usually how the person gets that power, which often contradicts vast swaths of what we know about biology, but it's not physics breaking.
