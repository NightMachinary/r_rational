I was confused too, and here is why:

JS comes from a world where on average there is an asymetry in power between men and women. The women get the short end of the stick, so JS (a man) subconsciously sees women as 'more important to protect'.

HJPEV comes from a world where on average there is an asymetry in power between white people and black people. The black people get the short end of the stick, so HJPEV (a white person) subconsciously sees...white people as 'more important to protect'?

That is where my brain goes 'what?'

I admit that my first uncharitable assumption was that the author was trying to misrepresent what was shown in WtC, and send a weird anti-antisexism message.

I hope it helps.
