  How? Why?

At it's very basic sexism considers a necessary and familiar part of our society inferior and often revolves around "protecting" them by taking their rights away or returning to "traditional" hierarchies. Racism is about considering strangers inferior and excusing either their exclusion or their exploitation post hoc.

Both have elements of both of course, but the weight is often different.
