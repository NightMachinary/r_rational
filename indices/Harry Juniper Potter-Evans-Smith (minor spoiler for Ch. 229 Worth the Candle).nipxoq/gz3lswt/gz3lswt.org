I see what you're trying to do but it doesn't really work. I guess because racism is fundamentally different from misogyny, specifically in a way that's highlighted here.

In the real world, racism that consists of only protecting whites (pretty much THE racism that exists) is racism in favour of whites, white pride or whatever, which is disgusting. So this idea elicits a strong emotional response, at least from me. But somehow, in your parody, this is racism AGAINST whites. It's weird.

Also, I don't remember the original text, but Harry Juniper's actions are definitely being strongly affected by his "racism" here.
