So, here's my read, in the interest of discourse.

I think you're calling attention to the exchange between Juniper and Valencia. By taking the exchange and making it about racism, rather than Joon's misogyny, you're intending to invoke a negative response in the reader (nobody likes racism) and get them to think about why they (presumably) didn't have such a visceral reaction to the exact same discussion when it was about gender instead of race.

My best guess at your deeper point is that we don't take misogyny as seriously as we do racism, or that we give it a pass when the allegory demonstrates we shouldn't.

On a high level, I actually agree with you, if that's your point.

There are two problems with the execution, I think.

The first is that (as another commenter mentioned) the adaptation doesn't really make sense. Interpreting protecting only white people as racism against white people (and thinking black people are stronger) is such a bizarre, rarely-encountered form of racism that it feels strange to read, in a way that detracts from the clarity.

The second is that I think the author of WtC intends for the reader to understand that Juniper is problematic in many ways and has lots of problematic views on gender and sex. The whole arc with Joon's Midwestern views on sex with Amaryllis culminated in "yeah Joon was wrong and being dumb". The parody reads like a criticism of WtC's depiction of the situation -- there's some dissonance since I as a reader think Joon's views are bad/problematic already, and I would only expect this to be written if you thought the author was endorsing Joon's point of view as good/correct.

I also don't think we're supposed to read Val's tearing into the others as her disseminating the objectively correct truth -- it reads like her speedrunning saying the most efficient things to get everyone's tensions settled enough to make it through the rest of the road to Fel Seed.
