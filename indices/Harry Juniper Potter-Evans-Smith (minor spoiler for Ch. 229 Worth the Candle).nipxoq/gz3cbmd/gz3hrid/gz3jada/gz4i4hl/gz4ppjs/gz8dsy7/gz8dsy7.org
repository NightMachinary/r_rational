I love discourse.

#+begin_quote
  Interpreting protecting only white people as racism against white people (and thinking black people are stronger) is such a bizarre, rarely-encountered form of racism that it feels strange to read
#+end_quote

Agreed. It is very bizarre. It left most readers confused.

There are two ways to resolve that confusion. Most of the audience went with the first one:

#+begin_quote
  problems with the execution ... detracts from the clarity.
#+end_quote

in other words:

1. The author of this parody is incompetent.

How can he not realize that making an analogy to some sort of rarely-encountered form of racism would be bizarre and confusing? Could he not come up with something clearer? Was that literally the best analogy he could think of?

I had expected readers to think this. But then I had expected some to keep thinking:

In fact, making an analogy to a more typical (anti-black) form of racism would have been such an obvious move, that the author had to have gone out of his way to make the analogy... somehow... weird. Which sounds less like an accidental mistake and more like an intentional choice. Which leads to the second potential way of resolving the confusion:

2. The strangeness is deliberate and integral to the point.
