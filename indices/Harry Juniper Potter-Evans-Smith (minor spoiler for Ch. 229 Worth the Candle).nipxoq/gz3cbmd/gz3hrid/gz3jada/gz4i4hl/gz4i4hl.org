Juniper himself as well as Valencia (essentially a hyper-intelligent master of psychology) discuss Juniper's problem in canon. Harry and Quirrell do something similar in this parody.

Juniper having /no problem/ is just wildly inconceivable as a notion. If the general consensus of those who read my parody is that the intended message is that the original author thinks that Juniper has /no problem/, then that explains the negative reaction, because then clearly I'm a moron.
