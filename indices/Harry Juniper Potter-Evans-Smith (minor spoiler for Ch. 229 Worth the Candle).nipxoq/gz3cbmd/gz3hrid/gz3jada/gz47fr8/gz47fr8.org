  I had initially thought that the intended message of my little parody would be too obvious, to the point where some people would dislike it precisely because its self-evidence, but it seems that my judgement was wildly wrong.

Then why haven't you clarified it?

Since the comment I'm replying to and quoting from, there's been another comment that also misunderstands your point, and instead of replying to that with an explanation, you posted more hints trying to get people to tease out the intended message, rather than just coming out and expressing the point you're trying to make.

I get that you're trying to express your point in a way that you think is clever. However, you've already acknowledged that you've failed at that, and we all know what [[https://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/06/16/the-failure-state-of-clever][the failure mode of clever]] is.

Edit to add: To be clear, as I don't want my own cleverness to count against me, I'm not calling you an asshole. What I'm saying is that however much better you think your point will be received due to your cleverness (if compared to the same point, plainly spoken), it will be received that much *worse* by people who fail to realize its cleverness. And every time that you try to resort to cleverness rather than clarity to try to explain your point, you're only going to make your problem that much worse.
