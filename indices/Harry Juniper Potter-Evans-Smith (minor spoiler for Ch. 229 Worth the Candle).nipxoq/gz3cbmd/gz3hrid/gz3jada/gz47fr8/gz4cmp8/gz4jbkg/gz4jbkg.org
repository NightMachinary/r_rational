  I expect that dissecting a failure of a story would not be very interesting for the audience.

Do you know how many /Rise of Skywalker/ dissection videos I've watched? To give you an idea, the combined runtime of those videos well exceeds the runtime of the movie itself. And I haven't even watched Episode IX.

  If it turns out that everybody in [[/r/rational][r/rational]] fundamentally disagrees with me on a point that I had thought self-evident... what kind of common ground could we even start from?
#+end_quote

At that point, you'd have to do one of two things. You'd either have to re-evaluate how self-evident your point really is (as any good rationalist should do), or, as most values are derived logically from baser values (e.g. "Pain is, generally speaking, bad!" or "The well-being of the community as a whole is good!") rather than existing at the base level themselves, move to a baser level where your values agree with those of the community and argue that your point satisfies those values better than the community's.

Humans are full of contradictions, and sometimes they don't even realize it; an instance of cognitive dissonance could easily infect an entire community, even one committed to rationality. Especially if it involves a belief commonly held within a culture that the majority of the community belongs to.

  I expect that the same point, plainly spoken, would be an absolute [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer][mind-killer]].

On the one hand, I can see your point, given the community rule of "No discussion of U.S. politics whatsoever." On the other hand, I can't see how you would ever expect the underlying point of your story (which seems to be equating Joon's private, visceral, unthinking sexism of feeling protective towards a group *is not* a member of, with a public, premeditated act by Harry to protect only a specific race that he *is* a member of) to be discussed in such a way that it *didn't* become political once that point was teased out. You seem to be equating thought and action as equally culpable, and I'm going to end my post right here before it turns into a diatribe against the Catholic concept of sin that I was raised to believe in.
