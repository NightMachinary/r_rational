Thank you for thinking and sharing your thoughts.

I had initially thought that the intended message of my little parody would be too obvious, to the point where some people would dislike it precisely because its self-evidence, but it seems that my judgement was wildly wrong.

  i can only see this post making sense from the position that (from a doylist perspective) you're not supposed to think juniper has an actual problem in WtC?

May I ask why you think this? If Reasonable!Dumbledore in this story is explicitly disappointed and "pained" after listening to Juniper!Harry and Valencia!Quirrel's essentially-WtC-canon arguments, how can you come to the conclusion that my message is that Juniper has no problem in WtC?
