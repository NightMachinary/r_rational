Eh, I'd say that what counts as 'victory' depends on your preference system, really. Rationality can't tell you what to prefer, only how to optimize for it.

For example, you implied that the well-being of starving kids in North Korea is important to you. Maybe you felt that you could optimize for it by convincing more people to use more of /their/ time/energy getting food to them.

Maybe you saw a debate about sexism and racism and thought 'Well this looks unimportant enough, let's recruit here!', and then decided that the most efficient and rational way was to throw sophistry and insults at people.

If feeding those kids was your winning condition, my best guess is that no, this thread was probably not a step to /your/ victory.
