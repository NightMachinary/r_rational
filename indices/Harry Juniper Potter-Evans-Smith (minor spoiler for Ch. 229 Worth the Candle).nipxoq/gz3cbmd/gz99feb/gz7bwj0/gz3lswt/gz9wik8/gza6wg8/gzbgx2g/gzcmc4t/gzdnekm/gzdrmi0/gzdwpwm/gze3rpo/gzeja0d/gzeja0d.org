I'd instead call it inadequacy per Yud's book. We'd like to generate and popularize ideas/strategies that make the world better, but the metric that gets selected for is some mix of 'looking/sounding good/Wise/virtuous on the forum' and 'makes me feel good to write'. The theorymaking system is unmoored and unaligned.

Cui bono? Maybe I'm a false flag, hoping to get people more invested in fighting misogyny...?

I took the SSC survey data and cross-referenced it with polls of fantasy readership and the broader rationalist movement. Given those, the funniest-while-still-being-plausible caricature I could generate was the above, so I picked that.
