Exactly. You can infer that I don't really care that much about starving kids in North Korea, or else I'd be taking actions more likely to help them.

In the same way, this thread feels masturbatory with respect to the subjects it's ostensibly about, like talking about sort of stuff is a sort of fetish for the people here. Kind of like right-wingers on twitter who talk about gay people and drag queen storytime non-stop. Nothing wrong with that; it is funny, though. We could /all/ be increasing utility, we could all be saving kids in [wherever], and instead we're here, with our dicks in our hands.

I do take issue with 'insults', though! Who said there was anything wrong with being an autistic, sex-weirdo neckbeard? Those just happen to be the demographics of this particular forum.
