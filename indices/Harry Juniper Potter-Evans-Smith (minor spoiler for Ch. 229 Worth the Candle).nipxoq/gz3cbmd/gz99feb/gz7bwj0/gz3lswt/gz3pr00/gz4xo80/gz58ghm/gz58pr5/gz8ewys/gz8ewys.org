It seems very much like you are trying to (mis)use the language of HPMOR to say something both misguided and abhorrent. If you are not trying to say such a thing, your intended meaning is both hopelessly opaque and hidden under multiple possible abhorrent meanings. If people aren't following that rabbit hole to its seemingly obvious conclusion, it is not because of any cognitive failing on their part, it is because they are offering you some degree of charitability. They are giving you an opportunity to explain yourself rather than jumping to conclusions. If you are saying one of these abhorrent things, you are abusing their charitability, while if you are not saying one of these abhorrent things, you are condescending to people who are attempting to be nice to you.
