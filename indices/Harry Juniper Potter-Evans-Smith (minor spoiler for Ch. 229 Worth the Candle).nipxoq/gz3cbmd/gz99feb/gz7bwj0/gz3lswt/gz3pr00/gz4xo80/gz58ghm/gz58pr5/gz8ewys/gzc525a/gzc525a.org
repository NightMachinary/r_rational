Thank you for your comment. It sounds like many who read the OP but chose not to comment might share your stance, so I'd like to understand it better.

Obviously I don't think my intended meaning is in any way abhorrent, but I realize that that's what someone whose intended meaning /is/ abhorrent would think as well.

So I'd like to ask you to clarify what abhorrent stance you suspect me of. I recognise that you are saying that you are giving me the benefit of the doubt (which I recognise as noble of you), and are not 100% accusing me. Obviously I won't get mad at you for doing me a favour by answering my question, and certainly won't downvote you (as a policy, I did not downvote anyone in this thread).
