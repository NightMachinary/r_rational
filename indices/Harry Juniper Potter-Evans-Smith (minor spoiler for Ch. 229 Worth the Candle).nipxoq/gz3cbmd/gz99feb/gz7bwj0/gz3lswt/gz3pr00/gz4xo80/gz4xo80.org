Hey, I'm sorry but it's 6 AM, I'm on my phone and I'm not really up to writing one or two long comments to discuss and clarify this.

I'll just say: maybe instead of assuming I'm not thinking (and saying it, which is a bit abrasive) and I just don't get what you're saying, make the effort you're asking of others. I certainly could have expressed myself more clearly but maybe there is some idea in my comment that could make sense to you. If you will, and since you seem to like rationalist jargon, steelman what you read instead of strawmanning it.
