I'm going to be honest, man. I think you're getting in the way of getting your point across.

I gave you a direct explanation of the point I got from your work.

You didn't comment on my explanation, but reading between the lines I'm probably not correct about what you intended.

From the comments elsewhere in this thread, clearly what you intended isn't coming across to the readers of this subreddit. It's more likely that this is on the authorial end than on the end of so many independent (though granted like-minded) readers.

Even considering it harder, I don't really see what your intended point is/could be, unless it's something wild like "treating racism as exactly analagous, this argument seems crazy; this isn't how racism looks. Therefore, Val's argument was crazy, this isn't how misogyny looks. Therefore Joon wasn't actually misogynist."

(That's unlikely, of course, since your Dumbledore is disappointed and thinks your Harry is racist.)

I don't think you're a moron or incompetent, I just think you executed this poorly if your goal was reader comprehension. There's a distinction there that I think is pretty important.

You're apparently unwilling to comment on what the point of the story is, in spite of all this.

I would urge you to reconsider -- right now we've got a story that's confusing readers. Discussing your intent and how it might be possible to execute better will lead to better reader comprehension and gives you the opportunity to potentially improve as a writer.
