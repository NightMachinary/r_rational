I got myself in a lose-lose situation through careless commenting (my fault).

There are three main points:

1. The OP has a message (some would disagree).\\
2. The OP reasonably effectively conveys that message (many would disagree).\\
3. The overwhelming majority of the audience cannot pinpoint the message, or misunderstands the message (evident).

#+begin_quote
  I thought the OP was fine
#+end_quote

If you grant me points 1 and 2 (even just as hypotheticals), and 3 is evident, then you see how I'm in a bind?

If I say that the message of the parody is obvious when it is not obvious to the audience, then that would unfortunately imply considering them stupid (a horrible move).

If I say that the message of the parody is a highly controversial and unspeakable new political idea, and that is why it is not obvious to the audience, then that would unfortunately imply considering myself exceptional (a horrible move).

There is no good move I can make at this point, except to consider my whole post a failure (which is what I'm doing).
