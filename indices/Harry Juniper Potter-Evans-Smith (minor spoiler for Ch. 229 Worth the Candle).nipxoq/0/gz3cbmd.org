i feel like this is trying to satirize juniper's misogyny but it's mostly just doing so by reframing it as racism and changing the setting to kinda-hpmor for some reason, without actually changing the content, which just sorta makes it confusing? i can only see this post making sense from the position that (from a doylist perspective) you're not supposed to think juniper has an actual problem in WtC?
