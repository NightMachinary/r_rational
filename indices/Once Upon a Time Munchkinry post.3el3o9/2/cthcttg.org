There's ... /really/ no "you can't wish for more wishes" on that list? Can't you just wish to have all of the genie lamps? That's so broken it isn't even hilarious, just kind of disappointing.

From a /slightly/ more narratively satisfying angle - I've only seen the first season, so I'll take it from there - Emma pretty much starts out with enough evidence to prove the whole "storybook magic" hing is real, and she has said storybook. So a rational character would automatically start out as one of four or so people in the town who know magic exists after the first episode had passed.

I don't actually know as much about the setting as Emma would, in that situation, but I'd be inclined to just talk it out with "Mr Gold" and, once I had some magical defences, Regina. I've honestly got no problem with maintaining the spell, at least in the short run - heck, it's arguable whether you'd be basically killing off spell-created people acting as soul jars for the originals, and they'd be /less/ well-equipped to deal with the world as it is now.

(Specifically, I got the impression Rumpelstiltskin doesn't really /need/ that Dagger anymore, he seems like a jack-of-all-trades these days; so I'd probably ask for that in exchange for my ability to exploit magical powers in ways that aren't bound by idiotic storybook logic. He already knows my real name, so he'd have a guarantee. As you mention, magic in his setting is insane, so once I have it I shouldn't have much trouble.)
