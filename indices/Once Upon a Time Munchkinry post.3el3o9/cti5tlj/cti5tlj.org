One thing they often say in the show is that all magic has a price. Which means that most attempts to munchkin it will fail; the answer to "why can't I use the magic to do X" is that the price will be really bad.

Of course, you can still munchkin the "magic has a price" rule itself. After all, things that benefit you may harm other people and vice versa. Whether something is a "price" or a "benefit" and whether it is large or small is purely arbitrary. (If you can cast a spell to make your army win a battle, and the price that they all die when the battle is over, could an enemy spy, who actually wants the army to die, cast the same spell? After all, to him, the roles of price and benefit are reversed, so for him, the benefit exceeds the price.)
