I can see that comparison. Dylan always seems to be playing to a larger audience, though --- maybe /the largest/ audience, the universe itself --- whereas Jack doesn't seem to really need an audience other than his victim.

There's also a bit of Regent in the way Dylan can gleefully show off his control of a situation. (Think Regent and Shatterbird, for instance.)
