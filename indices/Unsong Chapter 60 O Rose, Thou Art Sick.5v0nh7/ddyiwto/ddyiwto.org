Can I just take a moment to say that I really, /really/ love Scott's writing style? I mean, look at this:

  Anyone who gave their real name in a business like this was either a fool, or else so arrogant as to defy belief.

  “And I'm Dylan Alvarez.

  Not that he didn't know. Head as smooth as an apple, frame that looked like she could stand to gain forty pounds or so, desperate look in her eyes. And here she was, seeking illicit magical help. Cancer, that was what it was. He could see it from a mile away.

  “I want you to teach me to summon demons.”

  She looked familiar. Alvarez squinted. If she had a little more flesh on her bones, a bit more hair, then...he still wouldn't be able to place her. Damn.

  He took a copy of the /Greater Key Of Solomon/ off his shelf. Then a few other grimoires. The /Goetia/. /The Sacred Magic of Abramelin The Mage/. /The Antichrist's Cookbook/. None were relevant to the issue at hand, but he was a ritualist; he played to an audience. Opening a grimoire was a way of saying hey, I'm serious about this demonology thing.

This is /gold/, man.

*EDIT:* Also, I just realized who Dylan reminds me of so much--Jack Slash, from /Worm/. The same charisma, the same amorality, the same flair for the theatrical (though in Dylan's case that last part is actually necessary to his line of work). I'm not sure what it says about me that I enjoy reading characters like that so much.
