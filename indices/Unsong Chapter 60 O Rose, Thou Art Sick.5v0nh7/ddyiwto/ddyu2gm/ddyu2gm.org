  Also, I just realized who Dylan reminds me of so much--Jack Slash, from Worm. The same charisma, the same amorality, the same flair for the theatrical.

Many commenters have already worked out that Dylan is the subject of the "Satan" verse in American Pie, eg "as I watched him on the stage my hands were clenched in fists of rage". That means that he has to do all the other things mentioned in that verse.

So, if Dylan is kabbalistically equivalent to Jack, then - Jack Slash sat on a candlestick, 'cause fire is the Devil's only friend.
