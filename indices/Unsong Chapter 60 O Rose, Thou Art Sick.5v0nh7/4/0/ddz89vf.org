In not-a-coincidence, the "Comet King visits Hell" arc is entirely pretty recent and thus easy to check

This chapter - September 3, 1999 (New Mexico)\\
[[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-56-agony-in-the-garden/][Robin talks to TCK]] - August 1, 1999\\
[[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-55-none-can-visit-his-regions/][TCK visits Hell]] - July 1999

In the other direction, I searched [[https://www.reddit.com/r/unsong/comments/5v47k4/pdfs_unsong_so_far_and_the_study_of_anglophysics/][a PDF copy]] for Never Summer and found the date for that - July 2001, [[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-30-over-the-dark-deserts/][in chapter 30]]

  In March 2001, the necromancer seized control of Vegas in a spectacular coup. [...] The Comet King, still brokenhearted, at first refused to leave his mourning chamber. But when his children begged and cajoled him, he rose from his bed, gathered his armies, and took up the great sword Sigh for the last time. He marched west. The Other King and his undead legions marched east. On July 29 they met in the Never Summer Mountains near Fort Collins[.]
