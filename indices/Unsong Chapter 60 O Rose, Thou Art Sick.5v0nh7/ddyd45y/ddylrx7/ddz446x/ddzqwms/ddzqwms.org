"Malia" means "bad", but is also a Hawaiian variant of the name "Mary" (note that this chapter is set in /Magdalena/ - in the madonna/whore duality, Magdalene is the /bad/ Mary - but note as well that both Virgin and Magdalene are good figures), "Ngo" is either non-government organization or a Vietnamese pop album by artist Quang Ha - in Vietnamese, "Ngo" means "look". We might thus take her name to mean "Behold the evil one!", or perhaps "A whore for an NGO."

Malia Ngo is an anagram of "Magnolia", which ultimately derives from "magnus", meaning "great". It gets there via Pierra Magnol, the French botanist most famous for setting the categorization of plants still in use today. In 1720, he published in one paper a pair of treatises that each focused on two divisions of plants, a duality that echoes God's two major plants in the Garden; life and knowledge. The magnolia plant symbolizes feminine beauty and is believed to be medicinal in Asian cultures (which, per Ngo, are assuredly relevant). Note that "shrub" is one of the categories Magnol used - and that the rose plant is also a shrub. "Oh rose, you are sick"? Or perhaps "Oh magnolia, you are sick"?

Factor in the name "Lola Rivers" as well - Lola is short for "Dolores", meaning sad, and "Rivers" is kabbalistically equivalent to "Reverse" (see chapter 3, among others) - thus we may understand her fake name to be "Reverse sadness", but nominative determinism suggests this to be a poor name to choose indeed - if Malia is Lola is Robin, then we may understand this pseudonym to be a foretelling: Robin is attempting to reverse the course of heaven and earth - and her own husband - to end suffering and the sorrow it brings, but in doing so has reversed her own moral arc and is set on a path of despair. However, this reversal may allow Malia Ngo's name to be inverted as well, which would produce something like "do not see goodness", a useful warning when none may look on the face of God and live.

We only have the question of Dylan. If he enabled this horrific set of events, then the fact that he's aiming to take down Malia now may be why the universe is letting him count as a good guy: his moral arc is towards mitigating the damage of his greatest mistake. However, it may also be setting him up as a fall guy (which is appropriate - note his similarity to Herod and other villains in killing all of his enemies /except one/, and the hubris in then taking this person into his own ranks) and the slaying of Malia Ngo may be a terrible mistake, an evil only allowed to happen because Dylan refuses to doubt himself.

Thus, we can conclude that Malia Ngo summoned Thamiel, became tainted and radiates evil, but is nonetheless a force for goodness and her impending assassination may be part of the cause of the apocalypse, or we can conclude that Malia Ngo summoned Thamiel, became "sick" and surrendered to evil, and that her impending assassination is one of the ways that justice will be done through the end of the world.
