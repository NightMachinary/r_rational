A brief history of Korridor shamelessly ripped from this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dvlxwu/what_happened_to_game_by_god_and_monsters_and/][comment]]:

- /Game By God/ was about a web serial writer who competes in a /Danganronpa/-style murder-mystery elimination game. It was put on hiatus a couple of chapters into its third arc because the author thought it was too ambitious
- /Ship Poster/ was about a virtuoso violinist hired to play for a luxury cruise ship that rich people go on to live out their final days. About two-dozen chapters were released in total before the story was also put on hiatus for reasons I won't repeat here (they were given in a blog post titled "You Fooled Me Once")
- /Serial Infringement/ had a really cool twist on a superhero premise, but only one chapter was released before the site (and the author's various accounts) went offline

They have nothing in common with /Chili and the Chocolate Factory/ other than meta-themes like when in chapter 6 where they talk about the nature of stories and audience expectations (remember the bit about marbles?).

All of the stories were pretty good on a chapter to chapter basis, but none of them have proper endings. They were well-written enough to the point that I'm still glad to have read them even with the abrupt endings. But your mileage may vary.
