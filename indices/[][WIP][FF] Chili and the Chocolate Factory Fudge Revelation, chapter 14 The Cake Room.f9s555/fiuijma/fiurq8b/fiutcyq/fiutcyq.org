It's mainly because chapter 6 was a fake-out with everyone thinking the story was finished and done. It even had "Status: Complete" on the fanfiction website, until the seventh chapter was posted.

I'm just wary of the hiatus notice being the same thing where the next chapter ends up being posted a week or two later pleasantly surprising people.
