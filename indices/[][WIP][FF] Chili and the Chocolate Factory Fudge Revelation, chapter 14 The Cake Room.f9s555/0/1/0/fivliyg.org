[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment][Here's the link to the Wikipedia page]], but in a nutshell, the experiment was an attempt to measure self-control and delayed gratification in different circumstances for children aged 3-5.

They had hypotheses about how different activities would affect ability to delay gratification. They gave the kids a choice: one marshmallow now, or wait fifteen minutes and get two. They did followup studies on the kids later in their lives and found better life outcomes for the kids who managed to patiently wait.

Subsequent studies found that socioeconomic status explains a lot of this. So, Chili eating the marshmallow both reflects his background of abject poverty as well as predicting bad life outcomes for him.
