The vape room explicitly did not go where I expected. As Chili says, she has spoken multiple complete sentences before! Perhaps her zen-like brain-damaged state will mean Mahuika is the true winner. Except she vapes so probably not.

I love the reference to the [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment][Stanford Marshmallow Experiment]].

But what happens now that the title character has been eliminated? HAS the title character been eliminated? You couldn't do something like change the name of an ongoing story. Who would do something like /that/? Maybe somebody litigating a grudge. Some kind of grudge litigation.

We'll find out in a long time I guess! Thank you for this story so far, Gazemaize. It's been a highlight of every day there's been a chapter. It's the new weird thing I try to get my friends to read with no context. It's a love letter to Dahl but the writing style is also all you in the best way. Take your time and take good care of yourself.
