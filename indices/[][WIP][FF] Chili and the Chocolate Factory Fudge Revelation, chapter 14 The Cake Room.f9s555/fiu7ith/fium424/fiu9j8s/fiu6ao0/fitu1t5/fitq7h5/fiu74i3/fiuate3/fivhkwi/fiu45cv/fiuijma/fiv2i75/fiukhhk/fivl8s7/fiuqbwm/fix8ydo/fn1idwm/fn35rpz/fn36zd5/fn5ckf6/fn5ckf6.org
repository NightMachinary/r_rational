Ahh. Before Gloop falls (though in the first movie is pushed?) in, 'Oh, no! Please, Augustus, please! I beg of you not to do that. My chocolate must be untouched by human hands!'. Once Gloop is in the chocolate, Wonka doesn't say a word until he goes up the pipe--even when told that Gloop cannot swim--and then afterwards laughs, teases the parents about Gloop not being turned into marshmallows because the pipe goes to the Fudge room, and then assures them that he is perfectly safe.
