Since it seems like you're making a big life change here and this is, after all, the rational subreddit, I feel obligated to suggest you remember to take a rational perspective towards this intervention.

Make sure you keep careful account of whether it's actually working and how effective it is. I've seen a lot of people make certain life interventions for a variety of different reasons, and they're all usually pretty hyped on the momentum of it at first and very satisfied with their decision, but after that inevitably wears off, two common failure modes present themselves:

1. They couldn't stick with the change for discipline reasons
2. They do stick with it, but it didn't actually turn out to be better than what they were doing before

Your scenario seems unlikely to fall into case #1, but try to carefully track whether #2 ends up being the case once you get past the honeymoon period. The main reason I bring this up is because I've almost never seen someone end up happier after giving up one of their passions for something "more important". Sometimes it's necessary, such as dealing with mental health issues or freeing up time to spend with your family or because of changes in your employment situation, etc. But the resulting decrease in life satisfaction from giving up a passion is something that's hard to predict, let alone quantify, before you actually do it. Sometimes it's worth it to cut other areas of your life in order to make sure that you can continue with your passion, even if it's in a diminished form.

What does this mean in practice? I'd recommend keeping a quick and easy log of your daily happiness and satisfaction with your life. Maybe just a 1-10 score and a quick pros/cons list. Shouldn't take more than 5 minutes a day. Ideally you would have started /before/ this change so you'd have something to compare with, but it can still be helpful for analyzing the change rationally once your honeymoon period wears off.

If it turns out that you're not actually happier with the change you made once a few months pass and this is supported by the data in your log, then make another change to fix it, whether that's undoing the previous intervention or making adjustments to it to fix any problems that the previous change introduced.

Hope this was helpful.
