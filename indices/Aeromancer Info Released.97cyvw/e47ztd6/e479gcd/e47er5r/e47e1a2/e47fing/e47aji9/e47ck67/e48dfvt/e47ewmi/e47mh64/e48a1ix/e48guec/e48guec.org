I'm from a Slavic background (Russian/Ukrainian) and was born there and moved to the USA when I was young. When I say "church camp", I'm using a term that most Americans should be familiar with, despite the Slavic version of it being entirely different.

While American churches tend to have ages 11-17 be the recipients of church camp, Slavic churches tend to be 17-30 and involve multiple churches from several states - more like a conference but with cabins and all that. Having a Slavic culture brings unity when it isn't readily shared with the outside world, loosely similar to the Families situation in Aeromancer, but heavily similar in the sense that people are judged based on their state location or their last name lol. Fun Fact: the MI boys made a homemade bomb and let it off on the campgrounds. It was loud. But no one was surprised it was them that did it.

This conference basically had several speakers and a lot of hanging out. No one asked for money or really anything for that matter. What stuck out to me the most was a simple phrase:

  "You don't have to give anything to God /except/ what He asks for."
#+end_quote

They don't tell you what's requested. Is money a big deal to someone? Maybe God will ask for that. Is someone placing their job or school above all else? Maybe God will ask for that. A boyfriend/girlfriend? The desired thing doesn't have to be bad. It's similar to God asking the rich young ruler to sell everything he owned and give it to the poor. Do all Christians have to do that? Nope. Did the ruler have to? Yup.

Since Christianity is based on a personal relationship with God who speaks with each individual, God's responses tend to be tailored to that individual.
