Congratulations on making a tough decision! I am impressed that you have identified your values and have chosen to pursue them in spite of temptations otherwise. Most of the people on this sub (myself included) have a completely different set of values and a lot of people are insensitive to your beliefs (I'm so sorry you had to deal with some of the comments you've received). Thank you for sharing a slice of your imagination, and indeed a slice of your history if we follow the development of your story to your younger years. A lot of people have said this, but I want to say this myself: we all appreciate that you have taken the time out of your life to create something we enjoy!
