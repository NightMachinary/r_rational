Thank you for sharing past experiences to close the gap between our priors. I agree that I am sheltered and it makes it easier for me to think well of people since I have never experienced that fear for myself. It's definitely easier to interact with people over the internet. My comment about talking to someone with homicidal tendencies is likely also affected by my feeling of security.

I think it would help if I said respect =/= truth. I don't think I should respect the /belief/ per se, but the /fact that the person holds the belief/. That is to say: if they are wrong and I can't change that, then so be it, but I would tell them and others not to do that thing because it's still wrong. It means I cannot force the person to bow to my aesthetics except when it breaks an agreement they made (e.g law) and preferably to stop them inflicting harm on others. In that scenario you described where everyone applauded, I can see how it is quite distasteful. I am curious: Suppose everyone in that hall disagreed but clapped out of politeness, and nobody thought for a second that beating children is ok. Would that scenario be better than your memory of it?

I am noticing that I am getting a different feel from someone identifying as the KKK than identifying as a Christian. I completely agree with you that someone claiming to be KKK is a strong fact about them, whereas in my mind it appears that being a Christian is not (for me) a defining trait. I can guess that it's to do with the culture of it, or my knowledge about it, but this is idle speculation not correlated with my actual mental state. I just don't know why.

Shaming a group into isolation reminds me too much of echo chambers and cultish behaviours. A cult is strengthened by keeping only like-minded people, a not-cult benefits from diversity and any large group that is made for only like-minded people devolves into an echo chamber. Consult [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_to_Actually_Change_Your_Mind#J._Death_Spirals_and_the_Cult_Attractor][the sequences]] for the rest of this train of thought. Perhaps that's where my discomfort with shaming comes from.
