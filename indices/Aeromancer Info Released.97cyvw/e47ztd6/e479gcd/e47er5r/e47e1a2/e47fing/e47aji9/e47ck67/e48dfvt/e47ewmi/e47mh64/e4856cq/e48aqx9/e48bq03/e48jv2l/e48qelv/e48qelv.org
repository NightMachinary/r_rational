  I have a potential source for our disagreement, but correct me if I'm mistaken. You and probably many of the commenters from yesterday have an issue with the ideas that Gelifyal represents, whereas my opinions on him are based only on his words and actions as an individual.

Identifying with a position is an action. If I call myself a Nazi I don't have to do anything other than that. By calling myself something, by stating that I identify with it, I am giving an identity support and validating it.

  Murder is prohibited by their God and Christians aren't in it just to go to Heaven. I could explain more of their reasoning, but you'd think I was just preaching to you, so suffice to say there are reasons you don't know about and murdering children does not help them. I have no knowledge to make comment about homosexuality.
#+end_quote

I was raised Christian and while I'm aware they aren't in it just to go to Heaven it doesn't justify how in my, or in my opinion any decent, morality system if by action or inaction you allowed someone to be eternally tortured it suggests to me an obscene lack of empathy bordering on psychopathy. I recognise that Christians think that their partners and children deserve eternal torture if God decides such. Beyond that most Christians haven't even considered it which is absurd to me since you'd think optimisation of morality would be the first thing people think about when given scales as sheer as heaven and hell. I'm happy to acknowledge I'm biased against Christians (and religious people) based on my experience.

  I do not think this is a useful path to go down though; from a utilitarian standpoint, giving respect takes only self control and goes a long way in earning the respect of others, something essential to spreading rationality in a good light.
#+end_quote

From a utilitarian standpoint encouraging people to see beyond the attitude of a comment and going for the meat of it is much more important to me. I think that stripping emotion from human discussion is an impossible endeavour, especially since you will lose versus someone who is using emotional arguments (why would we give up one of the best methods of spreading ideas), whereas teaching someone to ignore vitriol is a much more practical benefit and should be standard for anyone seeking to achieve rationality. Besides which the practical benefit of shaming a group into isolation which I think is a more relevant (since no one was arguing with him with content hidden in insults, they were just insulting).

  I did notice the group-focus of these comments, and made me consider: I wouldn't think of acting antagonistic to an individual because of something another person in their group said or did (unless of course, they are implicated).
#+end_quote

I think this is crazy. If someone walks up to me and says they identify with a group that I know that say, murders, people like me. I would not wait for them to perform an action, their identification is action enough. I don't want to make an assumption but my guess is that your comment has to come from a particularly privileged position where you've never interacted with a group that has targeted you. If a KKK member knocks on your door it might be easy for you to deal with them perfectly normally, but for those hunted by the KKK they might reasonably not open the door.

  Let's be real, if Gelifyal hadn't said anything about his belief, nobody on this sub would've thought of it at all. As an individual he doesn't appear to embody any of the hazardous traits that we worry about (eg. he is willing to think critically of his beliefs).\\
  And I realise that I kind of assumed Gelifyal to be a guy, so if I'm wrong then oops.
#+end_quote

I haven't read the story, nor seen any of their comments, I just clicked in the thread and saw your comment. The respect beliefs because they are beliefs is something I've seen a lot and have particular distaste for. In one situation a large group of university students applauded when someone (from another culture) spoke about how they beat their children, and I was in shock that people would normalise something that has no scientific justification (and might be immoral even if it did) in the slightest.
