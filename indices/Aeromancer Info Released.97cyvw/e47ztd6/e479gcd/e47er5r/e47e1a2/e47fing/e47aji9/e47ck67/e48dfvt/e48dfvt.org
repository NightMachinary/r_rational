sad to see you go, but from your clear lucidity and good humor about the backlash you have faced for this specific choice, I feel much better about your safety. cults are no joke, and significant/sudden bursts of faith are often indistinguishable from them.

I hope everything goes well for you regarding this (still quite surprising) choice, and thank you for revealing what you had planned in order to assist anyone who may want to continue where you left off.
