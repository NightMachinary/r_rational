  What I was focusing on: ridiculing the position of others means that you are arguing with them, it means you want to change the state of their beliefs

No man is an island, and no argument is heard in isolation. I completely agree that aggro is not the best response for convincing the person you're talking to, but I do think creating a dismissive attitude towards a group rather than a "these people's opinions are as meaningful as other people's" minimises the memetic potential of that group.

  None of the Christians I know actually hate any homosexuals, and they are certainly not crazy enough to want to stone.

This is part of my problem, moderates allow the existence of extremists. Once you've accepted that being Christian is acceptable then the approach of stoning people seems reasonable if not rationale, this is even more true in Islam where the holy book is the literal word of God. If you took a rational approach to believing the Bible is the word of God then stoning people seems quite reasonable.

  Of course that would be not-ok!
#+end_quote

But would you respect that belief?

#+begin_quote
  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think you have either.
#+end_quote

Agreed, I only know I'm opposed to the idea that any belief is entitled to respect or a platform just for existing.
