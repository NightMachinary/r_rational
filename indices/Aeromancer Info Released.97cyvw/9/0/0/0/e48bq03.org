  It was to my understanding that Gelifyal's beliefs (Christianity) don't demonise or marginalise rationality or any common culture of our group.

Well nothing that holds across our entire group apart from the anti-empiricism that comes with making non-falsifiable claims.

I was more talking about the attitude of his book to individuals which [[/r/rational]] community has no issue with, like homosexuality, or their lack of willingness to murder infants when murdering children means they get infinite bliss and not murdering means they have a chance of being infinitely tortured.

  It's like the commenter assumes they know exactly what's going wrong, and that their opinion of OP's decision is just /shake your head and smile sadly, this one is lost to us forever/. They stopped treating him as a thinking human and immediately started modelling him one level below them. This isn't useful, this isn't rational and this isn't smart. And yet almost every comment acted like this.

Sure I don't agree with that comment. People willingly sign up to nazisim, the KKK, or WBC and to take away their moral responsibility for their actions isn't valuable.

  I'm using 'sensitive' to describe a way of talking kindly and with respect whether you agree with them or not.

Respect is earned not given freely. I don't have an issue with people being dismissive or even antagonistic to groups that have often do the same.

  It doesn't hinder rational thought at all and it makes it easier to communicate since people don't get offended and don't need to act defensively.

I agree with this in principle, a marketplace of free ideas should result in the best ideas coming to the surface. In reality tolerance of ideas leads to their acceptance regardless of their merit. I think that ridicule can limit the attraction of positions to many people, of course what is ridiculed has nothing to do with what is right too, see for example the ridicule of socialism in the USA during the red scare, but it worked.
