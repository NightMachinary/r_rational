I don't have enough time to give the response the attention it deserves, we got a lot more in depth than I was intending from my comment.

  I am curious: Suppose everyone in that hall disagreed but clapped out of politeness, and nobody thought for a second that beating children is ok. Would that scenario be better than your memory of it?

I suppose technically, my problem with applause is that it moves people on the fence to thinking these things are ok and valuing their positions as if they are equivalent or just as justifiable as the other one. However the reaction would also have to not impact the person who is speaking.

  I am noticing that I am getting a different feel from someone identifying as the KKK than identifying as a Christian. I completely agree with you that someone claiming to be KKK is a strong fact about them, whereas in my mind it appears that being a Christian is not (for me) a defining trait. I can guess that it's to do with the culture of it, or my knowledge about it, but this is idle speculation not correlated with my actual mental state. I just don't know why.

Yeah that's why I think statements you made that are generalised to be acceptable of all opinions aren't accepted by even those saying them, and really people just draw the lines in different places.

  Shaming a group into isolation reminds me too much of echo chambers and cultish behaviours. A cult is strengthened by keeping only like-minded people, a not-cult benefits from diversity and any large group that is made for only like-minded people devolves into an echo chamber

I am cognisant of this, but I'd prefer a world where climate change deniers are part of fringe cults than ones where respecting everyone's opinion allows them to broadcast on the BBC.
