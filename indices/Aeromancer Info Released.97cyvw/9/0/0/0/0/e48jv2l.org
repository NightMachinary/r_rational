I have a potential source for our disagreement, but correct me if I'm mistaken. You and probably many of the commenters from yesterday have an issue with the ideas that Gelifyal represents, whereas my opinions on him are based only on his words and actions as an individual.

  I was more talking about the attitude of his book to individuals which [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational][/r/rational]] community has no issue with, like homosexuality, or their lack of willingness to murder infants when murdering children means they get infinite bliss and not murdering means they have a chance of being infinitely tortured.

By 'his book' I assume you are talking about the Bible. I understand your opinion and I see how this translates to the points you make. I simply accept that I do not know enough about Christianity to make an accurate or useful judgement. I do not mean to strawman you by picking out arguments, but I feel inclined to respond to your comment: Murder is prohibited by their God and Christians aren't in it /just/ to go to Heaven. I could explain more of their reasoning, but you'd think I was just preaching to you, so suffice to say /there are reasons you don't know about/ and /murdering children does not help them/. I have no knowledge to make comment about homosexuality.

  Respect is earned not given freely. I don't have an issue with people being dismissive or even antagonistic to groups that have often do the same.

I realise now that this is a matter of personal preference and I was wrong to require others to reciprocate my views. I do not think this is a useful path to go down though; from a utilitarian standpoint, giving respect takes only self control and goes a long way in earning the respect of others, something essential to spreading rationality in a good light.

I did notice the group-focus of these comments, and made me consider: I wouldn't think of acting antagonistic to an individual because of something another person in their group said or did (unless of course, they are implicated). Let's be real, if Gelifyal hadn't said anything about his belief, nobody on this sub would've thought of it at all. As an individual he doesn't appear to embody any of the hazardous traits that we worry about (eg. he is willing to think critically of his beliefs).

And I realise that I kind of assumed Gelifyal to be a guy, so if I'm wrong then oops.
