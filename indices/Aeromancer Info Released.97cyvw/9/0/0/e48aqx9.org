I think we are working off different sets of information. It was to my understanding that Gelifyal's beliefs (Christianity) don't demonise or marginalise rationality or any common culture of our group. I found many of the comments on the other post on this sub and on royalroad to be insensitive in that they were completely ignorant, yet rather assertive. I want to say that I won't pick on examples but what the heck, I'm totally going to pick on examples.

  I hope he escapes whatever cult brainwashed him, and does so before they ruin his life too thoroughly.

It's like the commenter assumes they know exactly what's going wrong, and that their opinion of OP's decision is just *shake your head and smile sadly, this one is lost to us forever*. They stopped treating him as a thinking human and immediately started modelling him one level below them. This isn't useful, this isn't rational and this isn't smart. And yet almost every comment acted like this.

I'm using 'sensitive' to describe a way of talking kindly and with respect whether you agree with them or not. It doesn't hinder rational thought at all and it makes it easier to communicate since people don't get offended and don't need to act defensively.\\
If i'm missing some information though, I'd like to know your opinions and why you felt the way you did. I appreciate your willingness to broach the subject.
