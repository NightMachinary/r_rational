The etiquette is perfectly rational. It's there so we can keep having good stories.

You're free to think religion is wrong. That's not rude. Nor is it rude to criticize religion in forums about religion. Or in a debate with someone who wants to debate religion. The problem is when people treat the submission of a good story as an invitation to critique the author's personal life.

Increase the price of writing and we'll get fewer stories.
