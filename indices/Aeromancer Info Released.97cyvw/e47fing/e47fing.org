Some of you might remember me from yesterday where I shared [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/972fh9/aeromancer_update/e45buvl][copies]] of Aeromancer in various formats.

Well...I made all new copies that include chapters 15 to 18 and the plotline notes as a 19th chapter. Making all of the formatting consistent from chapter to chapter was so problematic that I even uploaded the four chapters to FictionPress just to make sure that I had the right font! Don't worry I deleted the story afterwards, so there's no plagiarism.
