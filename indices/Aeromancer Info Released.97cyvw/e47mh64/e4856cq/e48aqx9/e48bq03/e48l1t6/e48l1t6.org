  Sure I don't agree with that comment. People willingly sign up to nazisim, the KKK, or WBC and to take away their moral responsibility for their actions isn't valuable.

I'm sorry I don't understand what you are saying. If you think it's relevant, help me out and spell out the point a bit.

  In reality tolerance of ideas leads to their acceptance regardless of their merit. I think that ridicule can limit the attraction of positions to many people, of course what is ridiculed has nothing to do with what is right too, see for example the ridicule of socialism in the USA during the red scare, but it worked.

My understanding of rationality is a distrust of myself to be right all the time and thus taking measures to ensure that I am wrong as little as possible. Ridiculing an opponent position is a good thing if I assume my position to be correct and thus I must do all in my power to ensure that the mistruths of the opponent are stopped. I don't trust myself to be 100% right, and so we argue, and the idea which gains followers shows its worth in being followed. I take that with a grain of salt given that.. ahem *trump* happened, but that means I need to find trustworthy people to get the judgement of instead.

My experiences of Christianity are that people who I've talked to have had a better life because of it. I can't tell them they're wrong for living the life they enjoy the most, just like I can't expect expect everyone to seek the truth as aggressively as we do. And so I found that arguing against Christianity is not useful for me. Talking in a Rational sub about Effective Communication is far more productive. Also fun.
