  If you really spent all your time listening to literally anything anyone has to say you would have no time left.

I agree, I do not spend time to listen to everyone. Likewise, I do not have coherent arguments against everyone. I only find it useful to think and argue about things that I have knowledge of. So since I have a friend who is Christian and I want to argue with him about it, I require that I learn about his position first. If I did not have this friend I would likely have never cared about this discussion at all. I find that 99% of the 'science vs religion debate' is a complete mockery of the word 'argument', where everyone is content flaming their opponents and acting superior. If the people with incomplete knowledge stopped butting in whenever they felt like it, maybe we'd have a conclusion. Instead they are fodder for the opponents to strawman and now their side looks stupid.

What I was focusing on: ridiculing the position of others means that you are arguing with them, it means you want to change the state of their beliefs. If that is truly what the offensive commenters wanted to do, then ridiculing Gelifyal (or anyone) is an anti-rational way to approach it (not promoting the truth seeking attitude that we aspire towards). If they did not really care about changing his or others' minds, then what they said amounts to only insults.

With regards to your last paragraph, I'm sorry if I made you think that I wasn't approaching this rationally. I at least /think/ that my model has internal consistency and doesn't appreciate serial killers. I see a distinction between thought and action; thought is personal and harmless. They can imagine killing millions in their head and I am a-ok with that. If they actually kill someone, they are forcing their wants onto other people and that is /not okay/. None of the Christians I know actually hate any homosexuals, and they are certainly not crazy enough to want to stone them. Of course that would be not-ok! I would be fine talking to someone with homicidal tendencies if they can keep it under control, I would love to learn how/why they think like that and how to prevent other murderers from losing control.

The whole American issue 'what is free speech and what is hate speech' covers the topic of what discussions should be allowed, and I simply don't have an answer. I could say nice things like 'only constructive discussion is allowed', but they would be shot down by the point you made, 'you would have no time left'. I haven't spent enough time considering this topic to think that I could make that decision. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think you have either.
