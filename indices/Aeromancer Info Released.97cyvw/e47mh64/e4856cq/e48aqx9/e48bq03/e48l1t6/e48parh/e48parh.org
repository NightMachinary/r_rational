  I'm sorry I don't understand what you are saying. If you think it's relevant, help me out and spell out the point a bit.

Just because people think that some place is too bad for anyone to rationally agree with it doesn't mean that people who do bad things aren't doing so by their own decision.

  My understanding of rationality is a distrust of myself to be right all the time and thus taking measures to ensure that I am wrong as little as possible. Ridiculing an opponent position is a good thing if I assume my position to be correct and thus I must do all in my power to ensure that the mistruths of the opponent are stopped. I don't trust myself to be 100% right, and so we argue, and the idea which gains followers shows its worth in being followed. I take that with a grain of salt given that.. ahem /trump/ happened, but that means I need to find trustworthy people to get the judgement of instead.

In my opinion this is absurd and I don't think you agree with it. If you really spent all your time listening to literally anything anyone has to say you would have no time left. Some random guy preaching that the earth is flat because the faeries told him is not worth listening to just because you don't view yourself as 100% being right. In a world with infinite time sure you could give everyone infinite time to preach their ideals, but we live in the real world and you should be using Bayesian probability to figure out how many times for example Christian information improved your truth state.

  My experiences of Christianity are that people who I've talked to have had a better life because of it. I can't tell them they're wrong for living the life they enjoy the most, just like I can't expect expect everyone to seek the truth as aggressively as we do. And so I found that arguing against Christianity is not useful for me. Talking in a Rational sub about Effective Communication is far more productive. Also fun.

You might not have an egotistical moral justification for telling a Christian not to stone a homosexual because it makes them enjoy their life the most but that's not the same as allowing them to do it or even supporting a belief system which allows it to occur. Someone having a better life is NOT a good justification for allowing discussion, many serial killers were much happier after deciding to kill than beforehand. If you are okay with people serial killing then obviously I bow to your consistency and don't have issue with your position.
