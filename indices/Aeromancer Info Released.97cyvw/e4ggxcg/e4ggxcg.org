Welp, so it's true.

Good luck author with whatever you may choose to do in the future. Some of us will raise an eyebrow if your basis of decision is religious in nature. But don't worry, people can do the same with different basis. I'd do what my wife told me if that's resonate with me, even if that means I have to drop commitments I've made before.

No, I don't have a wife, it's hypothetical situation.
