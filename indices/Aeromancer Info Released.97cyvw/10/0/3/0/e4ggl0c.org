You missed the point.

I think it's called congruence. If your activities are in dissonance with your believe, you will feel uncomfortable. There is a writer, who is religious, that keep writing SF because he doesn't feel writing get in the way of their faith. Author feel that writing demand more commitment than what he's comfortable with. And that's get in the way of his faith. So he stops writing.

It IS subjective.
