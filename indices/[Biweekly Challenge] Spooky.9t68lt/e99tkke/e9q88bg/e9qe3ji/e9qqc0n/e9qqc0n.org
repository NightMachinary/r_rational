This story tackles a concept that I've been rolling on the top of my brain for quite some time. And I think your story doesn't even come close to the actual depths of horror that would be possible in such a world, or in such a future. What if a sadist simulated human minds only to fill them with suffering, just to get fleeting satisfaction out of it? What if the amount of suffering a simulated mind was capable of feeling had no upper bound? What if the sadist had hardware powerful enough to simulate trillions of minds? What if, in order to keep up with their progressive desensitisation, the sadist increased the suffering of those simulated minds in increments? In increasing increments?

And related to that, what if you combine this problem with the tech to copy the brain of a person onto a digital support? How improbable would it be that key people in political or military roles were briefly sedated, copied, and then have their secrets tortured out of them in the safety and darkness of the torturer's PC?

These thoughts are not imminent enough to keep me up at night, but they come close.
