The idea was that the simulations are complete, real universes. The software recognizes and identifies the emergence of sentience, or the ability to feel, which means animal life, and also sapience, the ability to think, which means human (or human-like) life. Animals can suffer (Dukkha) and humans can suffer even more.

The software also tracks positive qualities that emerge among the thinking population, including soul (Atman), enlightenment (Bodhi), and successful meditation (Dhyana). I used Hindu and Buddhist terms because I was hoping to show a society that pulls the best ideas from multiple cultures, but using these terms was a mistake; they're too obscure.

The simulations are supposed to help the researchers (Diaz and her students) identity universes that have high levels of positive qualities. This would help them figure out what actions/approaches lead to successful universes. Like running a drug trial on an entire universe rather than on a mouse. Today, a failed drug trial means a mouse dies of cancer. In this dystopian future, a failed simulation means a quadrillion thinking beings suffer for eight million years.

The bigger idea was to show how our moral wisdom doesn't scale with our technology-enhanced power. Jess and Mark are literally gods. They control universes containing quadrillions of thinking beings. But they prioritize their own plans, their own skins, their own careers. Now, this is insane from a utilitarian point of view, but makes sense based on how humans actually make choices. I find that disconnect disturbing (think of the insane moral quandaries companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook are facing; their decisions impact billions of people).

In other words, because of biases like scope neglect and vividness, our brains may simply not be able to make moral decisions correctly in a highly technological world (the White Christmas episode of Black Mirror is a particularly chilling example, IMO).

Obviously, I didn't explain any of this clearly in the story. Therefore, the story fails, but hopefully it is a failure I can learn from. My apologies for the poor writing.
