(It would be nice if Mark put in some time to make an analytic dashboard that measured Dukkha; rather, it threatens my suspension of disbelief that no one has thought to do this in all the dashboard-making that has happened so far, particularly that no ethics committees have been involved in doing this, specifically in that Mark represents that some people do think about and worry about Dukkha.)

​

((Or maybe the dashboards were all home-coded by the other small-sample-size number of researchers--in which case there's even more reason for it to be plausible that he could make another one himself--and Mark is the first person introduced to them who cares about that (as many others do), putting him in the position of a subject of a Milgram experiment; in that sense, it's a fun alternative-headcanon to imagine that the whole thing is actually a psychology experiment studying /him/ (and presumably others like him), to see the horrors that he could be convinced to do with a minimum of duress.))

​

For myself, I liked the delayed-horror aspect of the built-in pause for looking up the terms, to first understand what they're taling about--'oh, the values they care about are low, and he's worried about some other value they aren't measuring'--and then to look up the unfamiliar terms and find out how cataclysmic (there should be a better word) the thing they're discussing is.

​

The only major misunderstanding I had is that for 'straight lines at zero' I was imagining the (0,0) coordinate, and without quite understanding, the true meaning didn't click until the word 'flatlines' later on. Taking a problem solely on my end as the null hypothesis, wording such as 'always at zero' or 'almost never rises above zero' might have been understood faster.

​

I was amused at my emotional reaction in that I felt the most horror at the suggestion that someone might want to /turn it off/, representing the extinguishing of so many minds (in contrast with messing with it to try to improve things)--though it's also possible that the term could be used for a resume-possible action. That said, the suggested reaction to it being turned off sounded in line with having to start all over again (losing all the time/resources already put into it), rather than just wasting a little time until the decision could be made.

​

...I'm imagining two people, one apathetically doing nothing, and one looking over with pity and concern and 'compassion' as he steps nearer and nearer holding an axe and the thing I'm screaming most at the first person is to /save me from him/ and the incredible relief as she holds him back...
