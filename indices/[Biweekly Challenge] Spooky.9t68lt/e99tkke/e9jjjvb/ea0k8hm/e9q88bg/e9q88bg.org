Hello,

I found this quite interesting but I am not aware of most of the technical terms used and therefore may have missed the significance of this exchange:

  “But look, Jess. Sentience emerges here.” He pointed at the Atman chart. “And sapience here. What do you see?”\\
  “I see... a straight line.\\
  "You're absolutely right, Jess. Atman is a straight line. At zero. That's my whole point. There's a tiny blip here, see, maybe half a million years after the emergence of sapience. Since then, nothing.”\\
  “So what?”\\
  “It's not just Atman. It's Bodhi and Dhyana and... It's all of them, Jess! They're all straight lines at zero.”

I did google some of the terms, read the wiki on Dukkha, and understand them somewhat now. But I still can't intuitively get the horror that Mark feels; I don't completely understand why he's horrified and I want to. So far, i understand that the sims are suffering, but how sapience and sentience plays a part, idk.

Would it be possible for you to give me some insights?
