yes. completely agree.

edit: Actually, let me caveat that slightly. I worry that what you describe will not solely be done by sadists. It may be done in ignorance, because we haven't evolved to view simulations as real beings. It may also be done - or aided and abetted - by people like you and me, people who think they're good, but who, in the moment, will face enormous internal and external pressure to bow to expediency or comfort or the status quo or fear or the idea that "I can't make a difference so why bother".
