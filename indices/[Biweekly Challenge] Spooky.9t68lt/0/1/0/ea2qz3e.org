The way the story built up, I thought he was going to.

It's a pretty great story, though I wasn't familiar with the concepts, which made the Author Q&A in this thread essential. What's curious to me is that those stats are at zero, though.

You'd think if they were interested in those factors, they'd have more interest in what goes wrong - that way the expenditure is more justified. /"We simulated thousands of worlds, but only found a few that worked out that we can use to understand how we can do better in our world"/ doesn't sound as good as /"We have figured out how worlds go wrong, and what we need to do so that doesn't happen."/

EDIT: I was talking about them figuring out what interventions would improve their world, then I realized they could also test interventions on simulations.
