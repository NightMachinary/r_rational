How does that distinguish male power fantasy? It's not as though there's no non-men who want to be in a relationship with multiple other people.

I do agree that most implementations have been off, though, at least the implementations that deliberately invoke the idea. I know of at least one ratfic that pokes at the idea in an interesting and non-problematic way, but it doesn't seem to be an example of the trope as such, CERTAINLY not played straight, although it's not finished yet. The specific story is Worth the Candle, marked as a spoiler since even though I didn't say anything specific about the story it's a spoiler that it pokes at that trope. Unfortunately, that means there's no way to tell if you care about being spoiled until you click. No way around that though, I'm afraid.
