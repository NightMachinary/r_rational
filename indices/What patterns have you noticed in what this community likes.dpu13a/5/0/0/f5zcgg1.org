"Harems" (another word I don't like) do seem to pop up occasionally here, and I attribute this to the influence of anime and manga on nerdy internet subcultures, this one included. But whether or not "harems" are inherently problematic depends on your definition of such. If it's one man in romantic or sexual relationships with many women, or the slightly broader version, one person in relationships with many other people, then there's nothing wrong with that (in fiction or otherwise) as long as all people involved are consenting adults. On the other hand, the most cliche, played-straight conceptualization of the harem DOES seem to imply a level of objectification, seeing women as a prize to be won and something of which having more is better, a status symbol who could have been anyone as long as they were hot. However, I haven't seen the latter conceptualization of the harem in any works popular among this particular community (that I've read, obviously).
