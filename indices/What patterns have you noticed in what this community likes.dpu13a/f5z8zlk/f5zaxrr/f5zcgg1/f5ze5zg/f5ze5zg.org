I didn't actually say all harems were intrinsically bad. I used them as an example of one of the things that distinguishes a "male" power fantasy from other power fantasies. Also said weird ones are a red flag of sexism.

Although I don't think I've ever encountered a harem in a web novel that didn't seem a bit off to me.
