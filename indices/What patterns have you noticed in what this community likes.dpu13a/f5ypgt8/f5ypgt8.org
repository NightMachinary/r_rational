I agree with most of what you said. I think the prominence of fanfic etc. can be explained with the fact it is free. I can recommend a Practical Guide to Evil or the Erogamer to anyone and they can read it and then the community can discuss it.

I would say the two big things people here hate are the idiot ball and characters acting out of character. A general approach to bettering themselves and the society around them seems to also be expected of the protagonist but it is not necessary if the work of fiction is interesting in other ways and raises important questions.
