Hmmm. That's something that gets repeated a lot but, if you put his short stories aside, I think it's mostly false.

People who say that must be thinking of the first Foundation book, or to a lesser degree the second and third ones, but it definitely doesn't apply to /Foundation's Edge/ and /Foundation and Earth/. Or to his Robots books.
