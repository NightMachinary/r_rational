I think a lot of what you're observing with regards to the authors you listed is the difference between published authors (who rarely put out more than a book a year, and usually much less frequently than that, AFAIK) and webserial authors, who usually do a few chapters a month.

There's also a lot more involved in accessing the works of published authors, whereas with webserials there's a button to click; more, if I want books not epubs, I can't immediately start reading.

There's also a huge difference between discussing a single chapter, and discussing an entire book.

So, in terms of air-time, it's a function of quality, frequency, accessibility (a little bit) and content-size, which results in something like a black swan effect. The air-time something gets has more to do with how recurringly discussable it is, than subjective quality (although subjective quality definitely matters; look at PGtE vs TGAB).

After _that_, it's probably a question of "what kinds of webserials tend towards rationality" more than "we like LitRPGs".

Regarding "male power fantasies", it's gonna take more words. Rational works in general lend themselves towards stories about the growth of power; rational _readers_ quite like power-fantasy-ish stories, _but_ we also tend to not like curb-stomps, which is what the classic "power-fantasy" story involves - that's the whole "give Frodo a lightsaber, given Sauron a death star". After _that_, AFAIK the rationalist community skews male - so it makes sense that writers tend to write male perspectives (it's what they know), readers tend to read male perspectives (people like reading about people like themselves) - and fiction itself skews male (so if you're writing fanfic and pick a random character (even weighted by some measure), it's likely too be male). And then still after all that you can climb down the rabbit hole of "does default society treat power-seeking as a masculine trait". Finally, consider that Worm and PGtE are two of the top fictions as rated by this community.

So, overall, I'd say that "male power-fantasy-ness" is a (light) _negative_ predictor of a work's popularity on this sub, because a) power-fantasies tend to be both worse fiction and tend to be less rational fiction and b) sexist fiction tends to be worse fiction (globally).
