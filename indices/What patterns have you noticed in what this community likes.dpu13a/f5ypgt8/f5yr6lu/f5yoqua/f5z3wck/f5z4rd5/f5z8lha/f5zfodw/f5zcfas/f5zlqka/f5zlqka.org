Are you willing to admit the same is true of most romance stories (since they're intended for a female audience and typically have a female lead)?

It really gets my goat that people call FICTION (by definition not real) intended for a specific audience anything-ist. Especially if the writing style goes against the current cultural sacred cows.

I don't know about everyone else, but I'm perfectly capable of reading some pulpy men's romance (because that's what shitty harem stories are; romance novels for men) and walk away NOT thinking "Yeah, that's about right about how men and women work".

It's a FANTASY for a reason. Calling a FANTASY sexist, or racist, or whatever-ist or whatever-phobic is just absurd.
