  and fiction itself skews male (so if you're writing fanfic and pick a random character (even weighted by some measure), it's likely too be male).

Actually I'm pretty sure this is wrong. Women read WAY more then men and dominate urban fantasy.

I've noticed a definite gender bias to different genres.

My two favorite "Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court" style series bring in harems and have vaguely sexist undercurrents. LitRPG has a male bias. Yet as I said, if I go to a bookstore and look at fantasy novels there is a definite female slant, and Reddit Fantasy seems to be much more female leaning.
