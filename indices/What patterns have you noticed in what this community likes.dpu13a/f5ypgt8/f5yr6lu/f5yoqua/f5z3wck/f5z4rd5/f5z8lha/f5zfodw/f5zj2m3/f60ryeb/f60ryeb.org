I feel like the power fantasy thing applies more to the munchkinry subgenre (stuff like the 2 year emperor) than it does to rationalist fiction in general. If anything, I feel like rational fics, especially older ones, tend toward extreme powerlessness in the face of an uncaring universe.

Of the works I mentioned, only hpmor really qualifies as a power fantasy. (Although FiO /might/ qualify too. Depending on your system of ethics, it's either a power fantasy or existential horror.)

Luminosity, Metropolitan Man, and Worm /kinda/ start that way, but rapidly deconstruct it.

And qntm's stuff is the polar opposite of power fantasies, dealing with protagonists who are in way over their heads and stay that way for pretty much the whole story.
