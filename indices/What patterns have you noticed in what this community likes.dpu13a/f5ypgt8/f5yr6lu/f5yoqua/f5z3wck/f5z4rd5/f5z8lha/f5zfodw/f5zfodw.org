I agree with most of this comment, but I don't think rationalist fiction protagonists skew male. If anything, it's the opposite.

I admit this is anecdotal and that my knowledge of the genre is biased toward older (6+ years ago) works, but when rational fiction gets discussed, the works that seem to me to get brought up most often are:

- hpmor
- alicorn's fiction (luminosity's author)
- friendship is optimal
- the metropolitan man
- qntm's fiction
- wildbow's fiction (It's been debated whether this one is in the genre, but I count it because looking for stories similar to Worm was how me and a lot of other people discovered the rationalist community in the first place.)

Of these stories, only hpmor and mm have male protagonists.

Alicorn's fiction has almost exclusively female protagonists.

Friendship is Optimal has CelesteAI, who while not strictly female, is referred to as she/her.

qntm' fiction consists mostly of ensemble pieces with no clear protagonist, but the his SCP Antimemetics series has protagonist Marion Wheeler.

And Worm and Ward by Wildbow have female protagonists as well.
