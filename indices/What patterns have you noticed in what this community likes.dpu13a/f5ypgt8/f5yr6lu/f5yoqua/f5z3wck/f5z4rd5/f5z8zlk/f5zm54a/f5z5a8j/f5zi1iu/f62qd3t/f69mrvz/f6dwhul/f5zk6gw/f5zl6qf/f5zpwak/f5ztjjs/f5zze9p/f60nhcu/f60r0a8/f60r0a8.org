Thanks! I will take a look. What kind of comments are you looking for? I tend to be pretty syntax-focused so I can easily proofread but you're probably looking for more substantive feedback? I guess I'll try the whole "wise reading" thing :)

Edit: btw, I actually love editing more than writing myself but I still want to do my own writing as well.
