Honestly, I probably dissected my emotions more when I was a teenager then I do now. To be fair, it probably didn't make my behavior more rational.

What I run into is "This 8 year old is going to methodically study how magic works, perform meticulous controlled experiments...then go off alone to fight kobolds rather then waiting a few years until his body gets bigger and his magic improves." Ran into that twice lately.

Also, I'm annoyed when a character meets an actual god and gives an atheist rant when the god is right there. I have a strict policy of not telling telling anyone they don't exist where they can hear me.
