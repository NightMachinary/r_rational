If people are looking for more rational novels, go on rationalreads.com and filter by paid (the martian, permutation city, RedShirts, etc. [[https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/100705.Rational_Fiction?page=2][Goodreads]] [[https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/rational?page=3][lists]] are also good (although you may have to go a few pages in) because goodreads has more novels than fanfic.
