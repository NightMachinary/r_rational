  I think what gets brought up here is skewed a bit towards Fanfic, LitRPG, super hero stuff, and male power fantasies.

Other people have mentioned that fanfic is common here because it's free. There is almost certainly more fanfic available in the world than original fiction, so even beyond its free status it's likely to dominate just on numbers. Moreover, it's an easy place for new writers to get started, and new writers are generally looking for an audience so will make at least a modest effort to spread the word.

LitRPG seems to be a fad on the internet right now, hence why there's a lot of it. I don't remember much of it showing up here back in 2013-2015 when I was publishing /The Two Year Emperor/, so my guess is that it will die down eventually.

As to superhero stories, I would disagree with you there. From what I've seen, superhero stories per se have never gotten a lot of traction here, either in terms of numbers of posts or numbers of upvotes. My /Change Storms/ novel was the least popular thing I ever posted on this subreddit, and Doc Future's various books about Flicker (eg [[https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/34152071413/flicker-phone-tag]]) get confusingly few upvotes despite being what looks like tailor-made rr-bait.
