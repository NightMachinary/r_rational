I just prefer good quality web +comics+ serials over the popular books. It's not about cost because libraries are a thing. I can get sucked in to books as well but then the wait for the next is long enough that I don't really care to read more than a trilogy. Also Robert Jordan's really disturbing views on women just turned me off of the entire medium. At least he didn't make all women into monsters like Lovecraft did with minorities but no, actually he did.
