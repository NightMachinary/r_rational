That explains a lot, actually.

I'm not assuming the presence of Power Fantasies equates to Male Power Fantasy. I was qualifying Power Fantasy by adding "male" to distinguish it from other power fantasies. It's just a flavor I've been getting lately. (I've been running into a lot of power fantasies with harems and weird depictions of women lately and got irritated. And the difference between the "male" and "female' dominated forums is amusingly telling).
