The other series by John Wright is actually very good too - The Golden Age. Written after (I think) his supposed craziness but the story doesn't suffer too much.

I liked Accelerando (Stross), Egan's Diaspora. Online fic that's maybe lesser known:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23539/super-science-fast-romance][Super Science and Fast Romance]] is very good and complete (ish, i think?)

Edit: I found Street Cultivation to be kind of boring - the other series by Sarah Lin starting [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/42847216][Changing Faces]] was definitely more interesting for me personally. The conceit is the protagonist is an NPC evil lich who accidentally wakes up inhabiting a body that was supposed to go to a LitRPG player - and proceeds to play the game as if it were real life (which to him it is.) Rational? Yes, I think so. Not the absolute best I've read but it's hard to just list off stuff from the top of your head.
