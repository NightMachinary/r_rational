In principle that is a core problem of the genre. Honestly though, that's never been what struck me. I've never gotten frustrated with rationalist fiction because the hero was dissecting his emotional responses. I was thinking of more traditional male power fantasies getting tossed in their randomly.

The other thing that occasionally bugs me is when the character and/or author reveres rationality in principle, but the character engages in recklessly stupid behavior. (Because of the needs of an action story perhaps)
