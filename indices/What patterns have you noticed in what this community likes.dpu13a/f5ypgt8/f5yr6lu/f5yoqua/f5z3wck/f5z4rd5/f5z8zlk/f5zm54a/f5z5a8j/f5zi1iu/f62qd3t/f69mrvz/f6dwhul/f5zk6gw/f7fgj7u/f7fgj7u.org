  Where is the next level super-rational fiction that I am now craving?

I'm curious, are you familiar with A Practical Guide To Evil? It has very spot-on character writing for people's differing perspectives and how they clash and /exactly how people are irrational/, in my observation, and I enjoy it greatly for that. It has no 'perfect rationalist' characters, even those who espouse the values and employ the methods and come close are still people with biases and shortage of computing resources.

If you've read it, I'd be curious to hear your opinion on it. If you haven't, well... this is a recommendation then!
