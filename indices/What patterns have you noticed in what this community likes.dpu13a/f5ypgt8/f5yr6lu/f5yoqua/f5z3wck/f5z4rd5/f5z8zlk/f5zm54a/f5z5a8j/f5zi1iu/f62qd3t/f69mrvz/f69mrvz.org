  because Harry thinks he already understands other people very well and doesnt think he needs to learn much from draco.

How much do you think this is a mistake by the author and how much is it a purposeful character flaw he consciously gave Harry? I think it is a mix of both.

Back to your point though, the stuff you describe is why I like Wildbow so much. His PoV characters, be they the MC or from an interlude, are definitely not rationalist in the vast majority of cases. They are biased, both due to their general personality and due to the specific stressful and emotional situations they find themselves in. And yet they feel real. I rarely see obvious idiot balls and the like. In fact, I often feel like they are making obvious and understandable choices and only notice how skewed their thoughts were at times if I look back at it for a second readthrough.

Do you read his stuff? Or is there something that bothers you about it that you can't ignore enough to enjoy his stories?
