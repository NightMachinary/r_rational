I'm aiming to eventually write this as I recognise the same lack. But, might be a while. Then again, I do have some time perhaps to work on writing until the end of the year so we'll see.

Actually, if you don't mind the NSFW-ness: [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/][The Erogamer]] is already this (or near enough.) (site has sign-up required but no personal information is required or requested.)

It's respectful to both (all, really, including "non-binary" people) genders, has people being sensible in their decisions and has a great story. You can pretty much ignore the "porn" parts if you want, the story is the good thing about it despite it being on an NSFW site.
