Fanfic and other web fiction is popular here because the rational fiction community (or at least THIS rational fiction community) gained much of its popularity from HPMoR, and because the episodic release style that much web fiction uses is more conducive to active community discussion than the more traditional route of releasing an entire work at once. The popularity of LitRPGs seems to me to be especially high right now as far as web fiction goes in general, so that (along with another work popular in this community, Worth the Candle) contributes to the LitRPG trend, and of course Worm (while in my opinion not rational itself) is highly popular here, contributing to the superhero stuff (seems like 90% of the superhero stuff I see here is worm related).

I think power fantasy is admittedly something a little bit common here (though I think the name "power fantasy" has too much of a pejorative context and problematizes something not fundamentally problematic, and that while it shouldn't be the only tool in our toolbox there's nothing wrong with a work of fiction catering to a desire for a feeling of agency and ability to meaningfully affect the world, something our current society causes many to lack in their normal life), but I disagree with the characterization of it as specifically "male power fantasy", because I have never seen a work of fiction on this sub that seemed to endorse or portray a worldview in which the power should specifically be possessed by men. Certainly the gender or sex of the protagonist is irrelevant for these purposes; having a male protagonist pursue power does not evidence that the author does not believe women should have power.
