OK, never would have thought Daniel Abraham and James SA Corey were the same person.

You aren't kidding Graydon Saunders is hard to find online. What did he write?

Since (in principle) we like the same things, what actual books with rational pragmatic heroes can you suggest?

I loved Dichronaughts until the end. Not strictly rationalist but loved Orphans of Chaos by John Wright. Not even truly rationalist adjacent but Street Cultivation was interesting in that it had a character that wasn't COMPLETELY insane dealing with standard cultivation novel scenarios.
