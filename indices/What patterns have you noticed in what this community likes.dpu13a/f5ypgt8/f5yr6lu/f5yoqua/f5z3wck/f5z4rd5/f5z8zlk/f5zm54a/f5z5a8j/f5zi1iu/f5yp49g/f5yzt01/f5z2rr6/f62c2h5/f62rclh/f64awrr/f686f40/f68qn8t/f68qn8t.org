  Is there an equivalent "female power fantasy"?

Yes! As I've said earlier in this discussion, Laurel K. Hamilton is all about those.

A plain old gender neutral power fantasy becomes a male power fantasy when you add some stereotypical macho imagery and the hero's power (as expressed through his skill at violence) gets him lots of girls. I suppose this could be a lesbian power fantasy, but I personally haven't encountered a lesbian version of it.

As for gender-fluid power fantasies...I haven't encountered enough of these to get annoyed by them yet. (Or even recognize them). I'm sure they must exist, but I'd probably have to go to some really specialized subreddit to find them.
