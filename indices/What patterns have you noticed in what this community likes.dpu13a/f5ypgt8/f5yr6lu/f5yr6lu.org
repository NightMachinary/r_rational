This place brings up LitRPGs, etc., because those are the dominant trends in webfic more generally, and webfic is a lot easier to build a fandom around. If you want to read a print book, you have to either buy it or get it from the library. Ebooks make this a little easier, but if you don't have Kindle Unlimited or access via library, etc. you're going to have to actually buy the book. Whereas web serials are never more than a click away. Mention your serial here at 3 PM and eight people will have read the first four chapters by 8.

EDIT: Somebody else already said this, derp.
