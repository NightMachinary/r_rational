I to hate the Idiot Ball and that hatred has brought me to this reddit. That and a dislike of authors and characters who don't think through the implications of the Fantasy/Sci Fi elements they introduce.

I think part of the prevalence of fanfic is because people are really really angry at the irrationality of their favorite/least favorite franchise. That and the fact this is reddit. If you are here you have an internet connected device in front of you and likely spend a lot of time online. If a library were to set up a rationalist book club I suspect the book list would look very different.
