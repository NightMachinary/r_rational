  Are you willing to admit the same is true of most romance stories (since they're intended for a female audience and typically have a female lead)?

Yes! Well, maybe not most, but an awful lot. It's easy for heterosexual people writing out their sexual fantasies to forget the objects of those fantasies are actual people, or at least gloss over pesky character development issues. When I read Laurel K. Hamilton I had a realization...I thought the male characters were blow-up dolls and the author totally didn't understand what the situation would like like to them and realized "Oh! I finally understand the weird feeling my female sci fi fan friends said they had when they read Robert A. Heinlein". Laurel K. Hamilton is the queen of creepy FEMALE power fantasies. It's always kind of uncomfortable reading literature devoted to a fetish you don't have...the inconsistencies are glaringly obvious. In fact, I started looking at LitRPG on Reddit partly because I'd ODed on the Alphahole/Pride & Prejudice style romances that were common in the Urban Fantasy/Supernatural Romance hybrids that were big for a while.

  I'm perfectly capable of reading some pulpy men's romance (because that's what shitty harem stories are; romance novels for men)

I'm glad you are aware of that! So many people seem to deny that. I've had some arguments online with women who complained there were "No fantasy romance novels with men protagonists". My position was "You just don't recognize them as such".
