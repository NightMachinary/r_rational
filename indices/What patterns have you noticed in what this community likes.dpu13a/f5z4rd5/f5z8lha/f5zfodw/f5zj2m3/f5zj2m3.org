Fiction can still be male biased while having female protagonists, if that was the point you were countering. I do agree though that overall if anything the "rational" fiction I've read tends to be more likely to have female protagonists despite being "aimed at" male power fantasies. (extreme generalisation there, please do not take literally for any particular set of works.)
