I tried to read Worm. It's pretty good, but it was too heartpoundingly suspenseful for my nerves. I made so many attempts to get into it, and actually managed to get fairly far on the last attempt before I finally gave up. It was making me too anxious. Same reason I couldn't really watch the Merlin Tv series what with Merlin always sneaking around and doing magic even though if he got caught doing magic he'd be executed.
