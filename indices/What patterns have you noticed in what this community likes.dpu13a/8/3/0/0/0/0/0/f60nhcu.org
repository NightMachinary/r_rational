Gotcha. I've been trying to write a "super-rational" fic myself, but its very slow because I was a terrible prose writer with a very narrow perspective when I first started in 2017. I published the first book only to find out later that there were serious flaws that neither I nor my editors caught originally.

It's a novella series called "Earthlings: People of the Dawn". It's about an alternate near-present day Earth very similar to our own, where authoritarian regimes are taking over everywhere and the threat of human extinction is drawing near thanks to mass deception enabled by deep fake software and mass displacement of human workers enabled by the automation of their jobs.

It's what one might call high/epic Earthfic (as contrasted to low/drama-earthfic like this one: [[https://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/earthfic.shtml]])

If you're interested in taking a look and maybe commenting on it you can find the current draft of "Episode I: the Ambassador's Voice" here:
