Hey, will continue commenting on your fic, have been busy today.

I'm planning to do NaNoWriMo (although not aiming for 50,000 words necessarily - I will consider it a success if I do 500 of the right words than 50,000 of any words) - would you be willing to review my writing with me?

The story I am planning is this:

I hope you don't mind fanfiction.
