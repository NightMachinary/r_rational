  Harry thinks he already understands other people very well and doesnt think he needs to learn much from draco.

I think Harry just said that Draco can teach him about "people stuff" to get him to cooperate. Draco doesn't know shit about people, he's a bully and a death eater. What manipulative knowledge patterns Draco does have are poisoned by the way it is shaped for ill intent, the same way that Quirrel's is.

The character who /actually/ teaches Harry about "people stuff" is Hermione.
