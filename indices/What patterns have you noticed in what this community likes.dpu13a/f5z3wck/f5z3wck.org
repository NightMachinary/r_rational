Part of the popularity of fanfic is obviously, as has been said in this thread before, that they're free. Another one that I think people have overlooked, is the serial nature of them, i.e there's always something new to discuss. Even though he was a prolific author, Aasimov only has so many books, and they came out a while ago so most people don't have much to say on the topic that hasn't been covered already. Compare that to the front page right now, where each time a chapter of PGTE/ mother of learning/worth the candle comes out, it's a lot easier to analyze the new stuff from there and how it fits together with the plot, and new content multiple times a weak or monthly at most leads to it staying fresh in people's minds.
