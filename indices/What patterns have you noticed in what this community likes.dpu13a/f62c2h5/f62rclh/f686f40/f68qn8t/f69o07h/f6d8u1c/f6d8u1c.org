Well, Laurel K. Hamilton plays it direct...Anita Blake in the later novels uses her strength to get a harem of guys fawning over her. But that's unusual.

Usually it seems to involve the notion of standing up to men...a perfectly reasonable idea, although like most things it gets weird if you dial it up to 11. There are a whole lot of novels where an overpowered female protagonist gets to say and do whatever she feels like without worrying about others feelings, bulldozes through the consequences with super human strength, and shouts down a controlling alphahole until he admits he is wrong and becomes a sensitive boyfriend.
