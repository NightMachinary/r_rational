I'd guess fanfic is dominant here because the term [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][was coined]] by Eliezer Yudkowsky in reference to his Harry Potter fanfic (and people asking him to recommend similar works/tips on howhe wrote), and a lot of the initial subreddit population came from there? So we were pre-selected for liking fanfic.

And then of course it's self-perpetuating, since a lot of the stories posted and written by users here are fanfic they'll attract mostly people who enjoy fanfic.
