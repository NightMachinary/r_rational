We like being vindicated, we like being right. The rationalist characters are generally placed in surcomstances uniquely suited to the rationalist approach and they don't make nearly enough mistakes. The worlds are also often not rationalist and the characters don't ask about that, just take advantage of it. I don't like this. I think the point of writing a story about a philosophy or method should involve testing it to destruction. Not doing so limits the depth.
