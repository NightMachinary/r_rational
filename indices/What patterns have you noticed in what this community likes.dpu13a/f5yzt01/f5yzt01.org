Absolutely agreed. I'm personally a fan of John C Wright, hard sci-fi epic fantasies, etc pretty much everything you mention. Would definitely like to see greater variety on this subreddit.

Two particular authors that I keep mentioning over and over yet seem to get relatively little response compared to how good I think they are are Daniel Abraham (and pseudonym[s] James SA Corey) and Graydon Saunders.

Edit: also agreed with your point about this being the internet: stuff that is easily accessible online is likely to be shared and linked more just because you don't have to go through the effort of buying a physical or digital copy.
