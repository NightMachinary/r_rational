I think part of the reason sci-fi doesn't get brought up much is because most of the really good rational sci-fi is old. Generally if someone is asking for a new book to read on a niche site like this one Asimov is not going to be a helpful answer.

There doesn't seem to be much rational Epic Fantasy - do you have any recommendations there?
