I'm not sure it's a problem if that's what the audience is here for. It's just kind of interestingly odd when even a teenaged character's emotions are being dissected like a psychology case study by said teenager.

But yes, there is some dissonance between "this character, if wholly rational, would probably avoid getting into a fist-fight with a dragon, but he did max out his Punch stat and Dodge stat, so he can totally do that, and people love fantasy violence, so this calm, methodical puzzle-solver is going to beat the hell out of a giant monster to show off how cool he is."
