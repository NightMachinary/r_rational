The following post is not worded sensitively because I have not been feeling very well lately and I'm too tired and stressed to fix it. These are just my own point of view. Please bear with me and try not to take offense.

One of the things that really bothers me about rational fiction is that while it tends to be more psychologically and socially realistic than other fiction, it usually doesn't take that realism far enough, especially when it comes to characters who are too different from rationalists in their skill sets and way of life. Rationalists generally don't really understand how other people who aren't rationalists think and perceive things and why they think and perceive things the way they do. And non-rationalists generally don't have the analytical skills nor the obsession with constant maximum self-awareness to explain their reasoning to a rationalist's satisfaction. A lot of the nonrationalist reasoning is implicit and is easier to understand if you understand what a non rationalist's current knowledge, experiences and goals are. Even when people are ridiculously and systematically wrong, there are usually understandable and relatable reasons for why other people are so wrong like that--theyre human beings, not cognitive mutants after all. They arent fundamentally inherently different from rationalists. The true nature of mass delusion is just as much social/communicative as it is intellectual, if not more so in some ways. Otherwise if it were just an intellectual impediment rather than a social/communicative one, you wouldnt get so many people, many of whom are otherwise very intelligent and rational in other areas of their lives, sharing the /same/ delusions. Everyone would be religious and they would all have their own religion unique to themselves alone.

Non-rational fiction is often unthinking and full of holes. Rational fiction often makes the mistake of at least to some extent, strawmanning people who arent rationalists. Not strawmanning their specific arguments/beliefs, because rationalists have an injunction against strawmanning those. Instead they strawman the non-rational characters themselves, by treating them as inferior in skill and goals to the rationalist protagonist, and often not presenting them plausibly the way their real life equivalents would be.

Tbh, I think draco in hpmor could have taught Harry a lot more stuff, but we mostly see things the other way around with harry teaching draco. Harry has the science, draco has the people stuff. Yet somehow dracos role as the people person is made less important because Harry thinks he already understands other people very well and doesnt think he needs to learn much from draco.

Some of the more recent rational fics I've seen have done better with this. Alexander Wales has gotten particularly good at not strawmanning non-rationalist characters. That being said, I feel like Solace's character in worth the candle could be pinned down and fleshed out better. Just because her magic is meant to be undefinable and magically uncomprehendable by dm fiat doesnt mean her own heart and mind need to be that way too. She feels mysterious and serene and she cares about things being unknown and mysterious and not being pinned down and broken down and defined. Great! So if she doesnt like analyzing things or being analyzed, what does she like instead? The opposite of analysis isn't ignorance, it's CREATIVITY. Why don't we see her being creative more often instead of her magic being creative for her? Why doesnt she make art or sing? Real hippies/environmentalists/creative-nonconformists/anti-technology/anti-academic establishment types (pointing to an empirical cluster in person space here) might seem to think and act like solace on the surface, but there's a lot more to them than that! As a character, Solace is a strawman of those types of people. Generally speaking, she doesnt believe what she believes because of any understandable and relatable experiences, neither through her own nor her ancestors' experiences passed down in oral tradition or some other cultural mechanism. She believes what she believes for the purposes of being anti-rationalist, to steelman /antirationalism itself/ instead of steelmanning the kinds of cultures and perspectives that non-rationalists actually would plausibly develop.

People are complicated. The human brain is the most complicated dynamic system in the known universe. Generalized intellectual brute force can only get you so far in understanding the hearts and minds of other people in specific detail. Science is designed to attain /generalizable/ knowledge, not /specifiable/ knowledge. Understanding the general theory of everything doesnt help you understand the specific theory of why that person just told you your tie looks nice. In theory it would if you had infinite computing power and infinite time, because reductionism. But like, you dont have infinite computing power or time? That's why we have to compartmentalize our understanding of the world into different levels of scope.

How HJPEV was able to visualize an entire eraser in maximum physical detail for his partial transfiguration without the infinite computing power necessary to get infinitely precise visualization is still a mystery to me. His brain didn't have enough neurons to represent the eraser at even the quark level, because there were fewer neurons in his brain than quarks in the eraser. Visualizing the eraser in even more fine detail than that makes even less sense. If you can get infinite precision and infinite computing power, you can get infinite observational data, and then you can get probabilstic beliefs that are ACTUALLY 0 or 1 rather than simply rounded up to 0 or 1 in certain contexts and levels of scope like the brain /normally does/ because of limitations on its precision.

The chances that 2+2 != 4 are lower than the chances that santa clause exists by many orders of magnitude. It would take far more evidence-fuel to prove the former than the latter, but the absolute difference is small enough that their chances /feel/ equal from inside a human brain, because the brain is not infinitely precise. That's also the obvious explanation for why scope insensitivity exists btw.

*Tldr*; Rational fiction spoiled non-rational fiction for me, and now rational fiction has been spoiled for me too. Where is the next level super-rational fiction that I am now craving? The rational fiction that is actually rational fiction of which the current flavor of rational fiction is but a pale imitation of? /sighs in wistful desperate longing/
