Huh thats interesting. Are the porn parts relevant to the plot, and are they clearly marked?

I prefer same-sex romance stories and that often leaves me with a very bad taste in my mouth because there are much fewer authors writing decent slash fic. Most of the authors who write same sex relationships put same-sex attracted people on an othering pedestal of rainbows and specialness, just like half of the society I live in does, and the other half of that society isnt tolerant enough of same sex relationships to write them in fiction at all. This fact makes me angry and sad and leaves me with a very sour taste in my mouth, because whenever I want to read some good same sex romance stories I have trouble finding any i like and just end up watching porn instead. >:(
