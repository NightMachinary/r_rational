Isaac Asimov is really good and I recommend anyone who can to pick up an anthology of his work especially his short stories. Lots of clever ideas and puzzles to be solved by intelligent characters. Someone did recommend a story of his a while ago if anyone would like to see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/deaubu/evidence_by_isaac_asimov/?st=k2f99vad&sh=03ca2e91][that]].
