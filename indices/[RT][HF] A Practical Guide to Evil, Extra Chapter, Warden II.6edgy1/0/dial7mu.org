So i have been thinking about the parallels in the story. If Cordelia is the obvious parallel to Malicia because they both play shatranji and if Cat is the parallel to Black which is obvious as well the would it mean that Cat will join the good guys in the end ? She is still a Squire and its a neutral name.

On the other hand the white knight is already taken by the justice guy but he can die anytime however careful he might be anyways.

It would be weird because we know that Cat already sacrificed too much to turn back and There is also Heiress(or Diabolist) in the background cooking something up.

My best guess would be Heiress and Cat teaming up in the end because they parallel the current set up of roles. The empress + her knight.

just some shower thoughts
