I suppose I'd want to prepare for 3 scenarios: solo survival in the wilderness; survival in civilization where I have a tech advantage; and survival in a civilized, but alien, environment.

For the first two, I agree with [[/u/genericaccounter]] about the kindle, cellphone and [[https://www.emergencykits.com/emergency-supplies/radios-and-communication/multi-function-radios/multi-function-emergency-radio-ep-emr1000/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2JjOlIzw3AIVD5J-Ch0aoQEEEAQYAiABEgIWwvD_BwE][emergency charger]]. The radio would let you tell if you're truly alone, or if you're just a ways away from civilization.

I'd wear long sleeve button-down shirts, with a saturated dye, and a [[https://www.indochino.com/product/eastleigh-navy-dobby-shirt][stitched pattern]]. If I'm alone, it's nice to have long sleeves to protect me from sunlight and bugs. If I end up in the past, the unfathomably-expensive stitching marks me as a prince from some undiscovered country. If I appear in somewhere foreign, I'm wearing civilized, somewhat-decorative clothing.

I'd avoid tactical knives in case I end up somewhere civilized. Instead, I'd go with something like [[https://www.rei.com/product/884528/opinel-no8-beechwood-handle-knife][this]] which is useful but non-threatening.

For miscellaneous other survival stuff, I'd carry a metal, non-insulating water bottle. A hat, some sunglasses & sunscreen, a water filter, and a couple space blankets.

If I was truly paranoid, I'd have a tiny bad with some modern, domesticated plant seeds forgotten somewhere in the backpack. It would take basically no weight, but having access to modern wheat, potatoes, carrots and the like would be astoundingly useful if I found myself doing long-time survival away from earth.
