Except that the "perfect rationalist" thing probably means they can fake social interaction like a psychopath does if they think doing so will further their goal. Most won't crave it for it's intrinsic value (one could have as it's goal "be popular"), but if it'd be easier to build more dykes if the local government was on board a dyke maximizer could decide that running for mayor further's it goals and put in the work needed to develop the people and political skills to make the campaign successful.

Also I really don't think they'd be very destructive. At least the ones that are would be the ones with a directly destructive goal (like an "arson maximizer"). But they'd also be rare as wills are are to begin with per OP, a selection of random goals will include only a subset that are directly destructive, and destructive wills are going to live shorter lives as they draw attention and get hunted down by their nature while benign wills can go unnoticed or be exploited and protected by those their goal benefits.

Remember they'll rationally evaluate consequences and if they have to choose between their rock briefly traveling less than 30mph while they guide it around a building and being imprisoned for knocking down a building and therefore unable to keep the rock at 30mph for the duration of their sentence, they'd choose to divert the rock to avoid the building. That's why I think they'd mostly only become destructive when a human tries to exploit them (excepting the ones with destructive goals, which tend not to last)
