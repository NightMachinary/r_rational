A fan of portal fantasy and former Boy Scout has decided he'd like to "be prepared" for stumbling into a radically different universe / planet / time period.

1. What skills might he make an effort to learn or knowledge memorize in the event of a "reincarnated into a new body" scenario where all he can bring along is his mind/memories? (assume he is already a certified lifeguard and has wilderness survival and emergency preparedness skills sufficient to earn the respective merit badges, and is a High School graduate)
2. What items might he make a habit of carrying on his person at all times for dealing with sudden transport (no time to grab a bag)? (assume he usually wears cargo pants but doesn't want to pack the pockets full enough to be "uncomfortable")
3. What items might he keep in a daily carry bag/briefcase? (assume the bag also has to carry a laptop, various cords, and any normal day to day stuff for a student/job seeking recent graduate which will supplant anything less immediately useful in real life)
4. What items might he own for this purpose but not keep readily at hand (at home, in his car trunk, etc)?

In all cases items that have day to day utility or would also be useful in a more mundane emergency/survival situation are better than anything that's only useful in an actual dropped unprepared into an exotic time/place scenario.

Note: this isn't a muchkinry exercise in that the character doesn't actually expect to go to another world so it's less about hyper-optimizing and more about the character might reasonably do without going too far (intentionally ambiguous) out of his way to do so.
