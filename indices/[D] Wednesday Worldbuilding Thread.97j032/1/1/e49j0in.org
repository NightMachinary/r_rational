Mildly worse than zombies, but not as bad as mountain-lions.

My first comment is that I'd replace 'utility function' with 'goal'. Utility answers a question like "how happy are you right now?" and goal (/'target function'/'time discounted sum of future expected utility') tells you what you want to have happen in the future.

Everyone has goals. But I'm assuming that these will spirits focus on some specific and clear-to-people outcome. Like, "dig a hole" or "bask in the fact that this rock is moving at exactly 0.35 MPH".

Next, I'd note that, while I don't mind golf, I can't convincingly pretend to care about golf anecdotes for more than a couple minutes. And, like all [[https://www.reddit.com/r/totallynotrobots/][normal human people]], I'm hard-wired to enjoy conversation. But wow, extended golf anecdotes are terrible.

The Will-Demons don't like golf. They don't care about social interaction. So, they'd have an even harder time coming up with reasonably comments to fake interest. Only, Will-Demons would hate /every/ conversation topic (+/- one) as much as I hate talking listening to someone's rambling, 30-minute story about almost losing their ball.

This would make it pretty easy to spot them, even if they looked perfectly human. The lack of social interaction would mean that they have resources on the order of a crazy-hobo, or a mountain lion.

The first couple might get away with some impressive property destruction, but it shouldn't take more than a half-dozen property-destruction incidents for people to hear about them. And, I expect that the public reaction to dangerous, human-impersonating monsters is that everyone starts carrying pistols. From I'd expect the backlash to kill way more people than the demons.
