So here is a question regarding weather these creatures are either too dangerous or not particularly dangerous. In this world a number of types of spirits exist each drawn from part of humanities soul. Undead are drawn from life, the animating force, fae are hopes and dreams, angels and demons are selfless and selfish nature respectively. But those aren't the important ones. The final class of spirits, call them wills for now, through that is a placeholder, are drawn from our intellect. Each one is formed within the realm for these spirits. Once formed each one has one utility function. They will complete this at all cost. They are perfect rationalists, and cannot be turned aside or persuaded. However, the following downsides are possessed by each of them. The larger they are the greater amount of intellect they can devote to their task. This tops out at around the level of a moderately smart human. This pretty much means that they will only implement plans that can actually be thought of or understood by me with a sufficient amount of time to consider the problem. They have no other powers. They cannot self modify or merge together to become bigger.They can update their models and metamodels in the event of new data though. They look reasonably human but can always be identified by the appropriate tests. All the information presented above is well known amongst the people who deal with spirits, but since they are the rarest spirit, it is not necessarily understood by regular people. Would these creatures be not as dangerous as regular monsters or horrifying destruction levels?
