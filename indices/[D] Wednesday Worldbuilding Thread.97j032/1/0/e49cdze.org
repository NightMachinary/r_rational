They sound less dangerous than humans IMO.

They aren't any smarter than humans and if you can figure out what they're optimizing for you they become more predictable than humans. They'd also be easier to deter from behaving badly with threat of consequences. So the law should work pretty well for keeping them in line.

The biggest risks I can see would be people trying to exploit a will and doing it badly (the will that cleans your house was assured by your heirs who hate you that they can cover up it's involvement if it smothers you in your sleep and it knows from observing them they are much less messy than you are), and people mistaking them for a more common type of spirit it's behavior superficially resembles (it turns out the "angel" helping out around the hospital was a "bandage maximizer" and it's been re-opening wounds so they'd need to be rebandaged because it "doesn't count" if you just manufacture unused bandages).
