I guess it depends on what their goals are, but I think they're a lot more dangerous than humans. They're as intelligent as a moderately smart human, but they also have perfect rationality and pursue their goal at all costs? They're clearly more competent than humans. Like, I'm pretty smart, but I don't have much willpower, there are many skills I could learn but I don't because I don't find them interesting. That's why I'm not starting a company and taking over the world or whatever. It sounds like the Wills don't have this problem, they'd just go do whatever they needed to do, learn whatever skills they needed to learn with no compunctions for morality either. And I have to assume they'll be good at hiding what they are from everybody else. They sound like super-sociopaths, or something.

They are intelligent, they would be able to avoid anything which would require them to take one of those "tests" that could reveal them (as being revealed would obviously be contrary to their goals). If they aren't excellent actors by default, they would be able to practice and become so.

So how dangerous they are depends on what their goals are.

The other responses right now seem to imagine Wills that are acting very sub-optimally or predictably and would thus be easily defeated. But the Wills are described as perfect rationalists, so the Wills would just choose to... not act like that.
