I think everytime this experiment has been proposed, ever since Plato's Republic, the process and result of a program to breed and train rulers has been a smokescreen for the author's political views. Basically, if you personally want to write on the topic, firstly be aware that there is no rational answer as there is no successful solution in real life. There can only perhaps be a process of rationally educating someone in rationality and superficial leadership traits. However, that must in turn be rooted in the program's implicit support from the rest of the ruling caste for its results.

So educating the ruler is only the last step. The first step is contriving the rest of society to obey such a ruler and contribute the resources required to support them. Equally important is ensuring that society does not revolt, which will probably requiring its utter defanging to ensure the ruler caste's dominance.

In the end, educating a ruler from a ruler caste is unlikely to result in an especially just or desirable ruler. If society is too vibrant, expansive, and rich, the ruling caste will be obsolete due to the fact that as generations pass, inevitably their training will fall out of date, or you leave their training at the mercy of too many uncertain factors. A society where a ruling caste can be a viable solution requires that a static, unevolving or only slowly changing society where the ruler is also materially superior to those whom he governs so that revolution is unthinkable and impossible. Thus, don't train a human to rule humans. Train an AI, or an immortal superbeing.
