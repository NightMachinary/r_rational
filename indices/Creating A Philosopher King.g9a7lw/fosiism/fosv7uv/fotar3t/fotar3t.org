We have performed a lot of research on leadership and yet it seems that great people nonetheless rise due to structural factors in society as much as by their own merits and the skills they learn. In addition, a great human leader designed by the system may still fall short if great natural leaders in the population are allowed to rise to oppose them. That's why macro-level control over society to ensure the dominance of the elect is necessary.
