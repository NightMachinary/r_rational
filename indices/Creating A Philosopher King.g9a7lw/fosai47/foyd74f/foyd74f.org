  There's nothing specifically genetic about effective leadership.

If you're suggesting that genetics do not play any role in leadership, this is not true. There is definitely a genetic correlation to intelligence as we've found in studies of genetically-identical twins who were raised by different families. There is also a [[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Denis_Bratko/publication/23302097_A_Behavioral_Genetic_Study_of_Trait_Emotional_Intelligence/links/00b7d517fa7861daf8000000/A-Behavioral-Genetic-Study-of-Trait-Emotional-Intelligence.pdf][genetic component to emotional intelligence]] which has shown fairly strong correlations with things like assertiveness (0.74), adaptability (0.73), social awareness (0.80), impulsiveness (0.76), etc. High intelligence and emotional intelligence are both definitely contributors to effective leadership, so the impact of genetic correlations with those traits has to be taken into consideration.

Of course, as you've said, beauty will play a role in leadership as well. For example, people tend to correlate [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4020344/][beauty with trustworthiness]] which would obviously improve leadership effectiveness, even if there no difference in real leadership ability.

Of course, to tie this back into the original topic, if we can fiddle with genes to improve IQ, EQ, and beauty, there's no reason to limit this to a leadership caste. An entire world of smart, emotionally-intelligent and beautiful people is probably better for everyone than a world where only a small leadership caste is like that.
