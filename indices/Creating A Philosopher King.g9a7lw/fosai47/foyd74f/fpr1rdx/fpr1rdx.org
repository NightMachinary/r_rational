I think the problem is more, the way those things interact to make an actual good leader is way too complex to be genetically programmed somehow. You can have someone who's smart and puts that intelligence to evil. You can have someone who's empathic and lets that make him indecisive when he needs to make a hard call for the sake of the needs of the many.
