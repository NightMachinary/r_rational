  "being a good leader" isn't a quantifiable thing to begin with
#+end_quote

I'd argue it's pretty measurable. It can really be broken down into three pieces: a compulsion to take responsibility, the ability to make good decisions, and the ability to persuade people to go along with your decisions.

Now, none of those are /simple/ things to quantify, but I wouldn't say that any of them are unquantifiable.

  it'd be interesting to go through the process, if only to think around the issue "what makes a good leader?". After all that's a useful question to answer even if you want to design, for example, improvements to the democratic model, rather than replace it with the rule of chosen superhumans.

Although figuring out what makes a good leader would be /somewhat/ useful for a democracy (especially a /representative/ democracy), there's no guarantee that the public won't just throw out whatever criteria you use, dismissing those leaders as "elites," and elect an inexperienced, temperamental, narcissistic sociopath. It seems like it'd be more useful to first determine what makes a good /electorate/, and strive for that.
