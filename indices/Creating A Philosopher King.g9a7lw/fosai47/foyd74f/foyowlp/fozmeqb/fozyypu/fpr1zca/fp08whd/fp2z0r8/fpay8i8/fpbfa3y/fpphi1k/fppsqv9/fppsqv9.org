  Expecting that charisma should be purely definable based on personality traits is assuming a model of charisma I reject from the outset.
#+end_quote

Okay, then, explain your model of charisma. I can't argue against a concept something based on a definition of that that is hidden from me. That's all that I'm asking for, and I apologize if my phrasing made it seem otherwise.

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/cutting-edge-leadership/201103/measuring-personal-charisma-emotional-intelligence-and-savoir][Now you can measure charisma in plenty of different ways]]
#+end_quote

Interestingly, that link describes charisma as "more as a set of skills, rather than traits." I reject the idea that a skill is genetic. Either a propensity or a talent for a specific skill might be genetic, but skills are, by definition, both learned and teachable.

That one link you've provided has basically wrapped up my /entire argument/ that charisma is more acquired than genetic for me, so, thanks for that.

#+begin_quote
  you can't escape the inability to feasibly measure charisma without social interaction
#+end_quote

Sure you can. If charisma is something intrinsic to a person, it should be measurable by, say, studying them giving a performance in an empty theatre. If you can't measure it without an audience, then you're implicitly conceding that charisma exists /in/ the mind of the audience, and not in the speaker.

#+begin_quote
  I absolutely still think he's charismatic.
#+end_quote

Let's go back to that link you gave, and run down the list of components of charisma.

#+begin_quote
  Emotional Expressiveness - this is the ability to accurately and spontaneously convey emotional messages through nonverbal channels.
#+end_quote

Okay, I'll grant Trump the ability to convey emotion. Pass.

#+begin_quote
  Emotional Sensitivity is ability to read and accurately "decode" others' emotions and read nonverbal cues (of attitudes, dominance, etc).
#+end_quote

Here's a quote of someone who had been involved in a conversation with Trump:

#+begin_quote
  Now, at a fair table with four people, each person is entitled to 25 percent of the conversation, right? I'd say Melania got about 0.1 percent, maybe. I got about 1 percent. And the governor, Jesse, he got about 3 percent. Trump took the rest. It got so bad I had to go outside and burn one before returning to the monologue monopoly. Listen, I came up through Hollywood, so I've seen narcissists. This guy was beyond. It blew my mind.
#+end_quote

Ability to read social cues? Fail.

#+begin_quote
  Emotional Control is both the ability to regulate and control your emotional communication/expressions, but also the ability to hide felt emotions, or mask them with a different emotion
#+end_quote

This is the guy who sends out 1:00 a.m. Tweetstorms because he sees an insulting ad on TV. Fail.

#+begin_quote
  Social Expressiveness - think of "Extraversion" and being able to "work a room" or speak spontaneously and fluidly on just about any topic. Charismatic people are verbally fluent and articulate.
#+end_quote

HAHAHAHA Fail.

#+begin_quote
  Social Sensitivity is being able to read the characteristics and "demands" of the social situation in order to behave appropriately. Charismatic people are in tune, both with others' emotions (ES above), but also with the social climate.
#+end_quote

This is the guy who was laughed at by the United Nations, for claiming that he had accomplished more than almost any administration, and then said that he "didn't expect it." Fail.

#+begin_quote
  Social Control is self-confidence in social situations that develops because the individual has sophisticated and well-developed role playing skills.
#+end_quote

You know what? Pass. The last thing I'd claim Donald Trump to be is "not self-confident."

So, of the six metrics on which the link you provided would measure charisma, Trump massively, /brutally/ fails at four of them. Objectively, measuring qualities and skills that pertain to /him/, he isn't charismatic.

And yet he has a cult of personality. This is a strong indicator, to me, at least, that the charisma /needed/ to lead a cult of personality is something /attributed/ by the followers, not something /possessed/ by the leader.

#+begin_quote
  I was pointing out that if it were true they were being selected for the parts of intelligence that comprise IQ
#+end_quote

First, as the first sentence of the paragraph you've quoted should have made clear, I /don't/ take that for granted, and, as my other post should have made even clearer, I don't trust IQ as a reliable indicator of all that much (certainly not of anything genetic).

We're into the weeds of hypotheticals at this point, so I'm just going to drop this thread.

#+begin_quote
  I was very specifically talking about charisma.
#+end_quote

No, you were /very specifically/ talking about how creativity wasn't useful for /decision making capability/ (which was clear when I quoted you). Being able to /convey the reasons why you are making a decision/ (which requires a measure of creativity if you don't want to sound like an algorithm) is a useful skill for a leader.

#+begin_quote
  As for those parts of the test current AI could do well on, that doesn't say much because the questions were picked for their predictive power among humans. The fact that say reaction time has some ability to predict performance on other intelligence tests in humans doesn't mean it requires intelligence.
#+end_quote

Yes! YES! This, exactly! /This/ is what I'm trying to say.

You are trying to use a metric that has been found to be useful in humans to /create something transhuman/. The thing that you're trying to create /isn't subject to the same statistics as a typical human/, because /you've been tinkering with the mechanisms responsible for those statistics/.

Whatever it is you're creating, while perhaps not a full speciation (i.e. it might still be able to interbreed with stock humans), will be a statistical outlier, in probably more things than just intelligence, therefore /the metrics that are predictive in normal humans won't work as well/.

#+begin_quote
  In the wikipedia article all of the mechanisms actually described are based on people gaming the metric.
#+end_quote

There's only one mechanism actually described in that article (targeting number of cars sold instead of profit, leading to a drop-off in profit).

Regardless, that example should be enough to illustrate my point: those car salespeople aren't trying to "game a system;" they're trying to /meet a target/. They aren't /trying/ to make less profit for their company; on the contrary, they probably have other incentives (e.g. a commission) to sell at the highest price that they can. However, because their primary target is the number of cars sold, they aim to sell more cars, which leads to them lowering prices, which destroys the statistical correlation between "cars sold" and "profit."

If you call "trying to meet the target given" "gaming the metric," then sure, call it "gaming." But that car dealership is directly analogous to what I'm trying to say here. If you make a higher IQ the target, with the goal of having a higher level of intelligence useful to leadership, then all you're guaranteed to get is a higher IQ; you might not /get/ someone who can intelligently perform the kinds of tasks that leadership entails. Instead, you should create /new tests/ that *directly measure the thing you want to maximize*. That's what I've been trying to say all along.

#+begin_quote
  The test is normalized to a bell curve because that makes it the best at distinguishing relative performance for most of the population (those in the bulge).
#+end_quote

Which makes it /far less useful/ when trying to /engineer a statistical outlier./

#+begin_quote
  trying to construct an absolute intelligence test is a fool's errand.
#+end_quote

Perhaps. But trying to construct a test, much more hands-on than the very abstract, theoretical IQ test, that measures /leadership intelligence/ should be a lot easier.

My point is, once again, that /you don't get what you don't target/. I'm not going to get back into whether IQ usefully measures /any/ quality, but, at the very least, IQ doesn't measure intelligence /as it pertains to leadership ability./ So, if you're going to engineer a leadership caste (and, since it's been a while since I've said this, I think you /absolutely shouldn't/, that's a *horrible idea,* /DON'T DO THAT/), you should, as your target for intelligence, be using a more /practical metric for the kind of intelligence you want to optimize for./
