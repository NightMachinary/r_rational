  Again, I'm not saying that there aren't genetic changes that you could make, that would be advantageous to creating a talented leader; I made that point myself in my first post on the topic. However, per the Department of Pulling Numbers out of My Ass, I think that where the typical, untrained person starts with maybe 20% of maximum leadership potential, whereas you could get your perfect leader up to 30% when they're untrained, and the average person would top out at 99.9% of maximum potential, to your perfect leader's 100%.

The key thing you don't seem to be giving enough credence charisma's has a hugely disproportionate effect on leader quality, and charisma is plausibly as genetic as intelligence. Whether you want to win elections or just build a cult of personality around oneself charisma is possibly the most important trait for leaders that aren't unaccountable (and even dictators are ultimately accountable their countries elite). Other traits obviously matter, but ultimately it tends to be charisma that determines who can get and maintain power.

  That's what my Goodhat's Law invocation is referring to; not some idea that there would be a malaria/sickle-cell anemia tradeoff, but that changing IQ from a passive measure of "how smart is this person?" to a target of "how smart can we make this person" is a recipe for a hyperfocus on improving only the aspects of intelligence that IQ is good at measuring, which does not include all of the aspects which are useful for leadership... Are the types of intelligence that would allow someone to internalize history and geography, culture and custom, originality and creativity - are those useful in a leader? I would think they absolutely are. And if you select for "intelligence" based solely on the results of an IQ test, they're exactly the kinds of intelligence you aren't going to get.

The issue with this is the long history of tests designed to measure the kinds of non-standard intelligence you describe end up either failing basic test criterion or mapping onto IQ, with the potential addition of specific personality traits and knowledge. There's no indication there's some special component of intelligence that wasn't being selected for in ashkenazi. Since were that the case you'd expect them to be underrepresented among certain specific groups/professions relative to their intelligence and you'd expect noticeable differences in specific aptitudes between ashkenazi and IQ matched controls.\\
It's also strange that you seem to be dismissing IQ, based on things it isn't reasonable to expect from it. Most of what you describe boils down to knowledge and preference. As for creativity that is just another type of intelligence which many IQ tests already measure in various ways.

So while alleles that are only beneficial when heterozygous, and conditions like torsion dystonia seem like potential traps, they are only issues for specific approaches and shouldn't be hard to counter. After all genes that are harmful when homogenous should have that effect be more obvious in data samples than any small individual impact on G. Plus as mentioned in the article directly engineering heterozygous disease alleles isn't even an issue if those individuals know what that entails.

Ultimately while you could get negative side effects by say selecting for rare alleles associated with intelligence most proposals don't do that, and should produce geniuses who are also extremely healthy and attractive compared to natural geniuses (who are already on average healthier). When positive traits are so heavily correlated and much of the variance comes down to mutation load it just doesn't seem like you just should expect weird negative side effects like you're suggesting.
