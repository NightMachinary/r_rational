  For each of these people, about half of the United States of America's population of 300,000,000 people see one of them as charismatic, and the other as a corrupt, idiotic, hateful leader, worthy of prison if not assassination. There are probably a few exceptions who see neither or both as charismatic, but they are exceptions...\\
  Again, I concede that physical attractiveness is probably part of "charisma," but, beyond that, if you want me to believe that you could breed charisma into a leader, beyond simple physical attractiveness and emotional intelligence, you'll have to convince me that charisma is something that can be: defined exactly, in terms of the person's personality, objectively measured in the absence of a crowd of supporters, and statistically correlated with something genetic.

You're setting unreasonably high standard for the existence of natural charisma here: The fact people's perception of charisma differs isn't a point against charisma, because it's hard to imagine how things could be any other way. After all perception of intelligence or almost any positive trait is going to be heavily dictated by how much somebody likes that individual. It's also strange that you would demand that charisma be defined in terms of specific personality traits, since if charisma /is/ a trait like intelligence it might correlate with certain personality traits (like intelligence does) but wouldn't be defined based on them. It's important to distinguish what would be the charisma equivalent of "G" from purely the results that charisma produces. Since there are plenty of other factors to charisma linked outcomes like elections: Such as having popular policies and how much people dislike your opposition. With that in mind it would be unreasonable to expect a 1:1 correlation between getting elected and charisma. After all Obama and Reagan had landslide victories whereas Trump lost the popular vote and was running against another very unpopular candidate.

You bring up "exceptions" that even people who don't agree with them could still admit are charismatic, but I think this a larger problem for your model than think. Trying to reduce charisma to just attractiveness, emotional intelligence and training doesn't really work. After all one must remember that increasing charisma is a big market in politics and other areas, however despite the massive effort put into it there's just no training that can reliably turn attractive emotionally intelligent people into somebody like JFK. If charisma wasn't a genetic trait like intelligence or personality the fact incredibly high charisma is both rare and only trainable to a very limited extent would be inexplicable. To put it another way given politicians who have a fair amount of emotional intelligence and attractiveness aren't uncommon, and politicians already pay big bucks on trying to be more charismatic so if charisma is nothing extra /you shouldn't expect to see it be such a limiting factor/.

  Yes. Some aspects of intelligence are not easily tested for. That's a large part of my point.

This seems like a cop out, after all charisma isn't too nebulous for researchers to have developed metrics for. Plus even if you don't trust those metrics (after all they hardly have the same evidentiary basis that IQ has) there are other ways you can go about measuring it observationally. The point of my paragraph about ashkenazi in the previous comment which you seem to have missed, was to point out that if there existed a Goodhart's law effect working like you propose, then that should be detectable. Even if you don't have a direct metric for the parts of intelligence you are concerned about importantly they should still be something you can select for by getting enough data from groups you should expect to possess those traits.\\
Overall though while I think there's solid basis for thinking there is a charisma equivalent to G, I don't think there are likely to be additional major components of intelligence that don't strongly correlate to IQ. Simply based on the track record of alternative intelligence tests which seem to invariably end up either having massive methodological problems or are heavily correlated with IQ.

  NO! Again, I haven't taken a formal IQ test, but I've heard them described, and I don't remember, a storytelling component. Or musical composition. Or artistic ability. Or... really, anything else that would showcase creativity.
#+end_quote

While I'm not sure about the WAIS IV, plenty of other tests like the one I took [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity#Personal_assessment][include word association components which are one type of creativity test.]] That being said because creativity is almost impossible to disentangled from intelligence in measurement (and because creativity tests don't correlate as strongly with each other as different intelligence tests do) I've become agnostic as to its exact relation to G.\\
While I think it would be good to also select for creativity (though that will already happen to varying degree with certain intelligence tests), I'm not actually sure very high creativity is that useful for leaders. Since their job is generally not to come up with new policy ideas and deciding between existing policies isn't that creativity based.

#+begin_quote
  Wait, wait, wait. You're willing to attribute something as nebulous as charisma to genetics, but not something as easily observable as, say, musical ability as a separate component of intelligence?
#+end_quote

I was referring to the part of your post that I had quoted, I certainly agree musical ability is genetic (as Turkheimer's first law of genetics goes all human behavioral traits are heritable). I just didn't go into that since you weren't arguing musical aptitude is an important leader quality.

#+begin_quote
  What I'm saying is that you do not get what you don't select for (or, at least, not at a rate better than random chance). If you believe, as I do, that "intelligence" encompasses more than verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed, then, if you select based on IQ (which measures those four things), you will not get someone who is more intelligent than average in any kinds of intelligence that are not included in one of those four things.

Goodhart's law isn't a universal law: it works as a heuristic under certain conditions and can't be applied the way you're trying to here. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law][The whole point of Goodhart's law is that when a metric is used as a target it creates incentives to game the metric, thus reducing the original efficacy of that metric.]] There's a number of reasons however why that doesn't apply to this situation though, foremost being that IQ tests can't be gamed to significantly increase one's adult scores short of cheating.
