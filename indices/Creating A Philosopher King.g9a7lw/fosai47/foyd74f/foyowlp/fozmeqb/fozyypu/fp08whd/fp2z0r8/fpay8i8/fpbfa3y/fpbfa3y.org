  You're setting unreasonably high standard for the existence of natural charisma here
#+end_quote

Let's quote my standard, again:

#+begin_quote
  if you want me to believe that you could breed charisma into a leader, beyond simple physical attractiveness and emotional intelligence, you'll have to convince me that charisma is something that can be:

  - defined exactly, in terms of the person's personality,
  - objectively measured in the absence of a crowd of supporters, and
  - statistically correlated with something genetic.
#+end_quote

What, exactly, about that standard is too high? I'm asking for something that you can give me an exact definition for, measure, and correlate with genetics (and I'm only asking for the third because your assertion is that it's a genetic quality).

If you want to argue that the definition of "charisma" is so obvious as to not require an exact definition, the best definition for charisma I've seen is its sociological one, which describes [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charisma]["a particular type of leader who uses values-based, symbolic, and emotion-laden leader signaling."]] If you can convince me /that's/ genetic, I'll be impressed. Otherwise, find me a better, /objective/ definition of what charisma is, and how we might recognize it in a person, absent a crowd to be inspired by the person.

#+begin_quote
  With that in mind it would be unreasonable to expect a 1:1 correlation between getting elected and charisma. After all Obama and Reagan had landslide victories whereas Trump lost the popular vote and was running against another very unpopular candidate.
#+end_quote

If I read your argument correctly, you're saying that Donald Trump isn't charismatic. To quote [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/g9a7lw/creating_a_philosopher_king/fp08whd/?context=3][you from an earlier post]]:

#+begin_quote
  Whether you want to win elections or just build a cult of personality around oneself charisma is possibly the most important trait for leaders that aren't unaccountable
#+end_quote

If your argument is that Trump is not charismatic, are you arguing that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cults_of_personality#United_States][he doesn't have a cult of personality]], or are you withdrawing your argument that charisma is the most important trait in establishing one?

If you're /not/ arguing that Donald Trump isn't charismatic, can you please clarify your argument, because you've obviously lost me.

#+begin_quote
  This seems like a cop out, after all charisma isn't too nebulous for researchers to have developed metrics for.
#+end_quote

Citation, please.

#+begin_quote
  The point of my paragraph about ashkenazi in the previous comment which you seem to have missed, was to point out that if there existed a Goodhart's law effect working like you propose, then that should be detectable.
#+end_quote

Why would there be a Goodhart's law effect working on them? The IQ test wasn't developed until the 20th Century, and the postulated increase of intelligence occurred because of selective events centuries before that. How can a metric become a target, and thus cease to be a good metric, hundreds of years before that metric existed?

#+begin_quote
  I don't think there are likely to be additional major components of intelligence that don't strongly correlate to IQ.
#+end_quote

That's an interesting assertion. Verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, processing speed - these are all things that you can test a computer for. Would you say that a computer that scores highly on these four metrics is more intelligent than a human?

#+begin_quote
  plenty of other tests like the one I took include word association components which are one type of creativity test
#+end_quote

Huh. I thought that would be a link to the test you took. That would have been much more useful to your point than a Wikipedia article which, a few paragraphs further down, goes into depth about why experts are uncertain about how intelligence relates to creativity.

#+begin_quote
  I'm not actually sure very high creativity is that useful for leaders. Since their job is generally not to come up with new policy ideas and deciding between existing policies isn't that creativity based.
#+end_quote

You wouldn't include, for example, giving a speech as a useful leadership skill? Or would you delegate speechwriting to someone other than your leader?

#+begin_quote
  as Turkheimer's first law of genetics goes all human behavioral traits are heritable
#+end_quote

[[https://www.geneticshumanagency.org/gha/robert-plomins-use-of-my-ideas-in-blueprint/][I think you're misusing that]].

#+begin_quote
  I just didn't go into that since you weren't arguing musical aptitude is an important leader quality.
#+end_quote

My point in bringing up musical ability is that it is an example of a form of intelligence that is not easily correlated to IQ, and which shows very clear tendencies to run in families. If one such form of intelligence exists, it seems obvious to me that others would as well, including those which are valuable to leadership.

#+begin_quote
  The whole point of Goodhart's law is that when a metric is used as a target it creates incentives to game the metric, thus reducing the original efficacy of that metric.
#+end_quote

Where does it say that in the article you're linking?

Goodhart's law, as originally stated is:

#+begin_quote
  Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.
#+end_quote

My point is that you're placing pressure on IQ scores for genetic selection. There may be a correlation between IQ scores and other forms of intelligence beyond math and language, but that correlation is likely to collapse when you start using IQ as a target for genetic improvement.
