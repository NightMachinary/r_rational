  What, exactly, about that standard is too high? I'm asking for something that you can give me an exact definition for, measure, and correlate with genetics (and I'm only asking for the third because your assertion is that it's a genetic quality).
#+end_quote

Did you somehow miss the entire paragraph addressing that? Of your three demands only the last one makes sense. Expecting that charisma should be purely definable based on personality traits is assuming a model of charisma I reject from the outset. [[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/cutting-edge-leadership/201103/measuring-personal-charisma-emotional-intelligence-and-savoir][Now you can measure charisma in plenty of different ways]], but you can't escape the inability to feasibly measure charisma without social interaction. [[https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/08/15/psychologists-have-developed-the-first-scientific-definition-and-test-of-everyday-charisma/][This study]] is notable in that it found charisma to be a factor not explainable by intelligence and OCEAN scores. There's also studies [[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/born-to-rule-scientists-uncover-gene-that-may-help-create-natural-leaders-8452499.html][linking leadership to various genes]], but a frustrating lack of genetic studies that used the aforementioned charisma psychometrics rather than just looking for genes more common among leaders.

  If your argument is that Trump is not charismatic, are you arguing that he doesn't have a cult of personality, or are you withdrawing your argument that charisma is the most important trait in establishing one?
#+end_quote

My point was that Trump winning the way he did provided much less evidence of his charisma than a landslide election not based on negative partisanship. While I think Trump isn't that charismatic by presidential standards (that's just obvious from his approval ratings), I absolutely still think he's charismatic. After all you need a fair amount of charisma to attract a massive cult of personality around yourself and his track record before office speaks to his charisma as well, even if it was being used to con people.

  Why would there be a Goodhart's law effect working on them? The IQ test wasn't developed until the 20th Century, and the postulated increase of intelligence occurred because of selective events centuries before that. How can a metric become a target, and thus cease to be a good metric, hundreds of years before that metric existed?

You previously said:

  So, let's say that I take the premise for granted that Ashkenazi Jews were naturally selected to be better merchants than the average European because of centuries spent as Europe's mercantile society, and thus are genetically better at math and language skills. That's exactly the kind of intelligence I have already stated that I would expect to see reflected on an IQ test.
#+end_quote

I was pointing out that if it were true they were being selected for the parts of intelligence that comprise IQ then you should within your model expect some noticeable mediocrity elsewhere. While you claim the kind of intelligence you're talking about is hard to measure, it would strain credulity to say it has large effects, yet can't be detected.

  You wouldn't include, for example, giving a speech as a useful leadership skill? Or would you delegate speechwriting to someone other than your leader?
#+end_quote

I was very specifically talking about charisma. While speechwriting may be slightly helped by creativity I doubt it would make a substantial difference. When you think about the most famous presidential speeches many of them had ghostwriters and few of them aren't fairly predictable.

#+begin_quote
  That's an interesting assertion. Verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, processing speed - these are all things that you can test a computer for. Would you say that a computer that scores highly on these four metrics is more intelligent than a human?
#+end_quote

No formulation of the major IQ tests is going to be possible for an AI to do well on without a fair deal of general intelligence. As for those parts of the test current AI could do well on, that doesn't say much because the questions were picked for their predictive power among humans. The fact that say reaction time has some ability to predict performance on other intelligence tests in humans doesn't mean it requires intelligence.

#+begin_quote
  My point is that you're placing pressure on IQ scores for genetic selection. There may be a correlation between IQ scores and other forms of intelligence beyond math and language, but that correlation is likely to collapse when you start using IQ as a target for genetic improvement.
#+end_quote

This still misses why Goodhart's Law works. In the wikipedia article /all of the mechanisms actually described are based on people gaming the metric/. If you want to use Goodhart's Law totally differently than all the examples then you actually need to know what the mechanism would be. If people can't game IQ tests and IQ correlates to other areas of intelligence it doesn't directly test, then how /exactly/ would this correlation disappear as a consequence of selecting for IQ?

As for your second reply, everything you talk about is common knowledge among those who work with IQ (the increase in average IQ over time is called the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect][Flynn Effect]]). It seems as though you are objecting to IQ as it's misused by laymen: The test is normalized to a bell curve because that makes it the best at distinguishing relative performance for most of the population (those in the bulge). Intelligence may not in absolute terms be distributed normally (like a lot of polygenic traits it's probably a skewed bell curve), but trying to construct an absolute intelligence test is a fool's errand.

The test doesn't measure intelligence in absolute terms /and this isn't a bad thing/, because the test still has impressive predictive power and works for the purposes scientists need it to.
