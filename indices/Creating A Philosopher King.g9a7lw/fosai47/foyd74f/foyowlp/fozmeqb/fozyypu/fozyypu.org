  I think it's probably like sports aptitude in this sense, which means the upper limit on leader quality is still genetics limited.
#+end_quote

Well, sure. I mean, to use the most obvious example, experience in leadership roles produces a higher quality leader, and the amount of leadership experience a person can gain is genetics-limited. So, just in that one sense (and probably a bunch of others), you can't reach the extreme maximum of "total leadership quality" in a human being without genetic engineering.

However, past a certain extent, with most qualities, there is a diminishing return, past which point the resources you commit to improving the quality aren't worth the cost of continuing that increase. To continue with the same example: past leadership experience improves present leadership quality and future leadership results. However, the difference between zero years' worth of leadership experience and one year's worth is a lot more than the difference between twenty and twenty-one years' worth, despite still being one year's worth of experience in each case.

If we genetically engineered our perfect leader to live ten years longer, would that create a higher ceiling for better leadership from that person? Probably. A /measurably/ higher ceiling? Maybe. A /significantly/ higher ceiling? I doubt it.

Yes, the leadership quality you will be able to achieve with genetic engineering will be higher, and perhaps even measurably higher, than you could without. But I don't think it would be /significantly/ measurably higher. Sports aptitude is physics-limited, so the physical properties of the body are significant. Leadership aptitude is largely two pieces: the ability to make good decisions (and, possibly, to make good decisions /quickly/), and the ability to convince other people to follow your decisions, neither of which has limits in physics that you would need genetic aptitude to overcome.

Again, I'm not saying that there aren't genetic changes that you could make, that would be advantageous to creating a talented leader; I made that point myself in my first post on the topic. However, per the Department of Pulling Numbers out of My Ass, I think that where the typical, untrained person starts with maybe 20% of maximum leadership potential, whereas you could get your perfect leader up to 30% when they're untrained, and the average person would top out at 99.9% of maximum potential, to your perfect leader's 100%.

  Your talk of Goodhart's Law in the context of genetic engineering for intelligence rests on some questionable assumptions about genetics which this SSC article goes into
#+end_quote

I'm... not sure what questionable assumptions that you're talking about. I'm not saying "Selecting for intelligence will inevitably make us genetically less fit" because that's not what evolutionary fitness is. My point is that "intelligence" is hard to pin down, and selecting for IQ will bias the results towards a /specific/ kind of intelligence.

To use the article's example of the Askenazi Jews:

#+begin_quote
  Several highly mercantile societies independently evolved the same set of genes producing higher IQ. The most notable were the Ashkenazi Jews, who have an average IQ 12-15 points higher than their European neighbors and whose genes show strong signatures of recent selection for intelligence; this most likely occurred during the Middle Ages when they were the mercantile class of Europe, since non-Ashkenazi Jews show no such effect.
#+end_quote

What kind of skills would be useful for a merchant? Math skills and linguistic skills would top the list, in my opinion, followed by salesmanship.

Now, let's go back to my criticism of IQ:

#+begin_quote
  The problem with boosting IQ is that *it corresponds to a very specific subset of "intelligence:" mainly math skills, language skills,* and abstract thinking.
#+end_quote

So, let's say that I take the premise for granted that Ashkenazi Jews were naturally selected to be better merchants than the average European because of centuries spent as Europe's mercantile society, and thus are genetically better at math and language skills. That's *exactly the kind of intelligence I have already stated that I would expect to see reflected on an IQ test.*

Myself, I'm pretty good at language skills and mathematics; I would expect to have a decently high IQ score if I ever had it formally measured. However, I couldn't point out Sudan on a map; I couldn't tell you which countries were involved in the Hundred Years' War, let alone the reason why it was fought; I can't compose music that doesn't sound identical to whatever I was listening to a half-hour before; I can't intuit what gift should be brought over to someone's house when they invite me. I am in possession of a very specific and limited subset of the quality that you might call "intelligence;" it just happens to be the part that lends itself to being measured by the IQ test.

Are the types of intelligence that would allow someone to internalize history and geography, culture and custom, originality and creativity - are those useful in a leader? I would think they /absolutely/ are. And if you select for "intelligence" based solely on the results of an IQ test, they're exactly the kinds of intelligence you /aren't going to get/.

/That's/ what my Goodhat's Law invocation is referring to; not some idea that there would be a malaria/sickle-cell anemia tradeoff, but that changing IQ from a passive measure of "how smart is this person?" to a target of "how smart can we /make/ this person" is a recipe for a hyperfocus on improving only the aspects of intelligence that IQ is good at measuring, which does not include all of the aspects which are useful for leadership.
