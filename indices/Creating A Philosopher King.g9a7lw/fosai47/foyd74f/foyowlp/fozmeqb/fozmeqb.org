  What I mean is that the aspects of leadership that relate to "nurture" are so much more important than they completely overwhelm the "nature" aspects. A "natural-born leader" without leadership training will probably be completely outperformed by someone who is less genetically suited, but has been properly trained for the role.

I think it's probably like sports aptitude in this sense, which means the upper limit on leader quality is still genetics limited. As some people just have tremendous natural charisma that can't be really be "faked" (if anyone figured out how for one you'd expect more charismatic politicians).

Your talk of Goodhart's Law in the context of genetic engineering for intelligence rests on some questionable assumptions about genetics which this SSC article goes into: [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/04/myers-race-car-versus-the-general-fitness-factor/]]

Essentially given what we know about genetics, it's entirely possible you could create geniuses by simply giving an embryo the most common allele on every part of their genome. Since mutation load seems to be a really massive factor in both intelligence and other complex polygenetic traits.
