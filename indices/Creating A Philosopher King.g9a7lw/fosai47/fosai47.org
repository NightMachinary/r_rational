  I've recently been entertaining the idea of a 'Leader Caste' which would be best suited for administrative and civil work.
#+end_quote

That seems like just a bad idea on its face. Human history (since agriculture, anyway) has been the story of groups getting power and then using that power to benefit themselves over other groups, often inventing reasons why they deserve those advantages. Democracy, as it has been said, may be a horrible system of government, but it's better than anything else we've tried because it's designed to be resistant to that particular flaw.

  From there my mind went off the tracks and wondered if it would be possible to train a human being to be a good leader from birth. Would some form of genetic engineering be required, or would nurture suffice?
#+end_quote

I think nurture would be sufficient. There's nothing specifically genetic about effective leadership. That said, there are several obvious choices to make if you're going to make genetic changes for the sake of leadership - making the person physically attractive always helps, and removing some of the natural illogical biases would definitely be a good idea.

As for what you'd want to learn, critical thinking would be number one, paying special attention to what kinds of logical fallacies the human mind are easily led into (both to avoid them yourself and to exploit/protect against in your followers), followed by public speaking, and building a vocabulary of languages and cultures to encompass everyone you're going to be leading. They should learn enough to be a jack of all trades in all of the major aspects of the economy, to know how they support and interact with each other.

And have them travel between all of the various cultures of the world and interact with people, families, and villages from each of them, to recognize that they are people exactly the same as they are.

  Exactly how would such a child's life be structured, and what if the experiment were to fail?
#+end_quote

If you were actually to try this (again, I think shutting entire classes of people out from power is a bad idea, both historically and ethically), the best way to do it would be scientifically. Make a list of all of the aspects you want in a leader, and try different approaches to raising children until you have one that yields the best results.

  Is there anything you've read that has a similar premise?
#+end_quote

I remember a short story set in a prison, where everyone in that prison had been raised into a caste, including an administrative/leadership caste, and they try to plot an escape; I don't remember the name of the story or the author.
