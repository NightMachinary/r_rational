Oh, you're gonna love [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]]. The world is set up sort of like you describe, with Nobles being biologically augmented with not just intellect-enhancing features, but also enhanced durability and other neat gadgets. The main character, of course, is not one of those Nobles, but a young experiment of the Academies. Him and his friends are sort of state-sponsored terrorists tracking down and eliminating resistance against the Crown and the Academies. Nobles don't come into play until a few arcs in, but when they do, they steal every damn scene they're in.
