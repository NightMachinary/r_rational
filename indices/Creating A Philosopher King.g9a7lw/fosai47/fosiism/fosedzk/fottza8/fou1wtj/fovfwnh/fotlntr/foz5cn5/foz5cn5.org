That system in Rex Electi is, um, literally how Rome worked? Of course membership into the ruling class wasn't random, it was a wealth and lineage based class system. But ultimately the nature of the Roman political elite was roughly similar to that. Children of the elite are given a education and are expected to work their way through the ranks of the political system via success in business, administration, law, war and whatever they could get their mitts in. It worked for a time but didn't exactly prevent the rise of shitty Consuls or the ascension of people like Sulla who were kings in all but name. And eventually it was the power struggles between this learned political class that broke the Republic and help bring about the Empire in the first place.

Even during the Empire it was never solidly feudal style familial succession. Most emperors were already well situated as statesmen or generals before their ascension. Becoming Emperor involved a lot of politicking, a lot of adoptions, a lot of co-Emperors, and a LOT of coups and ascension of Emperors via the popular support of the soldiers, far more so than the title just being passed to an heir. The Roman political class persisted through all of this and, again, didn't exactly prevent shitty Emperors.

Honestly, to get ideas for this subject it'd be just as well to read history. Read what the Romans or Greeks or Persians or whoever thought about statesmanship and their political philosophy. Read about the civil service examinations of Imperial China, that sort of thing.
