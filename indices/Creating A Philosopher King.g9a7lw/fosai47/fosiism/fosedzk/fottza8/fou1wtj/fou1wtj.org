There are a ton of problems with this premise.

1. Creating a caste hierarchy diminishes empathy by its very nature. You could get around this with genetic engineering to increase empathy; however, lots of perfectly good, empathetic people are willing to stop their empathy at some pre-defined boundary. See every genocide ever.
2. Leadership is not some mythical quality that solves all problems. A good instinct for leadership without a functional bureaucracy means an ineffective leader.
3. We already know how to create a bureaucratic caste and it works really well. Examinations to enter, pre-defined performance reviews, universally defined salaries and advancement for self-chosen educational activities, internal accountability review boards, etc. Basically take people, tell them they can work a job for life with fair pay and no worries, as long as they are educated and do a good job.
4. Genetic engineering would help, because it could raise average intelligence from on the current scale 100 to 120. But we already have a ton of people on the normal end of the curve already.
5. Our mechanisms for making functional bureaucracy work astonishingly well by Historical standards. Most Westernized democracies live under some of the most effective least corrupt governments ever by Historical standards.
