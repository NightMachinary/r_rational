Training-to-be-a-leader is something that has already happened in noble or politician families, to various degrees of success. 'The Prince' comes to mind first as a book filled with good insights (and with nice examples!), but I'm sure there must be far more about good obtaining, holding onto, and using power.

I liked the idea of the 'Philosopher King' when first coming across it out of context, and then when learning more about the details and the context became rather disillusioned with it after gaining the impression that it was originally propounded by a philosopher--essentially someone saying "You know the thing that I do, that currently has little association with ability to hold onto or do much with power? We should put people like ME in charge." A bit like a certain Greg Egan book in which a character says "We should let ME mostly shape the Singularity, because I'm a casual science journalist, and so who better?"--bias of viewing one's own field with a better impression than others might view one's field.
