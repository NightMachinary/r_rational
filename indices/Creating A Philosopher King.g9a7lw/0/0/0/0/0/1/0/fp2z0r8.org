  The key thing you don't seem to be giving enough credence charisma's has a hugely disproportionate effect on leader quality, and charisma is plausibly as genetic as intelligence.
#+end_quote

I disagree. Mostly.

First, I think you're getting things backwards. People don't follow leaders who are charismatic; they attribute charisma to leaders that they follow. The best example of this could be seen in the last two US Presidents. Barack Obama is erudite, with an even temperament, and a kind demeanor; Donald Trump is plainspoken, emotional, and quick on the attack against those he sees as the enemy.

For each of these people, about half of the United States of America's population of 300,000,000 people see one of them as charismatic, and the other as a corrupt, idiotic, hateful leader, worthy of prison if not assassination. There are probably a few exceptions who see neither or both as charismatic, but they are exceptions.

If two people with such completely polar opposite personalities can both be considered "charismatic" by people who agree with them, and "not charismatic" by people who don't, it seems to indicate that charisma is subjective to the observer, and thus is very unlikely to be attributable to genetics.

Again, I concede that physical attractiveness is probably part of "charisma," but, beyond that, if you want me to believe that you could breed charisma into a leader, beyond simple physical attractiveness and emotional intelligence, you'll have to convince me that charisma is something that can be:

- defined exactly, in terms of the person's personality,
- objectively measured in the absence of a crowd of supporters, and
- statistically correlated with something genetic.

As it is, I'm not convinced.

  The issue with this is the long history of tests designed to measure the kinds of non-standard intelligence you describe end up either failing basic test criterion or mapping onto IQ, with the potential addition of specific personality traits and knowledge.
#+end_quote

Yes. /Some aspects of intelligence are not easily tested for./ That's a large part of my point.

#+begin_quote
  It's also strange that you seem to be dismissing IQ, based on things it isn't reasonable to expect from it.
#+end_quote

No, I'm dismissing IQ as a stand-alone metric for intelligence *because* it isn't reasonable to expect certain things from it.

#+begin_quote
  Most of what you describe boils down to knowledge and preference.
#+end_quote

Wait, wait, wait. You're willing to attribute something as nebulous as charisma to genetics, but not something as easily observable as, say, musical ability as a separate component of intelligence?

#+begin_quote
  As for creativity that is just another type of intelligence
#+end_quote

YES!

#+begin_quote
  which many IQ tests already measure in various ways.
#+end_quote

NO! Again, I haven't taken a formal IQ test, but I've heard them described, and I don't remember, a storytelling component. Or musical composition. Or artistic ability. Or... really, anything else that would showcase creativity.

The current gold-standard IQ test, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wechsler_Adult_Intelligence_Scale#WAIS-IV][WAIS-IV]], measures the following:

- Verbal Comprehension
- Perceptual Reasoning
- Working Memory
- Processing Speed

So, language skills (verbal comprehension), logic/math (perceptual reasoning), short-term recall and manipulation, and speed of answering the questions. Where do you see creativity represented /anywhere/ there?

#+begin_quote
  Blah blah blah (the last two paragraphs of your post).
#+end_quote

Stop arguing against a point that I never made, and that I have explicitly said that I'm not making. To quote myself /in the post you're replying to/ (emphasis added):

#+begin_quote
  That's what my Goodhat's Law invocation is referring to; *not some idea that there would be a malaria/sickle-cell anemia tradeoff,* but that changing IQ from a passive measure of "how smart is this person?" to a target of "how smart can we make this person" is a recipe for a hyperfocus on improving only the aspects of intelligence that IQ is good at measuring, which does not include all of the aspects which are useful for leadership."
#+end_quote

I will clarify it again, since you don't seem to be getting it:

I do not think there will be negative health or intelligence impacts for selection based on IQ.

Once again: *I do not think there will be negative health or intelligence impacts for selection based on IQ.*

For those in the back who are having trouble hearing, like, seemingly, yourself: *I DO NOT THINK THERE WILL BE NEGATIVE HEALTH OR INTELLIGENCE IMPACTS FOR SELECTION BASED ON IQ.*

What I'm /saying/ is that *you do not get what you don't select for* (or, at least, not at a rate better than random chance). If you believe, as I do, that "intelligence" encompasses more than verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed, then, if you select based on IQ (which measures those four things), you will not get someone who is more intelligent than average in any kinds of intelligence that are /not/ included in one of those four things.

And, if you don't think that there are forms of intelligence that are useful for leadership beyond verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed (or that every form of useful intelligence maps 100%, genetically, to one or more of those four traits), then I'm not going to try to convince you.
