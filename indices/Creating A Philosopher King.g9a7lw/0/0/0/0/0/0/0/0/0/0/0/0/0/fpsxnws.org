Yeah, I guess I was thinking about defining a leader with a bit more precision than that, but I see where you're coming from. For instance, how the "party primary" system can provide incentives to run as a more extremist candidate, where an open primary might attract more centrist candidates.

Yes, I suppose I can see how having a broad definition of the leader you want to be electing could help design the electoral system.

It just feels a bit undemocratic to design a governing system with the deliberate intention of shutting out a certain kind of person from being elected, even with the best rationale behind it, and less so to build a system that a system where anyone can, in theory, be elected, and then instilling a preference towards effective leadership within the electorate.

That said, I certainly agree that removing incentives, and adding disincentives, for corrupt behaviour is a necessary part of any project to rebuild democracy. But I see that less acting as an incentive for leader quality, and more as putting limits on the authority that anyone, even a saint, could have. There's a saying that "If people were angels, we wouldn't need government; if governors were angels, we wouldn't need restrictions to hold them accountable." Reversing the latter part of that, if you install proper accountability into an office, you /don't need/ the people you appoint/elect to that office to be angels. You can trust the restrictions of the office, so you don't have to trust the person.

Of course, if the mechanisms holding them accountable become corrupt, then you're right back in the same mess, but I think that applies to the incentive/disincentive motivation as well.
