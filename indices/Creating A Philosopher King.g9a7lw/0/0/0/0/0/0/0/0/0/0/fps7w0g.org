My take on that is that the electorate is also shaped by the electoral system. Like for example a First Past The Post system encourages two party systems; but two party systems encourage thinking about issues in sets of binary answers, which is horribly reductive and produces polarisation, which degenerates in... the kind of shit we see now in the US. Not saying it's /all/ the electoral system, of course, but the two things are linked in a feedback loop.

No system is perfect and no system can resist the dogged, persistent assault of an electorate hellbent hard enough on self-harm. Because after all democracy isn't about government being good or bad; it's about government being /what the people wants/, and if the people really wants bad government, well, it would be undemocratic to deny it to them. But we can still design the system so that it at leasts forces the electorate to exercise the kind of skills and mental habits that tend to produce more sensible decision-making.

One thing I'm a big support of for example is: more politics even at lower levels of daily life. Too many people never have to grapple with the reality of compromise and the difficulties of managing anything bigger than their own home, and so don't recognise these problems at the higher levels of government, and end up lumping together a honest and well-meaning politician who simply happens to not succeed entirely at maintaining their promises with a grifter who never had any intention to do so in the first place. Having more personal experience of a similar reality on a smaller scale might help people empathise and understand better what's involved in making the sausage, so to speak; and that would make them better judges of politicians. Another thing I'd be in favour is issue-based voting. Don't vote in a President and a whole Parliament that has to do everything. Vote each individual Minister - Economy, Defence, Environment, and so on. If I want less tax but also more environmental protections don't force me to pick between the only options are "left" and "right", let me express myself. And if that means that politicians from different parties will have to get to grips with each other within the same government, good! Let them discuss, let them compromise. That IS politics, that is what represents the actual conflicts within the nation. They'll have less incentives for slinging mud at each other if they know they may have to lay in the same bed. We've been too worried about efficiency in governance and too little about said governance actually doing its job of representing the people, and the result is a major loss of democracy. There's people who are basically /never/ heard because their vote is always drowned out in a different majority. For them, life isn't that different than it would be if they were living under a monarchy; it's just that their "king" is other people.
