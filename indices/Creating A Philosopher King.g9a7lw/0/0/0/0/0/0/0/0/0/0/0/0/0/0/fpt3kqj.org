  It just feels a bit undemocratic to design a governing system with the deliberate intention of shutting out a certain kind of person from being elected, even with the best rationale behind it, and less so to build a system that a system where anyone can, in theory, be elected, and then instilling a preference towards effective leadership within the electorate.

Isn't that what all democratic systems do? It was the original intent of the Electoral College in the US too. Democracy isn't absolute; you need some hard lines that can't just be legally budged even by majority decisions, such as human rights or the democratic form itself. Because the people may be sovereign, but should not be an /absolute/ sovereign; 60% of people can't vote to kill the remaining 40%. There's always a tradeoff between popular will and the rule of law, and this is about that. All decisions about the system will incentivise one or another kind of leader, because the meta-game, so to speak, tends to optimise itself around the rules. Inaction is the same as action - both lead to a biased outcome, just a different one.

  Reversing the latter part of that, if you install proper accountability into an office, you don't need the people you appoint/elect to that office to be angels. You can trust the restrictions of the office, so you don't have to trust the person. Of course, if the mechanisms holding them accountable become corrupt, then you're right back in the same mess, but I think that applies to the incentive/disincentive motivation as well.

All you can do is build defences and trenches. If there is a minority that tries to subvert the system, those might slow them down long enough for the majority to take back control. If there's a majority truly bent on tearing everything down, it's just a matter of time. No castle is impregnable if everyone is trying to ram its gate and no one is defending it.
