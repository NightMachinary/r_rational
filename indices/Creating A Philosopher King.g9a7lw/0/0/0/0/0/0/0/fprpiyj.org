  True, but here obviously the question is more general, as in, can you define some sort of LQ (Leadership Quotient) that is measurable, genetically inheritable, and could reliably make for better leader material?

It's a good question. If I were designing such a project, that would be the first question I would put up for study.

  Goodhat's Law still hangs on the issue (always easier to game a test that actually master anything...)
#+end_quote

That's the thing: it's impossible to game a metric that /actually measures the quality you are trying to optimize/. I mean, yes, you can /cheat/ the metric, but "inputting bad data" isn't what Goodhart's law is trying to describe; that law describes a breakdown in the statistical relationship between the quality being /measured/ and the quality being /optimized for/. If they're the /same quality/, there obviously can't be such a breakdown; there will always be a 100% statistical correlation between a quality and itself.

If you create a metric that actually measures the quality you are trying to instill in your future leaders, the only way to actually boost that metric (short of outright cheating) is by boosting the quality.

Developing such a metric is, of course, easier said than done, because if you get the metric even slightly wrong, it is /absolutely/ vulnerable to Goodhart's law (which is why I'm so adamant that using IQ, as opposed to a metric developed from scratch for this project, is a bad idea). Luckily, we're not actually trying to develop a leadership caste, so actually, scientifically, rigorously constructing a metric to use for LQ isn't something we actually have to do.
