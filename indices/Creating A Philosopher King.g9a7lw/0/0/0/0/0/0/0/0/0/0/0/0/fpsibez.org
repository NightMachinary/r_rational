I guess my point is, the two things go hand in hand. If you can identify the most desirable qualities, you can try to design a system in which those qualities map more closely to what's actually necessary to win.

For example one could argue that the way e.g. an electoral debate is set up may promote one or another style of argumentation. If you let two people shout over each other unchallenged you're more likely to have the loudest jerk come off as "the winner" than if you put them in a situation which promotes a calmer approach to answering, or that forces them to face the facts if they try to falsify them. I think the same could apply to electoral and political systems too. You want to make them straight up /unappealing/ to the sort of entitled narcissists who wish for power for power's sake, or at least able to control and neutralise them. "A single President with nigh unlimited executive power" for example really is /not/ a good way to do that. The entire symbolism, ritual and civic religion surrounding the office itself matter too to that end.
