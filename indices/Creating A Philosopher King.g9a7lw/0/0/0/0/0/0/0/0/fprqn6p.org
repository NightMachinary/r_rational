  it's impossible to game a metric that actually measures the quality you are trying to optimize
#+end_quote

My implication was more that no metric will ever actually measure 100% the thing you're trying to optimise, because "being a good leader" isn't a quantifiable thing to begin with. By turning into one or more numbers you're automatically reducing its complexity, mapping it into a smaller state-space and thus losing information.

  Developing such a metric is, of course, easier said than done, because if you get the metric even slightly wrong, it is absolutely vulnerable to Goodhart's law (which is why I'm so adamant that using IQ, as opposed to a metric developed from scratch for this project, is a bad idea). Luckily, we're not actually trying to develop a leadership caste, so actually, scientifically, rigorously constructing a metric to use for LQ isn't something we actually have to do.

Yeah, precisely. Though even without wanting to go all eugenic aristocracy... it'd be interesting to go through the process, if only to think around the issue "what makes a good leader?". After all that's a useful question to answer even if you want to design, for example, improvements to the democratic model, rather than replace it with the rule of chosen superhumans. We certainly are in sore need of that, and I think making improvements forward would be a good protection against being pulled backwards. I don't think the place we are in right now is likely to be stable; half the world thinks it's too authoritarian, and the remaining half that it's not authoritarian enough.
