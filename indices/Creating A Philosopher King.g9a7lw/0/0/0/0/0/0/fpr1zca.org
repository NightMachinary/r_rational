  Are the types of intelligence that would allow someone to internalize history and geography, culture and custom, originality and creativity - are those useful in a leader? I would think they absolutely are. And if you select for "intelligence" based solely on the results of an IQ test, they're exactly the kinds of intelligence you aren't going to get.

True, but here obviously the question is more general, as in, can you define some sort of LQ (Leadership Quotient) that is measurable, genetically inheritable, and could reliably make for better leader material? Probably not either, and Goodhat's Law still hangs on the issue (always easier to game a test that actually master anything...), but it wouldn't have the specific problems that IQ has.
