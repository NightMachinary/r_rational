Oh, absolutely. I can't disagree with any of that (I live in a country with a FPTP electoral system that hasn't been reduced to two parties, but it's hard to deny that power mainly flows back-and-forth between the two biggest parties). Figuring out the best qualities for an /electoral system/, or whether we want to include more direct democracy (e.g. deliberative democracy, or liquid democracy) are good questions at any time.

I just think trying to figure out the best model for a /politician/ needs to come /after/ improving the electoral system and the electorate, because if your electorate isn't going to vote for better politicians, the effort spent improving them will be wasted.
