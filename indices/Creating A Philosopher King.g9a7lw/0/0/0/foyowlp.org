  If you're suggesting that genetics do not play any role in leadership, this is not true.
#+end_quote

No, that's not what I meant at all.

What I mean is that the aspects of leadership that relate to "nurture" are so much more important than they completely overwhelm the "nature" aspects. A "natural-born leader" without leadership training will probably be completely outperformed by someone who is less genetically suited, but has been properly trained for the role.

  Of course, to tie this back into the original topic, if we can fiddle with genes to improve IQ, EQ, and beauty, there's no reason to limit this to a leadership caste.

That's another one of those ideas that seem good on the surface, but become problematic the more you think about them.

Let's leave aside beauty entirely, which is difficult to define objectively and universally.

The problem with boosting IQ is that it corresponds to a very specific subset of "intelligence:" mainly math skills, language skills, and abstract thinking. And, fair enough, when people are good at those, they're generally smart in other ways as well. The problem is that the IQ test seems particularly vulnerable to Goodhart's law (when a metric becomes a target, it ceases to be a good metric). You'd end up with these people who are good at taking the IQ test, but not at applying intelligence practically.

I'm not as familiar with EQ, but I imagine it would be vulnerable to Goodhart's Law as well.

Tinkering with people's intelligence through genetics seems like a crapshoot: sure, it could go really well, but I can imagine just as many ways it could go really poorly. Cybernetic augmentation (adding processing and memory capacity to brains, but leaving the underlying wetware mostly unaltered) seems like a much better option.
