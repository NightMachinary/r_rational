Well in Rex Electi these leaders are very much grown rather than found - the rejects who are unsuited either intellectually or dispositionally are weeded out in childhood, leaving a cream of the crop to pass a series of tests when they reach their teenage years. It's sort of like the Hunger Games, though the losers don't die. Instead they become the new Emperor's advisors.
