I think that you're not thinking meta enough to have any chances of success. No matter how you initially resolve the nature/nurture question, the /main/ problem is how to set up the whole system to prevent its erosion, otherwise it's doomed from the beginning (like irl Rome was).

This is not something we have figured out irl, even though we are really incentivized to. Democracy and regulated free market economy is our best approximation.

So don't think what combination of eugenics and education the 'leader caste' would employ. Think what mechanisms would force feedback to ensure the 'leader caste' has a vested interest in raising well-being of other castes. Then think what mechanisms would prevent the leader caste from dismantling the feedback loop. Basically, think what would happen if the worst possible individual gets to be the Leader, think how the worst possible leader is stopped and replaced. Don't think how to create the best potential leader.

edit: there was too much 'would'
