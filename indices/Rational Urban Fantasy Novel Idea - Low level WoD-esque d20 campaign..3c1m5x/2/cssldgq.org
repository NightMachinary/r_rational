Check out Dungeon World or other Apocalypse World spin-offs that are on a 2d6 system. It works out so that most rolls (the 7-9 range) are 'partial successes' in which you run with the improv situation of 'yes you succeed, but you also typically expose yourself to a) danger b) retribution or c) cost.'

Also, every time you fail, you get XP. It encourages people to take risks and play up their weaknesses as well as their strengths for moments of awesome and moments of character building (aka I want more XP!)
