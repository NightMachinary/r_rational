The bones of the rationalist modern-horror/fantasy novel I'm currently writing came from a New World of Darkness campaign. I think it works pretty well for realism, personally: far better than most other systems like D&D or Dresden Files.

Fun as those are, and conducive to storytelling, the players are very much meant to feel like heroes in them. In WoD, especially as a base human, there's nothing distinguishing you from anyone else, and you can very easily die or be badly maimed if you aren't careful, which promotes the kind of playstyle that reflects a realistic approach to problem-solving and story.
