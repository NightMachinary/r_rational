The Mistborn Adventure Game is a heavily story-based system that's geared towards people telling stories together. It naturally lives in that setting, but I think could probably be extracted from it fairly easily. [[http://www.crafty-games.com/files/File/Mistborn_Adventure_Game_Primer-Pre-Release-v3.pdf][You can read the rules primer here [PDF]]]. It's very "dice light", and I think sort of the model that I would use for my own RPG.
