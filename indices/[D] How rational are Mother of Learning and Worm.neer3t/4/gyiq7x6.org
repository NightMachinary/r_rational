Neither is rationalist at all.

MoL is maybe 80th percentile rational relative to its genre. I'd be hard-pressed to define that genre concisely, but "a little more general than 'fantasy timeloop'" is a sort of accurate description. Not specifically meant for that goal, but aiming in the same general direction. Definitely more rational than [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][its obvious inspiration]], which was pretty good on that front itself. (This may contribute to its popularity in spite of the other aspects which make it infamous.)

Worm is maybe 60th percentile rational relative to the average superhero deconstruction fiction. Compared to Watchmen and Wild Cards, the most well-known entries that predate it, it's about typical. Relative to actual 'traditional' superhero stories it's off the charts, but that's mostly just traditional superhero stories being /completely insane/.
