Worm is, like, the opposite of rational. All of its characters are drunk on heavy, heavy self-deception and rationalization, and have a tendency of punching each other into submission without attempting the basic practice of stringing together a coherent argument of "Why I believe/do what I believe/do."

I got it, shard mind-fuckery, Jack mind-fuckery, Simurgh-flavored domino mind-fuckery and Contessa-flavored domino mind-fuckery makes people violence-engines with their reasoning in tatters. I just...have a hard time caring about any of them, or deem them rational in any sense.
