Worm really, really is not. Many people complain about the Spoiler, and the Other Spoiler, but my main problem with the entire story is that the main character used her power very badly, and despite a supposed focus on combat creativity, essentially nobody ever prepared to fight her, or used any of the gazillion obvious counters.

It is not a spoiler at this point she controls bugs, I suppose, but given that power, ever showing her face is the height of foolishness. She has no defenses at all, and can fight by remote. The proper place and person to be is a random civilian /in a bunker/.

And anyone preparing to do anything where they might encounter her, should really have shown up bearing Raid and Fire.
