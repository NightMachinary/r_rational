Your title doesn't match the body of your post. Rationalist is different than rational. If rational fiction is a genre where characters try to figure out the gears that make their worlds turn, rationalist fiction is using the scientific method to do so. Really, only a few popular series do that; HPMOR, for example, but also Pokemon: Origin of Species. MoL and Worm are rational, but not explicitly rational/ist/ from what I recall.
