The character dynamics of the main three loopers are nearly unchanged from TB to MoL; there isn't a Hinata-analogue but it's really blatant. The main character has comparatively tiny raw power but really good control that they hone to get even better, plus a gift for mental tricks, and is contrasted with a primary looper who's the secondary character and has obscene amounts of raw power. The timeline of how Zorian/Sakura get pulled in also looks the same. Then we learn that the reason for the whole thing is that the Forces Of Goodâ„¢ manipulated the primary looper into it, the main characters cycle through power ups and huge-downer Wham Episodes, and some of the largest boosts come from the loopers allying together rather than any new skill they pick up for themselves. CED, by contrast, follows the original looper, doesn't have any of those things, and is a pure power fantasy for the main character.

It's not word for word, but it's /clearly/ directly inspired by Time Braid. With the serial numbers filed off and the BDSM and hurt-comfort stripped out.
