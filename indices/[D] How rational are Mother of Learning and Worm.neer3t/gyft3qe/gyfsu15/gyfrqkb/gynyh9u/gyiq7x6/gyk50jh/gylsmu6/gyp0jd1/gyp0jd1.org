In a bunker, you can't follow someone, once they're out of range.And bunkers aren't necessarily where you need to fight.Mobility is a tradeoff, too of course. But she did have spider armor for durability.And she was safer than most outside, given her situational awareness.Besides the fights were either not chosen, like Mannequin going after Taylor's civilians. Or culturally tolerated crime, but with zero tolerance for lethality.Being in a bunker takes away important less-lethal options.Or they were fights against Endbringers, where the bunker won't help.Also there was never a reason to prepare for her specifically.

And Worm is not just Taylor's ego trip. She brings friends.I don't think any specific engagement would have benefited from a bunker-mentality.

EDIT: It's been years since I read Worm, though. Might be possible. But this didn't stand out to me, and I think it would have.\\
But truthfully, when the fights became an anime-clusterfuck of powers, I tended to skim them, because I wasn't able to actually visualize it back then.
