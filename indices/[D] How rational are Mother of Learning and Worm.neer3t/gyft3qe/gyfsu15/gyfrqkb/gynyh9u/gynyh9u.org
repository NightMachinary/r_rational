For people complaining about Worm characters making obviously stupid decision or unable to find obvious solution I suggest to read the real world history. Especially history of WW2 on Eastern front which is reasanobly well documented and researched (especially taking into account latests resarch). In comparison to WW2 /all/ Worms characters making decisions no worse then average WW2 officer, especailly on the Eastern Front where fog of war was especially dense for both sides and command&control loop was often broken. Scale of stupidity and inability to see obvious solutions or consequences of own actions was staggering under the pressure of real-world total war.
