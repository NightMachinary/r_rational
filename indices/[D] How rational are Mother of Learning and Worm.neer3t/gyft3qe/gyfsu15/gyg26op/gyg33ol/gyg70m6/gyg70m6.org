Well, nominally so, but I didn't really feel this conflict drive playing a role in the story - as opposed to humans just being humans. Humans by themselves have plenty of conflict drive and are generally not good at maximizing utility functions. And regarding Bakuda putting herself in the harm's way unnecessarily - well, not everyone is smart IRL as well. I'm fine with an explanation for some character's actions like "because they are crazy and dumb", as long as this explanation applies just to that character and not to the majority of them.

I think if the "conflict drive ball" were visible and distinguishable from the normal human conflict drive, it would be indistinguishable from the reader's perspective from the plain old idiot ball, just with an in-universe excuse for it. Good that Worm avoids it.
