Wildbow has gone on record saying that people overestimate how much effect the shards have on human psyche, and that most of the conflict-seeking and poor decisions that you see are just a byproduct of almost all natural triggers being in bad headspaces either from their trigger event or from the factors in their life that led to them getting a trigger event.

It's definitely still a finger on the scales in the background in a way that's antithetical to what makes rational fiction interesting, a catch-all explanation for any bad decisions he might fail to otherwise properly justify, but I really think people overplay this card as some great and terrible crime invalidating every decision made in the story when WB already came out and said that's not how he was playing it. It's a grievance I have, but only a small one.
