Oh the full text I was referencing was “realistic intellectual agency is put above established literary tropes”, which is explicitly not the case, people in Worm follow established superhero tropes because they are driven by alien experimenters/parasites to do so, instead of because it is the best choice for them, and often sacrifice rational decision making because of their conflict drive - either by placing themselves in harms way much closer to the scene than they should be (Bakuda is a big example here), or by using their powers for combat instead of civil improvement / maximum utility function - even poor Parian can't escape this. I think more generally this phrase refers to “avoiding the idiot ball” but Worm has a “driven to incredible violence and conflict ball”, and even if there's an in universe explanation for why it exists, I still wouldn't say that Worm prioritizes intellectual agency or decision making over tropes, that would defeat the purpose of the story.
