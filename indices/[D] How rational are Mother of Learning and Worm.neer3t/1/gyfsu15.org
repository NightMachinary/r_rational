Worm - Explicitly not rationalist contains some rational tropes. To use the definitions in the sidebar:

Thoughtful behaviour in honest pursuit of goals - Almost every decision a person makes in Worm is reasonably motivated by something but the proportion of the time that decision is “I thought really hard and made a well reasoned decision” is not very large.

Consequences of behavior on world/plot - Yes. Choices have real, large, and far reaching consequences in worm.

Realistic intellectual agency - Absolutely not a part of Worm and I can't say why not without spoilers.

Creative / Intelligent problem solving - This is probably the reason most people are initially drawn to Worm.

Examination of goals and motives - I think some characters this is clear, other are not, but it's all at least consistent mostly.

Intellectual pay off: Worm is very long and has a lot of climactic action. Your mileage may vary for how particularly effective these are.

Aspiring rationalism: No. Worm has characteristics of rational fiction but does not primarily feature a rationalist character.

Thoughtful Worldbuilding: Worm is a genre deconstruction that provides an answer for why a superhero world could be “like that” within the context of things happening for a reason. Your willingness to accept the reasons given may vary. This is probably the second biggest reason it is popular on this subreddit.
