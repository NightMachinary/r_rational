So, on the khala: I had a thought today about the protoss. I'm curious if I want to make them all rational, and if so, they should all be roughly equally intelligent- or at least, should be when they consciously maintain their connection to the khala. What are your thoughts on the way the khala will influence their intelligence and their rationalism?
