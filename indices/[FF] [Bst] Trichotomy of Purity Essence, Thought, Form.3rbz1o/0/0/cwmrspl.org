My thought was to build my universe with similar ideas as to the overmind/Amon dynamic, and how kerrigan plays in there, but with several liberties taken as to the motivation of all involved, and their powers of rationalism. Start with Kerrigan as a ghost, and her interaction with certain less-changed characters (leaving raynor be, making mengsk smarter but sub-level-3) and then building from there into her integration into the swarm, and how she responds to that and moves from there.

The current list of character changes I would make, based on my current thoughts that I've had today, would be to keep Mengsk mostly the same, as above- don't touch Raynor, he's a perfect 'norm' to play against- and push up Overmind/Amon/Tass/Zera... And play the game from there.
