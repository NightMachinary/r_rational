That works for me.

One thing that bugged me about SC2 is how Kerrigan seems perfectly fine with reverting to her human form in HotS, and how she only desired to switch back in order to kill Mengsk. She should be more conflicted about it.

Also the whole prophecy thing is bullshit. I don't know why Metzen has to shove it into a scifi story.
