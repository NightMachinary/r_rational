The lore is vague about what the Khala means for the Protoss. We know that the ancient Protoss warrior Adun used it to end the Aeon of Strife and unite (almost) all the Protoss together. It seems to depend on the psychic capabilities that every Protoss innately has, and the Dark Templar underwent self-mutilation to sever themselves from it.

It follows then that it's some sort of telepathic network, but the details are unknown. Also of note is that the Dark Templar still retain the ability to telepathically communicate with each other and with the other Protoss despite their severance from the Khala. It's also different from the Zerg hivemind, because the Protoss retain their individuality instead of being wholly subservient to a single entity.

I propose that it's basically an empathic network. Protoss connected to the Khala can innately sense the presence of other connected Protoss around them, and can sense their emotions and pain. Full transmission of thoughts does not occur unless both Protoss will it.

This has some profound implications. On the one hand it creates a deep sense of belonging, of a higher purpose (since they can actually sense the well-being of the collective whole) and a desire for strict in-group harmony without resorting to violence, all of which contributed to the caste system they instituted.

On the other hand it also creates an us-vs-them philosophy. Everyone connected to the Khala are /Protoss/, everyone else are vermin. The Dark Templar were the worst of all, since they deliberately chose to break away from the ideal. It also explains how the Protoss saw themselves as custodians of the galaxy, and their general contempt for humanity (the majority of whom are non-psychic).

I don't think it necessarily leads to rationality. The caste system they instituted in fact led to stagnation of the sciences, in return for social stability. Their current technological prowess is a result of the gifts the Xel'Naga gave them more than anything (who the primitive Protoss worshiped as gods). They'd have an edge over Terrans in quickly distributing thoughts and ideas, but at the same time their society would actively suppress radically new theories and emphasize staying true to tradition.

What made Tassadar special is that he recognized the need to change their ways and reach out to the Terrans and Dark Templar so that they could adapt to the dire situation the arrival of the Zerg forced upon them. He strikes me as very rational in comparison to the average Protoss zealot.
