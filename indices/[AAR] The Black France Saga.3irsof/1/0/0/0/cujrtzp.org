It's got a lot of good points and bad points. It's one of my favorite games of all time, but I will try to be objective/impartial.

Good:

- Very large, complex game. 70+ factions, 2000+ different units, hundreds of spells, hundreds of magic items. Game is huge. Modding for additional content is easy (need text editor and paint) and so the mod community is also pretty big. Can play for a really long time and not see everything even in vanilla game.

- Complex, interesting battles. Large scale strategy and small scale battles. Battles are set up with issuing orders to leaders and troops, including scripts of spells to cast, then resolved simultaneously for both sides (all action happens on central server, without human input other than setting up plans for the army). Zero execution or quick reflexes or whatever, completely turn-based.

- Really interesting lore. Game is based on many different mythologies and factions. Includes Norse giants, Celtic elves, Japanese Oni, Hindu Naga, Hebrew giants, Cthulhu-based illithids and aboleths, Zoroastrian flying people, and a lot of other crazy crap. A lot of lore and description and flavor to everything. In one game I am playing a faction of lizardpeople based on the mythology of Egypt, and I have started casting spells to release insane undead gods from the pits of Tartarus to serve my empire. In another, I am playing a group based on the Canaanites/Phoenicians, and am gathering slaves to sacrifice to start summoning armies of demons.

- Long games. Games are most typically played at a pace of a turn per day or less, done by Play By E-Mail. Turns can take between a couple minutes early on to over an hour by the endgame of a large empire. Games extend for in-real-life months. Some groups (steam community /v/anheim, for example) have 'blitz' games where a group of people all take turns with 5 minute maximums for several hours at a time, but I find I don't enjoy those nearly as much.

Bad:

- The graphics are basically 90's sprites more-or-less. Easy to mod and create new content for, and you get used to it, but still not really pretty.

- User interface is not great. As you learn and use hotkeys it goes from bad to tolerable (never really great).

- Game balance isn't great. Multiplayer FFA nature of the game ameliorates this a little (people tend to gang up on factions perceived to be strong). Also, luck plays a big part in the game sometimes (both for good and bad).

- AI opponents are very unsophisticated, so playing online against humans is like 100x better than playing against AI.

- Occasional obtuse or opaque mechanics.

Steam occasionally has it for sale for as much as 50% off or more - if you aren't already into turn based strategy games I'd recommend waiting until it's on sale.
