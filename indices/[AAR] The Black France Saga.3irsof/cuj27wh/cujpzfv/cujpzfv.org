I don't really play Paradox games, so my following of the game can only be superficial. That said, what I understood of the story I enjoyed, and I would not be at all adverse to occasional posts in this vein.

(I personally get my strategy fix through Dominions 4, and haven't played much of any of the Paradox games at all).
