#+begin_quote
  Create a closed loop of runespace that's locked from the inside - the "pull" request to move something in or out always has to be confirmed from inside. Indestructible panic room.

  Do the opposite. Nearly unescapable prison.

Does that work? Could someone else not make a rune targeted at the inside of your panic room? If you can throw your voice five miles without needing a receiving rune on the other end, what prevents you from teleporting into a closed space that you don't physically have access to?

Similarly for the inescapable prison, if you have the materials you ought to be able to teleport yourself out. Drawing runes in your own faeces is gross, but it makes it effectively impossible to keep anyone imprisoned anywhere.
