Create a closed loop of runespace that's locked from the inside - the "pull" request to move something in or out always has to be confirmed from inside. Indestructible panic room.

Do the opposite. Nearly unescapable prison.

Create a corridor of stretched space extending upwards from earth in which distance is much, much less. FTL flight.

Instead of bothering with specifics, send a spaceship in about the right place near another star. They can work out more precise coordinates.

Compress space until you initiate nuclear fusion.
