So you can warp space and teleport things? Is there anything else you can do? Those don't seem related.

Your examples sound like they're locally Euclidean, were everything is normal except the boundaries. This should cause problems on the boundaries. You know how prisms bend light because they change how fast light goes through it? If you just magically increased the volume of space instead of sticking glass there, it would have the same effect. Only now it would operate on everything moving through that space instead of just light.

Are we abandoning special relativity? Or can I teleport to Alpha Centauri, change my reference frame, teleport back, and arrive a year before I left? Also, you'd be able to alter time as well as space, since which you're altering depends on the reference frame. And altering time means creating gravitational effects.
