Hmm, hmm. Can you make "standing" portals? As in, Aperture Science "standing" portals? (If you can, although most things are still possible otherwise, what do they need to be anchored to?)

Everything is moving. There's the (optional) movement of the planets (or equivalent), but there's also the blood through your veins, the brownian motion of, well, everything... Particularly hot things. And if I make a large effect, stuff moves through it... So can you elaborate on what's known about doing this to moving things?

Sound isn't air, it's compression. You can certainly do that by sending air, but there are other ways... What forms of energy can be sent? Do hot or cold things take different runes? What if I have runes for only a subset of the thing I'm trying to send? Say, water with ice in it, but only runes for water, or ice?

For that matter, can you add or remove energy from things during transport? (I mean, strictly speaking, you're going to be adding potential energy - but what about thermal and/or kinetic?)

What observations are there about the power consumption of runes? Let's say I make something that transports an apple a kilometer directly up. Is conservation of energy conserved, as far as people can tell, or am I "creating" energy? (If you're creating energy... is the world slowly heating up due to waste energy from all this?)
