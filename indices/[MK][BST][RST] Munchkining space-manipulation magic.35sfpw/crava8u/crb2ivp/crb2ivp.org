Interesting. I'll have to do some reading on that to make sure that I can do an adequate job portraying that effect.

I'm not sure how to get around relativity. I don't want to just push Einstein off a bridge, but I also don't want to open up time travel. Would it be too stupid to go "It's magic, and somehow slips past Einstein" and have the characters /know/ that this is really weird, but not be sure how it's actually happening?
