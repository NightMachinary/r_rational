It's possible to make it so the only real boundaries that you'd see messed up when you stretch space are inside walls. Although if you build the walls before you stretch space, it will just destroy the walls. And if you don't stick walls there, the border will destroy anything that passes through it. I guess you can just stick walls on both sides of the border. Or you can claim that if the space puts too much stress on an object, it's space that gets bent. You could even make that the way the spell operates. You make a space malleable, and then you make it bigger on the inside just by pushing on the walls. And you move a rigid object through the space to get rid of all the anomalies.

If you allow any noticeable changes in time, the gravitational effects would be enormous, so I'd just say it's too difficult to use it for more than altering gravity.

If you're changing physics anyway, you're allowed to abandon relativity and use Newtonian physics. There's nothing wrong with Newtonian physics. It's not like taking special relativity and breaking the symmetry. It just has a slightly different symmetry.

You can also just make it so spells are limited by their reference frame. You could make a prism spell and move it in such a way to push any stationary object in a certain direction, but you can't have it stay still and push objects around.

What bugs me is the whole locally Euclidean thing. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tX7KQSKMtQ][This is what you get when you break Euclid's fifth postulate.]] You don't get the TARDIS.
