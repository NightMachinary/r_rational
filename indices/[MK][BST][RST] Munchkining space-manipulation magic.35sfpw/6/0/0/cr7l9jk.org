On the plus side, build a steam engine around it and you have dirt cheap unlimited electricity. Or just a steam boat or jet engine with unlimited propulsion. Or an Orion drive spaceship (though the distance would ideally have to be adjusted every fifty million meters).

The Earth's orbital eccentricity isn't big enough that distance is a problem, and if direction matters, the fact that runes work on a rotating planet means you could just have a device which always points the runes at the sun.
