You seem to be thinking that people will mostly be doing this kind of inscribing on the spot for their magic, but if you can have if X then Y triggers then it basically becomes prepared at will magic.

You want lethal gravity manipulation in a 15ft cone in front of the rune? Hold it out and think "activate". It's programmed with that trigger and does so. You want to warp and shred the space all around you in a 5ft space? Think it, it's done. Teleport? The same. You just have to have the magic prepared ahead of time.

Depending on how intelligent and sophisticated your triggers are (how the hell do runes sense what's going on?), you can be invincible fairly easily by carrying hundreds of pebbles inscribed with tiny runes that all have triggers for every conceivable type of attack (e.g. teleport away bullets, create a plane of exceedingly high gravity, implode someone's fist, teleport YOU away, move you sideways 3ft, etc.).

The system feels rather loose. What defines a large versus a small task? How do you define exactly what is to be done? How do you adjust for the rotation of the earth/planet in teleportation? There are a lot of things undefined here, which is a lot of room for you to use cheesy author fiat. If you want a system that can't be munchkined, it needs to be extremely specific.

That said, you could keep it loose, as long as you don't use it to solve problems. As some intelligent author said, the extent to which you can use magic to solve problems is inversely related to how vague it is. Very vague = solving problems is deus ex machina. Very specific = it's a tool for your characters, just like a sword or bulldozer - the reader knows exactly what it can and can't do.
