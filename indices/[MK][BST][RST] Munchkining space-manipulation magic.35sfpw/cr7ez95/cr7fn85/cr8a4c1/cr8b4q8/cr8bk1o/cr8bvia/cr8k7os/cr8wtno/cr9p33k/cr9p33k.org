One thing I would add to the system is the physics concept [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference][frame of reference]] where all motion is relative. Pick some object to act as a point to measure all motion of other objects by and account for other objects' motion as relating to the 'observing' object. This way the rotation of the planet/sun/moon doesn't matter unless you are working with interplanetary distances. This could be *the* reason why it's so hard to work with increasing distances. You need greater precision to keep track of the motions involved as the runes affect a larger and larger area. Of course this would basically mean that all of the first few miles would be equally easy to calculate concerning the difference in motion between multiple stationary objects.
