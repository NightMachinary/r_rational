You have to hold the purpose of that rune (and other attributes like how it interacts with other runes in the array) in your thoughts as you inscribe it, so your ability to inscribe multiple runes at once is limited by your ability to hold many different thoughts in your head at once. So it's possible but there is also an upper limit to how many you can do at once.
