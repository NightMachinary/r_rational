  Hmm, hmm. Can you make "standing" portals? As in, Aperture Science "standing" portals? (If you can, although most things are still possible otherwise, what do they need to be anchored to?)
#+end_quote

Maybe? To simplify, runes say "Send THING from X to Y." You have to describe what X is, as an area in space, and the same for Y. So that description of space is standing, but it's not generally visible as an Aperture Science-style portal.

  So can you elaborate on what's known about doing this to moving things?
#+end_quote

It's more that if you want to send /only/ that one moving thing, instead of constantly sending through anything that is in Area X, then you'd have to insert a timing mechanism, and the faster the object is, the more precise your timing will have to be.

I should have made that clearer. Sorry.

(Though if I wanted, I suppose that "motion" could just be one of the things that runes have to deal with, and it just so happens that some of the "default" runes that everyone has to include in a transport spell, no matter what, are involved with the small amounts of motion that most people overlook, and then some of the runes that are involved with, say, bodies, account for blood, and so on. That would also be interesting. It would also affect the next answer, since accounting for heat would now be more important. Actually, the more that I think about it, the more I like it, but I won't call it a sure thing just yet.)

  Do hot or cold things take different runes? What if I have runes for only a subset of the thing I'm trying to send? Say, water with ice in it, but only runes for water, or ice?
#+end_quote

They don't necessarily require different runes (since you can simply go "SEND: Everything in X"), but you can use different runes to specify, say, "SEND: Only things in X which are between 45 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit."

The runes don't care much for human labels, so rather than saying "ice" you would have to use runes describing "H2O at or below 32 degrees Fahrenheit."

  Sound isn't air, it's compression.
#+end_quote

Right. I thought the simplest way to send it would be by sending air, however.

#+begin_quote
  For that matter, can you add or remove energy from things during transport? (I mean, strictly speaking, you're going to be adding potential energy - but what about thermal and/or kinetic?)
#+end_quote

Not through the runes themselves, except through the manipulation of space.

#+begin_quote
  Is conservation of energy conserved, as far as people can tell, or am I "creating" energy? (If you're creating energy... is the world slowly heating up due to waste energy from all this?)
#+end_quote

You will be creating energy. This would be a problem, except that there are not many magicians. They're very worried about somebody DESTROYING EVERYTHING, and have a sort of Bayesian Conspiracy with respect to the rest of the world. It helps that you need to think in a particular way (essentially get yourself in an altered state of consciousness, but more meditative than drug-induced) so you can't pick up magic just by seeing some runes and copying them, but they are actively concerned with keeping magic secret until they can figure out a better solution.
