  So one of the first tricky bits you're going to run into is the same as in programming - runes sound like they describe things exactly.
#+end_quote

Bingo. Yes. I wasn't planning to model them after programming, but that's basically how they work.

#+begin_quote
  "The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise"
#+end_quote

Thank you for handing me that quote. That is an excellent quote.

#+begin_quote
  So, can you "build" "new" composite runes from the existing runes? That would make sense - like learning letters and words, you'd learn the core runes as well as known "formula" runes that do specific things, but are really just a collection of the basics that have been worked out.
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  I also like to put programming like this: You describe an idea well enough that it is now happening. Sounds like Runes do something similar.
#+end_quote

I like that description.

#+begin_quote
  One last thing on this note: Are runes turing-complete? That is, can you do computations with them? If you can't, and they're purely descriptive (the "where" part of a "select" query...) what are the specific action runes that are known?
#+end_quote

I am not sure. I am but an egg in the world of programming, and "Are they turing-complete?" is an important enough question that I would prefer to thoroughly refresh myself on all the ramifications of turing-completeness before I made a decision on it.

  Side question there: What're topological limits to the portal surface / volumes? Can I make a klein bottle portal surface?
#+end_quote

Hm. Possibly. But it would be pretty complicated, I imagine.

#+begin_quote
  (In the system I first explored portals in, we used this to discover that you could cast gravity shadows, gravity was absorbed like light, and there was a universal maximum velocity beyond which things degenerated into mana blobs. Wacky!)
#+end_quote

Neat!

#+begin_quote
  You can also start doing some wacky experiments with pushing on yourself through a portal, and see what happens. Is the force transferred to the anchor objects?
#+end_quote

Come to think of it, living organisms may not do very well with anything but instantaneous transportation (no standing portals). Sending from X to Y at the same time that you are sending from Y to X can turn out very badly, so standing portals are one-way, with no exactly-symmetrical counterpart. But unless you're being /very/ precise about how your standing one-way portal is working then if you put your arm through then sure, blood is traveling down through your arm and being transported, but... there is nothing sending your blood back to the rest of your body on the other side, so you've sort of, just... got a disembodied arm on the other side, with all the problems that implies.

#+begin_quote
  Water mains are portals to the reservoir, sewage pipes are portals to the recycling / waste facilities...
#+end_quote

And in the cosmology of the setting there is an "Outside" of the universe (or rather, a place which is not this universe, and where the laws of physics break down, that the magicians /think/ is Outside the universe but might actually not be), so you don't even have to teleport your pollution to a containment facility. Just dump it in the twisty chaos-hell of Outside, and... hope that there isn't anything over there that might get mad.

#+begin_quote
  Can I cut things by creating space inside of them? Can I fuse things by removing the space? Can I do a crazy fuzzy teleportation that lets me blend two things together, like that trick for pixel art to "create" more colors?
#+end_quote

Yes. No, unless you use some pretty complicated rune arrangements. Maybe-- I would have to think a little more on that.
