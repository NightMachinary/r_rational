If you can use control runes which sense an environment and make the appropriate changes to the space-bending runes to accommodate those changes, you can do so very, very much.

Portal to the moon? Control runes tracking the moon, or runes on the moon which measure the distance and direction to the corresponding runes on the planet.

Indestructible infinity-tanking armor. Anything which hits the surface of the armor falls into a two-mile-wide hollow sphere where gravity is set to point away from the center. If something wants to hit the wearer, it has to pass through the armor's 'surface' and then manage to fly a mile straight 'up'. At the centerpoint there's a complex knot of space with the only opening being the size of a marble. Anything which flies directly into that marble comes out the other size because the internal space in it represents a straight tunnel with a giant loop coming off it which is where the wearer's physical self is located (and linked to the outside armor via magical sensors and motion translators).

Suitably shaped portal under the feet - you no longer technically have a planet underneath you, so you're not affected by its gravity.

Suitably sized portals in all directions around you - you now have a planet located in whichever direction you like, giving you up to 1G acceleration in a direction of your choice. Free flight and being able to walk up walls!

The same portals surrounding an object of your choice? Be a Jedi and move it around with thoughts or gestures.

Be able to reach into a portal and pull out anything you have stored in a remote warehouse or cave. Super-large bag of holding which is also unstealable.

Link a portal to a remote environment and point it away from you. You can now summon/shoot anything from blizzards to sandstorms to water to lava to clouds.

Put portals at either end of any weapon in your warehouse. Cast back-to-back portals in front of you. You can now reach in, fire the weapon, and the result comes out where your hand/wrist would normally be. Small arms fire, flamethrowers, crew-mounted weapons, a Dobie-O-Matic...

Never have comms cut off again! A portal can go to anything from a radio receiving station to a scribe to someone who is just standing by waiting for you to tell them what you need.

Shopping - never have to cart around shopping bags or push a cart ever again!

Trade - never have to travel with goods!

Choosing where to live - why compromise, when with portals you can put your house in literally any picturesque or low-cost location and have doors leading to all the places you normally visit?
