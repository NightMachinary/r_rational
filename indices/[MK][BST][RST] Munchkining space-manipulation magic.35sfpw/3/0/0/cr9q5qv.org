Okay. You're scaling everything inside this space. You can make empty space, but you can't have it automatically filled with anything.

It's cheap here to make tunnels. This means that trade is easier. No more hunting for passes; less blockage due to weather. It's also cheap to make canals -- similar effect. This applies even if you can't make point-to-point portals.

Mining is safer. You can make a tunnel that's internally 1cm long and goes to arbitrary points inside the ground. You can still cause collapses, but that's not likely to hurt the miners much if they're just moving their picks through the tunnel. (What happens to something that impacts the sides of the tunnel? You should probably add a spatial warp so that things effectively warp around or across the tunnel without interfering...but the simple way of doing it might end with a high risk of people getting crushed. Hrm.)

Interurban transportation is trivial, if you have portals, but it won't help your daily commute as much. A rich person's house will have each window looking out on a different scenic area and a door leading to each major city. A sufficiently becapitaled business can have a single depot containing goods, with each retail branch having a portal leading there.

Oh, back on the "material entering the side of a tunnel" thing -- have an externally large, internally short tunnel and shove a giant mass of rock through the side. Now you have giant hunks of rock forcing themselves out each end like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wwwPJJoJPg][the hammer of god]].

It's easy to steal things; warp space to get through walls and just walk in and out. Human guards become more common. Shops with hidden locations and portals to retail storefronts, closing their portals at night, become more common.

Intrepid young lovers don't throw rocks at windows; they project the ground upward to give them a staircase to said window. Similarly, instead of constructing a building, you can project the ground upwards and create a hollow area for each room using runes. Or just create an underground house plus an above-ground portal / tunnel. This will probably create a bias for shapes that are easy to construct with runes -- you might find most houses have spherical rooms, for instance.
