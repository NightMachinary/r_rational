I would say that, in general, matter is not created, but this gets blurry as you get into some truly dangerous and weird applications that rely on the fact that, in this setting's cosmology, there is an "Outside" to the universe that is made of "chaotic matter". The additional matter is coming from Outside and being converted, but it's only recently that any sane magicians have felt safe about conducting research down this path.
