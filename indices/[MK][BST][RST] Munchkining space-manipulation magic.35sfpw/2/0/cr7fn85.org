People have to make runes.

Magic, at least as magicians understand it, is about the human will setting bounds upon and bringing order to the world of chaos that is around us. This is expressed through runes because it is through language that even non-magical humans are able to organize the unorganized world.

But of course that might be a load of malarkey. Some magicians think that runes are the original written language despite that almost certainly not being true. They're also not sure if this or that legend (Odin, for example) has anything to do with their traditions or is just coincidence.

So it is possible that they've hit upon the true metaphysical reasons for magic taking the form of runes that have to be intentionally written down, but it's also possible that they've just come up with a nice Just So story.
