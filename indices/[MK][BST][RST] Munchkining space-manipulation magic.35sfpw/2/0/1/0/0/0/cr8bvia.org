  What is an "array"?
#+end_quote

An array is a group of runes that have been inscribed in order to work together to achieve a particular effect. Other people have used the term "system" or "schematic" elsewhere.

#+begin_quote
  Runes have different functions depending on their context?
#+end_quote

That will at least be a thing in the more complicated arrangements (especially when you're trying to inscribe a set of runes that are intended to interact with another set of runes).

It may also likely be a thing in general, so that you might place the same rune in two locations but it means something different in each. In the first location it is interacting with the rune that says "do not work perpetually, but wait to activate until X occurs" and may govern what X is, or may in turn say "after X occurs, wait Y time before activating." In the second location it is interacting with the rune that says "Send things in the affected space to Z" and is one of a number of runes that help to govern where, exactly, Z is.

This would make it harder to learn the system, possibly, but it would also reduce the total number of runes that one must know.

#+begin_quote
  Can people cooperate on arrays? I work on the left half and the middle, you work on the right half and the middle?
#+end_quote

I'm not sure yet. Going with either option will be both good and bad, and yet they are equally justifiable.
