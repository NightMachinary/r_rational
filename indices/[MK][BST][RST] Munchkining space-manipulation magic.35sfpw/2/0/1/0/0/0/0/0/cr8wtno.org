  You seem to be thinking that people will mostly be doing this kind of inscribing on the spot for their magic, but if you can have if X then Y triggers then it basically becomes prepared at will magic.

Mostly I'm still tinkering with and refining the system as I talk with people (you'll notice a fair amount of "I never thought of that!" or "Here's a detail I'm considering after you said that; how do you think that would work?") just responding to comments as I'm multitasking, so I'm not always catching all the implications of an idea when I first propose it.

I think that I could figure out some ways to make triggers not quite so much of a problem, but after thinking about it I'm not so concerned with the concept to do that. Goodbye, triggers, we hardly knew ye.

  What defines a large versus a small task? How do you define exactly what is to be done? How do you adjust for the rotation of the earth/planet in teleportation?

Someone else said that the system felt a lot like programming, and you're using the runes to describe exactly what you want to happen. A "large task" is literally a large task: it is simpler to affect a square inch of space than it is to affect ten square feet.

  If you want a system that can't be munchkined, it needs to be extremely specific.
#+end_quote

I'm actually very cool with it being munckined.

Right now, there is definitely some vagueness, but as I am talking with people I'm getting food for thought and thinking of things that I would have stupidly overlooked. It is good that I did not make it incredibly precise already, because there probably would have been a lot of wasted effort then.
