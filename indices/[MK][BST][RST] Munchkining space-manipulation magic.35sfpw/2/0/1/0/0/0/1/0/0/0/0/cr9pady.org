This would mean that you can't make certain systems subsystems of other systems without that subsystem activating. Computers have millions of logic gates and if each logic gate activates before I finished soldering in the other logic gates into the circuit boards, then it would be extremely difficult to create the entire system without electrocuting myself. Even if I could make the same rune integral to both the simple and more complex versions of the system that would only work if every part of the system depended on that rune. With more complex systems, there would be entire subsystems which have nothing to do with each other and therefore one would have to activate before the other. This could be part of the dangers of being a magician, having a series of systems activating to get the final effect you want. Also it would up the difficulty, since minimizing the number of capstones makes the system non-modular which is more confusing to understand.
