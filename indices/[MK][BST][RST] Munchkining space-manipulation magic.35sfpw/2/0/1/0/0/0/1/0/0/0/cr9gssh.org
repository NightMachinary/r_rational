I'm not sure. It might be that a system would have several possible capstones, but not every rune could serve as a capstone.

The capstone is such not because you make it any differently than if you weren't using it as a capstone, but because the whole system fails to function at all if that rune is missing. So refraining from adding certain runes won't turn those into capstones, but simply cause your rune system to work in a way that you didn't intend.
