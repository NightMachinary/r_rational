1) Warp space making things bigger to make it trivial to get more precise runes once you let it shrink again

Everything gets messy when expanded space collapses.

2) Warp space so that a single rune occupies multiple positions in a rune setup? Thereby allowing arrays that make other arrays more powerful.

Probably. Definitely not something that you would want to do as a novice though.

3) Shrink rune arrays for easily transportable abilities?

No. The size of the rune appears to be important. Some scaling is possible in relation to certain runes, but they are not infinitely shrinkable.

  4) Set up machines that inscribe runes?
#+end_quote

No. You need a human mind to inscribe the runes, and that mind needs to know what it's doing or (in the case of experimentation) what it's trying to do.
