Lets talk limitation removal

Can you 1) Warp space making things bigger to make it trivial to get more precise runes once you let it shrink again 2) Warp space so that a single rune occupies multiple positions in a rune setup? Thereby allowing arrays that make other arrays more powerful. 3) Shrink rune arrays for easily transportable abilities? 4) Set up machines that inscribe runes?
