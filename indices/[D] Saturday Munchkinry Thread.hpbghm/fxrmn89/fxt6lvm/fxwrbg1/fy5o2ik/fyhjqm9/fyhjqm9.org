Sounds like a good origin story for some of the anomalous religions in the SCP world.

I like this idea, you get a ready made audience with a predictable/controllable mindset. Freely handing out your religion may make for a good facade of innocence, but if you make it a mystery religion style cult, you could get your members to keep things secret. Maybe not the most moral way of using your power, but it balances caution with power.
