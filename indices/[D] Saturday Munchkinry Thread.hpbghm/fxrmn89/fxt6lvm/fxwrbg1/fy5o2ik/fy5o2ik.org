Hymns.

You have strong control over both the context (people frequently sing from hymnals but almost never use them as napkins) and meaning of the artwork (you literally get to write out exactly what you mean). The cultural context of religious artwork would mean a strong background of supposed miracles for camouflage as well as an incentive for the religious community itself to popularize and spread your art while maintaining the appropriate religious context surrounding it and supernatural collectors are unlikely to bother extorting you for your art when a copy can be obtained simply by attending your church and having it handed to them by a smiling deacon, free of charge.

As for the actual content, I am tempted to crib some imagery from [[https://www.bartleby.com/42/805.html][James Russell Lowell]]:

"Careless seems the great Avenger; history's pages but record\\
One death-grapple in the darkness 'twixt old systems and the Word;\\
Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne,---\\
Yet that scaffold sways the future, and, behind the dim unknown,\\
Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above his own."
