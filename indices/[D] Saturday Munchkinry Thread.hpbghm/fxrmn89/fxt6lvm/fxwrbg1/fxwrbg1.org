Road trip and putting graffiti all across America in places that are a tourist attraction due to being graffiti attractions. Tree in the forest type thing. Gain power from however long it isn't covered up (may be watched by hostile entities)

There's also the option of joining the dark side and making a self replicating monstrosity that

1. Imprints itself into the views mind (when they are not you).

2. Give the urge to have the viewer replicate the art piece N number of days after viewing it.

2.5. Or show someone the original work.

1. Showing friends and or family the fresh memetic hazard

2. Instills complete loyalty to the creator of the original art creation.

Though someone's probably tried and failed at such a venture and has as such ruined the effectiveness of that tactic.

Dance is art so maybe dance to have specific effects happen? Become a YouTube dancer that has 'editing' effects happen in their videos? Plenty of power through the views.

Take up pottery and or metalworking to make unique one time charms that'll grant a 'Somebody else's problem' field around yourself. Changing it up to apathy, avoidance, forgetfulness and various other mind altering effects once the first charm loses it's juice. After enough time has passed they could be remade as they'd be novelty in making something old but with a new twist to it.

Perhaps coding is art and as such maybe a code that infects every camera to not register you on screens. It'll always be interacted with because depend where you are in the world there's bound to be a camera that has you on screen somewhere.
