Consider making internet memes.

- They don't require any purchases to make, while you could be tracked down using the physical components of a material art piece
- They are easier to publish anonymously, using TOR for example, rather than having to go through fallible middlemen and proxies
- It is accepted that people will share memes to wider audiences, so their propagation will earn you plenty of attention without seeming implausible to those with the desire to contain you

In terms of the artistic message, consider a broad topic like "We all see the world differently" which should hopefully constrain the anomalous effects to the subjective and could be passed off as unusual but mundane quirks of neuroscience. Examples of what you could aim for are That Dress, the McCollough effect, and Scissor Statements.

EDIT: Once you've developed your talents as an artist enough, your next step should probably be to gather information, perhaps with a website that draws people in to reveal the most important secret they know as a commentary on the anonymity and exhibitionism of the internet. Your sense for the anomalous might help you pick out the truth from the confessions you collect.

There's clearly more to the world than what the public is aware of, so it stands to reason that you're similarly ignorant of important facts that you should know before pursuing your next course of action. For example, if you could create an anomalous reality anchor with a global scale, would that save or doom humanity? Are there aliens out there that also deserve moral weight? Is there an afterlife?
