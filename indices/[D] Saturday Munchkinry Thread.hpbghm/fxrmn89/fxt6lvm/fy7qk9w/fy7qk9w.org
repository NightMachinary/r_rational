I have a new headcanon for the origin of some of the memetic and anti-memetic SCPs. If I were an anartist, the idea of a self-propagating meme would seem too dangerous.

Aiming for effects justifiable as a quirk of neuroscience is probably a safe way of keeping your anomalous art anonymous.

The website is a good idea... as long as it attracts the right attention before the wrong attention. I guess the trick would be making the website's anomalous effect somehow filter out people that are part of large secret organizations?
