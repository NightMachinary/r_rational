The mobster encountered the superhero at an anime con in the city's convention center; they had sex in a hotel room. The convention center is at a stop on the major hub. I like what you're suggesting about revisiting the convention center. At the very least, the alter ego will probably visit the con again the next year. There might be another anime-related con at the convention center between this con and its repetition next year.

The superhero's empowered appearance is partly an aspect of their power; it doesn't look too much like their alter ego except in terms of height and gait-recognition cameras.

I really haven't thought about what use this superhero and their associates have put their powers to, yet. I know that they're public enough to be identifiable as specific superheroes, but I don't have a good idea of what a bunch of post-college rogues would do as capes.
