Assuming you can get your hands on Liam Nelson, you can shave down the delay by electrically inducing Liam to speak (or at least groan) and then monitoring the activity of the speech muscles of the precog. You still only get ~1 seconds of precognition and only one bit of information (maybe a few more if you have very fine-grained control of the muscles).

But, maybe you can back-chain. Make Liam groan if Russia declares nuclear war *or* the precog starts groaning. That lets you instantly answer questions from as far into the future as you can keep the two men alive and wired up. And you can ask multiple questions to get multiple bits of information (though learning one answer could potentially compromise the previous ones). Pretty OP.

No idea about ticker price woman. If only she had been born before the telegraph...
