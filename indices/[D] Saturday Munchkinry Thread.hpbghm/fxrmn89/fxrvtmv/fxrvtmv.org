I'm reading /The Long Dark Teatime of the Soul/ (a Dirk Gently book) and there's two very interesting, inconsequential-seeming powers in the book that I thought might be interesting:

- A woman who recites yesterday's stock market prices. Essentially, she's doing the work of a live stock market ticker but with a 24 hour delay.

- A man who says what Liam Neeson is about to say, so maybe one second in advance. He cannot say anything else. [and in the book the celebrity was someone else who I forget]

Yesterday's stock market ticker seems profoundly useless, and while you could take advantage of the liam neeson prophet by getting Liam to say things in response to other things (not that you necessarily have the access or the power to do that), the one second in advance thing plus it depending on people speaking makes it profoundly difficult to take advantage of.

Yeah, either one of these could win a supernatural challenge prize, but I don't have ideas for how to use it beyond that as they both seem so pointless.

I haven't finished the book so if these two characters (that I think were throwaways) actually do use their unique talents to save the day, no spoilers!
