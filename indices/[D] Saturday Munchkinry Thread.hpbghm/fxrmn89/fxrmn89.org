You are an anartist, you create anomalous art using something called [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/flow-hub][flow]].

Periodically, in the course of creating artwork, you tap into something greater than yourself in the form of some emotion, sentiment, idea, or concept that you wish to communicate to an audience. Your artwork then gains supernatural effects according to what you are trying to communicate. Your artwork retains these effects as long as it is periodically interacted with in a way that lets it continue to communicate the original intent behind it. When placed in a context where the art's message becomes sufficiently different, its powers may change.

With practice you can exert some control over how the art's power manifests, although it is still a largely uncontrolled process. You can try to create practical working art pieces, but you need to have an artistic message behind it, the exact power is difficult to control, its power may change over time, and you need to give the art regular interaction that supports its message. So for instance, if you wanted a classic, useful magic item, such as a "bag-of-holding" you would first need artistic skill in the relevant areas (leather-work or fabric or fashion) and you would need a message... perhaps a statement about the bottomless desire of consumerism. It would take some skill to get the power to come out right and practical, and it might have any number of quirks corresponding to the message driving the power. If the bag-of-holding communicated the endless desire of consumerism, it might compel you to regularly fill it with new purchases, or it might be literally bottomless, with some additional artifice required to retrieve objects tossed into it, or it might teleport objects stored into it back into your dwelling place instead of storing them.

You will find your powers grow as you effect more people with your art and the more powerfully you affect them. You will also find yourself skilled at making use of other types of magic and anomalies... but primarily in re-purposing them into artwork. You might also develop a sixth sense for anomalies over time. Your ability to produce anomalous is also connected to your sense of passion and creativity, uninspired artwork is likely not to have any anomalous effects. Repeatedly producing identical anomalous art pieces is all but impossible they will either not have anomalous effects (if you are bored) or you will find the powers differ unpredictably and possibly dangerously (if you do manage to retain your passion while churning out copies.)

You have only recently gained these powers. Another anartist recognizes what you are and gives you a few warnings. Powerful government organizations will seek to conceal and suppress your anomalous artwork and detain you or possibly even kill you. Collectors of the supernatural will try to buy your artwork at barely any markup (compared to non-anomalous art) and then resell it for much higher prices... and will resort to threats of violence to get you to sell and they have been rumored to engage in kidnapping and trafficking of anomalous artwork. Other anartists often lose sight of their morality and will create artwork with dangerous effects.

Ideas for useful/practical magic items, knowing the limitations in practical applications?

Ideas for artwork that can fly under the radar in terms of avoiding the wrong kinds of attention, while still having enough effect on people to grow your power?
