Where did you encounter them and where did you go to have sex? Is it plausible that the hero will be there again in the near future, in or out of costume, for the same reasons?

If the costume was more than, like, a ski mask, presumably it exists so that people can recognise it and have continuity with previous interactions. What do they do with this public identity? Join a group? Claim authority over a territory? Put up or reply to classified ads? Pay taxes? Much depends on how exactly masked heroes are integrated in society, in your setting.

+Is it set in the future? We're well on track for universal facial recognition (and costume recognition), and that's without tinkertech. Depends on how secure all this data is though; may or may not be in reach of a mobster.+ e: sorry, missed the "modern-day".
