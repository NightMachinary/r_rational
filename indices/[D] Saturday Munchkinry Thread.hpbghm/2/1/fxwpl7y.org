Basically stalk their superhero persona. If they go into a building it either means they mix with the populace of the building or there's an alternative exit. Find the other exit (tunnel, teleportation device, etc) and access it.

If they mix with the crowd then compare their heights, general shape of their face.

If they go out into the middle of nowhere it'll be easier and harder as they'll probably be the only person there but they'll most likely have a form of surveillance that'll let them know someone is around.

There's also the option of tracing the origin of the maybe defunct number. Find the carrier and access their records for the number, it'd probably give a name and maybe a address. It could be done through accessing major carriers and seeing if the number was in their logs. Or calling the carrier and posing as the hero's alter ego.

If they move too fast to be followed by foot or car then investing in drones and having said drones follow. If that's too risk or obvious then slowly plotting out where they generally arrive from while a crime happens in the same area could help sort out where to go. If they teleport or travel from far away really fast the plan is a bust.

But above all call the number first before doing any investigative work. Because they only MAY have changed it, at least going off the prompt.

All in all kind of interested but uncomfortable about the whole having a sexual service with a hero but the implication that it was recorded and then handed off to an unknown entity and for some reason there's a drive to find them once more a week later.

All the while there was access/knowledge of their phone number which was presumably given freely but then wasn't used for a week.

All in all it makes me feel icky but so very curious to see where it'd all end up.
