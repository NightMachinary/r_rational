In a modern-day setting:

You're a mobster. You were hired by someone you think is the government to get in contact with any superpowered individual in a city. You did encounter a specific superhero while they were out of costume, and you successfully seduced the superhero for an evening's paid sex work in costume. You got the proof of contact that your contact wished for, and your contact pays you your reward, which does barely cover what you paid the superhero.

It's a week later.

The superhero has probably changed their alter ego's phone number and haircut.

In a modern-equivalent setting, how might you find them again?
