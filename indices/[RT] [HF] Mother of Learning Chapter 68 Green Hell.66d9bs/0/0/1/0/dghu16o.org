That explains why they bother searching aboveground at all despite Awan-Temti's little crusade being an old history, but doesn't explain why they don't even think about the underground. Stuff he carried could end up underground for a large variety of reasons, like the emperor carrying it there himself in a vain attempt to hide from the dangers of the jungle, or even simply being washed underground by rainwater during a rain season (it is, after all, a jungle). And these reasons should be even more apparent to a qualified treasure hunter.
