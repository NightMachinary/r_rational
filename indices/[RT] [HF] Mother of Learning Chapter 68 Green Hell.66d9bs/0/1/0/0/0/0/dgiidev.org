It's actually 3rd or 4th indication that something's fishy about Daimen's situation, starting with the chapter named Marred Perfection where it is stated that Daimen finds his bride to be perfect. (Also a pun?)

But so far Orissa has been nothing but perfect. This whole situation has been too smooth despite significant exposition, and some ominous hints.

Let's just say my Chekhov gun sense is tingling.
