I really don't think that underground will be safer than aboveground. Remember, this section of the Dungeon is untamed.

I also think it's natural enough that Daimen forgot to check underground - though he was right that it was a significant mistake. If I were trying to find where someone deliberately hid a treasure in their house, I would look for trapdoors and basements, but if I were hunting all over the house for my keys, I would just focus on working out where I'd been. Daimen has spent his efforts narrowing down where the emperor fell, and it didn't previously occur to him that the orb might actually be hidden from view rather than just lost.
