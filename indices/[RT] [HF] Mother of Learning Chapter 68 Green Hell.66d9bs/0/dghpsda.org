Okay, I'm calling this one out. Why haven't Daimen, a highly experienced and competent treasure hunter, even thought about the underground before, until Zach of all people pointed it out? It would be one thing if the jungle didn't have a known and extensive underground system, but he doesn't have even that excuse - from the wording of the exposition it seems that the Dungeon-like underground of the jungle is uncharted, but hardly unknown.
