I disagree. Daimien was looking for a king that was fleeing an opposing army through the jungle. One populated by monsters that don't value loot. So it would be illogical to assume that the king tried to hide in a more dangerous area than the jungle itself.

Then go from that assumption to months of searching a jungle when you've already discounted the underground as an option, and it's not unreasonable.
