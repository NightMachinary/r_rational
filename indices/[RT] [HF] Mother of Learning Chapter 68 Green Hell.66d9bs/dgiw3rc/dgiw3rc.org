There was a bit of odd word-choice I noticed. At one point, Zorian says that he's been "spamming" the Key detection request to his soul marker.

But "spam" and "spamming" are very Internet related terms, referring to the Monty Python skit about spam, and the annoying advertising on Usenet.

And since the Ikosians don't have an Internet, I found it a little jarring to use Zorian use that term.
