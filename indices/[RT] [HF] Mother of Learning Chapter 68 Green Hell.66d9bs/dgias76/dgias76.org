Is there even any reasons for Zorian and Zach to even meet up with Daimen again next restart? They could just rush right to the orb now that they know where it is. Unless of course this hydra fight is going to take the whole squad to beat, which with Zach's power seems unlikely. From some bad vibes I've gotten from Orissa this chapter am guessing the group is going to get bamboozled after getting the orb, but that might just be me being a conspiracy theorist.
