"It could be on the surface" is a reason why his party couldn't have just been moving around in the relative safety (I assume) of underground for their whole expedition. It is not a reason to /only/ look on the surface. My previous post was unclear there, sorry.

Previously they needed to search underground and on the surface. This time they have Zorian's detection ability, so now they don't need to go on the surface at all, they can detect the orb on the surface from just below the surface.

Re-reading that bit again, it does sound more like Daimen just didn't think to look underground :/
