In order of the chapter's progression, my three guesses were actually that:

1) either the drakes kept relocating the orb when they saw yet another human party approaching;

2) stored and protected it in their nest because it gave some magical bonus (increase monster production by x%, for instance);

3) or was swallowed by the hydra, making it bigger and stronger than normal.

Also, I too agree on the Idiot Ball.
