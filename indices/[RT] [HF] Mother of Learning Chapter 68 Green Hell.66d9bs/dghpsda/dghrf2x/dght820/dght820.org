To be fair. This is more of a they tracked it by tracking the movements of the last people to have it, who died in the jungle. I think they assumed it would be above ground because there was no real reason for it to be underground. When someone mentioned underground he scolded himself for not thinking too hard on it, but even in the end its not really deep underground, it is in a place they already checked. Assuming treasure = underground simply because it is a more attractive option as a hiding place is really stupid, and probably not very realistic.
