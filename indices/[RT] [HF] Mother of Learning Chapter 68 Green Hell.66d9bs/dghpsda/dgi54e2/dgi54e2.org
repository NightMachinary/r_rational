Yeah, I feel like this would be worth fixing for the author if/when he gets around to editing the story. It doesn't have to be a major overhaul of anything. He could either scrap the ritual and say that the maps they have of the underground are from previous explorations of it or keep the ritual and claim that it's a new ritual that they've only developed sometime since their last attempt at exploring the underground. Daimen could still be annoyed that he hadn't thought of the underground - just make it clear that he's annoyed that he hadn't thought to re-explore the underground earlier /that day/ rather than annoyed that he hadn't /ever/ thought to explore the underground.
