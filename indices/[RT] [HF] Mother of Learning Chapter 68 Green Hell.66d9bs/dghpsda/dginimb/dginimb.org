I agree with the statement, but it also seems like it isnt going to matter - the team has searched via divination in /exactly/ the spot where the orb is located, but outside of the soul sense it appears to be shielded from all forms of detection. So it is a bit of an idiot-ball, but its not actually the resolution of any relevant plot detail - a very minor sin all said and done.
