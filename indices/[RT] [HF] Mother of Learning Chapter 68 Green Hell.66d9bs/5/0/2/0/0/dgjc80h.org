[[/u/winz3r]] people still have magic resistance as well. Remember Zach bypassing Zorian's to give him mana sight or the constant mentions of people immediately noticing if they were being mind attacked (even normal people, due to resistance). Plenty more examples throughout

It's probably just a matter of constitution. It's not a characteristic we have in real life so explaining it using real world examples probably wouldn't go too well but... think of it maybe as skin of a human vs the much thicker skin of an elephant?

The problem isn't really the difficulty necessarily but the time it's take to dominate? Unless ofc you're talking about something on the level of a freakin grey hunter resistance.
