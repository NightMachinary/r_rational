off the top of my head, I don't remember "life force" being brought up as being a thing (outside of life mana). I was thinking of that, too (being in mana rish environments leads to high resistance), but that could go either way. it might be a requirement to have some resistance to even be living in such an environment.

if simply living in mana rich environments led to higher resistance, then living in Cyoria would be perfect (but this is not the case). plus ambient mana is mostly poisonous anyways so we can assume (and I think already confirmed?) that all things with souls have resistance

though I guess the core question is where this resistance stems from. it might as well be because of life force. I should check again the worldbuilding pages to see if this was mentioned specifically
