I can't understand how all this magic resistance stuff works. Apparently the magic resistance of magic animals is a significant obstacle to Zorian, while Human mind shields can be taken on almost on a whim.

Wouldn't it make sense to find out why magical creatures have such high magic resistance and how to copy it? Although granted, Zorian and Zachs probably don't need any immediate mind magic protection.
