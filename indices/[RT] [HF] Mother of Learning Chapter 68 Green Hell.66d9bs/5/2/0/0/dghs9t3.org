The assault would probably take a maximum of 2-3 hours. I'm sure if you gave them an early shout out, they could set some time aside. It's not as if they're assaulting Iasku Mansion, which is operated by a fully sapient being with a small army of magical capable units. They're only dealing with 100 odd barely sapient lizards that are incapable of using magic. A small elite task force is easy to organize, especially because Alanic is in charge of said elite task force (battle priests). You can leave out Xvim, his defense capability seems to be more valuable than his assault. Also, I'm pretty sure artifact retrieval trumps Ibasan gate research on the priority list.
