TBH, the most rational thing to do would have been to gate in Xvim, Alanic, and his group of battle mages even before the assault on the chameleon drakes occured.

Completely decimating the population before they can summon the hydra would be optimal. If the hydra ever does get to be summoned, the living metal round would probably help a lot, assuming Zach isn't personally powerful enough to /easily/ incapacitate the hydra. If you're on a time crunch, pull out all that you've got.
