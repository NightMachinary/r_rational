I don't think the Keys have anything to do with including people into the loop. I presume you include people via the Mark. But as Zorian's is damaged, he can't include anyone, and Zach doesn't have the skill to do anything with his Mark yet.

Though that suggests Zach never could use the Mark, so Red Robe fully stole his rather than modifying a temporary Mark.
