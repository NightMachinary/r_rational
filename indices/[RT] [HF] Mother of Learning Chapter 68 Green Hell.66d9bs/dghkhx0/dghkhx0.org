Cold, hard experience had taught this particular group not to face their enemies head on if they *could avoid it*, especially if they were human.

I'd also suggest "especially if they were human" -> "especially human enemies". The "they" is slightly ambiguous, could be refering to the dragons (like the previous "they" did).
