Zorian's lack of frequency in recycling strategies aside, the chameleons weren't living in a cave. They made their nest on a cenote, which I had to look up but is essentially a hole in the ground, with /multiple/ caves dug into the walls.

Edit: also, isn't the point of battle to take as little risk as possible? Basically trapping themselves in the same area as the chameleons seems unnecessarily risky.
