  Truthfully, if Zorian was in Daimen's place, he would be wondering if Orissa ever actually loved him or was simply going after him out of sheer opportunism

I found this interesting, I mean we already got the wind of it when that girl tried a few chapters earlier to probe into Zorian's mind. Possible foreshadowing for future betrayals?

Also nice to see how Daimen reacted when Zorian asked to take it upon himself.
