I agree that the situation with the cenote makes it so that teleporting to the cave would be unwise, but I disagree about the situation with the Grey Hunter. We've seen Zach throw around stone like crazy during their attack on the summoning circle around the hole. That kind of large scale stone manipulation could be used to seal off the mouth of the GH's cave on the first day of a restart, and then they could leave it for a day or two and just come back for the eggs once the spider has died from lack of air. It's not like it could punch through a foot worth of stone even if it is a magical spider!
