A persistent problem I see with Zorian is that he tends to forget solutions that he has either seen earlier (like the example you used of Xvim throwing things through small gates to suppress wards) or even solutions to problems he has thought of earlier (like suffocating the Grey Hunter by closing off the cave and letting it respirate to death). It's a little disappointing, but also perfectly understandable considering the amount that he sees and does over the span of the series so far.
