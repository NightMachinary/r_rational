Uh, yes there's a restriction. Not all the party members can use teleport - it's part of the reason they opened a gate to the jungle at the start.

EDIT: I seem to be getting into the mindset of squabbling the little details, so I want to step back and just say that generally, in combat, when given the choice between preparing your own battlefield or stepping into enemy territory, you should always be picking the former. The latter has more uncertainty, no?

It's different if the purpose is to invade or infiltrate, but in this case they just want to get rid of the chameleons before investigating further.
