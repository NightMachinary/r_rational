Umm... that wasn't the point about the restriction. The little detail is that if you haven't been to a location before, you cannot teleport to it. What we dont know is what constitutes /being/ at a location. Do you have to be 5 meters away, within eyesight, physically on the exact spot? Zorian definitely knows how to teleport, so that wasn't even a consideration.

There's no restriction going out of the cave because Zorian has already been to locations in the vicinity that are outside the cave, so distance won't be a limiting factor. There's a potential restriction going into the cave because we haven't gotten the details of what constitutes having been to a location.

Anyways, the point /was/ infiltration. The whole reason the battle happened was to gain entrance into the cave. So have the entire group throw in the irritant gas and have Zorian hide. While they draw the battle elsewhere, Zorian could teleport/gate in. When the drakes realize imminent defeat and retreat, keep their attention while Zorian explores the cave. Of course the hypothetical can be arranged so that each of the groups can have any number of people, whatever makes most sense for the group at the time.
