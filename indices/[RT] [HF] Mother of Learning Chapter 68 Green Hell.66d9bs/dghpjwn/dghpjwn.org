Zorian should have taken a page from Xvim's book: creating a microscopic dimensional gate or throwing a magical item into the cave to facilitate teleportation (Chapter 56 and the teleportation suppressing ward exercise). They clearly were close enough to throw in the irritants.

If facilitated teleportation isn't possible, he could have used a simulacrum. Have his simulacrum shapeshift into some small robust creature, and throw the shapeshifted simulacrum into the cave. Shift back into human form, collapse or bar the cave entrance, and gate in the rest of the team.

This could have been done during the battle so when the chameleon drakes returned, they would have been none the wiser.
