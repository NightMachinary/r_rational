Wow, Zach is scary! That sword used the same material as his six daggers, right? The one which can dismember Quatach Ichl awesome skeletal body. I wonder what that is. Considering Zach stumbled upon Dragon Stone (gift prepared for Earth Elememental) easy, I suspect he also stumbled upon numerous other amazing material. Would Zorian be tempted to build a special magical tool out of them if he can get his hand on them?
