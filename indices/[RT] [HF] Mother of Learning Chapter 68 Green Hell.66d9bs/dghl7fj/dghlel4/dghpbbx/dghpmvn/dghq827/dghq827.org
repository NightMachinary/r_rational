Why would they betray him? Keeping him around to sire children and then raise them and teach them how to use their powers is in their interest. They want him happy and helpful and invested in his kids' future. There are some reasons to betray him, but there are plenty of reasons to not do so as well, so I wouldn't expect betrayal unless there's something else going on. After all, we learned this chapter that they have to communicate with the bees in physical ways or with unstructured magic. Being able to do so via mind magic by breeding a natural mind mage into their line would be super useful. If Damien loves Orissa and wants to get married, have kids, and teach those kids how to use their powers, everyone involved is a reasonably happy camper.
