While it possible the drakes are soul-bonded, the word bonded alone usually meant paired, sexually bonded, or blood relative. But yeah, interesting course of thought there. If we take Briam's word, soul-bonding gives better efficiency for some spell, outright cheat for summoning, and it feel a little bit weird. But Briam also told that bonding required a ritual. Can Zorian subdue the creatures so they can do ritual voluntarily?
