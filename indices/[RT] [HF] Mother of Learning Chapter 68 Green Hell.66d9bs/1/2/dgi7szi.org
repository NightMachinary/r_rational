I hope so too. Zach's reaction to this thing makes me view it as less of a threat. He may just do that because he's been killed so many times by giant monsters that he's used to punching above his weight but he may also just be confident of killing it. If the hydra has access to a powerful magic artifact or has been exposed to the thing for its entire life then maybe it'll be an especially troublesome fight. There needs to be a reason Zach doesn't just dice the thing to pieces with whatever spell he used on the drakes.
