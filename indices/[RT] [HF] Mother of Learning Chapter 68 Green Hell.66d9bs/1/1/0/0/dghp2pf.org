It's not impossible but less likely. If the hydra was in the smaller cave which connected to the cenote on another side, I'd assume that Zorian would have been able to detect it.

What seems more likely to have happened is that the wailing of the chameleon drakes travels further than divinations and mind sense distance limits with the help of magical prosthetics. This would mean the hydra was significantly further away.
