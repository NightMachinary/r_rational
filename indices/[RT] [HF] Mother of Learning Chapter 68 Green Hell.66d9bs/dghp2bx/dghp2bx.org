seeing the soul-bounded drakes makes me wonder though, what would happen if he soul bounded with a thing (ive been insistent about the grey hunter so ill say something else) for instance the hydra (haha). what would happen one the restarts ? would the binding continue ? what would happen at the end, would the hydra leave with them ? would the guardian see that as too much alteration for one soul to go through ? (if ever) Of course the hydra is just an example.
