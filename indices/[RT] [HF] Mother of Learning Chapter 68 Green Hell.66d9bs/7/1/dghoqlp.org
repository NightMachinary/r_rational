I think he has changed a lot in this regard, probably since interacting more with Alanic and Xvim and getting to see how he compares. It isn't a sudden change this chapter. This is character progression - very natural and well done imo.

Plus it is fun reading of Zorian messing with people's expectations, of course he would enjoy doing it :D
