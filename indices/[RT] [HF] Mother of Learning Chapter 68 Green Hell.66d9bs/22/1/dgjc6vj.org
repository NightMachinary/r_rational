Not the first time it's happened. I'm pretty sure Zorian mentioned "tanking" in terms of having a shield withstand an attack, and I don't think this world has tanks yet. (Golems, yes, but not tanks.)

Considering they technically don't even speak English (and their verbal and academic languages are apparently completely different without the readers being aware for 60+ chapters), just take the dialogue as how they would have sounded in modern English. Interpreted through Zorian's mind, since word choice is kinda similar between individual characters.
