Zorian already has a mix of functions that work (transmitting identification, sensing key pieces, counting down remaining iterations) or don't work (checking the core of his soul to dynamically alter identification, resetting upon mind/soul tampering including death). Why make assumptions about the status of another function?

And he never said "more than half", or anything quantitative, that I can recall. Can you cite a chapter?
