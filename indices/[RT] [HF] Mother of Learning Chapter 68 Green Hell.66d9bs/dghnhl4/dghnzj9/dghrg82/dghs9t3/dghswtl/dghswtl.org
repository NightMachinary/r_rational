Again though, you have a fairly capable group already so there's not much point wasting valuable time to make it stronger. They didn't know the hydra was there and dealt with the lizards fairly well, not to mention Zach alone can fight a mage dragon. If things go south Zorian will probably summon his golem army, but I don't think they will need it.
