Chapter 51:

  If he remembered correctly, life force was simply a special type of personal mana that wasn't part of a mage's mana pool and was used exclusively by the body to keep itself living and resist foreign magics. Since the amount of life force rarely varied much between humans, and couldn't be used to power spells, the academy instructors hadn't spoken much about it.

The high mana density which comes from the Hole is the reason why Cyoria is a thing. It /is/ the perfect place for beings who either require or make use of vast amounts of mana. However, I don't think that strictly speaking leads to a higher resistance. Evolutionary factors aside, high mana density doesn't give you higher amount of life force, just enables it. Highly magical creatures need to hide in the depths of the Dungeon or they will wither away, and as Zorian conveniently mentioned in that paragraph, human life force levels are mostly the same.

Also, ambient mana is toxic only if used as-is to cast spells. Mages are constantly assimilating it into their own reserves to boost their regen.
