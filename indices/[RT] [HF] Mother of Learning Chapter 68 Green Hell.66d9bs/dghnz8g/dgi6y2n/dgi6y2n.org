Zorian can be vain, if he feels like blowing off steam. (Back in Chpt. ~10, he was using a rain barrier liberally and amusing himself watching the water on the road part before him after being trounced by the invaders in the previous loop.)

That said, in this case I'm pretty sure Zorian was just irritated his power level was revealed so openly. Dialogue suggests he knew it was inevitable it would come out eventually, but wanted to keep it on the low as much as he could before Daimen ruined that plan.
