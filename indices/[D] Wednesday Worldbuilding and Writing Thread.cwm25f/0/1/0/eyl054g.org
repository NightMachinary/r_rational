The phase goggles is a neat idea. If this makes it to campaign, I don't want the players to feel their actions don't matter, so the simulation will probably get pulled. I think there is still enough hook and possibilities without it, just have the AI quest chain be more important. The Olympus Research Group could just be researchers stranded in space on their space station and the Greek pantheon references are just a red herring to make them think they are more important. It wasn't the original intent, but the guard procedures would be like the Long Earth series (people could step from one Earth to the next in an ?infinite? chain of Earths). Meetings are held in special bunkers that don't have a corresponding underground location, and you could definitely employ guards/counter-intelligence agents on both sides. Thank you for your critique and contribution
