I feel like as a player, finding out it's all a simulation would be disappointing. Also, I would have a hard time being convinced that simulating two entire planets is going to be the most efficient way to solve any interesting problems, unless the simulation highly resembles the real world, or is some sort of prediction. The AI quests sounds cool though.
