Hmmm.

Some thoughts:

- Simulation hypothesis would seem to cheapen the player's choices. Doesn't matter what they do, if they anger the Lead Scientist it gets instantly rewound. This messes with player agency and... may cause problems. (Also, if the Lead Scientists have AI - which they must in order for Prometheus to exist in the sim - then isn't it a better idea to use that computing hardware for a team of dedicated AI Thinkers to figure out a solution to the problem, instead of simulating an entire world?)

- Interphase interactions could be interesting. Presumably the biggest dinosaurs are nearly unique to Wildis, since phase gates can only be made so large (but some people will bring eggs over from one side to the other and try to raise them).

- I can imagine a magic device - "Phase Goggles" - that lets you see what's happening in the other phase at any time (but not interact beyond that). A scientist planning a risky experiment might use phase goggles to inspect it from the other world, while a spy might use phase goggles (accompanied by either phase headphones or an ability to lipread) to spy on a secret meeting.

- One way to prevent a meeting from being spied on by an out-of-phase spy is to hold it in a basement or near the top of a high-rise building, where there is no building in the other world. However, spells like "Fly" or one that allows moving through rock make those precautions tricky to use successfully.

- A better way is to have people guarding the other phase of the same location as the secret meeting. On top of that, a small percentage of guards (in both phases) have their own phase goggles (and a communication protocol based on hand signs) so as to keep in contact with each other.

- If two people stand in different phases such that their brains overlap, is telepathy between them possible? If so, would it be voluntary?
