These Tobias interludes are being told from a third person perspective, but I wonder if this reflects the thought processes inside his/their brain.

In the same way that Helium now thinks in terms of "we", I wonder if Tobias and Maninho think in terms of "the boy and his passenger".

I really like the exploration of "self" and what that means from varying perspectives. From Helium's aforementioned "we", to Rachel's exploration of what her sculptor wants, to the way Yeerks themselves have coalescions as individuals but all the shards are also individuals serving the greater whole, right up to Esplin himself trying so desperately to find a way to preserve his own self the way he understands it (and what actually happened to Alloran?). That's not even mentioning "Fake Jake", Marco's belief in his Marclones continuing his legacy if at least one of them survives, Cassie's selflessness, or whatever is happening with Tobias at the moment.

The are a lot of different perspectives to unpack, and I'm loving exploring them all as much as I'm enjoying the overall story itself.
