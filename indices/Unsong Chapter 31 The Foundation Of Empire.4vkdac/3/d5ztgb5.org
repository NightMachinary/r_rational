  “Like you did, Jalaketu ben Raziel?”

So this makes Jala's father, Comet West, Raziel.

Raziel was previously mentioned in [[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-20-when-the-stars-threw-down-their-spears/][Chapter 20]]:

#+begin_quote
  Raziel was missing, as always, out doing his thing, whatever Raziel's thing was.

  ...

  “Sometimes there comes upon us the desire to seek out and explore new parts of God's creation, that we may appreciate ever-greater portions of His glory. ... Thus Raziel, who has absented himself from this assembly to traverse the gulfs beyond the world.”

  ...

  “Raziel?”

  “Off somewhere,” said Michael.

Jala's other patronymic, "ben Kokab", appears to mean "son of a star" (or /the/ star; I don't know how the grammar works there).

In the comments of this chapter, Scott said:

  I really wanted her to actually call him “Jalaketu bar Kochba”, but I remembered at the last moment that angels can't speak Aramaic.

This is the aramaic translation of "ben Kokab", and it refers to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_bar_Kokhba][Simon bar Kokhba]]. He led a revolt against the Romans and established an independent Jewish state that was conquered within 3 years.

Given what we know of Jala's eventual (presumed) demise and the fall of his empire, it seems kabbalistically appropriate.

He was also a Messiah candidate, but that wasn't bourne out for obvious reasons.

It seems likely that Raziel was aware of the kabbalistic connotations of siring Jalaketu. So what was his plan? I can't remember if he's still around. Apparently he was giving Jala dreams throughout his childhood, so at the very least he didn't die in coitus.
