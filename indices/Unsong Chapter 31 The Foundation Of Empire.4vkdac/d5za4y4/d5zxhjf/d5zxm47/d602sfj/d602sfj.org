So even if I really liked some parts, I have to lie and say the whole story is shit because I found some parts pretty boring?

This "logic" would mean I've actually only enjoyed a tiny percentage of the media I consume. I loved the hell out of the Haruhi anime series but hated when they repeated the same episode 8 times, guess that's a show I actually hate lol.
