That's like saying you have to tell the truth and say that you can turn into a proton at will. It's either one or the other, because if I said I enjoyed the whole story, I'd be lying.

  refusing to do so is not giving the author his due.

I don't see why. So long as more than half of his writing is good, it's a net improvement in my life.

And, really, even if someone wrote something that sucks completely, I could still commend them for their efforts. Whoever wrote the time cube, for example, certainly spent a good while on it and definitely can get credit for /that/ even if it's mostly just psychobabble and is otherwise not worth reading. I don't see the connection between giving an author credit for writing something and giving a subjective evaluation of it.
