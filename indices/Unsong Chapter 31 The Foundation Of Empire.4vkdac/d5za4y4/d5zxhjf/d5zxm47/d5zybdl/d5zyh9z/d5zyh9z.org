I'm saying that the Aaron parts of Unsong are great and the Comet King parts of Unsong are great and they are both part of a singular, beautiful whole, like the world itself. A belief on your part that one section is worthier than another is your own flaw, and a sentiment that you would /destroy/ one part for more of another is simply disgusting.
