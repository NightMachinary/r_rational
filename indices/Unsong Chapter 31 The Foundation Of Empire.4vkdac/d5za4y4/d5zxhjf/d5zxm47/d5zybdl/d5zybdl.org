What? That's ridiculous, of course you can break a work down into pieces. That's a fundamental critical technique. That's what criticism /is/. Is your understanding of how we evaluate works so warped that you think something like "the pace was too slow" or "his motivation didn't make sense" is somehow invalid because it's not holistic?
