I'm curious what Unsong's take on the Holocaust is. Yes, it happened before the sky cracked, but it had a huge effect on Jewish culture in real life, whereas it's not even been mentioned thus far in Unsong, as far as I recall. Did the events of the sky cracking simply overshadow it to the point of irrelevance? I somehow doubt it.

Is it a coincidence that our rocketry programs, which destroyed the beautiful order of things everyone had settled on, relied on the employment of Wernher von Braun, an engineer who worked for the modern empire that made the most credible attempt of wiping out God's chosen people within that beautiful order?
