... You are reading a "Kabbala-punk" story. Multiple key events have involved or outright hinged upon puns and choices of letters... Thus Unsong itself can be thought of breaking up sentences into word and words into letters, so I don't think you can criticize a criticism that involves breaking things into bits and pieces.
