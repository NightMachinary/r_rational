That ending was priceless.

I also liked that detail about Pallet Town's gate opening inwards and what it meant. Is that fact based on anything or did you just fancy the idea?

What I understand less is why Oak puts so much weight on prestige and media narrative. I mean, judging from all Pokemon media I know of, the world is chock full with trainers. Surely only the tiniest fraction can be getting any media attention of note at all and yet they are still at it so it can't be the be all end all. So letting Blue's audacious and probably criminal act just slide and go without consequence simply because it makes for a better story seems to make little sense in a world that isn't based on Shadows in the Limelight like rules. Not to mention that in a world where pokemon dominate everything and where there are age old trainer initiation rituals there must be more to aspire to as a young trainer than to become Champion.
