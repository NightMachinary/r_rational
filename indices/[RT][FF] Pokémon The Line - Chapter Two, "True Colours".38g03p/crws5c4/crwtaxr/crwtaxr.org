Pallet Town's inward-opening gate is a pure invention. I don't think the canonical Pallet Town even has a gate.

You are correct, there are many ambitions beyond becoming Champion. In much the same way that most actors harbour some dream of becoming the next Brad Pitt, or many newer politicians hope to become President/Prime Minister, so too do most new Trainers. The professional Trainer circuit makes up only a portion of the wider Trainer demographic.

Going into details would be revealing a bit too much, but one can broadly state that being a Trainer is something of a stepping-stone to more 'grounded' careers - a way of gaining experience and seeing the world. Most Trainers will only stay on the freelance Trainer circuit for a few years before finding 'real' jobs.

Generally, placing so much concern on a couple of new Trainers' public image would be laughable. But these are the sons of Professor Samuel Oak, foremost Pokémon researcher in Kanto, inventor of the Pokédex, and other stuff that will be brought up later. They are already in the spotlight, so they may as well make the most of it.

This is about as much as I can say right now, but I hope it makes things a touch clearer.

Cheers!
