I'm generally uncertain about this chapter. A particular concern is that there may be too much exposition towards the beginning. Curious to know if it reads too much like an infodump.

Other than that particular question, criticism in general would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: Horizontal lines are coming up extremely inconsistently for me. I've edited the chapter several times, but they keep vanishing and reappearing. There should be two in this document, after "You /bastard/." and "He looked like a Champion." Is anyone else not seeing them?
