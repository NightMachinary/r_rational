It's the little things like "Reclamationist fortress of Viridian City" that /really/ make me want to know where you're going with this. In the meanwhile, this is really good stuff. I've barely met him and *I* already want to punch Blue, in the stomach, /fairly/ hard.

Interesting take on Red's mom too. I'm assuming that's inspired by the canonical opening to the games where you set one foot in the long grass before Oak bustles out saying how dangerous that is and you need a starter Pokemon, and then have basically no parenting thereafter.

Almost a little sad about that, having played Gold where she was a slightly more active presence in the game and always seemed sweet/concerned in the way that parents are. But then, that's a different protagonist from a later generation who lives in a different town, so... never mind.
