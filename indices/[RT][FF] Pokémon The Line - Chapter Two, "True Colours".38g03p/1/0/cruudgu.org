It's SLIGHTLY heavy on the exposition, but it's described vividly enough to keep it from being boring. Plenty of more famous authors do far worse. If you want to trim it down a little, that's your prerogative, but don't feel like you HAVE to.

I, for one, quite enjoyed this chapter. I was starting to get annoyed by the scene with the reporters, but then I realized that was PRECISELY the intent, and it worked out great. And it only got better.
