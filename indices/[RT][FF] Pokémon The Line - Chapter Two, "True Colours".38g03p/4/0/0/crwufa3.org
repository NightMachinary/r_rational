  You are correct, there are many ambitions beyond becoming Champion. In much the same way that most actors harbour some dream of becoming the next Brad Pitt, or many newer politicians hope to become President/Prime Minister, so too do most new Trainers. The professional Trainer circuit makes up only a portion of the wider Trainer demographic.

I may be misunderstanding what 'Trainer' actually means. Isn't anyone who trains pokemon for offensive purposes a trainer in your world? That would be including all rangers, hunters, entertainment level fighters, aspiring champions, wilderness explorers, criminals, military and anyone else you see throwing around pokeballs to face off threats both real and artificial. And that isn't even including those trainers that focus even more on the show aspects as seen in the poke-contests in the newer editions/seasons. So the pokemon economy has to be larger than whatever the media supports, no?

  ut these are the sons of Professor Samuel Oak, foremost Pokémon researcher in Kanto, inventor of the Pokédex, and other stuff that will be brought up later. They are already in the spotlight, so they may as well make the most of it.

That is kind of what I mean though. They are already advantaged when it comes to public fame and image. Letting such a direct and personal insult and crime just slide and allowing injustice mostly for public 'ratings' seems really weird to me. It seems equivalent to, I don't know, aspiring musicians from the same family hiding that one of them blatantly stole the other's hit song /after/ it got copyrighted? Or maybe publishing a paper based on research data easily proven to be stolen from your brother? There is not really a similarly prestigious career path that requires a unique object to start out.
