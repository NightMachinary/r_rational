'Trainer' is a term that I'm using to refer to the more traditional Trainer set that we mostly see in the games/anime/books - folks who wander about battling monsters against one another for money and fame. The phrase "Trainer demographic" there was perhaps not quite the best to use. Let's call anyone who deals with Pokémon on a regular basis 'Handlers' for now, with 'Trainer' referring more specifically to the classic Pokémon archetype.

A great many Handlers and Pokémon begin in, or move into, more standard societal roles (such as the ones you listed), rather than remaining in the competitive circuit. Some immediately move into these utility roles, others start out Training in the pursuit of ambition, to gain experience, and as a chance to explore the world (if you're familiar with the concept of an OE, it holds a similar cultural connotation). Most who go down this path fail, but the few grand successes encourage young aspirants all the same. Those successful enough to make it into the major media spotlight serve as motivation for the many who try.

So, yes, the Pokémon economy is much larger than those few supported by the general media.

As for Oak's conclusion, this is something that I feel shouldn't be bluntly expressed in a comments discussion, especially when the piece is still in progress. How you perceive Oak's permissiveness towards Blue's actions is up to you, and I don't think it's really my place to enforce a particular interpretation.
