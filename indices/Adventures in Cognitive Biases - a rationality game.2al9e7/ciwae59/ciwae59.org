An interesting illustration for people who haven't seen this sort of thing before. Very intuitive and easy to follow, but no actual new ideas or concepts for me. If I was teaching or taking an intro to probability and stats class, this might be valuable, but it's old concepts for me personally.

Some questions seemed a little imprecise or stupid. I mean, I have an extremely high probability that there have been exactly 0 reincarnations of the Dalai Lama (>99.9999%). Perhaps the question should have been something like "How many reincarnations do religious followers of his ascribe to the Dalai Lama?" if they wanted to use the answer they went with (though I guess it might be interpreted as a joke based on the monk trappings?). A couple others also felt like the questions were wrong or imprecise. For another example, consider the number of countries in the world question - I personally think the best answer is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AivEQmfPpk][around 200 or so]], but honestly this is more a question about 'how do you define a country' than a real question with a concrete answer.
