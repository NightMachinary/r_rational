I know how to answer questions on tests to score what the tester expects. I have extremely good test-taking skills. That said, I hate tests like this one where to score 'correctly' I have to answer incorrectly because of the test-giver's biases and prejudices, rather than actually choosing the factually correct answer.

True story: I had an English teacher who actually taught us that, in Shakespeare's Macbeth, the titular character was never motivated not by ambition or lust for power or persuasion by his wife but was instead a purely noble and good person who was corrupted by an evil spell from the play's witches, and that any other interpretation of the play's events was wrong. After discussing and attempting to persuade the teacher and eventually giving up, I answered tests and wrote in essays basically fundamentally wrong things about the play and ended up in the top of the class. I didn't feel good about it, though.
