"How many years does a plastic bag take to degrade?"

"Hmm... I don't know, but I remember hearing that glass bottles take 4000 years, and plastic bags seem more flimsy so they'll take slightly less time. I'll guess between 100 and 1500 years, peaking at 400."

... but at the flattest I can make my belief graph, it only spans 130 years.

This seems like it should be fixable. Have you tried using logarithms?
