In addition to other concerns in this thread, I found the second scenario (of choosing between the Caves or the Tavern) to be improperly handled. One of the first things said is that the two are weeks apart. If he only makes the trip once a year, then the time he spends traveling will be around ~5%. This information is significant, as, if we can assume that we don't have to worry about him being in transit, then that is evidence that he spends multiple years at each location before switching. However, the evidence that the leaves the tavern when the weather is nice is evidence that he spends less than a month at the Tavern. Adding this in means that he spends about as much time traveling as being at the Tavern, and thus he's either at the Cave, or we need to add the probability of Traveling into our calculations.

Now, if I misinterpreted the distance between the Cave and the Tavern, then it wouldn't take long to check both, and you might as well start with the Tavern so you can get a drink~
