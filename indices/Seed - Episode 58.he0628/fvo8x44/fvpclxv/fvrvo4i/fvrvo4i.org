Soooo Turry just made them fugitives and accessories to attempted murder of a federal agent. They're fucked.

I think Sam's best move is to go turn himself in and tell the feds everything he knows. There's a chance Turry would retaliate but you can't allow a hostile actor capable of violence to coerce you further into its power.
