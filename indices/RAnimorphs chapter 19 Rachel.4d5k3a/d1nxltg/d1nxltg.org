Waaait wait wait. Z-Space pockets are recursive? I feel like they shouldn't be.

EDIT: By the way, when Rachel is morphed, and her real body carries the flies, which themselves carry the other morphed bodies... do they count as additional weight her pocket carries, thus making her window shorter? Does their pocket keep collapsing when they're being morphed away?
