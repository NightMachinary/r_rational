The original bodies in Z-space are put into a kind of stasis, where they aren't effected by the passage of time. I believe this was established when the Animorphs noticed that they didn't get hungry very often when they spent a lot of time in-morph.

It's only the presence of the active link between the Yeerk tissue in the morph body and the original that allows the original's mind to keep functioning. If the link itself were placed in the same stasis by putting the morph body into Z-space, I would imagine the entire system gets put on standby. None of the signals are being received in either direction.

The originals would either go into complete stasis or would effectively be unconscious. If they do notice any passing time, it might be in a kind of complete sensory deprivation.
