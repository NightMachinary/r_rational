Not sure what specifically you mean by perspective switching. Each chapter is entirely from a single perspective (in this case, Rachel's). At one point, she's morphed into Marco, and at another, she's in a Tidwell body with Illim in control, but at all times, she's the "I" of the chapter.

If there's a specific thing I can clear up, I'm happy to try.
