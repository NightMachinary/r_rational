(Had to revisit chapter 3 to remind myself of the tip-off.)

I think I'm missing something about the 'alphabetical order'--if I count correctly it should chronologically be A-C-J-M-R, but the fourth doesn't look like M's perspective and the fifth doesn't look like R's perspective (unless I'm misunderstanding). Another interpretation of the alphabetical order comment, plus the 'over's they're all making a point of saying leads me to expect they should be saying Aover, Cover, Jover, Mover, Rover, but they aren't--so I don't see where the order is being conveyed. <puzzlement>

Tip-off conversations: Any particular reason why they happened so chronologically close to each other?

Advice/Second opinion: Wasn't that just acquired? Why a need to ask for it again, or wouldn't it be a third opinion by that point? (Even if different due to up-to-dateness, some thoughts on the answer at that time should already have been had and witnessed..?)

Quite interested to see what happens next!
