Wait I'm confused....

Why would the Yeerks have to wait until a Gedd dips their heads in the pool by chance? That's only true for the first ever Gedd, and after that the Yeerks could easily arrange among themselves to only enter the left ear and exit out the right ear. No need to wait for the Gedd to come back, just arrange to swap off hosts while a Yeerk is leaving for another Yeerk to take control through the other ear.
