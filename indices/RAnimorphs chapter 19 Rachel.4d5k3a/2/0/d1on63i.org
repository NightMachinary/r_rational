I don't think they need to be recursive for this to work, that is to say, I don't think Z-space pockets need to be able to hold other pockets in turn.

It could be that the way the morphing tech works is that every time you morph, a Z-space pocket is created somewhere in Z-space and the controlling intelligence placed within it together with everything it takes with it, and a morph is generated in regular space. If someone else were to take the morph along with them into Z-space they're still taking regular matter into a new Z-space pocket, not putting a Z-space pocket inside another.

It's not recursion, it's linked lists.
