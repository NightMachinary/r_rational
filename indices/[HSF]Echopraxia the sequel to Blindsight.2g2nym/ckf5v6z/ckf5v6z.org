It was definitely very nicely done. I'm not entirely sure it's quite as awesome as Blindsight, but it does not hesitate to apply the concepts from the first book in its speculations.

Watts also plays around with the idea of 'faith' in a way that's especially interesting, given that, in all, I think I can class it with Blindsight in the 'proto-rationalist' to 'rationalist' section of my library.
