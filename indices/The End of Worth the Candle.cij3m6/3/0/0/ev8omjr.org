  Fallatehr tapped his finger to his lips. “There is a book about a candle, written in 97 FE, which describes it in exacting detail. Each imperfection of the candle is noted, every possible measurement of it is taken, and the composition of the candle is detailed down to the diet of the hog whose fat was rendered to make it. It runs for four hundred pages.”

  “Okay,” I said slowly. “So the soul is like ... a list of things about a person?”

  “Some of the information listed about the candle was procedural,” said Fallatehr. “There are details of how it was created, what processes were used to render the fat, information on the construction of the molds, and all that sort of thing. The soul has nothing like it. There is nothing written upon the soul that will tell you how a person came to be as they are, no history, only marks that you might use to work backwards and infer.”

From chapter 63, titled The Chemical History of a Candle.

I'd speculate that the DM summoned book 'Worth the Candle' is what we're currently reading, written by Joon, titled with a reference to the unnamed candle book written in 97 FE.
