On Aerb, plastic has an innate magic inherent to it. If you implant enough small disks of it under your skin, you become a plastic mage. This allows you to change forms, have magical mental flexibility... And the secret, dangerous technique is that it allows you to merge with other plastic mages into a single being. This can apparently be an exponential runaway process, which got barely stopped the first time it happened.
