  Aerb is an incredible shithole as far as worlds go.

I disagree, Aerb has infinite opportunities, basically every problem is solvable, given enough time/work invested. On Earth, In comparison, many unfortunate circumstances are hopeless. As someone who's currently stuck in such a situation (severe health problems), I would transfer to Aerb without a second thought given a choice.
