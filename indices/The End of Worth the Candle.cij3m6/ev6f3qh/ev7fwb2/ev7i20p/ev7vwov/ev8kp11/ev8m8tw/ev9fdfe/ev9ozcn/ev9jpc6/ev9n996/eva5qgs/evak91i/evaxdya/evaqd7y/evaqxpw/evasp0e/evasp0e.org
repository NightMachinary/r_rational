I ballparked a pessimistic overshoot on undeveloped new tech to maturity based on the huge variance in the estimates.

Take project apollo: [[https://history.nasa.gov/Apollomon/Apollo.html]] this site says conservative estimate was §20 billion, early estimates were $7-$12 billion. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program]] has a final figure of $25 billion. So the variance in the estimates is only a factor of x2-x3 and yet the worst estimate was overshot by 25%.

The Olkiluoto nuclear reactor, first of its new kind of nuclear reactors, was sold at turnkey price of €3 billion, ended up going to €8.7 billion, planned building time: 4 years. Real build time: we don't know, it was supposed to be finished 2009 but is still currently sheduled for 2020.
