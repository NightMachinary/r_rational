Not to marginalise your issues, but most sentient life on Aerb, if I understand the ratios right, is under constant torture by unnaturally competent beings. The most likely outcome for their world is that all life other than the tortured souls and those doing the torturing are wiped out. Our planet is in a precarious spot, but we're technologically primitive and have a large opportunity for solving these issues for future lives.
