In Aerb, every "exploit" they find gets nerfed by the gods.

In our world, the exploits are small and weak. Electricity and magnetism barely do anything without centuries of infrastructure and many people's lifetimes making slight improvements to it. Computing has taken close to 200 years - and many generations of dead scientists - to finally begin to yield the *big* gains from it.

​

But no one, so far, has come along and decided to just take away something. The internet hasn't quit suddenly because an asshole god decided to exclude it to a single city. While we talk about doom and gloom scenarios following a nuclear war, the knowledge that let our civilization reach this point has been copied millions of times, between books and records in compact portable devices. Unlike what the Romans had (some parlor tricks and a few useful ideas that were lost), our advancements are here to stay.

​

And we're /this/ close to unlocking a means to ending all of our problems, one way or another. (yes, super-intelligent AI is an existential risk but it also offers a possible route to banning human death and illness and unfairness)

Did you know that the neural network algorithm Google calls "AutoML" is a neural network that can find superior neural network architectures, and it is itself subject to the same improvements...?
