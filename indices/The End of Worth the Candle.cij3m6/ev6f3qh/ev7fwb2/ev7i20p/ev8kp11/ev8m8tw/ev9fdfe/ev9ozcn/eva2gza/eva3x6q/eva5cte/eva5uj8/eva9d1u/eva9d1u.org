/People trying too hard to be nice on the internet is definitely, absolutely, certainly not/ what I'm talking about, and you damn well know it!

#+begin_quote
  It isn't honesty, it is craven congeniality in the face of imminent danger, which is exactly how we got where we are environmentally.
#+end_quote

I didn't say anything about people being nice on the internet, and you know god-danmed well that's not what I meant. But you do have a point, you said

#+begin_quote
  I could argue with you, but I'd have to make something up
#+end_quote

And here you are doing exactly that. But for all you're affectation of having trouble communicating, you know that's nonsense because you also said

#+begin_quote
  I don't think that would be particularly fair.
#+end_quote

And it's not. I'm done speaking to you. At best you're a fool, at worst you're a bad actor using the bullshit asymmetry principle. Either way, you're waste of time.
