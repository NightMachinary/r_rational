You just linked me something from an economist, who said that the scientists should be ignored, because it would hurt the economy. I shit you not, second paragraph he likens spending money combatting climate change is the same as spending money on tracking asteroids that could hit earth as equally dangerous and equally dismissed. He then said that if you're concerned about climate change, then you should be concerned about terrorism, because carbon emissions reductions would reduce our ability to fight terrorism. This podcast is garbage. For being on a sub that preports to be about rationality, you don't seem to have much.

Edit:*/JFC/* I'm done reading, after he says "humanity has gotten along for the last 5-10 thousand years by deciding to fix problems when they arise he pulls the 10B number out of his ass, then hand waves it away.

    Estimates show that the total cost of avoiding all global warming for the 21st century would be on the order of $10 billion dollars. So, remember: this is probably between 3 and 4 orders of magnitude cheaper. So, typically we talk about $10-$100 trillion dollars of trying to fix global warming. This could fix it for one thousandth or one ten-thousandth of that cost. So, surely we should be looking into it, if for no other reason than because a billionaire at some point in the next couple of decades could just say, 'Hey, I'm just going to do this for the world.' And conceivably actually do it. And then of course we'd like to know if there's a really bad thing that would happen through doing that. But this is what could avoid actually any catastrophic outcomes, not just cutting carbon emissions through more solar panels--which will, in any reasonable estimate have a negligible effect over the next half century.

This is horseshit!

Theres been a book written about this guy's profession as a climate denialist masquerading as a legitimate economist.
