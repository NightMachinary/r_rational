You scale up the overshoot based on the very very wide range of estimates. The moonshot - totally untested tech, biggest project ever - had a range of estimates that were only apart by a factor of 2x-3x (with overshoot of 25%). If your estimates go over a range of 100x, you are pulling numbers out of ass, the variance gets higher and the worst case scenario is that much worse.

I'll take a bet that if we made this it would cost more than 5x the worst estimate annually.
