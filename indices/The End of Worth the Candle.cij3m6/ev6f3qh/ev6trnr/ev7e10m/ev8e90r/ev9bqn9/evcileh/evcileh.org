Personally, I'm still leaning towards the idea of him being dead. Assuming that Uther is actually Arthur in the same way that Joon is actually Joon, I'll bet that he got a similar deal. DM talked to him, he made a choice to go to Aerb but the details are kept from him. Then he gets hit by a car on Earth to explain his absence. This would also work with the simulation idea.
