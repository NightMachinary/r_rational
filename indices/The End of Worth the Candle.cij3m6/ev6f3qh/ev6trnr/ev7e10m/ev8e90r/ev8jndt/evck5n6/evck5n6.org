Umm, maybe I'm missing something, but "worth the candle" is a saying that means something is worth the cost of doing it. It originated from needing to use up a relatively expensive candle to have the light to do things in the dark. The book Falatehr is talking about, which I think is based off an IRL book, definitely has some interesting parallels in regards to the story, but it isn't where the title of the story came from. Joon used the phrase "worth the candle" in his prayer to the DM when they were in Weik Handum or however it's spelled, and mentioned this when everyone was discussing the DM's second appearance.
