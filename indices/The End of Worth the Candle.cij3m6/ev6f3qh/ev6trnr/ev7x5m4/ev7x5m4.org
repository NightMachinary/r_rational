Simulation is already strongly implied. I don't think Joon would freak out at it being a simulation; he's already pretty much concluded that, as have most of us I think. There's hells of a lot of evidence that it's either a simulation or the DM wants Joon to think it's one, and it just being one is the simpler hypothesis in many respects.
