In addition to what azurebyrds mention, in chapter 36 Juniper gradually adds points to MEN to see how his knowledge and capabilities change. After adding a certain amount of points, the following pops up on the game layer:

*/WARNING: COGNITIVE ENHANCEMENT HAS CAUSED PERSONALITY NETWORK TO EXCEED HOLISTIC INTEGRITY THRESHOLDS. REVERSING AND REFACTORING EMULATION TO WITHIN HOLISTIC INTEGRITY THRESHOLDS. ENABLING TRI-STRATUM PSEUDO-INTELLIGENCE INJECTION SETTING TO COMPENSATE./*

This appears to describe Juniper's mind as an emulation, which Juniper seems to take as pretty definitive evidence that he and the rest of Aerb are being simulated. He takes it in stride though.
