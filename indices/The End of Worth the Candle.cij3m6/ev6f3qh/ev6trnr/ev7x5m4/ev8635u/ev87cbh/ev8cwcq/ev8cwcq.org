Many different messages from the game-layer. Specific instances include when Joon's mental stats got too high and the game-layer switched to knowledge-injection mode, the crash when Valencia got her infernal-eating powers, and the failsafe that went off when Joon got hit with the infohazard in the Library that kept it from using his full processing power (each more blatantly simulation-implying than the last).

Like I said, Joon seems to be operating under the simulation hypothesis, and IIRC Amaryllis has seemed to be too.
