Joon screws something up so that the status quo is going to be much worse than people being tortured in the hells forever, with no hope of recovery. Through a desperate gambit, someone then successfully ends the universe, which is a good thing in comparison to the alternative. Some tiny piece of Joon's legacy makes its way back to Earth.

A better ending than godhood, at least.
