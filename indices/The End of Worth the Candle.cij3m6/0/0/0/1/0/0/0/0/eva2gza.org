That's good, because I didn't describe you that way either. I said that your empty, shallow, condescending words are worthless and not even remotely close to an arguement. You even agree with me, but want to act smug and superior?

We do not, as a global society, have the necessary mindset for what needs to happen to avoid a catastrophic loss of human life. And your mealy-mouthed response of "I'm sorry you feel this way. Life can be tough, and it's certainly not fair" is an idiotic pleasantry.
