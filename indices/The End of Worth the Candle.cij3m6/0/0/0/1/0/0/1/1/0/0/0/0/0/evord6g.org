That's a bummer. He did seem to have a number of good points, like the public should be caring for other extinction level events. Recently a meteorite got reallly close to earth and we aren't prepared for stuff like that. I also can't seem to locate the source for 10 billion dollar for fighting climate change but the idea of using geo engineering to generate clouds and create reflexive surfaces are very compelling.

Accordin to a friend who lives in the artic, his points about polar bears are poor as hunting them are in fact already banned most places. It's allowed on greenland since they need it for food and it's allowed in self defence (you really need to be able to shoot an angry bear running towards you). The change of ice means that they have to go longer for seals and so the diminishing population is in fact due to climate change.
