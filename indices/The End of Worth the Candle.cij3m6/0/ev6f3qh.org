Aerb is an /incredible/ shithole as far as worlds go. Tons of hells and so many existential risks that plastic mages - an X-risk in and of itself - still get used after a couple close calls in that one Library glimpse because the X-risk doesn't even register as worth avoiding. -_-

The Aerbian hells alone make Aerb as-is such an incredibly bad place that removal of those is the basic rat!story necessity. Normally that'd require godhood but we have Library glimpes of depopulated hells, probably via Valencia. That leaves us with ALL THE OTHER SHIT that is going down on Aerb.

Basically to satisfy rat!story requirements and Mary+that other guys stated ethical intentions, its either soft godhood like Uther had for thousands of years to even have a chance at the long future, or hard godhood.

Hard godhood is kinda boring, so I'll go with lots of exclusions and soft godhood for a long time.
