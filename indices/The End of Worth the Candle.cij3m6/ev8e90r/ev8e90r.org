:END:

I feel like the ending has been heavily foreshadowed. The DM revealed to us that Joon agreed to 'enter' Aerb and would be satisfied with the ending. The title of the story is Worth the Candle, which is a reference to an in-story book about the supply chain and production of an actual candle (pig slaughter, not beeswax).

So we, as readers, are being taken through a metaphorical pig's life, slaughter, and greater purpose. The pig is Aerb et al. and the greater purpose is Joon. AKA there's a lot of suffering in Aerb and we as readers are supposed to question whether Joon's closure / character development is worth that moral and/or ethical cost.

Whether Aerb is a simulation or not is unimportant, as Aerb has been demonstrated to be too real to dismiss as "Oh, it was all fake? I guess Fenn and Mary don't matter since they were just fake and can stop existing now."

Joon as a capital G-God may or may not happen, but if it does then I do not believe that would be the end or purposeful to Joon or us as readers beyond wrapping up loose plot lines in Aerb.

The story's about the candle, not the pig. Joon, not Aerb.

That said, I don't expect Joon to remain in Aerb when the story ends, whether he dies or returns to Bumblefuck, Kansas I won't speculate on. So the G-God question becomes a bit irrelevant.
