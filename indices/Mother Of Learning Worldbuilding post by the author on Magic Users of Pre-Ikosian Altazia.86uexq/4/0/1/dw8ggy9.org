#+begin_quote
  The "their own willingness" part is supposed to the witches, I think, so the meaning of that clause is "witches are willing to bend the laws [thus they are still not regarded highly]".
#+end_quote

I agree.

Toe the line means

#+begin_quote
  accept the authority, policies, or principles of a particular group, especially unwillingly.
#+end_quote

So "willing to bend the laws" means the same as "unwilling to toe the line".

#+begin_quote
  [Witches] still exist */on the margins of society/*, because they are unwilling to toe the line.

  [Witches] */still exist/*, because they are willing to toe the line.
#+end_quote

Both of these would make sense, but the second sentence would be inconsistent with the "lingering prejudices" point. They aren't still existing because of "lingering prejudices", but they are on the margins because of them.
