+I think this one is actually right? The full sentence is:+

#+begin_quote
  +[Witches] still exist on the margins of society, however, due to lingering prejudices among the populace and their own willingness to toe the line in regards to magical regulations.+
#+end_quote

+The "their own willingness" part is supposed to the witches, I think, so the meaning of that clause is "witches are willing to bend the laws [thus they are still not regarded highly]".+

+I think "their own willingness" doesn't refer to "the populace", though I see how the structure of the sentence causes obfuscation.+

EDIT: I had the wrong definition for "toe the line".
