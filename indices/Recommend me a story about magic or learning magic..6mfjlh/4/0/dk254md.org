I love these books like candy, but they're candy; there's very little investigation or rationality to commend them, it's mostly just standard xianxia executed at a professional standard by a native English writer.

(The mostly is because the top echelon of power are something like sci fi ancient aliens mixed with the Diablo series' archangels, which was a new one to me.)
