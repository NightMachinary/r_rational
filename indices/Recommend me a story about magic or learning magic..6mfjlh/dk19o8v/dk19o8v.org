Two original stories I can recommend are [[http://blastron01.tumblr.com/kumoko-contents][I'm a Spider, So What?]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSnakeReport/comments/5xh4o7/chapter_0/][The Snake Report]]. Both of which are stories where a person gets reincarnated into a fantasy world with RPG mechanics as a lowly monster, and they must struggle to survive. Admittedly, both stories put large emphasis on the struggle for survival, but the way they tend to go about that is by having the protagonist explore the abilities they have and find the best way to use them.

In the realm of fanfiction, I can recommend [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/about/][The Waves Arisen]], a Naruto fanfic. It's even listed on our [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][wiki]] as a defining work of the rational fiction genre. It's a world where the magic system is consistent but specifically /not/ loophole-proof. Naruto gets himself in a position to exploit the rules of the setting to become very powerful very quickly, which is good because the challenges he has to face scale just as quickly for similar reasons.

In a similar vein, there's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/][The Two Year Emperor]], in which a country in a D&D rules as written world summon the protagonist from Earth to be their supreme ruler for the next two years. Being rules as written, it's very broken and our protagonist immediately sets out to break the system as much as he can because his enemies outgun him in every possible way.

And if I may diverge from writing, the anime [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon][Log Horizon]] seems like something you'd like. It has the fairly standard premise of a bunch of MMO players being transported into the game, except there's no indication whatsoever that escape is even possible, so instead of an aimless quest to find a way out people start coming to terms with living in a fantasy world and attempt to build a stable society as best they can (the fact that players still respawn then they die doesn't hurt). Many things about how the world work have changed in the transition from game to reality, and a good amount of the story involves the veterans of the game figuring out what's the same and what's changed.

Lastly, [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][A Hero's War]] is a story where, to defeat the apocalyptic army of zombies, the queen of a fantastical country summons a hero to lead an elite group in a quest for a fabled sword which will grant the power to save the country. Our protagonist, though, is the /second/ person the summoning ritual brought along for the ride, a materials engineer who the summoning ritual plopped at the outskirts of civilization. He's no good in a fight but as a materials engineer he happens to know how to do things like build furnaces capable of producing high quality steel among other things, and once he hits his stride he starts taking a look at how exactly the magic in this world works and how he can best make use of that, both to enhance society's standard of living and to create better weapons for the fight against the zombie armies.
