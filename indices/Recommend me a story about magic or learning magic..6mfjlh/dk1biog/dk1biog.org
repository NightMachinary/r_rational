Rick Cook's /Wiz Biz/ series where a programmer enters a magical world and creates a whole new kind of magic based on programming.

Randall Garret's /Lord Darcy/ series has an intricately worked out magic system ... applied to forensic investigation.

The classic work of this kind has the protagonist encounter another new magic system in each story: the /[In]complete Enchanter/ series by L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt, and extended by others.

Poul Anderson's /Operation Chaos/ and Harry Turtledove's /The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump/ are also notable.
