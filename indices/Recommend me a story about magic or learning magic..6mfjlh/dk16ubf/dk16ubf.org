I know I just recced this the other day, but try [[http://www.casualvillain.com/Unsounded/comic/ch01/ch01_01.html][Unsounded.]] It has a consistent magic system, which /is/ used extensively in combat, but also in the setting's technology in various ways. There is an organization dedicated to advancing humanity's understanding of magic through scientific experimentation, and the central plot is driven by a character's effort to advance a particular area of magic. Various characters make a study of different aspects of the magic system to pursue their own goals, and some have made significant breakthroughs (usually prior to the events of the story, but you sometimes get to see how they did it).

There are also written side stories that delve into magical research efforts in greater detail--for example, there's one that portrays the comic's main character and a college friend collaborating on a research project into the properties of light and how they might be exploited and manipulated with magic. I don't recommend reading the side stories before catching up on the comic, though, since they contain spoilers. The author also often answers reader's questions about the finer details of the magic system on her Tumblr.

I will note that the main magic-using character in the series has already pretty much mastered the art, so the excitement with him has been mostly seeing how he cleverly applies it rather than in watching him gain new abilities. The current arc has been touching on that magic science organization and its recent acquisition of a tool for studying an area of magic that was previously pretty opaque, so that's exciting. Just be aware that it takes a while for the magic system to be explored in depth, since the focus is initially on setting up the story, so the early magic combat scenes don't really show off the underlying structure until you go back and reread them later.
