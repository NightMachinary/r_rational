Got it. I'm not on the wagon of "if it's not the System it's not interesting," so I don't find interim chapters disappointing, but if you're only interested in combat and System exploration I can see how it would be.

For the record I also disagree with what seems to be the consensus here that the author sucks at writing interpersonal/emotional scenes. I enjoy the friendships that Rain has built, and even though Rain/Ameliah is obvious from a mile away, I'm still rooting for them & think they'd make a good couple. I'm also interested in the fleshing out of Ascension's command structure/economy, so chapters focused on that are interesting to me as well.
