We don't reasonably expect him to for half a year as he'll likely need to delve to do so, which he plans to do in the badlands, which he won't reach until at least after vestval, but he also said he might take vestval survivors to the smuggler city first. And he'll need a party capable of taking down a 25 monster, I don't know if ameliah and tallhearts will be sufficient when his other highest companions are lower than him. So yeah, that sounds like around 25 chapters, maybe 50 for the actual blue, no?
