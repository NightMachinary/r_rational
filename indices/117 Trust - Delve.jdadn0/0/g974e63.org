Not sure how I got started on Delve but thinking of putting it on hiatus till the chapters build up. Story updates once a week and the pacing is so slow, it is as if the author is racing alongside the Chinese wuxia writers who take chapters to make a point that one could make in a couple of sentences. Less said about the constant Math tutorial the better, though the author seems to have toned it down off late.

That said there are occasional flashes of brilliance in the writing, which is the only reason I haven't dropped the novel as yet.
