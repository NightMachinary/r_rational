I think what made Delve great from chapters say 1-60 (this is a huge ballpark, /basically/ everything was great up until the barrier is erected.) was a few things:

- *Rain filling out his levels and build* was really interesting reading about how his build is super non-standard but still potentially very viable.

- *Rain exploring /other/ builds, learning about them, and how they interact, meeting new people with new builds. Seriously, unlocking skill trees and selling that information should have been one of his highest priorities once he realized he could do that. Its such an easy way to make money.* His group should have /very/ strong supports and fighters at every level, because he can write down their build and show them how good it will be to convince them to do it.

- *actually delving.* We get him in like, 2 lairs in the whole story, although that's about to be 3.

- *meaningful progression of skills/levels/abilities* He's been spending like, 100k mana per day for weeks just so we can get throwaway lines about how mana manipulation is finally level 7. It ties in with other complaints I have, namely that he hasn't increased his cap in like 2 years worth of chapters.

As for how this chapter specifically feels like a let down? Well, its extremely short and nothing happens to change anything. There's a lair, but it won't raise his cap. He hasn't spent time convincing people to build efficiently for higher levels, so we're gonna see the same old shitty builds or perhaps slightly optimized builds. Based on where the story is going we're gonna get a few chapters of this lair, then they'll move on with some newly awakened and continue to that city where the mages family is, likely spend 15 chapters or so there, where nobody is likely to advance, nor can Rain make any progress besides stupid "synchronization" percentages which feel really useless as a reader.

Basically this chapter feels like a precursor to 4 months of the same shit.
