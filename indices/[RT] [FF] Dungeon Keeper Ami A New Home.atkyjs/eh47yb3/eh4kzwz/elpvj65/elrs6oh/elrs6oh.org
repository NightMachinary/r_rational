I never claimed that it was rationalist, just that it was rational.

But, assuming you meant to claim that it wasn't rational, I disagree. It's pretty common in rational stories for the characters to take the known rules of magic as brute fact and work within them without worrying about why they're the specific way they are rather than some other way. There exist some exceptions, sure, but I feel like claiming that being-an-exception is necessary for a story to count as rational will lead you to an excessively narrow picture of what exactly ratfic is.
