The Anime Addventure format was deliberately designed so that anyone can take an un-used prompt and start adding at any point in the story, creating a new branch for the story to go off of. The good news is that the author Pusakuronu has written an unbroken, un-branching story that has been re-posted to a forum and can be read like a traditional narrative.
