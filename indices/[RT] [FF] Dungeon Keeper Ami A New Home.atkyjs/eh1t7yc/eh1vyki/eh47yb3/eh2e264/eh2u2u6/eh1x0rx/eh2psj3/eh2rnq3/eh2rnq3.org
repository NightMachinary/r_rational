  To accomplish something similar for a pseudo-sleep spell, Ami would need a specialized medical setup. She'd need something to oxygenate her blood /and/ remove the carbon dioxide, and /fast./ Probably without ever actually moving it all through her lungs either, since even with her heart pumping faster, there's probably some hard hydraulic limitations on how fast liquid can move through tight spaces...

Then how do the plants do it? Plants too need to "breathe", in the sense of absorbing air. The leaves may be fine because they produce oxygen, but the rest of the plant needs to absorb oxygen or it dies. A similar issue arises for water: plants don't have blood, but they still need water to live. So when a plant is accelerated, liquid has to move FAST from the roots to the leaves through tight spaces otherwise the plant dies.
