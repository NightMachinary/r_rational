I don't think that's enough to make it rationalist. In particular she uses the system and thinks about how to use it more efficiently but she doesn't question it, for example the sapphire-gold-aluminium oxide-sapphire cycle is made but no questioning of why gold and sapphire are valuable in the way they are or why no other power appears to have used it, including ones that have the power and knowledge to do so. In addition the munchkin stompfest definitely happens, the author gets better at it over the course of the story but the effects are still felt to the current part. Really what redeems it for me is how when she touched the molten adamantium and had a test of guilt the main thing is how she realised that she shouldn't have invaded the dwarves like that, even if you have power and cause to do something doesn't mean you should.
