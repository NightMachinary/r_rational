Lots of clever munchkinry used to beat much-stronger enemies (in the well-written way where the enemies' strength actually feels pertinent and threatening, not the "munchkin stompfest against nominally-stronger enemies with no narrative weight" failure mode that a lot of stories have). Lots of well-executed good-versus-good conflicts wherein all involved parties are well-intentioned but either place differing weights on particular tradeoffs or are unable to trust one another due to epistemological issues. Also does a bunch of good worldbuilding, both on the "fleshing out the Dungeon Keeper universe" front and on the "fusing it in interesting ways with the Sailor Moon universe" front.
