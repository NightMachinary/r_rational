Depending on how it works it might let you break through things. Your body is entirely impervious to damage, so what happens when you try to jam your pinky into a brick wall with all your strength? Your pinky certainly won't break, so if you anchor yourself sufficiently well that you can't get pushed back then you should break through.

I have a nagging doubt my physics is off.
