I'd be pretty upset by this situation honestly, seeing as I'm a trans person and not particularly happy with my body. Ignoring that issue, I think I'd just live my normal life without fear. I'd be immune to the elements so homelessness would be an inconvenience at worst. So my focus would be on finding some measure of long-term happiness. And who knows, with all the time in the world, maybe I could become an omnidisciplinary scientist, among other things.
