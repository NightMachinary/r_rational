Well, yeah, if the murders were happening in a vacuum. But most crime scenes have DNA besides the killer's present, and plenty of killers don't leave enough usable DNA behind out of pure luck. Finding a crime scene with no DNA evidence wouldn't be evidence enough of our protagonist's involvement, and that's assuming that their abilities are well-known in the first place, which, if they were going to become an international assassin, I'm guessing they'd keep private. ;)
