I hire an agent. That's generally a good idea of you have superpowers, and they don't include having the power to get the most out of your power. Even Contessa had Doctor Mother helping her figure out how to best use her power.

I also start a trust fund to find me should I go missing, and carry a GPS and transmitter and a distress beacon with me at all times. I do /not/ want to get buried alive. Zoning out helps, but I don't want to have to zone out until someone mines out the entire Earth for raw materials for a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrioshka_brain][Matrioshka brain]].

Long term, I need to prevent the heat death of the universe. I am a perpetual motion machine, so in theory I could just turn a crank to power everything or something. The problem is that I'd need to be very careful never to lose matter. It takes nearly 90 petajoules to produce one gram of matter. 180 if you count the antimatter I'll also produce and need to get rid of. The good news is I have a /very/ long time to figure out how to make something that needs that little maintenance. If I don't find anything, I figure I'll jump into a black hole. Unless my powers allow me to travel through time, that will kill me.
