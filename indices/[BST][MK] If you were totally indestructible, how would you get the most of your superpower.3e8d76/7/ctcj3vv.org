Along the same lines as the rest of the responses I'd look towards something dangerous as well, but rather than simple emergency response (admittedly I'd probably be involved in that on and off as well) I would help in hostage situations, warzones, and other high-pressure situations. Bomb threats and whatnot would be good as well. The size issue in being a teenage girl would stifle some of the possibilities, but I could rescue children from situations and use my indestructable body as a human shield without putting myself at risk.\\
For an explosive situation I would see if it's possible for me to bodily produce a seal around the given explosive. It's easy to consider protecting people from explosions with my body but if there's not a solid seal it could still produce an unsafe situation for those around me. Regardless of the physical capability of doing so, it would still be easy enough to walk the bomb away to a safer situation.

Considering the overwhelming number of landmines still placed in wartime countries it would also make sense for me to run around and try to set them off. Protecting a dog, kid, or woman from potentially blowing themselves up while they attempt to survive in a ravaged area would be a positive use of the power. Considering my status as a teenaged girl in the situation I believe I would find it fun as well getting thrown around by explosions without any possibility of bodily harm.

And, if at some point I have gained enough reputation to get my way onto a space voyage I would set records for space walking time without space suit (rather easy considering). I could also use my status to get into showdowns with famous MMA fighters and boxers and whatnot where they could attempt to beat me up in front of thousands of screaming fans. That would likely get old in a bit but I'm sure I could get enough money from that and the advertising deals that would come with it to finance my ability to get involved in more of the activities mentioned earlier.

I'm not sure how rational this all sounds, but I think it sounds like a pretty good use of my capabilities in the situation.
