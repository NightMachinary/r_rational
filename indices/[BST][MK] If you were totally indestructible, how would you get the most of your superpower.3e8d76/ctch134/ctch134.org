Stunt-person is the obvious pay-day here. More socially useful.. Become a fire fighter/rescue worker. Don't need protective gear, and no matter what goes wrong, can always be dug out of the rubble after. Law enforcement is also an option, but really, invulnerability won't be applicable nearly as often there as it would be in emergency work.
