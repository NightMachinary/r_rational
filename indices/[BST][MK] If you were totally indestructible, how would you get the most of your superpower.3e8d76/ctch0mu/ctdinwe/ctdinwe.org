Spacewalks looks like something that would actually be more dangerous to this person than to normal humans, since the worst normal humans have to fear is death -- but if you drift into space, you'll have endless boredom of drifting through space unable to die, or will be trapped for endless eons in the center of sun....

Fate worse than death, if you don't have a way of deactivating the suffering called 'boredom'...

EDIT: Saw you talk about that, in a different comment. Never mind then.
