I'd do something that would (for someone else):

- Be really dangerous
- Require special equipment

Repairing broken undersea cables, doing naked spacewalks, working as a firefighter ... those sorts of things. Probably not mining though, given that I could still be trapped forever by a collapse. Probably not nuclear work, given that I wouldn't want to be radioactive. Depending on how many other people with superpowers are out there, I could probably get a show on television, or a Youtube channel, which would give me an income, assuming that people wanted to watch me repeatedly surviving bigger and more extreme stunts.

Obviously I would also collect the Randi Prize. I'd also get some scientists together to poke and prod me in hopes of being able to reverse-engineer my power.

(Edit: My pitch to NASA would be that I don't need food or water, I wouldn't suffer muscle atrophy, I wouldn't suffer from cosmic ray bombardment, I can work on the exterior of the space station without a space suit, and I don't need a return vehicle.)
