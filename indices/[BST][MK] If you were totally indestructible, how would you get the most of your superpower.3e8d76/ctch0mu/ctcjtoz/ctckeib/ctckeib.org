No, I thought it through. All human spaceflight thus far (save for the Apollo missions) has been in low earth orbit, where orbital decay is a significant limitation in how long you can be left drifting. Per [[http://www.lizard-tail.com/isana/lab/orbital_decay/][this calculator]] I probably wouldn't be spending much more than a month drifting, even assuming that I had no means of slowing my orbit (I would likely insist on having an emergency electrodynamic tether wrapped around my waist that I could unfurl to increase drag in case some catastrophe).
