Oh. I see. You're talking about working on low-orbit, shitty little "space" stations. Poorly funded and planned buckets of failure still sitting in the thermosphere, for dog's sake. Like we're using now.

Sorry. You're right. When I think "space station," I usually think outside the upper atmosphere. /Real/ space stations, what you'd need to actually work and live in space. Habitats [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit#/media/File:Orbitalaltitudes.jpg][in GEO, not LEO]], and certainly not those constantly boosting embarrassments currently up there. If you want to risk belly-boarding from low, /low/ LEO, then go for it. Take along a Go-Pro.

I can't believe I actually failed /optimistically/ there. Sigh. Maybe someday we'll put on our grownup-pants and actually do space right, hopefully before sending manned suicide missions to Mars. Look at us, here in 2015 and not a single Lagrange Point hab, let alone a small little GEO science station. Heinlein would be so disappointed.
