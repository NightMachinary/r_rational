To me, it really sounds like this setup requires that the mind be no longer an electrochemical process of an organic brain, but rather to be recreated as some sort of em, perhaps running on whatever substrate now encompasses your body, or perhaps running outside our /metric universe/† altogether, with the results injected in. The body is now effectively something like a "game avatar" for the mind, being piloted by wire.

As such, I'd expect that none of the things about brain chemicals apply any more, since the brain is no longer chemical. But /equivalent processes/ might have been created as part of the "hypervisor drivers" of whatever's simulating the mind---algorithmic processes that obey rules that determine that certain stimuli over extended periods will make you bored, etc.

Basically, I would imagine that whatever features a cybernetics engineer would need to hack into the hypervisor software to make an uploaded brain remain human over time, would be there; and anything /not/ meeting that criterion (like, say, stomach cramps) would be simply left unimplemented.

† Not the same thing as the /causal universe/, note.
