Nothing dramatic. Violence and danger is bad for the psyche, the only thing you've got left to damage. Physical discomfort is defined-out here, but not mental derangement. You are going to live forever, it seems, so time to get chill on a permanent basis. Maybe take some yoga classes, or just intentionally stay hopped +up+ down on drugs all the time. It isn't like they'll hurt you.

(But maybe you can't even metabolize at all anymore. Huh. I guess that means you're now breaking thermodynamics. Oops. Wonder what is supplying you with brain chemicals...now...whatever.)

On the other hand, you will have unlimited willpower and focus, as those are exhaustion of chemical processes which you have to be immune to if you never get "uncomfortable" or, as is implied, bored. You could program forever, do the dullest accounting analysis without pause or breaks--basically do the most tedious, detail-focused jobs in the world without ever having your attention lapse.

Or maybe not. It also implies you might be permanently unable to experience any "negative" emotions or even physical sensations, which has disastrous results for a human mind. No pain isn't a big deal, but no boredom, or mental or physical discomfort resulting in novelty seeking behaviors, means you'll quickly get non-human thought processes. Completing goals is still feel-good, but not completing them doesn't make you angsty or uncomfortable.

Standing around doing nothing might be relatively the same to you as doing anything else short of something on the level of eating chocolate cake and having sex (assuming no drugs with painful side-effects work on you at all anymore). In fact, without any of the downsides, you'll likely drift slowly into a maximum chocolate-cake-and-sex lifestyle. Sex, then chocolate cake during the refractory period. Rinse-off (or not, it isn't uncomfortable after all) and repeat.

--------------

But let's assume that's not the case, and your brain and internal goal systems aren't fucked badly by this change.

You can ignore the [[http://i.imgur.com/lp3SQ82.jpg][Cyborg Limb Limit]], so you can simply use your body as an unbendable element in lever operations, regardless of your personal physical strength. Exo-suits mean your physical body doesn't matter, strength wise, so you have super strength whenever you want by just strapping on enough hydraulics.

Your body is a miracle material, so I'm sure some enterprising mechanical engineer could work something lucritive out. Maybe a machine that has high operational value that can be a lot smaller by simply jamming you inside at a critical stress juncture, thus saving on reinforcement costs. Just make sure you keep it secret from any other power-gamers, otherwise you will be a very unactualized part of an infinite energy device very quickly.

--------------

Otherwise, do whatever. Just stay out of mines and arctic areas, and never get in an orbital craft. You can be a bum if you want and still live on the nicest beaches in the world. You can take a decade to write that novel you always wanted time to work on, or just scrape up some money to put into long-term investments and wait in a quiet forest for a hundred years. Or a thousand.

No reason to risk damaging your mind by trying to fight crime or do anything dangerous. If you understand your situation correctly, you will know you currently represent more potential future experiences than the rest of humanity's history and (likely) future combined. You are going to outlive /galaxies/, so take this initial time to really perfect a mellow outlook. Sooner or later, you'll almost certainly have to jump-start civilization again (human or otherwise), but for now build good mental habits that will help in your coming immortality.
