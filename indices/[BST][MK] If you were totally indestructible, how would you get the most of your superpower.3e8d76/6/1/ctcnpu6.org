Stable things are stable because they have low energy - to destroy or deform a solid object, you need to put more energy into it until it can overcome the bonds keeping its atoms in place. An unstable object - like a radioactive material - is unstable because it can lose its extra energy and become something more stable.

Indestructible things are as stable as it's possible to be (maybe a little more than that). You get energy by /creating/ indestructible things, not by destroying them.
