Hmm... presumably this power lets you reposition your body in any "normal" way. You can move your muscles etc. but it wouldn't let you dislocate your shoulder or allow your muscles to rip. So If I were to clench my arm to my chest at full strength, and someone were to pull it away with great strength, my power would allow that to happen, it simply would not allow the muscles to tear or the arm to come off etc.

So, given that alongside my further understanding of the mechanics of the lower esophageal sphincter, I believe you are correct. We would need some other, perhaps technological means to contain the micro-sun at the two available exit points, but it may still be more efficient that an entirely mundane containment method.
