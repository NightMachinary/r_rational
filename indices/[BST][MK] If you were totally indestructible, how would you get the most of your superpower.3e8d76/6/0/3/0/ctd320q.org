Where are you abusing the unphysical immovable/incompressible/indestructible property? What you're talking about sounds like it could be accomplished with masses on a frictionless ordinary rod, with pins to lock masses in place. This obviously conserves energy.

If you want a magical effect (violating conservation of energy) you need to actually exploit a magical property. Similarly, it takes about five seconds to look at hoax nonsense like the "EMDrive" and conclude that nothing about bouncing photons around in a box (thoroughly mundane) can lead to the magical effect of violating conservation of momentum.
