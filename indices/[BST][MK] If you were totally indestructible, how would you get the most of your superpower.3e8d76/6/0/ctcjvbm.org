This is something I've wondered about for a long time. My favorite magic item in D&D is the immovable rod, but I could never figure out a way to make even a buffed (indestructible, truly immovable) version of it generate energy.

The problem is that the indestructible girl is /stopping energy/, or just not being affected by it, which seems energy neutral at best. (I guess she doesn't need to eat, so is technically capable of producing 2000 calories worth of energy every day, or more if she can just work at peak efficiency all the time, but ... that doesn't seem like it's worth much to anyone.)
