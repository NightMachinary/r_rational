Generating energy with an immovable rod is trivial. Activate it in a room that happens to be spinning, such that the rod is spinning end-over-end. (The D&D rules allow such rods to work on planets, so rotating reference frames obviously aren't forbidden.) The rod has a changing quadrupole moment and will [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave#Sources_of_gravitational_waves][therefore]] radiate gravitational waves, which carry energy - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_bead_argument][thanks, Feynman]].

Could conservation of energy prevent this? I don't think so. Consider what happens if your rotating room is at the exact center of a rotating sphere of matter. Such a sphere would not radiate gravitational waves, so it'll rotate forever. If the immovable (with respect to the room/cavern) rod attempted to slow down to conserve energy, it would no longer be rotating with the sphere.

(I don't know enough GR to say what happens to a rotating rod of ordinary matter. It has to radiate, and I think the back-reaction is what will slow its rotation in free space.)
