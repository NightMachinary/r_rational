Consider that perhaps it four-dimensionally locks to the nearest mass of sufficient size. In effect, it becomes part of the mass-sphere (or the planet). It remains immovable with respect to the locked mass, but if you apply a force from outside the lock system, it will affect all of the mass normally.

Given that it presumably locks to the planet most of the time, this doesn't come up much. However, if you locked it to (say) a sphere of suitable mass, you could use a crane to pick up the rod - and the sphere would come with it. No energy output needed.
