That said, an object with a magically fixed velocity which is not anchored to the earth cannot follow the Earth perfectly, because the /earth/ does not have fixed velocity. So I think you could write a physics-consistent story about a society which harnessed the kinetic energy out of the movement of the Earth itself - with possible plot twists involving risks of throwing the earth off course and into the sun...

Of course, if it's truly "anchored" to the earth, infinite energy is available once we can move the planet. Or failing that, if the Rod only follows the /celestially predicted/ orbit given no human interference, there may or may not be room for interesting stuff involving the forces which adjust the course, since those would involve /non/-constant magical acceleration.
