  My favorite magic item in D&D is the immovable rod, but I could never figure out a way to make even a buffed (indestructible, truly immovable) version of it generate energy.

Hmm... can you not treat an immovable object as identical to an object which is inexorably moving in circles, simply by changing your frame of reference?

(For example, if it's immobile relative to /earth/, from the perspective of the sun it's always spinning in circles...)

I think either you /can/ get free energy out of this, or you can't and by corollary we /also/ proved that you can't get free energy out of unstoppable objects at constant velocity (assuming Newtonian and disregarding gravity for now), which is interesting in and of itself.

My intuition is says it's probably the latter (so if you change your frame of reference to the sun, you can use the circularly-moving rod to make other objects spin in the exact same type of circle - but that's not free energy because /eventually/ the whole universe will be spinning in that exact circle, as if someone were stirring it. In effect, it's non-renewable kinetic energy - you can only harness the motion of objects that are moving relative to the rod. Which is not exciting, since we can harness kinetic energy between objects moving relative to each other anyways, but if we have Earth as reference frame then i think we at least delay heat death by a fair amount as we anchor the stars and other massive objects one by one to keep the turbine powered by our spinning rod in place?)

Edit: Relevant: [[https://xkcd.com/162/]] and I just realized that I've accidentally derived "conservation of (angular and linear) momentum", which is apparently a thing... so yeah, I feel silly. The immovable rod gives us energy we would not otherwise have had access to, by allowing us to violate conservation of momentum each time it interacts with a moving object (and extracting more than would otherwise be possible from harvesting kinetic energy alone), but not easy infinite energy.

Edit 2: But see this: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3e8d76/bstmk_if_you_were_totally_indestructible_how/ctdk97j]]

angular velocity may be different from linear velocity
