I don't know that you'd actually be able to become /irradiated/, but I do think you could be /contaminated/. Probably not irreparable, though still not something I'd want to deal with.

As to what radiation does to the perfectly preserved body ... that's a big question. I would assume that you'd be either perfectly reflective or perfectly absorptive, but I don't really know. Clearly if you /look/ normal you're only reflecting a certain amount of light, right? And what about all the natural oils that you secrete? Do those not just replenish? Do they not get absorbed by the environment or washed away? Inquiring minds want to know.
