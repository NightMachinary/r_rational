One point that I'm a little confused on is whether or not an unalterable angular velocity will give you an infinite supply of linear acceleration in any arbitrary direction. Might you not get infinite energy that way? My intuition keeps flipping between yes and no... a constant /acceleration/ means infinite energy, after all, but I'm having difficulty reconciling that with the notion of arbitrary reference frames.

So yeah, this might all be totally wrong and maybe it's an energy free for all afterall. That's what I get for not taking physics classes past high school :( although we're still strictly Newtonian so I /should/ be able to resolve this with only what I know now. It seems I've been nerd sniped and have other work to do, so I'll leave this up for now and let's see if anyone can clear it up before I think about it more... and if we can't, we can always recruit [[/r/physics]]
