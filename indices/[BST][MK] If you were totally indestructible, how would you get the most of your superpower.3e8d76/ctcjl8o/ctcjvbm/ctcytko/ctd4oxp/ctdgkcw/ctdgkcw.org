Yes, if you have /two/ rods with differing (linear or angular) velocity, you get infinite energy.

But if you only have one, or if you have multiple but they all have identical linear/angular velocities at all times, then you can't. The only thing you /can/ do is bring the rest of the universe closer to the same velocity as your rods, and harness non-renewable energy out of that.

(And in the D&D case, I assume even if there is more than one, they'd all be anchored to the earth and therefore be identical, so no dice. But if you, say, got an Earthen rod and a Martian rod, then....)

Edit: but see this caveat - I suspect there's something I've misunderstood about rotating reference frames.
