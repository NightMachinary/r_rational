That's an interesting puzzle. I think it's quite likely impossible, but I have one I have one plausible looking setup which I haven't properly disproved so I guess I'll post it anyway.

Given objects with masses 1, 2 and 3 (these masses in particular might not be right, but that's the ordering, and the hypothesis is that there's some values that would):

1. Start in the state: 1------32
2. Launch object 2 away from 1, and lock 2 once you're in the state: 1-----3---2
3. Gravity will eventually turn this into (you can extract some energy here as well): 1--------32
4. Then unlock 2, and extract the energy from it falling to 132 which looks like it should be less than the energy to reset it to 1------32 plus the delta between what you use in the launch and what you can recover in step 3.

It should be relatively easy to prove whether that works and whether it's possible at all with gravity by actually doing the math, which I might do eventually but don't feel like right now.
