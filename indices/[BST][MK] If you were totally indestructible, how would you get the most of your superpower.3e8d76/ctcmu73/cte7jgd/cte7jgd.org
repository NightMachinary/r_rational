I used to think this: but I get really paranoid regardless.

The problem is though that we're talking about unprecedented levels of power here, not physically but in how you rewrite our understanding of the world. We're not talking about someone with a cool antibody. This has never happened before, in history. (No matter how much religious people want to coopt it into one narrative or the other)

Who the fuck knows how safe you are? Sure, the government /might/ protect you if they know about someone coming after you, but the politics of the whole thing are complex enough that you can't count on everyone else just backing off and you going back to being a nice little pet in a government lab.

EDIT: Well, being a pet is the most secure outcome. Better to say that living a normal life with no consequences (beyond the ones common to fame) because CNN and Gawker know who you are is just unrealistic. I mean, imagine what happens if the government tests you with nukes and you're still walking? Gilded cage is what you're getting, at best.
