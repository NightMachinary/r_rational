*This Chapter*

The dynamic shown here between Leet and Uber is really interesting, and it was a surprise to get a [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][Level 2 Intelligent]] Leet. If nothing else, the chapter is well written on a technical level and a satisfying discussion of heroism, villainy, and the ambition to save the world.

*General*

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4en57t/rtff_worm_elahrairah_thinkercauldrontaylor/][I've recommended]] this story before, and you can check out the link for why I did so, and what others think of the story. There was also [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4ppq49/repost_of_repostupdated_todayrtffworm_elahrairah/][some discussion last month]] about the story's flaws, and the complaints there are pretty on target.

I go back and forth myself on whether this story is worth reading, and how "rational" it is, but I think this chapter merits the label. So, if you gave up on this story, or haven't checked it out, I think this chapter is worth reading. You don't need to know much: just that Taylor goes by Administrator and is working with Cauldon, and that her power gives her a deep understanding of Shards.
