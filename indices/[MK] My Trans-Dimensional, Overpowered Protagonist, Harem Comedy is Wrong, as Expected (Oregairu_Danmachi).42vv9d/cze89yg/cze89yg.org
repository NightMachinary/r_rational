Just throwing this out there, for anyone who isn't familiar with Oregairu:

Hikki isn't a loner. He's lonely, and in denial about it.

I'm tossing this out for anyone else who would get frustrated with his "Herp derp I'm a loner yup so lonery WHY DOESN'T ANYONE LOVE ME!?" attitude. It irritated me until the above clicked.
