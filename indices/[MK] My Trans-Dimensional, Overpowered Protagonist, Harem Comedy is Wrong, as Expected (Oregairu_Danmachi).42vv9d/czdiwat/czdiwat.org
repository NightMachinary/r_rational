I haven't watched Danmachi so I'm not sure how good the munchkinry is, but there's a lot of it. The writing quality is pretty good too. A lot of internal monologue, but that's meant to mimic the style of the Oregairu light novels. The character interactions are good. The only annoyance I have is the way thoughts are presented in between lines of dialogue, which can be a little hard to follow.
