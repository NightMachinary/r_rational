The apathetic narcissistic, semi-nihilistic somewhat pessimistic main character, Hikki (from Oregairu), is placed into a gamelike dungeon universe whose main character, Bell Cranel, literally has the power of friendship. (Danmachi)

Notable moments are Hikki stretching the truth around entities that almost can't be lied to, and Hikki munchkining his various skills as well as simple tactics and dungeon knowledge to fight enemies way above his supposed weight class.
