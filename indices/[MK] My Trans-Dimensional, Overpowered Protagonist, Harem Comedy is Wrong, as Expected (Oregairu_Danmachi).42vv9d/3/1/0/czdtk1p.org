It takes place in Danmachi's fantasy setting, which is a bit similar to D&D. Hikigaya, the main character of Oregairu, which takes place in our real world, is transported to the world of Danmachi, and is trying to progress to the end of the Dungeon in order to get back home. He finds the protagonist of Danmachi, Bell Cranel, who he recognizes as the protagonist of the light novel-esque world he's in, and decides to mentor him so he can tag along to the end of the Dungeon. The story seems to follow some of the plot points of Danmachi, which is a harem comedy anime. So I'd say the main appeal is probably the comedy of seeing a dour character like Hikigaya in Danmachi's setting, but there's also quite a bit of fantasy action/munchkinism.
