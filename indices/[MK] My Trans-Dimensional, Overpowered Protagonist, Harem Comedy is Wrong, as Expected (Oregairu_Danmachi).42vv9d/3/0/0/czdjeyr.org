I'd suspect yes. I'm not familiar with Danmachi and was able to follow it. The world of Danmachi is basically based on dungeon crawling videogames, similar to D&D. The only element from Oregairu is the main character, Hikki. Familiarity with Oregairu might make it easier to understand his unhealthy mentality and his backstory, but I think it should be doable to pick up the important points as you go along.
