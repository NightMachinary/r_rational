I'm in this boat. I wasn't paying attention and just thought it was an original work for a few chapters and it read fine. Some things were more confusing than others but that really just put me in the same boat as the main character, who is also new to the universe.

That said, I later did realize that it was fanfiction and started looking up characters as needed on the Danmachi wiki. Largely unnecessary, but the fic does sometimes under-describe various side characters, so it's nice to see their full physical descriptions from the source material.
