That assumes threadmarks being used in a way which makes that possible. Not necessarily true. Some sort threads don't have/use threadmarks for whatever reason, and depending on your method/approach to editing for all I know it's possible to completely break them.

Probably doable for the ones that do use threadmarks, though.
