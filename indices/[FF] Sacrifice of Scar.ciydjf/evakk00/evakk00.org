Good premise and idea, but introduced a bit clumsily, maybe too quickly. I think the core concept here is very strong, and there are only execution issues.

It's hard to believe Simba would be so patient.

It might help if someone else could give credibility to Scar's testimony, or if Simba made some direct assumption that Scar could rhetorically flip on him. Then it'd be more sympathetic that Simba might be stunned into passivity.

Also, why did Rafiki deceive Simba? It might be good for Scar to indicate Rafiki isn't trustworthy before moving into his overall pitch. "Rafiki is the one truly responsible for your father's death" or something similar might have suitable impact.

I'd like to know Simba's reaction to this. Does he forgive and exile Scar, or refuse to acknowledge the truth and denounce him as a liar, or something else?

Finally, it'd be cool if you could somehow work in some ambiguity about whether or not this is all a lie that Scar thought up on the spot.
