Interesting point. I'm considering to sneak in some history lesson like "Remember your grand-grand-grand-father Uwazi?" or "Remember how the first lion become king of the Pridelands?".

In my mind Mufasa was in denial about the draught. Rafiki and Scar decided that immediate action was necessary. I see that this does not come through in the story.
