My only critique of the story from a "rational" point of view is that it doesn't quite make the case for why public opinion is so important to ruling the kingdom.

Assuming that Mufasa would have been willing to make the same hard choices that Scar made, then why would it be such a bad thing for the people to temporarily hate Mufasa until the drought was over?

The best answers I can think of is that long periods of discontent might lead to some unqualified ruler attempting to overthrow Mufasa instead of someone who could see the bigger picture like Scar. In which case, the lions would be doomed long term.

Or alternatively, the Lions no longer trust Mufasa, but don't want to go through the trouble of overthrowing him. So they find ways to subvert and disobey his orders whenever they can get away with it. Basically leading to the same results of dooming the lions in the long run, because their uncoordinated/careless actions break the circle of life. Though if we are to assume that Scar was able to prevent this from happening, there's no reason to say that Mufasa wouldn't have been able to do the same.

On a related note, why didn't either Scar or Mufasa try and educate the population so that they would understand the reason they needed to make the hard choices they were making? Mufasa explaining why they were going through hard times would make it less likely for the people to rise up in discontent.

In short, I like the idea that Scar was willing to make unpopular choices when the lions were in a lose-lose situation. But I'm not completely sold on the justification that Mufasa needed to die in order for those hard decisions to be made. There are some potential justifications, but they weren't really presented in the story.

Edit: I did enjoy the story btw. Not sure if that got through in my ramblings here.
