This is a bit of a general comment about the challenges. I've been participating for a few months now, and I have a pretty clear order of preference for challenge prompts.

Work-focused prompts are the bottom of the totem pole for me. Writing fanfic for a specific work feels a bit like a chore to me, even if I like the work in question. The SCP challenge in particular seemed insurmountable until I started thinking of SCP reports as a genre. (If you think that'll stop me from taking part in the /Worm/ challenge, fat chance! I promised myself not to skip a single challenge until someone else breaks my streak, which means I have to start writing for /Worm/ now.)

Medium-focused ones seem strange as well, though I've never participated in one. In looking through the older prompts, I found an Anime challenge. I don't think there are many common elements between all Animes that translate well to the medium of short stories, so I wonder what the point of that one was. Maybe someone else can enlighten me.

Genre-focused challenges are where it gets spicy. Suddenly, there's a buffet of genre tropes to choose from. The more formulaic a genre is, the less fun is in it for me; it took almost the entire two weeks to find an idea for the slasher challenge.

High Concept (or thematic) challenges are the most fun. I mean, there's an infinity of options with a theme as open as "Eschaton", or "Metafiction", yet they present a clear core to build the rest of the story around. More like these would be amazing! (And yes, if I do manage to get that fifth win, I'll pick one from that last category. Incidentally, is it possible to participate in the challenge I pick a theme for?)

I don't want to force my preferences onto other people. If you like single work challenges, more power to you! I don't have to participate, after all. This is just intended as a bit of feedback, and maybe a start to a discussion.
