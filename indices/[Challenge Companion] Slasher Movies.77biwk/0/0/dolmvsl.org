Thanks for the feedback; I don't often get it and normally have to sort of feel my way around what people want.

I would generally agree with your preference order, but try to mix things up in order to offer variety for people who /don't/ share that preference order. Works challenges in particular are mostly "for" people who really like to read or write in those worlds, and generally get chosen at a semi-regular interval from the pool of "things people on this sub have probably had sufficient exposure to".

My general rule for challenges is that I'll spend fifteen minutes trying to generate as many workable story ideas as possible, and then only select topics where I can produce a suitable spread that attack the topic from different angles. (I don't do this for the ones pulled from the community spreadsheet, nor the works challenges, in part because I worry that I might bias the challenge too much in the direction of the things that I like the most. I wouldn't want us to never have a Naruto challenge just because I don't like or know Naruto.)

You're free to compete for your own prompt; /I/ occasionally compete (under pseudonym), and I'm the one that gives the challenges. For myself, my rules are:

- Don't submit until the challenge has been up for a few days (i.e. don't give myself a first-mover advantage)
- Don't start writing or planning until the challenge has been announced for a week (i.e. don't give myself a headstart at writing)
- Use a pseudonym (obviously)

I obviously don't ask or expect that anyone else follow those rules if they're the one writing the challenge, though obviously issuing a /very specific challenge/ for which you already have a long, polished story ready would be something that I would frown upon.
