Thanks for replying! Always interesting to know these behind-the-scenes details.

  issuing a very specific challenge for which you already have a long, polished story ready

No such thing. I will admit that I'm considering a theme which many of my stories could fit into, but I'll write new ones for the occasion :)

I don't think I've stated it often enough: I love these challenges. They're the perfect way to get feedback without a lot of pressure, and I love how they challenge me to think of specific ideas instead of waiting for creativity to strike. (Also, short stories are my favourite form of literature to work in because they can be extremely polished and perfectly focused on one single theme where longer books cannot escape the occasional pacing mishap or excess of exposition.)
