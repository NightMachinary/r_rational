Super awesome! Great work.

Only confusion was that the explanatory part just before it starts says "no one actually has spontaneous duplication", but the whole premise of this is that Cedric Diggory does, no? Maybe a slight rewording is in order.

I'm also extraordinarily curious about how Cedric got it.
