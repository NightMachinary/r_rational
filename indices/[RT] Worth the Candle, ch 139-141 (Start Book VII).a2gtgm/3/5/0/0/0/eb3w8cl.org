It'll probably be released as part of the Apocrypha after the series is over, but if I put it out /now/, then it both locks me in (if I think that something is dumb and want to change it, or want to write a side story with more fully-hammered out stuff, or whatever) and it also produces a lot of fodder for non-fruitful discussion.

The full list includes skills that Juniper could take, but has chosen not to, for whatever reason, and I find it mildly annoying when people make arguments about decisions without the full context, which a list of skills would necessarily not have.
