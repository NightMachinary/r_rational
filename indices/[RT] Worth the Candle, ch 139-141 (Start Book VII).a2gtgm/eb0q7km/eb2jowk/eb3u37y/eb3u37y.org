Thank you but where does it say that. More specifically when does everyone learn of it so it makes unicorn blood NOT the obvious go-to-solution for any ailment? Fenn has a freezer for the meat - why wouldn't she use it on the blood? Also, from chapter 46: “I was hoping to find a buyer for unicorn meat,” said Fenn. “We spent a fair bit of time butchering that thing. I'll hold back a bottle of blood for us, but we've got a few from when we drained the thing, and they don't go bad fast enough to be worthless.” She looked to Solace. “We killed a unicorn, it was no big deal.”

I sadly just feel left out narratively. If it's obvious zo everyone in the story and here on reddit - what did I overlook?
