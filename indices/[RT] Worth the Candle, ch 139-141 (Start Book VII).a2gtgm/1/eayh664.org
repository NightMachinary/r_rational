I know it's kinda redundant given that there is supposed to be official art Soon™ and it's not all that great looking, but another princess (AC7's if anyone's curious) inspired me to doodle Amaryllis and it'd be a waste to let it languish in the drawer given there's precious little Worth the Candle fanart, so I just hope it doesn't burn your eyes --- [[https://imgur.com/a/6DlemvM]]

Anyway, let's hope we're not getting another disaster so soon in the atheneum, though given Joon's track record in that regard that might be a tad too optimistic.
