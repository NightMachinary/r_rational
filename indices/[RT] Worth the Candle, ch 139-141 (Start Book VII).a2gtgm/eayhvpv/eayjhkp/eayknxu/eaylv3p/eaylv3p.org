All weekend every weekend, and a fair number of school nights too, and /maybe/. Like Tiger Woods played golf, or Tonya Harding skated. But in both of those cases, there was an adult driving them to do it at least as much as they were self-driven.

Gaming is a team sport, too. And better gaming pretty much requires bad gaming as a pre-requisite. Ten-year-olds are munchkins, they burst into tears over failed rolls, etc etc. You have to crawl before you walk, unless you have one hell of a good coach.

Also there's the literacy level to consider, and the sociological sophistication level.

This isn't a critique of the story quality, it's a great story. All I'm saying is, Joon's gaming backlist is like HPMOR-Harry's reading backlist.
