Joon didn't necessarily create every single idea, himself, out of whole cloth, but a lot of it had to have come about from ideas bounced back and forth between him and players during campaign setup and "session zero", and even more of it developing from things that happen in play.

I wasn't much of a GM, but I'm quite sure I did as much gaming as Joon did around the same ages, and I gamed with a GM at the time (one of my high school friends) who was every bit as creative and not much less prolific, quantity-wise.
