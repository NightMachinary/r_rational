Making a proper game out of Worth the Candle would require shitload of procedural generation (it would be a challenge to make it be reasonably realistic outside of handcrafted landmarks) and probably some kind of AI to fill the Dice Guy's shoes (crafting an engaging hex-spanning narrative would be a challenge at this scale).

And I have a distinct feeling if a WtC game ever gets attempted, it would end up in a real-life Friendship is Optimal scenario just with 9000 hells rife with devils and demons, instead of cutesy ponies. Not quite sure which would be preferable to be honest.
