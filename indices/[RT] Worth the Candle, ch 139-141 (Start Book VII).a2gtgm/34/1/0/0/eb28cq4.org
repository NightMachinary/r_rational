You can't go back further than you can teleport, which puts a limit on it for them and even if you could it has to be impossible as otherwise there would not be a general attitude of death being hard to reverse on aerb. Most likely some part of the spirit leaves the body after you die and you can't revise something you don't have all the component parts to.
