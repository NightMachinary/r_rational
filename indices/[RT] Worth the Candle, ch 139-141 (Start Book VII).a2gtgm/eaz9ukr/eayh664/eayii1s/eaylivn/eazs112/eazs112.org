I would hazard a guess it's how the darker marker shades give way to thicker black outlines in shadows. It was only a half-conscious choice, but way they seem "heavy" makes it feel as if it pulls those parts back into the background.

Also, I assume R3 is some kind of hair product? Not sure how that translates into how hair looks with it though.
