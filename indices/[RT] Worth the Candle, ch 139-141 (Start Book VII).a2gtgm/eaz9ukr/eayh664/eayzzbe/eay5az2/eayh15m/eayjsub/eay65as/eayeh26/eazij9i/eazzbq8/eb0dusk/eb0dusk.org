Canonically there are 266 skills, only 40 of which Juniper actually has at any given time. Juniper still gets the benefit of companion skills from Symbiosis, even if they're not one of his 40 selected skills, and his companions aren't limited to just 40 skills (though they also don't benefit from super-learning, just the benefits of Twinned Souls which artificially increase their skills).

(I have the full list of 256 skills + Custom written down, in case anyone was wondering whether they were just numbers. Helps keep track.)
