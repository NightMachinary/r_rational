Since Joon has canonically seen that list of skills (during his first jaunt into Essentialism, if I recall correctly), is there any possibility of us being able to see that full list of skills as well?

If you felt like being extra-super-nice to us, I think we'd all also appreciate knowing what's excluded and the note the game layer provided. ^^ But obviously this is just idle, if rampant, curiosity, so don't feel bad about saying 'no' if you don't want to for whatever reason.
