I hesitate to say that it's impossible, but it strikes me as impossible. Or at least very close to it. Too many entads have specifically mental or emotional effects, and we can't currently read input as naturally as we would have to for many of them (controlling vines, for example). Every entad would have to be specialized for unique input and gameplay.

I mean, short of it being a text based game or something.
