* WtC Wiki Progress Report

  :END:
Since [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9yc1dm/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_135137_holding_krinrael/ea1e93v][my post last time]], there's been a fair bit of progress on *[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Worth_the_Candle_Wiki][the new /Worth the Candle/ wiki]]*.

Summaries are complete for the *first six chapters* of the story: "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Taking_the_Fall][Taking the Fall]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Thickenings][Thickenings]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Solely_Responsible][Solely Responsible]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Reaver][Reaver]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Goraion][Goraion]]" and "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Cold_Comfort][Cold Comfort]]".

The minor characters from "Goraion" ([[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Poulus_Cambria][Poulus Cambria]], [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Becca][Becca]] and [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Sly][Sly]]) have comprehensive write-ups. So too do [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Nate][Nate]] and [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Ricky][Ricky]], the two other kids from ten-year-old Juniper's and Arthur's D&D sessions. A start's been made on [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Arthur_Reimer][Arthur Reimer]]'s page, but it's slow going and we're still trying to formalise a way of doing these write-ups. There's placeholder pages for [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Juniper%20Smith][Juniper Smith]] and [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Amaryllis_Penndraig][Amaryllis Penndraig]], but there's so much to be written up for those that we've been putting off making a start. Pages for the game layer have yet to be completed, with the exception of a fairly comprehensive page for "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Achievement][Achievement]]" and a "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Skills][List of Skills]]".

Other *miscellaneous completed pages* include "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Frongal][Frongal]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Blackthorne][Blackthorne]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Color_Riot][Color Riot]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/The_Collection][The Collection]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Obol][Obol]]" and "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/God][God]]". We've also made good starts on "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Athenaeum][Athenaeum]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Risen_Lands][Risen Lands]]", "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/XC-class_soulcycle][XC-class soulcycle]]" and "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Earth][Earth]]".

To make these pages possible, I've been compiling an assortment of *custom templates*. While the wiki software does include plenty of bits of convenient markup, there were a few things missing for our purposes. I've added a [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Scroll_Box][scroll box]] which has been put to use with the new "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Reflist][Reflist]]" (for preventing long lists of references from bloating a page's length). There are now standardised templates for citing [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Wtc][extracts of the story]], [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Tcoa][extracts of /The Council of Arches/]], [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Reddit][Reddit comments]] and [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Discord][Discord comments]]. The "[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Storylink][storylink]]" template is used to link out to articles on a chapter from character's biographies and such. There's now [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Gt][a template]] for marking text as quoting a game notification. For some reason [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Cite][citation needed]] and [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Sic][sic]] weren't a thing, but now they are. I decided to throw together a template for [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Mentioned]["mentioned only"]] and for [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Main][linking to a main article on a subject from a section on that subject]]. The new [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Messagebox][messagebox]] template has been used to make a [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:Stub][stub]] template, which is presumably (read: unfortunately) going to see a lot of use. [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Template:W][Linking to wikipedia articles]] can now be done just with the article's name. Examples of all of these templates' use can be found on their respective pages.

The pre-Aerb timeline of the story is kind of impenetrable, with Juniper's notes in chapter 105 being the best resource for organising it. We're looking into organising the story's flashbacks in chronological order - for now, we've pulled out all the relevant text and loaded into [[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Flashback/src][one page]] in chapter order, but we've got our work cut out for us untangling the chronology.

In case you're wondering about the... /unusual/ prioritisation on display here (Blackthornes? Nate? /Really?/), things so far have generally just been a case of doing pages as and when the opportunity to do so arises. This isn't about turning as many redlinks blue as possible, it's about making sure what's going up there is *reliable* and *comprehensive.* To do so, we need all the help we can get - *no experience necessary.* Got a favourite character, chapter, or creature? Do a ctrl-f on the story and start pulling out info for a new page. *Just head over to the wtc-wiki channel of the alexanderwales Discord server (linked at the end of the last chapter) to join the discussion!*
