A WtC game wouldn't be that compelling, because WtC is narrative-based way more than system-based. Games are really good at simulating "kick in the door, kill them all, loot the bodies, rez the hostages" murderhobo gameplay, but they're bad at giving you the story-based, "do whatever you want and I'll come up with rules" gameplay feel that Joon is all about.

The closest you'd get to the WtC experience would probably be a Telltale-style game with linear storytelling and different rules, characters and locations each chapter.
