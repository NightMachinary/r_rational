Something I've been thinking for a while: Is anyone else not a huge fan of bold text or other font changes to denote special events?

I can't stop myself. As soon as bold text enters my peripheral vision my eyes reflexively snap to it, and even if I don't read the line in that fraction of a second I can often infer what it denotes.

Game layer notifications should probably be differentiated in some way, maybe italics would be less eye-catching.
