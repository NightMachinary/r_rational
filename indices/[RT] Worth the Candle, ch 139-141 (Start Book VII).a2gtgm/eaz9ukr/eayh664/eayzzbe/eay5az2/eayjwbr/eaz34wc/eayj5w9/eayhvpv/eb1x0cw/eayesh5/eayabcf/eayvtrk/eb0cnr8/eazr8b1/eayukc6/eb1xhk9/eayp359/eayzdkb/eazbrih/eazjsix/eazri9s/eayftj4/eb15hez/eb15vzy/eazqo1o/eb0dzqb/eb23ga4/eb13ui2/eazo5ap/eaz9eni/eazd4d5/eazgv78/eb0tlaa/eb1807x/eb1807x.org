If a soul is like a specific type of component in which it is just a collection of data attached to an entity then spirits are like systems which determine how entities change over time. (and interact with each other).

​

Many things that don't have souls should still be affected by spirits. Although the spirit wouldn't interact with the soul so the strings of spirits would have to be accessed through some other means. (June has only accessed spirits through their affects on his soul)

​

The true name might be an instance of an entity and there might be other components that you can gain access to besides the soul through knowing the true name like a location component which doesn't seem to exist in the soul but can still be modified by teleportation based artifacts (and still mages). My guess is that the true name points to an instance of an entity. My guess is that everything in the world (all artifacts, objects, people, animals, groups, buildings, cities, and possibly civilizations ect. have true names although it's harder to find them for some as there might not always be a convenient reference to it in a component such as it is with the soul component. ( I wonder if there is an artifact that can find true names of anything.)

​

Typically Systems can take an entity and add and remove components to it.

​

Magic systems/spirits in general might listen in for the existence of specific components. An exclusion zone could be created by creating a spirit/system that adds and removes those components as an entities location (component) shows they left and entered a zone. You could remove a spirit from the world and destroy the exclusion zone with all that that implies. Alternatively create a spirit or modify an existing spirit so that it ensures you have the necessary components to use the excluded magic. That way only you can break the exclusion zone in a more controlled manner ie that gives you a distinct advantage.
