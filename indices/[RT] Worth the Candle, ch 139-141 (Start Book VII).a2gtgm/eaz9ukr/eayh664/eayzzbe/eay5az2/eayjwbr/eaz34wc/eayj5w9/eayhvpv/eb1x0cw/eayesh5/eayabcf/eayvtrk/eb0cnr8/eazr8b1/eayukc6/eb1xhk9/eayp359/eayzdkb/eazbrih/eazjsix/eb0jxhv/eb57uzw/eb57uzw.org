This is adorable!

The competition anxiety is real, though. I'm pretty sure my ex and I almost ruined dancing for each other when we were forced to compete together.

I loved the dancing scene as well, 10/10 from me. It's clear that you really understood what was going on, even if you stopped competing for separate reasons. Juniper not only being surprised by how well he can dance, but also managing to consciously pick apart what his body is doing unconsciously is also a clear reminder of how smart he is right now. All in all, great job!
