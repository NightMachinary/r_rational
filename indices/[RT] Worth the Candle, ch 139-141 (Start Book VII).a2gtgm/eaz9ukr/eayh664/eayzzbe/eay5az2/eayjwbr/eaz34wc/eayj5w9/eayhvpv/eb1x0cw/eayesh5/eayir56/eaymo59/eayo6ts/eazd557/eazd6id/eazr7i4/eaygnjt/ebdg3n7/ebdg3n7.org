Chapter 138: "psuedo" -> pseudo, "monocole" -> monocle, "Arrmor" -> Arramor (I think), "weilder" -> wielder (three times), "depedent" -> dependent

no idea if typo, but "Trident of Bubbling Flame: One command, this trident will activate" is kinda awkward, so maybe should be With one command

Chapter 141: miscellania is probably miscellanea, unless it's a reference, "eyeglass" -> eyeglasses?

Chapter 125: "The sheathe" should be The sheath, probably

Chapter 37: "Astely" -> Astley

EDIT Chapter 73: "Fallather" -> Fallatehr

Not sure about these being typos, but joon mentions the Cloak of Leaves (with capitals, so I assume real name) at one point and then it's just simply Leaf Cloak on the list in C138. The bracelet that consumes poisons (given by Gemma to Juniper and immediately worn) is missing from the entads, as well as the incorporeal bodypart ring (not sure if he wears that one, though). Probably something that should be decided by CRJ instead.
