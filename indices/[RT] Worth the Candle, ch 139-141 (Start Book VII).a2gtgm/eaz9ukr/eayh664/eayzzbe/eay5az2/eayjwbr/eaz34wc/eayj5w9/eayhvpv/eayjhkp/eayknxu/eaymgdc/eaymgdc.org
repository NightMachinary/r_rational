It's not about working out exactly which day every event took place on, it's about being able to definitively state "flashback X takes place before flashback Y" for as many given pairs of flashbacks as possible. Tiff's arrival, Arthur's death, and many smaller details besides can be used to split up the forty-odd flashbacks into groups - I just don't want to make incorrect assumptions. It might be possible, using the dates given in chapter 105, to apply something more than a relative ordering, but that's not really a priority.

Besides, Juniper ran sessions /twice weekly/ from 2009 to 2017. I'm sure there's plenty of details that can be used to work out a more accurate figure, but just as a rough ballpark, that's between (52 * 2 * 7 = ) 728 (presuming he started in December 2009 and went to Aerb during January 2017) and (52 * 2 * 9 = ) 936 sessions (from January 2009 to December 2017). Dude's spent thousands of hours doing these campaigns, many of which we know only actually lasted a couple of sessions. Is this level of "prodigal gaming" for a ten-to-seventeen year old unusual? Sure is. Is it a timeline impossibility? Nah, I don't think so.
