  <My crush,> said Amaryllis. <Her name was an anagram. Lena Kardrow.>

  <What's that an anagram for?> I asked after a moment's thought.

  <Karen Dowler,> replied Amaryllis.

Is it still an anagram if it's not a perfect match? I thought it had to be, but in that case we have an extra "a" but are missing an "e" (would be "Karen Dowlar").
