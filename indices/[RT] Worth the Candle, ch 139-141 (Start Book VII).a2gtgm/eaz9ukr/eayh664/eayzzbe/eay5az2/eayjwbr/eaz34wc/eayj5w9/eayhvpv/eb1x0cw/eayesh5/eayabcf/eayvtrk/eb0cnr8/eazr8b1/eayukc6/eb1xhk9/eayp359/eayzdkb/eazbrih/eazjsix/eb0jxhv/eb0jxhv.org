My wife and I did ballroom dancing together for nine months, enough to get me to bronze level. I dropped it after that, mostly because competition doesn't mix well with my social anxiety, and she was always more enthusiastic than I was. She still goes dancing twice a week, with amateur competition now and then (silver level, "with some gold").
