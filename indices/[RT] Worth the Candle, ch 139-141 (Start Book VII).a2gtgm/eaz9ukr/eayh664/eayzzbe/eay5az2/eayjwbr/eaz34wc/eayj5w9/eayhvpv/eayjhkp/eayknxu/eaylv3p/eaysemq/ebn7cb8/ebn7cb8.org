For what it's worth, I had 10 year old Harry's reading backlist (and am now a boring adult and no kind of genius). It just requires *obsession*. And reading is a solo sport, though being able to talk about it with grown-ups helps.

The team sport aspect is a really good point. I know what kind of hours I spent on reading. I didn't know /anyone/ else who did the same at that age.
