At the end of Chapter 140 there's an unusual gap between the bottom of the chapter and the next chapter button. If you highlight it and right click it on chrome or copy and paste it, you can see that it states "Actions". No idea what the meaning of that invisible text is though or if it's just a browser error or something.
