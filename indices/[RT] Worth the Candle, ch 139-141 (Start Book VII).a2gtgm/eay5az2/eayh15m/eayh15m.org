These chapters were great. A week as a 'regular student' sounds like it's gonna be full of deeply hilarious hijinks (assuming he doesn't blow it all up immediately on accident!) and I love the entire idea, so I'm looking forward to it a LOT. I'm super hyped for the next set of chapters - I hope he actually gets to do a 'regular student' set of events for at least a while without it all blowing up.

I hope the Bursar has his dried frog pills ready...

This continues to be a great story and this last set of chapters was a refreshing interlude after some of the more harsh ones. The bit about Fel Seed discussed with the locus makes a TON of sense.
