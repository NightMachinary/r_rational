If you're wondering about ch 138, that's just Stats for Nerds II, compiling information for reference from the rest of the work. I'll be adding more to it in the next day or so - I ran out of time to get everything there that I wanted (a list of entads and a list of spells being the two most important).

Also, thank you to [[https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales][my patrons for their continued support.]] (New goals will probably wait until I've delivered the worldbuilding doc.)

[[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PaLrwVYgxp_SYHtkred7ybpSJPHL88lf4zB0zMKmk1E/edit?usp=sharing][Progress spreadsheet is here,]] which will give ETA to next publish when I have it, and word count on what's been written so far.
