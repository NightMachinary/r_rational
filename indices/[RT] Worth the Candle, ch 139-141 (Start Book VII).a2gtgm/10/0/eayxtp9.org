  *Raven:* Everyone here should be able to read the story without being bothered by what they see in their peripheral vision. Fonts are symbols, and you should be able to dissociate symbols from meaning and prevent them from spurring trains of thought. There are real hazards out in the world, those which would slowly poison your thinking, or instantly scar your mind. You shouldn't be spoiling your enjoyment because of some conspicuous line, you should be continuing to read while resisting the urge to look at it and infer what it means.
