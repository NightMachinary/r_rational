The pre-Aerb timeline may have to stay fuzzy, given that Juniper is supposedly 18 and has more gaming experience than the average 30-year-old no-outside-lifer (and more psychological self-awareness than most folks /ever/ get). Which is fine, he's obviously a partial self-insert and his prodigal gaming makes the story work well, but it would make construction of a timeline difficult.
