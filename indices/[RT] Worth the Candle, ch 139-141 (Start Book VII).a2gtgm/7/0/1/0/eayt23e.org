Gaming is like a harvest, reaped from the seeds of cultural input. It'd be the next thing to impossible to just pump out game sessions over-and-over without material on which to base it. You have to read, watch movies (Joon /also/ has extensive movie knowledge), participate in games run by others, participate in web forums like this one, etc etc. For every campaign, there's several hours of prep - even for very prep-light systems like Dungeon World, you still have /some/ prep, even if it just consists of thinking about (say) a scene you want to run with "some evil king" confronting the PCs and in actual play that turns out to be the local duke one of the players created. Granted Joon could probably spend a lot of his classroom time daydreaming and not suffer much from grade reductions, but still.

I suppose you could just repeatedly run pre-generated campaigns like Pathfinder APs, but that's a problem too - each one of those is going to be at least 200 hours of play. My own group just finished a Pathfinder AP that took 133 3-hour sessions to get through. Even at the cracking pace of high-school all-weekend gaming, that's still most of a year.

And Joon and Arthur's group /weren't/ "kick in the door, kill them all, loot the bodies, rez the hostages" murderhobos. They actually liked to role-play, develop relationships with NPCs, etc etc. That stuff (which is the real fun of gaming anyway) takes even more time.
