That's one of the breaks from reality that I found acceptable. I would consider it at the edge of plausibility, rather than strictly implausible, but understand it's one of those places where YMMV. Per the math as it's been laid out in the story, most campaigns were on the short side, low single digit months rather than years. Per the math as it's been established for play, that's ~8-24 sessions, which, again, is on the short side, depending on how long sessions actually are. Should be one short one mid-week, then a marathon session on Saturday of maybe 12 hours (noon to midnight), which is what we did when I was that age, so an average of maybe 8 hours each. Not all of that is actual play time, since some of it is conversation, argument, eating, breaks, etc., but it's hard to account for that. That would mean ~192 hours of play every three months or so. (In practice, lower during the school year, not during holidays, more during the summer but with fewer players.)

I'd say maybe half of the stuff in WtC is taken from actual high school campaign notes, old posts from our forum, PbP campaigns I ran in high school, etc., with the rest being either made up explicitly for the work, or taken from campaigns I ran as an adult. Partly this is because I didn't jump ship from campaigns as quickly as Juniper is said to have. In some cases, campaigns were "split" for WtC (e.g. they're described as being different campaigns, but in the reality that they were taken from, they were just two extended different arcs within the same world).

As far as inspiration? The campaign list notes a number of them; SCP, /The Atrocity Archives/, /Fine Structure/, Star Wars, Pratchett, etc., and there are more of them scattered through the entire work, none of which I think is /particularly/ unreasonable. It's also noted that Juniper and Arthur watched movies specifically because Arthur thought that cultural literacy was the mark of a good citizen (which, again, is something that I actually did in high school).

(Most of Juniper's emotions, reads on people, knowledge, etc. are taken from autobiography/e-mails/posts that I wrote when I was 13-18, so they're what I would consider /mostly/ realistic depictions of what it was like to be that age for me, if not for others.)

I generally consider Juniper at the edge of what's realistically plausible; he's an exaggerated version of how I was in high school, with many of the same forces shaping him.
