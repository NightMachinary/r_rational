Pallida lays it out in ch 125. The tl;dr version is that Pallida, Raven, and Dahlia (Uther's daughter) were all besties, and then Pallida and Dahlia began to grow up while Raven stayed the same age, which eventually came to a head when Raven walked in on Pallida and Dahlia having sex. Pallida says to Juniper that Raven is going to tell a version of this story that makes Pallida look a lot worse, but Raven hasn't actually said anything yet.
