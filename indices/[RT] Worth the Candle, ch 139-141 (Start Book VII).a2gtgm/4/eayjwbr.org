Lovely peaceful little update, thank you. I enjoy these calms between storms so much. And Joon's talks with the Locus are great. He keeps trying to get her loyalty up and ends up accidentally therapying himself and it feels pretty healthy honestly.

Grak appears to be actually in the process of healing for the first time and it's very heartwarming. Him and Solace being cuddle buddies is straight up cute. Hopefully he'll find stumble upon his own Jorge soon.

Anyway, looking forward to seeing what fresh hell awaits us in Sound and Silence
