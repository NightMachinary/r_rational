June has all the tools needed to create his own memetic weapons and defenses. Hell, with spirit and existentialism combined he could create a contagious "ideology" meme with a backdoor such that it doesn't affect those who know about it. Taking over the world with mass scale mind control. Oh wait I guess June wouldn't do that. He might be able to make a meme that can cause fell seed to self destruct.

Both Valencia and Bethel lack a soul but do they have a spirit? If not what is this thing that Bethel has that is not soul or spirit but has properties attributed to both in fantasy settings? Is there a skill that might give a clue? Is it really memorization or the mind? In which case social skills would be necessary to manipulate it.
