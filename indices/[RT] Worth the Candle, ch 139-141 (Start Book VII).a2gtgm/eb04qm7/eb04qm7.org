Unrelated to the chapters.

After the library arc ended, I have this theory about what the DM actually is. Tho it comes with some flaws too.

The idea is the DM entity that Joon met in his soul trance after he maxed out his Essentialism (Chapter 78: The Sacrifice) is actually an entity just like Cypress (old Amaryllis on the doomed timeline), but instead communicating via book, the entity is communicating via soul link.

Or speaking more formally: the DM is a simulation of a character (probably Joon) on another doomed timeline. Sending message to the past via their soul link.

Or maybe with another wording: Joon following that DM's soul link is actually activating the doomed-timeline-simulation and creating that DM avatar.

The Flaws:

- The DM gift (the Earth Backpack) is hard to explain
- The DM is actively nudging things here and there
- If he's just simulation, why not just tell Joon directly?
- They already met in the past (in the recording of Joon's consent of being transported)

Okay, sorry, just wanna let this theory out from my head. I know it's flawed. And seems unlikely. But after reading the Cypress chapter and start thinking about the "what if" scenario. The scenario where Joon was one that tasked with sending message to his past. The talks between Joon and the DM comes to my mind.
