I doubt that Archive of our Own supports this, but it'd be nice if game status updates could be hidden by spoiler tags like I've seen some authors do on the Spacebattles and Sufficient Velocity forums.

You'd still know that some update was going to happen, but at least you wouldn't see the exact content before you got to it.
