Loved it.

I've been thinking about the Loyalty mechanic, ever since that theory that /Joon's/ loyalty is what's actually measured, a couple threads ago. I think that has too much going against it (a new data point si the bump in Bethel's loyalty, which seems to be completely internal).

However, I do think Loyalty could be a two way street. The increases in the Locus' Loyalty this chapter felt like Joon was actually starting to understand what druidism and the locus are about. Maybe it's about understanding your companion and letting them feel that understanding, forging a connection. Or something.
