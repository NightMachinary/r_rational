Tiny Tunie is adorable. Big Tunie as well, for that matter.

I strongly recommend this story as something that promises to be a fascinating sort-of hard scifi (alt-physics scifi?) story. I especially enjoy how [[/u/nighzmarquls]] manages to create characters that combine being utterly alien, relatable and believable.

If OtP seems somewhat interesting, you might also want to check out their previous similar work [[https://web.archive.org/web/20150421102920/http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?46308-Deep-Rise-An-Illustrated-Xenofiction-Adventure][Deep Rise]]. It is one of my favourite fictions of all time. Sadly, the original version was lost and I did not find it on one of the proper archives.
