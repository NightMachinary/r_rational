I've sort of got a vague idea I want to go back and remaster deeprise. It was done as a kind of text version of nanowrimo. I did daily illustrated updates for almost two and a half years and the quality sort of suffered for it. But the exercise taught me how to produce consistently and is part of the reason why I can manage the pace of writing and illustration at the quality I have now.
