If were rec'ing hardcore history I recommend /[[https://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-31-blitz-suffer-the-children/][Suffer the Children]]/, a standalone episode about the amazing change in the historical attitude towards children, and how by all accounts they were seen as basically vermin by parents until very recently by pretty much all societies. How one of the most universal aspects of the human condition across pretty much all human cultures was not just their neglect and abuse, but also /infanticide/.

There's a part that still haunts me years later where Dan quotes a man walking in (iirc) ancient rome and hearing babies crying inside latrines, having been thrown in with the shit to die. It was such a common part of life at the time that it scarcely bore mentioning...
