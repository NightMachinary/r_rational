  He wanted more power, so he committed mass murder.

That is factually incorrect and shows ignorance. He was Elected Khan of Khans, he wanted to make a trade agreement with the people he first warred with, but they killed his envoys and send their heads back to him, which in his culture was basically the biggest offense you could commit and a declaration of war.

So he did war on them, but he was so successful and brought back so much wealth and resources from a short war with virtually no losses to his people that they demanded more wars.

And so he did as his people asked, but first he always asked for tributes and offered to leave people alone if they gave his horse some hay and accepted to send him tribute once in a while. Only when they refused and attacked him did he fight them.

That's why I said he accidentally conquered the world, that wasn't his goal, he was doing what his people asked as their elected leader and even then he wanted to avoid conflict and killing as much as possible.

Most of the time when he took a city he only killed the rulers and the people responsible for refusing his demands, he left the average person alone or recruited them into his nation.

Again the average person has a completely flawed view on him and his actions. He wasn't going around mindlessly killing people that idea is based on made up stories from the renaissance.

PS / edit. He wasn't 'very far' his troops fought near modern day berlin, plenty of russian, polish and other relatively 'western peoples' were directly affected by his actions.
