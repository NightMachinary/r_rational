I love Hardcore History, the narrative and quality are fantastic and his perspective is new to me. "The Celtic Holocaust" is my favorite, all the quirks of the Roman legions are very interesting and the brutality is mind blowing.

I'm pretty sure George Carlin himself addresses the astronomical amount of genocide Genghis Khan did and how favorable Western history has been to him. Being a "barbarian", world domination, the silk road and Pax Mongolica are what he's known for, not the genocide. I also don't recall him ever being enslaved?
