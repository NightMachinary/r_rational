How is starting a war different from starting a genocide? Genghis khan didn't have some virtuous reason to conquer cities and slaughter people. (You would need an extraordinarily good reason to justify that.) He wanted more power, so he committed mass murder.

"Rape and Pillage."

I'm definitely not saying there aren't gradiations of evil. A defensive war would be less morally fraught than a campaign of conquest. But this seems like a classic near-far thinking scenario- brutal conquest, the slaughter of cities, Genghis Khan- is all very far away from us, so we have these high-minded ideas we use to approach it (system 2 thinking). Whereas racial genocide is closer to us and there are a bunch of 1st-hand stories of things like the holocaust, so it has a much more visceral effect.
