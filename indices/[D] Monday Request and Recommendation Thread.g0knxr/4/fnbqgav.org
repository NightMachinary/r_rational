Recommending Hardcore history, specifically the Mongol Empire series. It's really good, Genghis Khan is this green eyed, red haired, 6ft tall asian man, munchkin all over asia in the 13th century. It's almost like an anime.

​

Most people today think of him as a monster because of outdated history, and made up stories from the renaissance. (Basically writers, at the time, used the mongols and Genghis Khan in place of their own kings and rulers when they were criticizing them, so the idea of them as evil monsters permeates even today in our culture).

​

He wasn't exactly a good guy, but still it's really fun, seeing this ex slave revolutionize warfare, city planning, commerce, creating writing system for his language and kind of accidentally conquering the world.

​

I listened to it years ago, and I still think of it often, it's one of my favorite things ever.

PS. You can listen to it for free if you bother looking for it.
