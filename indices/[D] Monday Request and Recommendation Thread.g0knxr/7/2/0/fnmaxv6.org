It has a ton of issues tbh. at around chapter 150 it changes tone for a while but it gets back to normal after a while. There are pacing issues at some points. Some characters are... Well. Anyway.

didn't stop me from subbing on patreon, so I second this rec! Its just a lot of fun! There is enough of it that, especially consumed in smaller chapter batches, it can last weeks!
