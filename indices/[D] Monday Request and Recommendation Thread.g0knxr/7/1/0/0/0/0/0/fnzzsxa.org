It's essentially a culmination of the genre. All the tropes you're familiar with are executed well. The main character isn't evil and has some memorable relationships. The sidekick characters (introduced pretty far in) are appropriately ridiculous and genuinely amusing, but still matter for the story.

The arc structure is pretty notable. The arcs will typically culminate with something suitably epic, and then the world and the MC will be irrevocably changed. The arcs usually have their own logic and focus, there are arcs on alchemy while undercover in an enemy clan, an arc where the MC is leading a tribe across the continent, a tournament in which the MC forges a bond with a magical crate, travelling back to the past to learn lost techniques, and so on. This keeps it pretty fresh.

Finally, the battles are done well. (if you don't like battles this might not be the one for you.) The MC always has some kind of bag of tricks and will use them and the environment, or the rules around advancement in the world, to his advantage. Early on, that often means a lot of running away. Arcs are balanced, sometimes the MC is the weakest person around and needs to play things smart, sometimes he's playing in the B leagues and is the strongest...he's not always curb stomping or being weak, where he is on that spectrum is based on the context..

Anyway, enjoy, and stick it out for 20-30 chapters as the first couple are a little slow. (Oh, the pacing is a bit slower that other novels in this genre, but they're typically so breakneck that this will still seem pretty peppy.)
