If you can stand translations, I Shall Seal the Heavens fits this. The MC does things like sit at the bottom of the ocean for 100 years, contemplating the nature of death. With few exceptions, he's on his own, and he does a lot of traveling after the first arc or two. Give it about 20-40 chapters to see if you like it, if you're not immediately turned off by translation oddness.
