I've already read it :) I'll just write down stuff I've read that has this trope:

- Paragon of Destruction

- Wake of the Ravager (kind of, shadow boxing is sorta alone)

- Delve (kind of, more so recently than before)

- Ar'Kendrithyst (once again, sort of, although has tapered off recently)

- Defiance of the Fall (has tapered off recently)

- The Rage of Dragons (great execution)

- Cradle (sort of, though has tapered off recently, great execution)

- Reborn: Apocalypse (less training and more preparation, but still counts)

- The Snake Report

- Mother of Learning
