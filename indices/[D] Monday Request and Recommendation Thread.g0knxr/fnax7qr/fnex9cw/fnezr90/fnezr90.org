I want it to mirror the real world, aka be RATIONAL. In the real world noone is successful purely on willpower or discipline. Noone.

Everybody who is successful relies upon: a great deal of luck in their circumstances and timing, along with their own individual intuition, creativity and willpower/discipline.

Having more Intuition, creativity and willpower can compensate for having shittier luck and vise versa, but then I have to see that that the MC really has that willpower or that genius level intellect. Most MC's don't- most MC's have slightly above average intellect, along with a decent amount of willpower/discipline (very very rarely do MC's have an consistent, inhuman amount of willpower).

That is NOWHERE near enough, in a rational world to propel them to the heights that MC's usually achieve. So something has to be given to them, or the world isn't rational.
