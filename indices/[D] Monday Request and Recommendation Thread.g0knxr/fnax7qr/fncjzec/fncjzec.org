There's The Zombie Knight Saga. Here are some abilities that other characters leverage. Mild spoilers:

- There's a mechanic that if you push someone too hard they become desperate and sometimes get a power up. It's only a quantitative powerup though (so like, better control, more amount, etc.), not a qualititative one, but it still can alter the balance of a fight. So battles are a careful balance between not pushing hard enough and pushing too hard. This powerup happens to enemies and friends alike.

- The really strong people have the best control over their power, which lets them use it in different ways. For example, some people can materialize (mostly) pure elements. As they get better they can materialize the element in different states (solid, liquid, gas). As they get better they can materialize it /moving/ (like shooting discs of metal, javelins, etc.). The really high level people can materialize allotropes, put dynamic states on what they materialize, and so on.

- And you bet everyone exploits the hell out of what their power can do. The sodium guy makes on-the-spot explosives. The oxygen guy makes jets of air around his body to fly like iron man. There's a fight where a really strong guy with lasers was stalled by an aluminum materializer, who made mirrors. And it goes on.

The Zombie Knight Saga /does/ sorta fall into the munchkinry trope where the mc figures out things others haven't, but I think it's done in a believable way. What he figures out has more to do with things he has intrinsically that others don't, as well as a synergy that people didn't figure out because the starting components of it were genuinely useless. And whaddya know, once he figures it out other people ask him to learn it, and they figure it out too.
