Can someone recommend something where characters other than the MC munchkinry shit? I find it really really annoying when the MC has the same power as everyone else, but thinks of obvious loopholes that somehow noone else has thought of. It just makes no sense.

A more general idea would be where everybody including the MC abuse the shit out of magic -which in fact makes the MC super weak when they start off and elite tier (NOT GOD TIER) as the series progresses. At no point should they become vastly stronger than everyone else unless they have something that no one else has (and there should be a rational reason for why noone else has it).

This is sorta progression fantasy, but almost everything I've read in this genre falls into the trap of only the MC abusing shit and everyone else has the brain of a 5 year old.

A great example of what I am looking for would be cradle where in the latest book, the MC competes on the world stage and realizes how thouraghly outclassed he is. Everything he has done, someone else has tried before and concluded it is suboptimal which is why noone else is doing it. The things that he has going for him are things that he lucked into, or was given.
