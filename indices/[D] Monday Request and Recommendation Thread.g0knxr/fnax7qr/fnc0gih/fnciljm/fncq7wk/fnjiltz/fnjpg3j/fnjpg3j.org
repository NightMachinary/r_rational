Nadia's only "weak" because she's a mage who's lost access to her magic. With Calvin's current Chained Spirit setup, she doesn't have the ability to use any Bent or Bent-based abilities so she's restricted to pure physical power - the thing she's not spec'd for.

And she was /still/ wiping the floor with Calvin most of the time, at least up until he got out of the funnel. There's a reason why Calvin's refused to get any perks for Chained Spirit that might maybe give her access to some Bent; she'd make him her bitch almost immediately.
