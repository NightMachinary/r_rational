I'm guessing that a lot of the abilities he recently got are restricted, but you are right that shadowboxing is the only one that has been specifically called out as restricted.

That said, my point was that Elliot does provide Calvin with abilities that no one else can get, which was the bar set for understanding why he is so strong compared to others.

It's worth remembering that shadowbox is crazy powerful. Calvin is very clearly decades more advanced in his magic abilities due to his ability to practice his bent abilities unlimitedly.
