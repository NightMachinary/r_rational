Ima be entirely honest, Wake of the Ravager is exactly what I was talking about when I say that other characters don't munchkin. The only real advantage that Calvin has is: Mutations + Eliot.

If Eliot can change which abilities he gets offered then ignore everything I say, but it is my understanding that Eliot only effects Mutations. So then, why is it that every character whose not Karen gets curb stomped by Calvin? Like most legends he faces are so weak despite him only recently having achieved the same number of breaks as them. They're are far far too weak, like they gave no thought to how to balance their stats.

Not to mention the hyprocrisy of kala slaughtering 50k innocent soliders and then chastening Calvin for beating up a bully. I still don't get how none of them are affected by the morality ofkilling 50k soliders. Like none of them are psychopaths and they dont view ulsians as subhumans, so how can they without any regards to morality kill 50k people just to trigger a break?
