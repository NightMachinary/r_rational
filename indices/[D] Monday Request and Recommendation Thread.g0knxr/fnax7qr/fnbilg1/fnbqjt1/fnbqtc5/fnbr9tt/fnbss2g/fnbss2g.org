So a story that comprehensively addresses dark topics is "twisted and disgusting?" I get it if you prefer more upbeat stories but its not like WTC is some cheap circlejerk where the author tried to cram in as much grimderp as possible. Its a universe creating by someone going through depression after a close friend died, it's not gonna be a fun place to be.
