Glad to see you've enjoyed it!

Another manga that I would recomend after reading Kaguya is [[https://guya.moe/read/manga/We-Want-To-Talk-About-Kaguya/][We want to talk about Kaguya]].

It's a spinoff focused on the mass media club (don't think they've been introduced yet in 108) that, while not /quite/ as clever as the original, is still pretty funny. Much shorter as well; the chapters are only a couple pages long, so not much of a commitment.

Additionally, the site I linked it probably the best place to read Kaguya. Best quality and translations.
