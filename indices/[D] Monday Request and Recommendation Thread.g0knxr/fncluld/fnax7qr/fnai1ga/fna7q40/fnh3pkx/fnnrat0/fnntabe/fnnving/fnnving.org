Right.

​

Person A want to win: 54

Person B wants to win: 53

Person A wins.

It isn't that someone didn't try/want hard enough - if there's only one winner (at most), then someone has to lose. (If there's a lottery with only one winner, and one person buys 99 tickets, and another person buys 100, and one of them wins, which is it?)
