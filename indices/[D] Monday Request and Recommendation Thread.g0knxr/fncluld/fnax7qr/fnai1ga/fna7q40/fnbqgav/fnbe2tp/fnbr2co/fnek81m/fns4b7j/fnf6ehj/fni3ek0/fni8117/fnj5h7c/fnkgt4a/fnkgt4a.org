Its a worse problem for Naruto inserts than most worlds, because Narutos world has one of the most pathological political setups in all of fiction.

There are worlds that are even more hellish, but mostly that is because of external factors - rampaging monsters, alien invaders, demon threat, ect.

Naruto is a hellworld entirely because its social and political structure is insanely dysfunctional. Ninjas have monopoly on magic, and by extension, a monopoly on effective force, but they do not govern, they are not united, they hold betrayal, deception and murder as active virtues, and they do very, very little with the literal goddamn keys to the universe other than murder each other and any civilian who happens to inconvenience them.

Anyone iskaied in from a functional world ought by rights to have really, really extreme aversion to.. everything.
