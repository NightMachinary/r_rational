You might enjoy [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/16946/azarinth-healer][Azarinth Healer]], a litrpg where the main character spends a pretty good chunk of the story off by themself. A bit more fighting than training, per se, though in practice the two go hand in hand in this setting.

It's not particularly rational in any respect, but it's fun and not exactly irrational either.
