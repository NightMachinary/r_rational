A separate comment, for a separate discussion: I just went and read the first few chapters of Great Lakes & Expectations on your recommendation, and I'm pretty torn. (I'm already following Sanitize, which is great.)

On the one hand it's interesting and well-written, and I'm enjoying the story.

On the other hand, it's not translating the Japanese, which is the single most irritating quirk I've ever come across. I'm having to copy and paste entire lines into google translate. I /hate/ it.

There is a reason literally every other author writing about a foreign language ever has either written the foreign language as English with some indication it's foreign like <this>, literally just noted they're speaking a foreign language and continued to write in English, summarised what's being said, or written a throwaway line or two at most in the language and then dropped it.

How long does this go on for? If it's more than a few more chapters, I'm strongly disrecommending it for sheer obnoxiousness, unless you can read Japanese.
