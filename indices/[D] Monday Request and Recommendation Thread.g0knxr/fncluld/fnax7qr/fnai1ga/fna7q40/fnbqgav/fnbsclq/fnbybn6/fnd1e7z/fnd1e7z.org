I think the contemporary ideas about how bad bigotry is might be clouding your moral consideration. The problem with genocide isn't that you're targeting one group, it's that you're killing a lot of people. Genghis killed a lot of people for personal gain, which is evil. It doesn't matter that it wasn't a genocide (or maybe it matters very slightly), the overwhelming part of the moral consideration here is people's lives, not whether someone was a bigot or not.

It's strange, like how people are comfortable joking about murder but rape jokes are taboo. I don't get it.
