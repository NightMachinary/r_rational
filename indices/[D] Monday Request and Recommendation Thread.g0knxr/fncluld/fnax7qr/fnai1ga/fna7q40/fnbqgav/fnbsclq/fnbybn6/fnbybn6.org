I've also read newer books on him, and more recent historical discoveries have been made since that episode. It's highly implied, in our main historical source of his life, that when he was 'arrested' for the murder of his brother he was made into a 'slave' for an indeterminate amount of time, until he escaped.

Things like razing a city that wouldn't surrender, so other cities would be more likely to surrender in the future generally decreases the total number of casualties in the long run. it's kind of rational, if quite cold.

Same with killing all the leadership and their families, while also installing his own leaders and marrying them to the daughters and widows of previous leaders. It solidifies his control and staunches potential future rebellions led by distant relatives of past rulers.

I wouldn't call what he did genocide, that implies targeted removal of specific people. And that's not what he did. He's responsible for a very large number of deaths, but his goal wasn't eradicating any specific groups of people. He wasn't a racist, or a religious bigot, but actually quite tolerant and open minded.

Historians generally see him favorably, the average person and our cultures interpretation of him are quite different and more focused on the negative imho.
