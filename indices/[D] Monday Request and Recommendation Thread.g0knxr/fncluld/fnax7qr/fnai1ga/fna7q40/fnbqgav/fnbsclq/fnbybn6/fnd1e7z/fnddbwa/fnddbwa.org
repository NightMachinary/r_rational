  I think the contemporary ideas about how bad bigotry is might be clouding your moral consideration. The problem with genocide isn't that you're targeting one group, it's that you're killing a lot of people.

You're probably right, but it still leads to discussions on whether you believe there are levels and degrees of evil of it should be used as a blanket term and that every evil person should be seen as the same.

Personally I see responsibility for deaths in warfare as a more redeemable evil than targeted systematic killing of civilians. Whether that's rational or not is debatable and potentially an interesting discussion.
