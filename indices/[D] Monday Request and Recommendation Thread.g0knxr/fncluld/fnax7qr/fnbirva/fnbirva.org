That's more commonly seen in different stories with different power scales, where if there's magic the MC doesn't and mages are just as fragile as normal people. What you'll generally find is that the villain did the munchkinry or is trying to do it.

​

Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson has this, the evil immortal god emperor, became immortal and super powerful by doing munchkinry. I could go into specifics but that's basically the best part of the first book..

​

And the best thing is, his munchkinry checks out, it fits the magic system, we have a scene of him doing it to maintain his immortality, and it's nothing boring like sacrificing people or anything cliche like that, just a loophole in the magic system he found and exploits.

​

Raven's Mark series has this too, but the magic system is much softer and the MC isn't a mage, the books tend to be about him either helping his mage gods trick the enemy gods to fall into a munchkinry trap, or stopping evil people from doing munchkinry to become gods.. It's pretty good, not mistborn level, but still better than most and very well reviewed.
