Read chapter the end of chapter 86. It's 50k (this is repeated somewhere else too but im lazy).

1) They not enemy combatants. They're not invading Gadveran. They're trying to save a castle from being sacked in their own territory. Moreover, Uleis didn't even support the war against Gadveran(Only 6 out of 12 of the leaders individually did). The country as a whole was neutral.

2) They would gadly kill him because he fucking gassed 50k people for no reason at all except to trigger a break. They weren't killing Calvin. They were protecting their country. Like what do you not get here. The action was evil.

lastly, this action is fine if it's in calvins character to do it(its not) or if its out of his character and he regrets doing it/feels sad for the people involved (he doesn't). It's like hes a cardboard. No serious feelings.
