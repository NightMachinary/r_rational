To be fair nadia seems to be more specked for illusion, leadership and manipulation. I'm fairly sure it wasn't 50k people, it was like 10k iirc.

​

One legion not their entire army, it makes no sense to send 50k soldiers to retake a castle with 1k troops, specially when the rulers wanted to keep the entire thing a secret.

​

My only problem with it was that calvin needed to get some more push back on that, at least for lamp shading purposes. But they were enemy combatants, so killing them is relatively acceptable in most people's mind.

​

The number is irrelevant, they are enemies and would gladly kill him given the chance, which they ended up doing by throwing him in the hole technically. It's not optimal or something a good guy would do but calvin was never a good guy.
