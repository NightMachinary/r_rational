Yeah it really annoys me when someone is repeatedly super lucky. Personally I don't mind them getting super lucky /once/ (usually near the beginning). Then its part of the premise -- this a story about someone special (but not special in that they have seem to have plot armor and maxed luck stat). What they make of their windfall is interesting, and needs to be logical in the world.
