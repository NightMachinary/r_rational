I usually feel the same way, but I think Amonwilde has undersold the quality of the translation. I've only read the first couple chapters, but so far this reads more like English-native Xianxia than the translated stuff I've seen elsewhere. It's probably worth a shot if your only reason for ignoring it is poor translation intolerance
