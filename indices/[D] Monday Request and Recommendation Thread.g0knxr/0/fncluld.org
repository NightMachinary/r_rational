I think it was recommended here before (not sure), but I'd like to re-recommend '[[https://mangadex.org/title/21562/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/chapters/][Kusuriya no Hitorigoto]]'. Young pharmacist gets kidnapped and starts working in Inner Palace. She uses her intelligence and herb knowledge to cure people and solve mysteries. Amazing art. Great story. It's one of the few manga that makes me want to read the original LN.
