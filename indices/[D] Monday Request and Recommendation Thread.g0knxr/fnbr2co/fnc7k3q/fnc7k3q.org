Black Clover is not amazing in general, but it has a good tournament arc. The main character has no tools other than an antimagic ability, but he does have allies with other powers and enemies with a wide variety of powers and tactics. So if you like tournament arcs, you might enjoy the series. The rest of the series isn't bad as such, but it's kind of fast food anime. I watched everything available in a week, then by the time the next episode aired a week later my interest in the show had faded.
