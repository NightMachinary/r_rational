Here's a rec that you might not get elsewhere, but then again it's a bit dated. The classic anime Yu Yu Hakusho has a couple of tournament arcs, they total probably about 40% to half of the series. In theory it's a bout a kid who is a spirit detective, but he spends about five minutes detecting spirits and just throws down for for the rest. I enjoyed the early episodes, but they are, in content and tone, not really like the remainder of the show. if you enjoy the first tournament arc you will likely enjoy the rest of the series, some memorable characters. Many fights won through some clever trick or strategy, but not rational.

Also, in general people don't like anime dubs, and for good reason, but the dub for Yu Yu Hakuso is notably good. So is the original, but it's a legit choice.
