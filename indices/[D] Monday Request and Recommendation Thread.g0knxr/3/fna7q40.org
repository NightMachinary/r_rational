I've generally found comic books to be the least rational medium. Lots of "I'm losing but will just really try hard now and say something cool and now I've won". The latest X-Men mini series though, House of X and Powers of X, is probably the most rational mainstream story I've read (or at least has the most things I first saw in rational fiction. I wont give spoilers, but there is at the very least some hard-core munchkining of powers). Art looks great as well, and there's not a tonne of background needed to get it (I hadn't read an X-Men comic in about a decade). You can get a free trial week on Marvel Unlimited, the digital platform. Can reccomend checking it out.
