Recently I've branched out into reading Naruto fanfiction, and I've found some great SI/isekai stories to enjoy.

I like when the isekai plotline /doesn't/ follow the stereotypical power-building arc wherein a baseline American civilian gets plopped down into ninja society and rapidly embarks on their transformation into the specialest snowflake with requisite powerlevel and angst quota. My suspension of disbelief especially falters when the civilian SI immediately develops a blase attitude about personally partaking in a society that churns out child soldiers and routinely commits war crimes for a living. It's a problem of balancing the desire for realism vs. canon-similar levels of action that many fanfic authors unfortunately struggle with.

Thus, my favorites tend to be stories about 'badass normal' SIs who /don't/ jump into the ninja powercreep arms race but instead use their intellect and civilian skills to make a positive mark on the world they are thrust into.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20721824/][Sanitize]] is an excellent example that has been recommended on this sub before. It focuses on a doctor SI who, through her efforts to propagate modern medical practices, unintentionally plants the seeds of peace during the Warring States Period.

I also want to recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12083631/][Great Lakes & Expectations]]. It follows an SI who was working on her Masters in International Relations before being isekaid into the world of Naruto. She gradually finds her feet in a seemingly violent society while dragged around at the whims of people who vastly outpower her. Eventually she reaches a position of security and begins to put her considerable political skill set to use, striving toward positive change despite shinobi society's inherent bias against civilians.
