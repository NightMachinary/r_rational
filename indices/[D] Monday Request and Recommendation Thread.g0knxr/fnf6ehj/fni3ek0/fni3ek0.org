The culture clash often gets skipped over entirely which is a shame, but it's not /completely/ unreasonable for an SI to get pretty gung-ho about the whole thing - assuming they don't wake up as an 11-year old about to enter/leave the academy, they have over a decade to grow up and be indoctrinated into their new society. Somewhat less so than "native" kids sure, but that's a really long time, especially when you're pretending to be a native yourself. On top of that, you've got a pretty tempting power fantasy and the knowledge that the only way you'll be allowed to get your hands on battle wizard magic is to conform.

The fact that most SIs just buy in and go along with it is actually probably pretty realistic, though you'd expect a few internal thoughts or self-deceptions.
