You're right that it can be realistic depending on how it's portrayed. If someone is a teenager or younger in the real world before getting isekaid, then I could see them being more open to gradual indoctrination in the value judgements of their new world. I've also seen a few fics where the SI was part of the criminal underworld or a career soldier beforehand, thus partially explaining why they are not viscerally opposed to causing suffering the way a typical person would be.

I find it less plausible when the isekaid person was an educated adult who lived 20+ years of their life in a peaceful democratic society. At that point, if the character just goes with the flow rather than trying to uphold their previous values, then the author needs to convincingly address how the character manages to justify that moral dissonance to themselves. If the character is mainly motivated by their desire to live a power fantasy, then how do they justify all the suffering compounded by acting on that selfish desire?

One example of a plausible justification might be [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18474445/chapters/43772794][In Sound Judgement]]. In that fic the SI recognizes that she has no hope of rebelling against the system while weak, so she decides to conform until she is strong enough to enact a 'fifth column' style insurrection.

Like any trope, the character's reasoning can be done well or done badly. When done well, it makes for a highly engaging story. I just get annoyed when the the justifications are so slim/nonsensical that they feel like transparently thin excuses for the author to skip to the power fantasy part of the plot.
