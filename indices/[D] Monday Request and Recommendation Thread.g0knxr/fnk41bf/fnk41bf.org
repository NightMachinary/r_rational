I am looking for fanfiction where the main protagonist is seeking redemption. It can be either through reincarnation, time loop, or a crossover. A [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-king-is-dead-arthas-menethil-warcraft-in-asoiaf.840089/][Warcraft/ASOIAF crossover]] is really taking off on spacebattles right now. Redemption is the main emphasis and any suggestions will be appreciated rational adjacent or not.
