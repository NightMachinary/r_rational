She didn't care about calvin bullying a bully, but about him indulging in his mild psychopathy (i.e. visibly enjoying hurting someone), which is admittedly not only a bad trait for a wizard king to have, but to be seen to have.

Also, there is an explanation about why even legends don't have optimized stats: no one except for royals can count on having multiple breaks, so they optimize for the present. An example is that a royal can casually decide to invest almost all their warp points in their first 4 breaks to body or mind, which increases the amount of warp they'll have next time, and so on, cumulatively. So 4 break royal can have 30-40 mind or body, which gives them 30-40 warp on their 5th break. On the other hand a commoner will have to have specialized for survival and treated each break as if it were their last. So at their 5th break they will have half the warp that a noble will, which gimps them and their power tremendously.

Besides that, I agree with you that powers in that story are not being exploited by opponents properly.
