I'm not saying it wasn't evil. Enemy combatant doesn't entail they are in the wrong, just that they are /his/ enemies and that they are combatants instead of civilians.

It's totally in his character to do so, he's always been a psychopath. It's stated quite often, just after he captures Nadia or whatever the illitian princess name is, there's a very big focus on how he makes her horny /because/ he's a sadistic psycho. She even asks his archer friend about his childhood and he tells her about how he manipulated people, tortured other kids and animals, and how he's been getting better thanks to Kala.

But he's still a psychopath, it's in his genes, he doesn't care. It's an inherent trait of his, he can learn to be better and conditioned to act in a more social manner via incentives other than ethics, which is also clearly stated and demonstrated frequently as to how he doesn't feel bad about hurting people, but actually by Kala or somebody he cares about being angry at him if he does.

It's a genuine trait he possesses, it seems to me that you've seen him be kind a few times and assumed he was a good guy. He isn't, he's an evil wizard king taking over the world by force. That's the entire story.

PS. It's also implied that he only did that because Elliot manipulated him, there's a conversation between Elliot and Nadia, where she asks him if he doesn't know this entire 'make trouble in Ulessis arc' is bad and going to make Calvin hated. Elliot replies that's his goal, that he wants Calvin to experience being despised and hated as a part of his growth / education.
