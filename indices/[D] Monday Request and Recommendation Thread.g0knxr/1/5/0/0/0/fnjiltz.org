But when you look at Nadia, as a royal she was soo weak. And I highly doubt Karen is like those royals who plan ahead for future breaks, but yet she is so powerful. And noone so far, has had any power that made us think-wow how did he get that except for karen. Everyone else has a straightforward power, no creativity or uniqueness involved (unless they on are on Calvins team). For example look how useless every archer is except for Calvins childhood archer friend. He doesn't have any secret abilities, nor even alot of breaks until like 20 chapters ago. But he was curb stomping every enemy archer he came acrross because they have no brains and only people on calvins team do.

Furthermore, you look at dupdomacy, where Calvin is the first guy to think of cloning very dangerous materials-come on man. How is that possible when other characters are munchkining as they should be in a rational world.

  She didn't care about calvin bullying a bully, but about him indulging in his mild psychopathy (i.e. visibly enjoying hurting someone), which is admittedly not only a bad trait for a wizard king to have, but to be seen to have.

This kinda ignores my whole point of how slaughtering 50k people is ignored by... well everyone. Nobody thinks about the moral repurcussions, noone even cares. Which makes NO sense.

Remember this is the calvin that decided to not destroy that Gadvoran silk cloth's maker's livelyhood by only selling his silk after leaving godvoran. Even ussein, whose own people are slaughtered didn't even fucking blink. wtf. Like dude. That one action was so out of character for everyone involved it makes no sense and completely destroyed my suspension of disbelief.
