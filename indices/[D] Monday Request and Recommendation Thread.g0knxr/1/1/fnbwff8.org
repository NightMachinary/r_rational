The Two Year Emperor is a munchkin fantasy story based on D&D 3.5's rules that starts out with only the main character acting as a munchkin but later reveals other, competing munchkins.

However, while it starts out pretty strong, I found the overarching plot to be repetitive in an unsatisfying way.
