I like to think of books in three categorie, by the number of 'gimmes' the main character gets.

1 gimme: Hard rational. Something incites the work, but other than that pure logic has to carry the main character through. For example, an ordinary (if rather clever) dude finds a halting oracle.\\
2 gimmes: Rational. You get to pick a convenient main character, and then they get a single gimme. A mathematician gets isekai'd into a land where magic is based on mathematics.\\
2+1 gimmes: Soft rational. Convenient main character, inciting event, plus one lucky coincidence. A rational work where a smart character also gets an OP ability, or an otherwise-rational work where about once an arc you can expect something to go in the main character's favor by sheer chance. HPMOR\\
4+ gimmes: ordinary fiction.
