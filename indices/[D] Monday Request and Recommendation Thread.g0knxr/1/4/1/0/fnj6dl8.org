Yes, my yardstick for realism is that a character getting lucky /once/ is reasonable - there's a reason this character succeeded where someone else failed, and across enough people /someone's/ got to get lucky. I don't always care about this rule because sometimes you just want to enjoy a popcorn power fantasy or some such, though.

One pseudo-exception to this rule for me is usually xianxia - yes they're blatant power fantasies, but they're also usually written in cosmologies that include a ridiculously large population. As such, across such a population not just one person but quite a lot of people are going to get "unreasonably" lucky - we're following the guy who didn't just get unreasonably lucky, but more unreasonably lucky than everyone else. It's pretty much the same reasoning as before, applied to larger numbers.

Of course, that's just the reason why it's arguably justified. The reason it doesn't /bother/ me is, again, because I'm reading a popcorn power fantasy.
