This is not really a recommendation but it looks like something I've previously recommended: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bs0f7l/birds_of_a_feather_chapter_37_rtwipff_rational/][Birds of a Feather]]

has been sadly abandoned, couldn't find any info on it the author left comments on the current chapter but nothing after 29th november. they were very active in responding to comments so it doesn't seem like them to abandon it like that so hopefully they're ok

If anyone knows anything else then be sure to comment

Still I think it's worth reading it's an amazing story, up there for me with Worth the Candle in terms of interpersonal quality,
