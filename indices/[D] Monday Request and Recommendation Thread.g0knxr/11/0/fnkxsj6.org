It's not fanfiction, but redemption/second chances is a big theme in [[https://www.parahumans.net/about/][Ward]]. Basically every character in the main cast has either done something they're trying to atone for, or are struggling with having had something done to them that they need to learn to live with, and frequently both.

It's not rational, not like Worm was a de- and reconstruction of the Superhero genre, but a lot of stuff that seems unrealistic at first is justified later on.
