More like the opposite of Rational, but I want to recommend Tiger King, which recently came out on Netflix and is immensely popular.

Almost everyone involved is a grade A asshole, and I for one went back and forth for a bit on who was the worst among them. However, it makes for some good chitchatting with others who have watched it. Did X kill Y? Is A sanctimonious? Is B a bigger dick than C?

Edit: My first controversial comment on [[/r/rational]]. Exciting.
