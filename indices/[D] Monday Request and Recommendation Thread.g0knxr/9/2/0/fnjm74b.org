I agree that the Japanese not being translated in the early chapters was /intensely/ irritating. I kept a tab open to translate, but most of the time the translator I used didn't make much more sense beyond what was already clear from context in the fic.

Fortunately the lack of translation only lasts until the main character becomes more fluent in the language. In chapter 9 the Japanese parts switch to romaji rather than katakana/hirigana/kanji, and by chapter 10 the SI is fluent enough that all speech is presented as English (with appropriate Japanese honorifics).

I get the impression that it was an intentional stylistic choice to convey just how bewildered the SI felt during the period when she can barely understand everyone she encounters. To me the overall quality of the fic is great enough that I'd recommend pushing through the untranslated parts - especially because everything important in those first 9 chapter is conveyed by context and the bits that the SI manages to puzzle out in her thoughts.
