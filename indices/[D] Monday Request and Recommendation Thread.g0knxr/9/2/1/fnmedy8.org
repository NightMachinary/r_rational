Yeah I'm going to second that it's super annoying to have to translate the Japanese, particularly when the main character does actually understand at least a little bit of it, and /especially/ when the only parts in Japanese are the parts she *actually understands*.

Geez, it's almost intentionally annoying.

Edit: that being said the story is pretty worthwhile so far, I just wish the author would translate the Japanese into English
