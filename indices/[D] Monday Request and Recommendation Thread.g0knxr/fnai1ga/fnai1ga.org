I recommended it last year, but let me do it again cause of the new season:

/Kaguya-sama: Love is War/ is a stellar manga and anime that you should definitely watch. While it's not quite rational, it's quite fun and entertaining. The second season just started and looks quite promising, and the manga has over 180 chapters so far.
