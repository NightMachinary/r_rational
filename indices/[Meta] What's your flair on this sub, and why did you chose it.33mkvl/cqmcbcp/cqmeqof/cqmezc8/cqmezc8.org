The picture at the top is taken from a 17th or 18th century German fresco. I don't know much more than that about it - I e-mailed a society for fresco preservation to try to get more information twice, but they never got back to me.

I'll check the site's settings - it shouldn't be doing that. Edit: Should be fixed. Probably shouldn't be screwing around with CSS on a live site, but whatever.
