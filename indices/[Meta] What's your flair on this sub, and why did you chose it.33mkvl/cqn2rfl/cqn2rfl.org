Sun Tzu said that, and I say he knows a little more about fighting than you do pal.

Because he invented it!

And then he perfected it so that no living man could best him in the ring of honor.

And then he used his fight money to buy two of every animal on Earth, and then he herded them into a boat, and then he beat the crap out of each and every single one!

And from that day forward any time a bunch of animals are together in one place, its called a zoo!

Unless its a farm!
