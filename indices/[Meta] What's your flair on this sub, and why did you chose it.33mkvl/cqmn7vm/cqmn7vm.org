"Project Freeelancer" is an organization in "Red Vs Blue" that pushes the boundaries of science, human knowledge, and the law. They find a way to indefinitely copy AIs, invent temporal distortion technology, build robots that pass the Turing Test against trained soldiers, and they even have the ability to bring back the dead to an extent.

Basically, they're Aperature Science if they had to work with severe budget limitations and strict military oversight, and still made badass tech that rivals anything. And we actually get to see how it all fell apart too. The Director is also one of the most tragic characters I can immediately think of.

IDK why it's my flair, out of all the refferences I could make. It might be my Rooster Teeth community pride shining through. Maybe I'll switch it out for "Cadmus Initiative" at some point, for DCAU cred. But for now I'll keep it like it is.
