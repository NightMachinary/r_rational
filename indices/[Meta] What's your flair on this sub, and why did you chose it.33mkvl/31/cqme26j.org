This thread inspired me to make flair. I've written many posts on [[/r/rational]], but the group I'm most proud of is the setup and follow-through for [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2tw821/roleplayingmk_i_tried_my_hardest_to_win_in_an_ai/co2ylpe?context=3][this joke]] with the unwitting help of [[/u/alexanderwales]] -- so I have chosen an appropriate flair to go with it.
