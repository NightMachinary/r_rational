  Because I'm a Computer Science Major with an AI track and this subreddit loved to talk about AIs a lot more around the time I came on.

I thought you said you were a Cognitive Science major :-P.

  Well that and showing my support for bronies; too many people seem unfairly prejudiced against the FiM fandom.

I think people just need some notional spot in the Geek Hierarchy labelled with the rough concept of "total fag", or "person whom it is acceptable to beat up and steal their lunch money". Right now, that's people who watch ponies.

  So I decided to joke about working on making CelestAI a real AI.
#+end_quote

I'm often unsure how much of a joke this actually is. Not with you, specifically, but I was trying to bridge the massive inferential gap of my Marxist politics with a friend a week or two ago on Facebook, and I asked him how he supposed the world was /supposed/ to be organized, and his answer was, "I ask CelestAI to organize it for me" -- /and he doesn't even watch MLP/. And I've at least occasionally seen [[/r/rational]], [[/r/hpmor]], and LW posters reference uploading themselves to pony-land as an appealing escapist fantasy (at least, /qua/ escapist fantasies).

The Facebook message thread was insufficient to contain my sputtering of, "But but but that whole story is so /reductive/ of human potential and it gets so many things /wrong/ and why can't someone /do the original work/ of thinking up something /better/ and you can't ask fictional unfriendly superintelligences to make your decisions on social issues /for/ you! And even to the extent she /was/ partially Friendly, if you /punt/ to your /imaginary construct of her/, you'll never understand the Friendliness thing well enough to actually /build/ a program that does anything like that! How do you expect to /get/ Pretty Pony Paradise if you don't understand what underlies it!?"

So instead I just said, "Listen $FRIEND'S_NAME, if you keep punting your decisions to imaginary superintelligences, I'm not building you one." Hmmm... that would make a great flair.
