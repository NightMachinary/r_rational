Because I'm a Computer Science Major with an AI track and this subreddit /loved/ to talk about AIs a lot more around the time I came on. So I decided to joke about working on making CelestAI a real AI. Well that and showing my support for bronies; too many people seem unfairly prejudiced against the FiM fandom.

I've actually thought about changing it, but I can't think of anything better. Anyone got any ideas?
