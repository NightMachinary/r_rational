- =Time Braid fanboy=: /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ has been my favorite book /of all time/ since 2011, when I discovered /Naruto/ fanfiction and scrolled through all 200k-word stories after getting tired of devouring NaruHina romances. (This was back when you could filter by /any/ wordcount, rather than just the wordcounts provided in the search function, which max out at 100k.) I was /absolutely ecstatic/ when I saw Mr. Yudkowsky recommend it in an /HPMoR/ author's note. I've read it literally /six times over/--runners-up for most-read book (four times each, IIRC) are /HPMoR/, /The Three Musketeers/, and /Robinson Crusoe/. I have it bookmarked so that I can recommend it instantly whenever an opportunity presents itself.
