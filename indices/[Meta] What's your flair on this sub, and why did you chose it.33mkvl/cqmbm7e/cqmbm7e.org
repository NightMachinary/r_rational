Mine is a specification in set-builder notation (in Latex) that should read, "[eaturbrainz] equals the set of strings too Martin-Loef random for you (the Turing machine =\mathcal{M}=) to compress them." It's kinda-sorta a pun on Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem.

This is partly named for the way I confuse the hell out of people when I first meet them by not fitting into any preconceptions. It's also because I think Chaitin-incompleteness and its associated field of study offer an avenue forward on certain LW-y things we don't talk about because everyone knows they can't be done (but which the official papers on doing them anyway label "Vingean reflection").

And deep down, isn't exponentially-growing optimization power thanks to recursive growth [[http://gurrenlagann.wikia.com/wiki/Spiral_Power][what being a Spiral is all about]], and exactly why Spiral Power is dangerous? (Or in other words: I am a TTGL fanboy.)
