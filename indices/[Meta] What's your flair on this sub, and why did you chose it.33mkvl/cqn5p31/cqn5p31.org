My flair is =Cloudbank Citizen= because the world depicted in the game Transistor is pretty appealing to me.

Transistor is one of the more notable Solar Punk stories I have come across. Solar Punk as in: Art Deco, high fashion, high art, green energy, augmented reality, intellectualism, naturalism, etc. The polar opposite of Cyberpunk.

In Cloudbank, everything is up for vote. The weather, the architecture, the city planning, the colour of the sky... If anything it is a world which is strictly better than the one we live in currently: everyone is healthy and educated. (There is no insinuations that there is a scarcity of resources or a lower class at all in the game.)
