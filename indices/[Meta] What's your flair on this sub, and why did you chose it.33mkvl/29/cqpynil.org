"And with strange aeons, even death may die."

Lovecraft's universe is extremely irrational, filled with supernatural beings that cannot even in principle be understood. The original line is referring to Cthulhu's watery rest, and is very bad news for humanity. But taking the line out of context, the line sounds optimistic, and all the more so by its contrast to the original meaning.

Any attempt at rational munchkinry by characters in a Lovecraftian universe would be doomed to unimaginably horrific failure. It's not even possible to imagine a well written fiction where something other than that occurs, that doesn't abandon its fidelity to the original works. However, when I imagine the pure and desperate hope it would take for some aspiring hero to even try to fight against such nightmares, I feel awestruck and an echo of that hope blooms inside myself.

This matches my feelings about transhumanism and rationality, another reason the quote is appropriate. I think the technological pace of advancement is overestimated, but more importantly the nontechnological aspects of creating a desirable futurist society are going ignored and almost impossible to overcome anyways. [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][Moloch]] isn't Nyarlathotep, thank heavens, but he's still stronger than we can imagine. And while rationality is a good target to aim for in the abstract, it's actually more like a curse for real life human beings, or at least it feels that way in my experience.

I'm very pessimistic, but try to clutch at hope and enjoy it anyways.
