Mine is Zul'Tek (flairs don't allow apostrophes). It's my name for myself if I ever find myself in an appropriate setting. For example, it's the name of my Skyrim character. And I would also use it as my character name in other appropriate settings, although if my username = my character name, I'd use Kishoto.
