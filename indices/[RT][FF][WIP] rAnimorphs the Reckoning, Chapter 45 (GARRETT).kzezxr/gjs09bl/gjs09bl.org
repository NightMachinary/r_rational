  I was running late because ██████████████
#+end_quote

TK17Studios, giving us the Animorphs-SCP crossover we didn't know we wanted.

Garett censoring thoughts as part of his mental breakdown feels very much in character.

#+begin_quote
  I want to pretend like I was listening, like in that moment I was trying to do the thing, like I was actually doing what TOBIAS had been trying to teach me, but in fact I was just hanging on. I was just repeating them like a lullaby, like a magic spell, and when one memory ran out my brain handed me another.
#+end_quote

As someone who sometimes go through a bunch of catchphrases during stressful times, I can totally empathize with Garett here.

Like, the worst thing is that even when you notice it you're in a state of mind where your brain keeps feeding you catchphrases even when you'd really like it to just STOP and BE QUIET.

#+begin_quote
  but they were still mostly managing to press forward and then I saw ANTE press a silvery cylinder up against JAKE'S head
#+end_quote

Oh. Right.

They're on a pool ship with a bunch of yeerks, who are totally fine with nabbing people and infesting them. I kind of forgot this sort of thing was possible.

#+begin_quote
  ANTE, who was DEAD.
#+end_quote

Welp. Rachel warned you.

Being a redshirt in an Animorphs story is a high turnover position.

#+begin_quote
  “You know, I really wish you'd stop indulging in these petty fantasies, Marco. Like the one where kicking my host actually hurts me, or the one where every little thing that goes wrong in your universe is automatically my fault---”
#+end_quote

Wait. We later realize that the Marco that brought V3 onboard was a V3 plant himself. Did V3 kick himself just for the fun of telling Marco that line? That is /twisted/.

#+begin_quote
  “They won't self-destruct, infant! The whole point was to stop you from sending them into a war zone---they want to live.”
#+end_quote

I feel like Esplin might be letting some frustration seep into that remark.

#+begin_quote
  “---is there any way to vent the pools from here? Remotely? Ditch Sarcaun, make room for Terra?”
#+end_quote

Wow.

Flushing the yeerks was something canon!Jake only did at the very end of the canon story, that was considered an unforgiveable war crime and a proof of how ruthless the war had made him, and here r!Jake is just considering doing it for convenience, and nobody even comments on it.

This fic gets /dark/.

#+begin_quote
  it was JAKE, JAKE had morphed into TOBIAS, had morphed into TOBIAS to---to---to get my attention, he'd done it as just, like, a move, and it had worked, because I was a CHUMP and a RETARD and a SPAZMASTER 3000 and I had maybe never been so angry ever before in my entire life
#+end_quote

Well ouch.

#+begin_quote
  “Yeah, and does that cut both ways? What's stopping you from doing whatever the fuck you want after we hand it over?” [...] “Says you. How do you know that you're even the real Visser Three, and not some clone he spun up specifically for the purpose of making promises that he himself wouldn't be bound by?”
#+end_quote

Wow, Jake is /on point/ in this negotiation. Basically anyone else would have let V3 bully them into accepting any terms he wanted.

I feel like that dig must have cut a lot deeper than V3 let it on, by the way. He /knows/ this is the kind of thing he'd do, and he's created more elaborate deceptions before.

#+begin_quote
  And not only that, but I could see through things---through the clothes that JAKE and MARCO were wearing, through the outer layers of skin and fur on HELIUM and the HORK-BAJIR. I could see the dim outlines of organs as if they were lit up by spotlights---HEARTS and LUNGS and STOMACHS and KIDNEYS---could track the ebb and flow of air, the surge of blood through veins and arteries, even an almost-invisible flicker that I thought might be the firing of nerves.
#+end_quote

Ooh, I forgot about the Howler's murder-vision.

Canon Howlers were incredibly cool, especially for a one-off species that only shows up in one book plus two paragraphs of backstory in another.

#+begin_quote
  VISSER THREE held up a finger. “One moment,” he said. “Terra is a unique hive-mind in the Brazilian Amazon, containing humans and animals alike, centralized around a cooperative Yeerk pool located at the confluence of the Rio Branco and the Itaquai River.”
#+end_quote

You were too tired to do proper opsec, and you figured Visser 3 wouldn't notice. That was a mistake. Visser 3 /always/ notices sloppy opsec.

#+begin_quote
  “Because I, too, am bored. I am bored, and I am tired, and I have been exceptionally cooperative, and it's time for you children to make up your minds. I can destroy the Howlers---all of the Howlers---before they reach you or your precious little Terra. You hand over two of the pool ships, and I will withdraw from this system and never come back. Whatever empire I manage to create, it will treat your people kindly, according to your own definition of kindness. But I want the cube. Now. I should mention that I have my own Howler morph body sitting inside a holochamber at this very instant, and it would be extremely easy to, say, identify this ship in particular as the one that would be most fun to destroy, or draw an arrow toward the Amazon that doesn't require them to notice and decode a bunch of human speech. I will give you five minutes to make your decision. I know you're not exactly quick-witted, but that should be plenty, even for you, because this is not a hard call.”
#+end_quote

I like how /done/ V3 is with the whole "taking these plucky human children seriously" thing.

Like, he's captured both Marco and Jake, morphed them, infested them, analyzed them. They're not that special. Now he just wants to rush to the end of the storyline and build his space empire without having to negotiate with annoying unkillable kids.

#+begin_quote
  “Magellan, you and him get the fuck out of here, right now.”
#+end_quote

Aaaand the controlled!Marco is still in the room.

You know, I'm thinking the constant testing and "how do I really know you're you? you can't but you should probably assume I am anyway" back-and-forth is starting to bite them in the ass.

Early-story Marco and Jake would have definitely checked v3!Marco for influence.

By now I figure there's so many possible vectors of attack they've stopped trying to defend against them at all, which is starting to seriously cost them.

#+begin_quote
  “He's gonna want to confirm this with a Leeran. Which means we're going to have to get close enough that he can do pretty much whatever he wants.”

  “So, what---we give it to him, he puts it in some kind of Faraday cage, and then he kills us?”

  “Ten percent chance,” MARCO said.
#+end_quote

It's interesting here that V3!Marco steelmans the position of not dealing with V3. I wonder what poor Marco thinks of this conversation.

I get the impression that V3 does that because he knows that's what actual!Marco would say, and he respects Jake enough to expect he'd /notice/ the difference. I wonder how much of that is Marco's bias voluntarily leaking through, kind of like Alloran did.

#+begin_quote
  “Stop! You can't!”
#+end_quote

See? Unkillable.

#+begin_quote
  The air between JAKE and VISSER THREE had opened up, and two people had fallen out of it, and one of them was a little boy with soot-covered clothes and a tear-streaked face, and the other one was CASSIE.
#+end_quote

Wow. I had a lot of advance warning for that one and I'm still /super/ confused.

#+begin_quote
  And RACHEL--- ---who had been sitting motionless in the corner in zombie mode the whole time--- ---RACHEL had surged forward, surged to her feet, and slammed her hand down on MARCO'S wrist, knocking the DRACON BEAM out of his hand and sending both of them tumbling to the deck in a tangled heap.
#+end_quote

Proving once and for all that Rachel is MVP.
