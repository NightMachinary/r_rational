Well, there goes my hypothesis that the boy was David, and that Crayak had allowed the Ellimist to return Cassie because he had also been allowed to place one of his own pieces back on the board. Completely forgot about the kid Cassie brought into her morph.

There comes a moment in every non-drawn chess game that one of the players realizes the game is lost, often long before the game is truly over.

I have a strong suspicion that the very end of this chapter was that point for one of the Players. I think we just witnessed the turning point of the game.

Alternatively, perhaps this was the merely the point at which the /length/ of the game is determined. I suspect that the Ellimist's goal throughout this story has been to unite Terra with the Andalites, and that Crayak's goal has been to unite Visser 3 with the iscafil device. If Jake doesn't make the deal, they probably ultimately escape with an extremely crippled terra/fleet, but since Visser 3 is deprived of the cube, the midgame is stretched out. On the other hand, if he makes the deal with Visser 3, the animorphs have an intact Terra and a fleet to get them to the Andalites, but the Visser gets his cube, leading to an early endgame.
