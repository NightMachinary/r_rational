I love hyper-detailed nitpicking and reactions. <3 <3 <3

I was trying to convey that Garrett knows that Eric's /limit/ is 6, but doesn't know whether Eric has the same inner experience/phenomenology/reaction to getting overloaded at that point. Maybe Eric's version of "overloaded" is different from Garrett's, and he actually e.g. just drops half the balls, or something.

  I don't see why he'd save the boy

The smallest possible intervention is to just freeze the pocket dimension and preserve it and pass everything right back out. Cassie took the boy into her morph, therefore the boy was in there with her.

No comment on the rest other than <3 =)
