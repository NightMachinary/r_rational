One of the things that makes canon Animorphs so compelling...

... is that things like the portrayal of the Howlers here are 100% canon. There are some more details about what the Visser figured out about their biology and stuff, but it otherwise could almost have been a rated-R recut of the original. Canon gave us /maybe/ two very brief views into their murder-toddler rampages while the Reckoning has let us see it first hand in all its carnage, but it's otherwise entirely a difference of detail and not kind.
