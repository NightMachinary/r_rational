  I don't know exactly how the Howlers worked in canon, but I really like the glimpse into their species and their psychology we get here.

The psychology here is pretty close to the canon version.

The biggest difference is that, in canon, the Howlers were more of a designer species, built specifically by Crayak to destroy all life (we later learn that the Pemalites were similarly designed by the Ellimist to seed life everywhere, as part of their contest).

Part of that design is that Crayak deliberately eliminates any Howler experiencing defeat or emotions he doesn't like, so that they don't pollute the memory pool, which is how the Animorphs defeat them in canon.
