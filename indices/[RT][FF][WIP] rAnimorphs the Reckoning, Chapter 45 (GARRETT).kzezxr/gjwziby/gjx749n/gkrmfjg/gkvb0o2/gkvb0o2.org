So, my issue is that if Yeerks can be separately thoughtscreamed to, why is Garrett's default not to scream to every Yeerk in the vicinity (excluding morphed friends maybe, so he still needs those eg Jake-shaped holes)? That way he wouldn't have chanced Ante's death. By now the Animorphs must have tested this, right? And that would be an amazing weapon, even if it kills morphers' control Yeerks, since the nanotech or whatever for targeting is still there so they can still demorph. They would have an AOE disable-all-Yeerks spell, which is kind of OP.

So anyway I think in-story the answer has to be “no”, at this point. Even though I think “yes” makes more sense, personally.
