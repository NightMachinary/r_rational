AHHH Cassie!!!! Man if this is the real Cassie (and it seems like it is) then man, what a fake out because after this long without her being resurrected I was sure she was going to stay dead. Can't wait for her chapter up next. I was wondering how the plot has suffered from her absence as one of the chosen 4 but it makes sense that she was saved somehow.

I recently reread the entire story and I'm so thankful I did because there is a lot to unpack and understand. It's been interesting connecting the canon plot to this fic as I've never fully read the entire series. Thankfully I do remember the Howler side plot and your depiction of them is just as wonderful as they were in canon.
