Oh, one other random thought, also involving Tobias, is that I feel like each of the four---maybe even six, counting Rachel and Garrett---OG Animorphs have some kind of a /believably superhuman/ ability. In a sense that neither me nor, likely, anyone else in the thread is going to meet such a person IRL, but the suspension of disbelief is not yet broken.

Jake has the little black box, Marco can intuit when shit's about to go down, Cassie knows her animals really well and has a deeper kinship with the morphing system than anyone else... But I don't really get what is Tobias's thing. I tried to think about it, but honestly, Tobias comes off---at least to me---as Marco v. 0.5. (This is going to be one of the things I address in my meta-thoughts post after the story is finished, tbh.)

Either way, thanks for writing this cool story again!
