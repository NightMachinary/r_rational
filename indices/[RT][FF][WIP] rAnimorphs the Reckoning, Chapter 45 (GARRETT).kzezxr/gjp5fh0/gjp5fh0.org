  ANTE'S eyes were open, and glassy. One of them had turned red, as if half of the blood vessels in it had burst. His face was wrenched, twisted, frozen, his body weirdly contorted. It looked like one of his shoulders had dislocated as he fell, as he spasmed, as all of the signals in his brain went haywire and all of his muscles contracted at once.

Ouch, but don't beat yourself too much about it, Garrett, he's just dead, ordinary hazard in the Animorph line of work, nothing you yourself haven't gone though. Just acquire him and all he loses is a couple weeks' worth of memories, and seeing as they're memories of betraying his friends he probably won't mind all too much. That said, I'd imagine the supply of suicidal/terminally ill people has gone down quite a bit given recent events; resurrecting him seems to be a lower priority than, say, making another Marclone.

No idea what's gonna happen next chapter, but I can't wait to have the time travel/alternate universe/simulation thingies all explained to me.
