Yup. If nothing else, you'd expect a non-captured Marco to have easier access to a handgun than to dracon beam. Getting a handgun just requires robbing a gun shop (by morphing either the owner or a rhinoceros). Getting a dracon beam requires meeting controllers, and the only ones left on Earth outside of Brazil work for V3.
