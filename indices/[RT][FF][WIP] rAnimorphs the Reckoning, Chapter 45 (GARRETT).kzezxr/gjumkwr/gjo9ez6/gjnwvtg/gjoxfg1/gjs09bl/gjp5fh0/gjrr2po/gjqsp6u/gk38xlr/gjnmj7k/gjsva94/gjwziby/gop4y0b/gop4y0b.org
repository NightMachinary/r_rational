This chapter in particular helped me kind of understand what I've been doing in my life and that is loving the story I have been telling myself. This and the next chapter really has been driving home for me that I need to work on not taking reality for granted. Thanks heaps for that and also for keeping me entertained with this story over the past couple of months.
