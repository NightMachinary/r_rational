  “I humbly submit to you that there are a lot of good things you can only get if you're the kind of person who can actually keep a promise.”

Yeah, well, there are also a lot of good things you can only get if you're able to break promises. Like, in a one-shot prisoner's dilemma, you don't want to cooperate unconditionally, you want to... I think it's "cooperate iff the other player will cooperate iff you cooperate". Here I think he wants to keep his promise iff he gets good things iff he keeps his promise. This isn't necessarily single-shot, but it might be? E.g. if no one will be around to tell that he broke his promise.

(And it's not like we haven't seen him lying before, which isn't the same as breaking promises but is in the same ballpark.)

I absolutely believe Visser 3 is capable of making unbreakable vows, but (like the Animorphs) I'm not convinced this is him doing so.

(Or, like. HPMOR-style unbreakable vows might not be a thing he's willing to do, they might be too close to changing identity. But something like that.)

I'm, I guess a little suspicious of how everything seems to be revolving around the cube. V3 seems to be willing to sacrifice a lot for it - if he'd really leave Earth alone (which, again, /doubt/, but if) that's billions of hosts. There are other cubes, and he has a body on the andalite homeworld, so it doesn't seem that unlikely he'd be able to get one. But if he doesn't care that much about it, why hasn't he killed the animorphs? I could believe he cares about it enough to let them live, but not enough to let earth go, but... I dunno, feels like I'm missing something.
