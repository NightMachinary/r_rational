I disagree, as a reader.

My guess is "/yes/." (Is it hubris to disagree with the author himself on mechanical debates? Lol.) There's definitely a separate metaphysical entity to influence, since Yeerks have thoughts and feelings and a "self" completely separate from the host. Like, it's more debatable in Andalite-Controllers or collaborators or whatever, where they do their little fusion dance thing and the boundary breaks down. But in humans, where that doesn't happen, there's always a clear line separating the two - there's always a unique mind that's /purely/ Yeerk, and sits on a level above the human one, separate from it, with secrets and walled-off thoughts.

I'd submit that thought-speak works finely enough to distinguish one mind from another, even if the physical bodies are glued together. The level of arbitrary control the Animorphs are able to exert over who they target seems to indicate as much, anyway. Heck, in theory, couldn't they just target the physical location containing the Yeerk neurons that process all its Yeerk-specific thoughts?

Anyway.
