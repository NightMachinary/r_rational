hey everyone, this isn't related to the current release but I was hoping to get some help from you all. I stopped reading this story a while ago and due to how the chapters are structured I'm having a hard time finding where I left off. last main story beat I remember wasn't long after an assault on a yerk base. I vaguely remember one of the kids turning into a whale at one point as well.

Sorry if thats not very specific but I was hoping someone could point out general chapter window around then so I can pick up the story again.

Thanks!
