I originally opened this thread from utter boredom eleven days ago, and it piqued my interest to the point I've binge-read the entire story---literally caught up just now and immediately went back to this thread. (To be fair, it was not /just/ the thread; this story had been recommended to me many, many times before, and the discussion there was a /tipping point/ of sorts.)

So. Wow. What a ride. I'll probably put some thoughts on meta-aspects I liked and disliked after the story is finished---since this event is bound to happen very soon (unfortunately!).

One thing I *need* to say is that I sincerely hope to see the original plans for this story---I know some significant changes to the future plot were done in the middle of writing, and I wonder what we would've gotten if everything stayed as planned originally. Omake? A post on this subreddit? Anything, pls.

One thing I adored in the last two chapters is the sheer petty bullshit Visser Three was up to. My favorite kind of character is "intelligent and driven but utterly psychopathic," and so, naturally, I absolutely love Esplin (in the earlier chapters) and V3 (now). Before we mostly got him as the Big Bad, and almost every single line, every single scene was extremely plot-relevant and significant and had, uh, a scale? In a sense that whatever he did, it was capital-B Bad, and now it's only lowercase-b bad, and it feels really fresh, you know? I mean, there's a difference between "blowing up half a billion people" and "kicking yourself and then snarking about that to keep up the charade for a little longer," and the second one is /much less expected/---and thus more interesting. ...Oh wow, I'm rambling.

Aaaanyway, I really enjoy this story. I'm not good at writing theories right now because it's 5 am (no points for guessing why I'm up at 5 am), but I'm really looking forward to the next update, whether it's an interlude or a full-fledged chapter. While Cassie's is obviously going to be interesting, I've been looking forward to Tobias's chapter for the last, like... eleven parts (since it was eleven parts ago when we last saw him).

Keep up the good work!
