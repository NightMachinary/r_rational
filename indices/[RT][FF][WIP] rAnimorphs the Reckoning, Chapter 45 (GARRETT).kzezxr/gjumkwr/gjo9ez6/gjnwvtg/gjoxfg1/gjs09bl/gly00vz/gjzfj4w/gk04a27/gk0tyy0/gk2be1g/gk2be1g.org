Well I'd say "immediately tries to shoot Cassie" counts as strong evidence too =P

But if we want to make a list:

- Marco immediately tries to shoot Cassie, like he was expecting her to appear. Even if a real Marco had a reason to shoot Cassie, he'd be at least shocked to see her appear.
- Last chapter V3 alluded to controlling a large number of Marcos. We had a scene where we saw him control one while talking to US marines, and also alluding to a conversation either him or another Marco had with Tyagi and deadmanswitch!Marco, suggesting the Marco escorting Tyagi was himself hijacked (and probably Tyagi herself).
- Marco has a Dracon beam.
- Marco is the one who brought the V3 mouthpiece on board, which suggests contact with V3. Having contacted V3 isn't proof of being hijacked by V3, but it's strong evidence given that by this point V3 is kidnapping people left and right.

But, I mean... this is Animorphs. The default assumption when you see someone know suddenly try to shoot one of their lifelong friend with no warning is "They got infested by a yeerk".
