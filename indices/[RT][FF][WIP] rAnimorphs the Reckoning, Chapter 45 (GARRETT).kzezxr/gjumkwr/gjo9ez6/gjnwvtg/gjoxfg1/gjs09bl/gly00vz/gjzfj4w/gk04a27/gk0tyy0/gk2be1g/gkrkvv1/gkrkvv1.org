I kinda disagree - I personally think it's reasonable to assume that Marco's attitude by now is "Here's a sudden total unknown, thus it's /probably/ dangerous, thus I should /probably/ just shoot it now and not ask questions." Kind of like when Rachel instantly shot "Jake" without even consciously thinking about it because Garrett told her it was Visser Three.

I mean, your theory is also perfectly plausible! There's a good chance that's exactly what happened. But personally, I'm not making it my default assumption just yet.
