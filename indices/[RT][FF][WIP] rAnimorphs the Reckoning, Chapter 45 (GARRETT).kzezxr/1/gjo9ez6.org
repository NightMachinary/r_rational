Rachels morph vision:

#+begin_quote
  The walls seemed to shimmer, to flex---changing colors, changing shape, one moment flat unpolished metal, the next smooth beige plastic. There were lights, shifting and flickering---beeps and clicks, radio voices---a viewscreen like the one on the starship Enterprise, showing---

  Showing---

  ???

  “---no time,” said Jake, or maybe Marco, the bodies switching places, disappearing and reappearing. “At this rate---they've already---hundred Venturas---”

  “---can't beat them head on,” said Tobias, from the screen---no, from right beside me. “---wasn't for those mines, we'd already---”

  It was different this time, I thought. And then I realized that I was thinking---that I was thinking, the now-Rachel, the Rachel who was demorphing, who was right now in the middle of a seizure-vision, I'd never come awake during one before---

  Marco spoke again, and it was like the voice of some nightmarish monster, ten different sentences all emerging at once, blended and overlapping and incomprehensible. Jake answered back, and then Ax---except no, wait, Ax wasn't here, Ax was down on Earth, and besides, he wasn't called Ax anymore---

  Flashes of light, blindingly bright---

  The whole ship shook, throwing us to the floor---

  No, wait, nothing had happened---okay, now it was happening---

  ‹Yes, or no,› thundered the voice of the Visser, from where he stood, surrounded by Marines all pointing their guns at him---no, he was on the viewscreen---both?

  It isn't usually like this, I thought. Why---what---why is it all---

  “Yes,” said Jake.

  “Yes,” said Marco.

  “Yes,” said Tobias, and then vanished.

  “No, wait, stop, you can't!”

  The voice was Cassie's---

  Cassie's?

  She was there, where she hadn't been, her eyes wide, her face stricken. “You can't,” she repeated, as Jake shouted her name, as another explosion rocked the ship, as beside me Marco raised his gun and fired---

Vs. what actually happened:

#+begin_quote
  You stop the Howlers first. You stop them now. Then we figure out the rest, in detail, with a Leeran. We do it slowly, no time pressure.”

  VISSER THREE shrugged, stepped forward, held out a hand. “Shake on it?”

  JAKE'S arm began to rise---

  “Stop! You can't!”

  It wasn't until after everything had already gone still and quiet that my brain was able to go back and sort it all out and figure out what had happened, and what had happened was this:

  The air between JAKE and VISSER THREE had opened up, and two people had fallen out of it, and one of them was a little boy with soot-covered clothes and a tear-streaked face, and the other one was CASSIE.

  JAKE and VISSER THREE had both jumped backward, and HELIUM'S tail blade had snapped into a ready position.

  CASSIE had shouted “Stop! You can't!” as MARCO---

  ---the tired, dirty MARCO, the one who had brought VISSER THREE on board---

  ---MARCO had pulled a handheld DRACON BEAM out of his pocket and pointed it straight at CASSIE and his finger had been on the trigger and it had been squeezing, I hadn't processed it in the moment but when I looked back he had definitely been trying to fire.

  And RACHEL---

  ---who had been sitting motionless in the corner in zombie mode the whole time---

  ---RACHEL had surged forward, surged to her feet, and slammed her hand down on MARCO'S wrist, knocking the DRACON BEAM out of his hand and sending both of them tumbling to the deck in a tangled heap.

The events are different enough to assume that they aren't the same, especially given that the timing otherwise makes no sense. This strengthens my suspicious that what Rachel saw was an Ellimist/Crayak simulation.

As for how Cassie returned, I couldn't guess the specifics, but if anyone could figure out how to morph after the "gate" had been closed, it would be her. Especially if she had some help from one of our godly friends. Why she chose this moment however I have no idea. What I do know is that these events were definitely manipulated for this specific outcome. And since Rachel "wasn't supposed to be there" maybe this means that Marco was supposed to successfully shoot Cassie? IDK. Looking forward to having all the answers.
