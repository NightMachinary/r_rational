Some delayed thoughts (had to take a few days to think about the chapter):

Current-V3 has some definite value drift from original V3; wasn't it several chapters ago (shortly before David's death) where he swore never to morph again because that put him in the realm of the gods?

Speaking of morphing, I think I figured out how V3 is spawning V3-flesh in humans: he's using the part of the morphing tech which spawns Yeerk flesh as the control mechanism in the morph, but instead of the morph the target is now humans. To me this is again a serious deviation from his predecessor who strongly disliked the idea of being an E/C pawn.

It seems like the surviving V3 has 180-ed from 'Fuck you E/C I will not be your pawn' to 'I'm all about emulating the gods'. Example: there's a lot of similarities between the V3 hive mind and the Howlers, so much that he's noticing what can screw with their hive-memory and is making sure not to let that become a weakness in his, his new body's durability and structures takes inspiration from Howler biology, etc.

A few threads back I mentioned it would be an interesting end for V3 to be reabsorbed back into Cirran. Not really possible now (and how would his hive-mind setup work in a coalescion? How would V1/4's?), but I wonder if perhaps gets reabsorbed into a different sort of coalescion - the Howler coalescion. This would actually call back very nicely to canon, where the Ellimist mentions that Crayak would see humans absorbed by the Yeerks, and then the Yeerks eventually absorbed by a superior/dominant species. I think that might be in the book where they encounter the Howlers, actually.

The difference here is that pawns are able to be moved by both players in the E/C game, like the blue avatar from a few chapters ago. This means the Howlers are pawns of /both E/C/, not just C alone like in canon. V3 being absorbed into the Howler coalescion...well, who knows which god that would please?

EDIT: Ah shit. This isn't going to end in 'ram the Blade Ship' and everyone dies, is it? Because I could see it going that way...the losing player cleans the board.
