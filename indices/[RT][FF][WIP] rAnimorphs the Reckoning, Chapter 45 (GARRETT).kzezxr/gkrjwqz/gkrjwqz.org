Finally got around to reading. Yay, a Garrett chapter! Poor Garrett :(

Like, poor Garrett because of the Ante thing and the Tobias thing, but mostly because he's just having a really, really, really bad day. When he activated his Super, that was genuinely pretty shocking.

Y'know, there are devices that can transmit thought-speak, obviously. I can't imagine it would be /that/ hard to, like, tune one of those to transmit at lethal volumes and form a portable orb of murder. Maybe fly it around on a little drone slow enough to mess up your target, or just, like, everyone. And what are the rules for long-range thought-speak again? The recipient has to be plugged into a long-range thought-speak receiver, right? If those things just, like, write down your "words" and transmit a copy of them to the receiver, then you might get bottlenecked by the throughput of the device. But if they transmit your thought-speak directly, with no data limit or whatever, you could pretty much kill anyone with a receiver at any time. (Except maybe an Andalite. Garrett thought-screamed into Ax's eib when it was /Ax's/ turn to fray, and it only soothed him.)

At the beginning of the chapter, when Garrett is watching Rachel through the cameras, the timeline is very slightly different than it was in Chapter 43. The obvious thing is that the Howler thumbsed-up instead of waving, but then there's also some minor Rachel curling up/laying down/standing up stuff that's more nitpicky. Is that a TKSU (like the KASUs from canon - anyone else remember the Anibase?) or is it some sort of clue? As the author himself said in the author's notes for Chapter 7, "/Sometimes a continuity error is a continuity error, and sometimes it's plot./"

Getting Megamorphs #4 vibes from the end of this one. Like, in terminal endgame stages, amid action and gore and Dracon fire, everything coming to a head, formerly-dead Cassie materializes out of nowhere on the bridge of an Animorph-controlled Yeerk ship, and the air tastes like Ellimist. Again, I can't tell if it's a happy accident or an intentional callback - or if, like, it was coincidentally where the story was going anyway, and [[/u/TK17Studios]] kinda leaned into it, too.

So, Cassie's alive. Or "alive," or something. This is one of those rare moments that I actually very slightly regret following along in the comments as chapters got posted; there have been hints about this development for - oh god - years, now? Not to mention the cryptic release schedule from the Author's Notes of 44, and the Author's Note at the beginning of /this/ chapter. I can't even imagine the /WHAM/ of this moment if it hadn't been for the low-key spoilers that have been leaking out about it, lulz.

Can't wait for more!
