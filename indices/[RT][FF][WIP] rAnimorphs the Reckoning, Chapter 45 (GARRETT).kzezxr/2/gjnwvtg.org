I really like Garret chapters because he has such an unusual perspective that it sort of forces you to reconsider the things you take for granted. The counterpoint to that, however, is that Garrett's perspective makes events that would already be confusing or difficult to process even harder to make sense of. That's not necessarily a bad thing, I think in this case it really worked to convey the helpless confusion and despair that everyone (not just Garrett) was feeling, but it's still something to take note of.

I don't know exactly how the Howlers worked in canon, but I really like the glimpse into their species and their psychology we get here. A whole species of glorified toddlers is absolutely terrifying, but very believable in the context of their hivemind. As a species they don't have a theory of mind. They don't think of other living beings having their own individual lives and identities because they don't think of /themselves/ as having their own lives or identities. They sacrifice and maim themselves with the same willingness and glee that they murder and torture others, and I suspect the only reason we don't see more violence between Howlers is because they've already exhausted all the possibilities there.

As for that ending... I don't even fucking know. I can't even try to make sense of it or speculate about what's happening, because it's so far out of left field that I just can't even begin to figure out how we got here. I'm definitely looking forward to the next chapter, because what the fuck is going on?
