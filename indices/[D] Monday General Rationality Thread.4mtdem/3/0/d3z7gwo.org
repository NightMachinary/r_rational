Sounds like a good victory for self-control and getting what you truly want. Learning to control your temper is an important skill for anyone, and you should be pleased with your accomplishment. I'd be hesitant to shy away from emotion in general, though.

I've always thought of rationality as steering and emotions and choosing the destination port, so to speak. In this sense, I always am under the influence of my emotions in the most profound, deep ways that influence my goals. I love my girlfriend, I gain great joy from my job, I feel exhilaration and excitement from playing video games and watching sports, and I get a feeling of accomplishment from doing a good job at work so on. These are all emotional responses, and I am quite pleased that I am under their influence.
