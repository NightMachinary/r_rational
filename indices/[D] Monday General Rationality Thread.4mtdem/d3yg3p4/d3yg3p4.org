I was checking the book *Brain Rules* trying to find some method to improve my performance and discipline. Overall can't recommend it, the rules so far have been:

- Exercise daily.
- Eat your vegetables!
- Don't multitask.

I don't think there's much of value to get so far and I'm past half the book. I've realized I read a lot on Reddit and at school but only a small percentage stays on my long term memory so I'm trying to come up with techniques to improve it.

Currently also checking mnemonics and *Anki* which is a flashcard software for accelerated learning of concepts. The software is much more entertaining than the mnemonics as those take time to build and it seems to really work. I'm using it to learn Japanese and it along with repetition exercises has been giving pretty good results.

Also still struggling with the discipline problem. I wish I was even as half driven as the rational protagonists of our stories. I still haven't found a reliable way to build up willpower/motivation/discipline. And it seems they are different things to booth.

Oh what I'd give for some of those aranean spells for memory retention and focus.
