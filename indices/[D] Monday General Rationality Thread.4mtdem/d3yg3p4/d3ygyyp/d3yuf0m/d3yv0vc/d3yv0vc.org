Heh. I'm only minoring in Philosophy, but I'm hoping to scramble enough funds to go on for a Master's in Philosophy.

(another unexpected side effect of philosophy is that it's potentially aggravated the effects of my depersonalization/derealization disorder too; they should include medical warnings before you take a class >:P )
