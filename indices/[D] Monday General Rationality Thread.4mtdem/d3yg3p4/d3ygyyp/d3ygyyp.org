  I still haven't found a reliable way to build up willpower/motivation/discipline.

I've, um, considered calculating how many lives I could by working in a given hour (or, really, what fraction of a life, given that there's nothing that I could do that would make $3,000/hour) and then framing things in terms of "You're going to kill X people if you lose an average of one hour of productivity a day."

I feel like this might work for me, but I'm also kind of afraid to go too far into trying it because I have bipolar and it's kind of possible that I might decide that I'm wasting so much time that I might as well stop consuming resources and, um, quickly die in some manner that would at least let me save some people by donating my organs.

(It's ridiculous to think that I've legitimately considered whether I'm morally obligated to kill myself, but that's bipolar/depression for you.)

If someone else with greater mental health is interested in this, though, then let me know. I'd love to see if it works or just makes you feel horrible.
