As for food, use smaller plates/bowls.

It's much easier to think "Am I full?" every time you empty your plate and have to get up to get a new one, compared to every time you take a bite.

I don't have an answer for entertainment. I have the same problem. It's just too easy to binge watch/read/play something. There's rarely a good point to stop and re-evaluate if you're enjoying yourself.
