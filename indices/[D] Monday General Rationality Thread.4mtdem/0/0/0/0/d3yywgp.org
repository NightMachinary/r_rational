I have a big problem with not finishing things, but I think giving up on having to finish out a television or book series has helped me with that. I imagine it like there's a limited pool of gumption available to me, and I can either spend it on finishing actually productive things (like writing stories I've lost my enthusiasm for) or I can spend it on things that gain me nothing (like reading fiction I don't like).

Of course, my unfinished works to finished works ratio is still something like 4:1, so I can't really say it helps /that/ much.
