I find I do enjoyable things beyond the point where I enjoy them, in both entertainment and food. It's hard to notice the transition between doing it because I want to and doing it until it's done.

The other problem I've been having is that I tend to overestimate the unpleasantness of doing something other than what I'm doing in the moment. It leads to nonurgent tasks not getting done for a very long time. I know my intuition is wrong but it's still a very strong influence on my decisions.

Has anyone had any luck with stuff like this? What would you recommend?
