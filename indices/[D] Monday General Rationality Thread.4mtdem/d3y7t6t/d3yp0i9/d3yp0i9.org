That used to happen to me with entertainment, but eventually I just developed a hair trigger reflex towards dropping things I wasn't finding fun anymore. I think it happened when I went through a period of reading a lot of fanfic; so many of them fall apart or stop updating that it never seems like that much of a loss, and some of them are so long that if you're going to sink time into finishing them, you're going to sink a /lot/ of time.
