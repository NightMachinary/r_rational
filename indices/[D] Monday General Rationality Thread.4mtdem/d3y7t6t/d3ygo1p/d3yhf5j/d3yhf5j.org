A fter the initial enjoyment fades it's more like the task is engaging but at most mildly enjoyable than completely empty of value. It's usually only after that I noticed I wasn't hungry / entertained after some point. The second problem definitely contributes to procrastination. I'm not sure about depression.

I think there could be causation the other way for entertainment as an escape from unpleasant thoughts rather than for its own sake.
