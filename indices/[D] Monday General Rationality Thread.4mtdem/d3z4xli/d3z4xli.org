I have previously been under the impression that I was a fairly rational person. The past two days have shown that I am under the influence of my emotions as much as, if not more than my intelligence and reasoning.

An individual near me has slighted me in what others may consider a small way, but it completely infringed on my territory. Today while pondering on my irrationality, I understood the rational reasons why I was upset with the individual, and was (today) able to explain like a rational adult why I was so pissed at them for it, and garnered an apology from them.

I also apologized for being upset in an irrational manner...

I'm striving to be a rational person, but some times I have an emotional pull into so many things.
