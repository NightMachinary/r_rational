I didn't have any luck with [[/r/software][r/software]], but I managed to find a chrome extension on my own.

Chrome extension Crackbook [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crackbook/nbgjmohekjolcgemlolblankocjlgalf?hl=en][(link)]] provides a splash page to websites of your choosing. No "are you sure" challenge, but waiting 3 seconds to open a page provides a similar experience. It's also open source: [[http://github.com/gintas/crackbook]]
