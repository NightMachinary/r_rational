I'm looking for a productivity tool (ideally as an extension to Chrome). Here's what I would like it to do: When I navigate to a website in a list I specify (say, facebook), I'm presented with a challenge page that asks if I want to continue or not. This trivial inconvenience will help to remind me that I need to stay on target without expending significant willpower, in the same way that putting snacks far away from your workplace reduces the amount of snacking you do.

My attempts to search for an extension like this have mostly turned up productivity apps that completely block sites, or limit time on them. Does anyone know of an extension that does what i'm describing?
