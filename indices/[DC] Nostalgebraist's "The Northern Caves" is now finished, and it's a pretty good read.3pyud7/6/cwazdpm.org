This does a similar thing to what Floornight did, which is starting with an interesting enough premise and then just descending into ... I don't know, prose for the sake of prose? Words arranged in some way that might have been meaningful to the author? The semblance of style but no real substance?

It's cheap gimmickry in a story about people analyzing a story that's full of cheap gimmickry, standard experimental fiction that's analyzing experimental fiction ... I'm almost on the verge of saying that I hated it, but I think if I strip away all the things I don't like (most of which are down to style) there's an enjoyable story.

Perhaps reading it all in one sitting wasn't the way to go.
