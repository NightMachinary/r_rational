I assumed, after a good- well, mediocre- night's sleep, that in their daze they just... assumed chains of cause and effect that were plausible in the normal story, and more-so in the north caves, but not in the real world.

I assumed the deaths were coincidence, or close to that level, (if i do something that accelerates a death, by accident but with intent to change something, is that manslaughter? it's probably not murder) but the unending chains of causality, combined with a decent dose of superstition, made them overthink it. That the story is only a memetic in that it conveys a bizarre worldveiw- everything else that happens is normal. If you spend long enough thinking in patterns, they stick unless you're very careful. It's not magic, just things going weird manually.
