Yesh, maybe. But that's kinda boring.

I was out of the story by the time they just immediately accepted that the short chat Errant had with a stewardess was the cause for the suicides. I felt, from the 10th or so chapter on. like the story was teasing me continuously, just on the edge of something worthy telling actually happening, and then nothing happens and it just ends.

Bleh.
