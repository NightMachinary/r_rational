Kind of late replying because I took my time thinking of my response... I guess the fact that the story takes place in a fictional world makes deciphering the real meaning and cause of the events more difficult. What I mean is, in the real world, the prior probability of someone developing mimetic manipulation/psychic powers/power capable of causing people to commit suicide just by talking to them is incredibly low, but in a fictional world it is much more likely. Three people making a suicide pact for no apparent reason is a pretty unusual event. Thus the events are ambiguous because we can't be quite sure if it is a magic-realism type of story or a more mundane type of story. This would be okay, if the story played up the ambiguity better, but instead all the more rational/sane characters in story treat it as a coincidence and then the story abruptly ends without any resolution or even acknowledgment of the ambiguity.

Also, I have to agree with [[/u/alexanderwales]] that the prose gets awkward to read when the main character gets really crazy. I feel like a moderate amount of this would have been okay, or a large amount so long as it has a pay off, but as it is now, it feels excessive for no pay off in terms of plot or characterization of hidden details.

Still despite all of this, I liked the story, it just ended too abruptly.
