Huh. An alright story. Worth the read. I might recommend it to a certain type of person, but not to most people.

The title should definitely be changed.

It has a Luddist feel to it (mostly because of the main character) which is vaguely disappointing. I suppose... I am not sure what I am supposed to take away from the story. On the one hand, the protagonist swallows at least some of his Luddism and makes use of an AI. On the other hand, the ending would not be out of place in a story whose message was about the dehumanizing effect of AI or technology in general.
