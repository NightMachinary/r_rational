Hey hey, just to chime in: this is part of a set of 10 stories called "Tomorrowland," each of which is named after a different movie coming out this year. Here is [[http://www.miraclejones.com/stories/the-avengers-age-of-ultron.html]["Avengers: Age of Ultron,"]] for instance, a story from this collection in a similar vein.

Edit: All the stories so far in the collection, in addition to many other stories, can be found at [[http://www.miraclejones.com]]
