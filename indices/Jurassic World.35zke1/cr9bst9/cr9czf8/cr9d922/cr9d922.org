That... sort of makes it ridiculously misleading. The first time that I read a Tomorrowland story I might not think that it was a text version of the film to which it referred, but it would be reasonable to think that Jurassic World, for example, would at least have to do with /genetic engineering/ if not dinosaurs or time travel or something.

After finding otherwise I will know better, but the titles will now be useless to me. They tell me nothing. You could name them Story #1, Story #2, Story #3, and so on, and I would know just as much as these titles tell me, and this... kind of annoys me, much to my surprise.
