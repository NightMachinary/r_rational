I've been kicking around a few thoughts about sakki and partitions.

Sakki is about removing conditioning that dictates what a pokemon should or should not do which returns them to their wild state driven by instinct.

Partitioning is about putting up barriers to block off certain patterns of thoughts or behaviors. Another way of thinking about it is that it's a type of imposed conditioning to not think about specific thoughts or mode of thoughts.

I suspect that sakki will, later in the story, be used to counteract the ability to partition.
