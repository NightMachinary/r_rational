Ugh Red, I swear to Arceus its two steps forward one step back with you - if you have read as many stories as you claim you would know keeping the /sakki/ secret in particular from Leaf, probably also Blue, is totally going to blow up in your face! You had all those therapy sessions around how telling the people in your life your feelings instead of assuming and bottling them up is better, gotta realize those are general case lessons, not Akio-death-specific techniques. And Leaf was there for it all, it affected her - she may take the deception personally.

The poor boy has had way too much trauma in too little a span of time...
