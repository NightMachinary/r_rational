I see a couple more assumptions that I think are causing the confusion:

#+begin_quote
  The whole fight plus the repair would have played out in maybe 60 seconds.
#+end_quote

Lizzy had been working on the generators already when the renegade found her and attacked, knowing that the lowest basement level was exposed and not sure what she might have seen.

#+begin_quote
  This implies that she met Leaf after she just fixed the generator
#+end_quote

No, she didn't know Leaf did that until afterward. The last thing she saw was the sandslash turn on its master, then she ran back to the generator, finished fixing it, and was guided to Maria by Red.
