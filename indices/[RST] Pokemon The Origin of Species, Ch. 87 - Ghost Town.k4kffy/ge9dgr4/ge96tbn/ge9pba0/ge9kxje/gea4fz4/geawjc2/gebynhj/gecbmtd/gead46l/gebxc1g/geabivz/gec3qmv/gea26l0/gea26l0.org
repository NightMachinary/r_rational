Awesome chapter as always. I love learning more about the various "supernatural" ghost/psychic/dark phenomena in this world.

The paragraph about replication struck me as odd. If it allowed for the easy, cheap & legal replication of something as complex as a Silph Scope, you'd think it would also let people replicate i.e. Ultra Balls and Full Restores, which seems like it would have huge market consequences--but instead, the only example given is pokemon statues, which is cool but hardly world-shaking. If there's some reason why battle tech can't be reproduced, it's probably worth mentioning, as otherwise the entire PokeMart business would be quickly replaced with replicators where trainers can slot in whatever they need more of and just xerox it a hundred times. You do mention a manufacturing shakeup, but to me the casual and offhanded nature of the description didn't seem to match the consequences of the new tech.
