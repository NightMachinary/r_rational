Thanks, that's helpful. I'm surprised that someone would have intuited that order of events. Did that reader already read chapter 87? Because then it doesn't count, since Red just presents this as the order :)

If not though..... "some of the assumptions you made while reading it were not necessarily inherent to the text" Yeah probably. Or maybe nobody assumed that Red would be directing Lizzy and Maria at the same time (or swap between them), which I strongly assumed because of the Lizzy-projection. [and that being similar to some of the Rei-experiments] Definitely will try rereading this with fresh eyes at some point, though.
