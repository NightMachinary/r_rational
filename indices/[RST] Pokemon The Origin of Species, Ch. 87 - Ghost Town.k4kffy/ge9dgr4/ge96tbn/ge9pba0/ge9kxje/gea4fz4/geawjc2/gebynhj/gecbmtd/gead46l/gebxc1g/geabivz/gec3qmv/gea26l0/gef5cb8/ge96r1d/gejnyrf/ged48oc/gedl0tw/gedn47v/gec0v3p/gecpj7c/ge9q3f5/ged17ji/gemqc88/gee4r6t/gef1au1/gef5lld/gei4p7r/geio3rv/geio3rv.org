I suppose it could be read like that.

But it's not just the wording.

Timing-wise Lizzy's side of events must have played out incredibly fast.\\
Rakim burns, Maria captures the Golem and Magmar, starts helping Glen, notices the emergency lights going out and the normal lights turning back on.\\
If Maria lost consciousness during this maybe, but that didn't happen.

So I reread Lizzy's account again:\\
"Turned out to be a sandslash, which chased after me soon after. I nearly went through my whole belt just slowing it down as I ran around the halls... until suddenly it turned on its trainer."

Apparently she only "nearly" ran thru her whole belt.\\
Maybe her Mareep made it. Or maybe turning on power was as simple as flipping the right switch?

The whole fight plus the repair would have played out in maybe 60 seconds. And both fights would have to follow one another very closely, when those events happened independently from one another.

And then Lizzy reports:

“You still acted quickly in capturing his pokemon after,” Lizzy says. “That was really brave! I was so shocked by what happened I didn't even think of it, just ran away. I got doubly lucky my renegade's sandslash didn't chase after me, or kill someone else while I was busy with the generator, and just stood around her body until Leaf was able to put it to sleep.”

This implies that she met Leaf after she just fixed the generator, since otherwise she would have to say "when I was busy with the generator for sixty seconds, climbed from subbasement 1 to subbasement 3, give Maria a hug, have an extended conversation with her and go off to find another exit".

But if she met Leaf right after fixing the generator, she also would have been told that Red was the one who guided her by Leaf. And then she would have told Maria, when they were wondering about who did that.\\
But Lizzy does not mention meeting Leaf.\\
But the way she tells it, the unattended Sandslash was only a danger when she was fixing the generator. (maybe 30 seconds)

I appreciate that the hospital scene is full of unreliable narrators, but there's no way an attentive reader could have looked at everything that's written and thought that "Rakim, then Maddie" is even remotely likely.
