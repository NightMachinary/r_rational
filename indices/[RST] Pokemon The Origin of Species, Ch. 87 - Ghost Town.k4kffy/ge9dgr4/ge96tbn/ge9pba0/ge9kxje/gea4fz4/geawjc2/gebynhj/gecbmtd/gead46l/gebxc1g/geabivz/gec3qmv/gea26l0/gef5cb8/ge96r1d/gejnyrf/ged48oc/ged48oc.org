Pray tell, where is Ace international law student Alex Cyr?\\
Another exeggcution must be scheduled, to be sure.\\
And by the way, where on earth is the ever-elusive Rei?\\
It's been way too long, since we've seen her.\\
Heard she's even more powerful than Sabrina!\\
Did she "die in the earthquake" as in "fake her own death"?\\
Wise that would be, and she better stay dead.\\
Or she too will soon draw her last breath.\\
Cause if she makes a play for dangerous secrets and crosses Red's path....\\
Let's just say you really don't want to draw this 12 year old's wrath!\\
Run far away, lay low and everything might just turn out well.\\
And heed the warning, that Yuuta and Maddie and Rakim are screaming from hell:

*If you dare to cross Red, you are already dead!*
