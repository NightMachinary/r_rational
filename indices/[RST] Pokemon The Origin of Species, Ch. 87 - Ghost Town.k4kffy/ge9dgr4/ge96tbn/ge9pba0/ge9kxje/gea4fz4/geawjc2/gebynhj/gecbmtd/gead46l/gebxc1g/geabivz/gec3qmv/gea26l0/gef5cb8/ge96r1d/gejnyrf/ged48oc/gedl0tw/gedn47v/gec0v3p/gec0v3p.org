It's always a delight to read these.

Relative to other tweens, or in general?

Anyway, I'm sure that once knowledge of sakki does get out, there will be conspiracy theories that the legendaries were captured years or generations ago. There probably already are, since the conditioning itself was developed within living memory. And they'll surely be the subject of an arms race if they can be used aggressively.

ETA: Aggressively by any old psychic, I should say, since hunters can already to that. Maybe Red just ought to work harder at getting one first.
