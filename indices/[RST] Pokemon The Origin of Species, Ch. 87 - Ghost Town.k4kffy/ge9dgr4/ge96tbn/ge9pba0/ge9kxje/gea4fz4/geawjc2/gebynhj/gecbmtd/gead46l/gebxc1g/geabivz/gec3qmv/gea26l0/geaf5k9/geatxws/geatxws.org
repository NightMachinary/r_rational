  you'd think it would also let people replicate i.e. Ultra Balls and Full Restores

Not sure about Full Restores, but I imagine the Pokeball tech using a rare element that cannot itself be scanned.

My headcannon for why Pokeballs cannot duplicate Pokemon relates to the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owPC60Ue0BE][No Cloning Theorem]]. Also: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem][(wikipedia article)]] In essence, biology requires destructive scans for sufficient accuracy, but duplicating physical objects can afford non-destructive scans and lesser accuracy.

So maybe Full Restores have a biological component.
