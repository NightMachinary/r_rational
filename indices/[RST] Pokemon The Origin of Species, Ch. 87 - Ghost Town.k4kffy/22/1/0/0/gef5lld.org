argh.... Reddit removes all linebreaks, when you edit a comment!\\
That's why this looks so messy.

tl;dr: Cause the other way around just doesn't make sense.

I'm not really great at reading.\\
Translating text into visuals, mapping different parallel perspectives onto a cohesive timeline. Who's standing where doing what in a fight scene?\\
Reading Leaf's journalism and not immediately forgetting all the names as soon as I hit the next sentence?\\
Even keeping similar Japanese names straight.....\\
Very difficult for me.\\
And I used this as a good challenge to push my reading comprehension to its limit.\\
So that I one day may reread "Animorphs: the reckoning" and Worm again and it's more than just a fun blur to me.

If my analysis doesn't make sense, I'd be surprised, but also very interested to hear where I reasoned wrongly.
