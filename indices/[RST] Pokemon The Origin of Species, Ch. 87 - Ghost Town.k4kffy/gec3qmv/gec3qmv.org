Huh in terms of places that you encounter Team Rocket in the games it's like Mount Moon, where they're trying to get Fossils, the Nugget Bridge where they try to recruit strong trainers, there's a grunt stealing TMs in Cerulean City proper, the Games Corner where they have a base and are implicitly the owners of it, Silph Co in Sabrina's city where they attempt to steal both the Silph Scope and the Master Ball. And of course in Lavender Town where they catch a multitude of pokemon and orphan a Cubone leading us to see a the ghost of a Marowak. And i think there's one more encounter or two but the last two are the important ones to keep in mind.

Team Rocket or rather the various forces under Giovanni have the Silph Scope or an equivalent to one, they then use that to capture a ton of ghost pokemon and probably Cubone/Marowak which our protaginists are too late to stop at least partially because of them posting */ONLINE/* their plans to do something about Lavender Town. Which is great of coordination, but also shows their hand to the person that's arguably working against them or it could be said that our group has stumbled upon Giovanni's plans more than once.

Also as an aside Sabrina being told that oh yeah a psychic can totally lie and not even know that they lied if they have a partition up was hilarious if only the Hoenn events had happened a little bit later, but also the extreme irony that if she had started the though experiment during the month that Red had been a part of mentorship group well let's just say Sabrina had multiple reasons to feel regret not only towards Red but seemingly toward Mewtwo also.
