It feels like it's been so long since we had an old fashioned adventure with any of the cast. It's nice to see them start to get back to their lives after everything that happened these last 12 chapters, even if 'normal' to them now isn't the same 'normal' from before.

That Celadon tag-along is totally a covert agent for Erika. Doesn't help that she is Phoenix. I'm expecting a psychic breakdown at some point.
