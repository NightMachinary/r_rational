  Uhm.... that feels inconsistent:The wariness deepens. Talking or thinking about this part in particular always makes the discomfort worse. “I didn't. Keep my concentration, I mean. It was hard to focus on any one thing at a time, so I used my psydar instead, and only realized when the first two people... when their minds vanished at the same time, right next to the golem that I thought was summoned to save them.”

  “And then you focused on it?”

  “With the help of my partitioned self, yeah. I realized the next time it attacked a survivor that it was able to see humans as threats. After that it was just a matter of warning my friends.”

This reads like he killed Rakim first and then Maddie.

Red killed Maddie with her Sandslash to save Lizzy.So he already broke that taboo, at that point.Then *afterwards* he killed Rakim with Maria's Vulpix to save her and Glen.

Seems more odd that Red wouldn't have used Rakim's Golem or his Magmar, because it felt wrong, when he just did the same thing with Maddie's Sandslash.Especially since it was Rakim's Golem from the beginning, that tipped him off.Or at least that's what he's telling Sabrina.

That story has another problem though, because Rakim's Golem only told him that there was one renegade about.Not that Roark specifically was one. Roark is dark and probably was using a pokémon to just shovel them free (and then getting a separate kill command, which Red could not have known for sure). So my theory is that Red succeeded in becoming the perfect liar.

And he's hiding the fact that he went full "sleep time first, ask questions later" at that point, which is worthy of a renegade branding.

Actually no, I'm none too confident that I can properly keep track of Red's web of lies and deception.

Part of the problem is that I'm never sure what "partition is up" vs "partition is down" means.Does up mean "up like a raised gate" or "up like a raised wall"?Like..... is a partition more like a fence (coming in from below) or more like a garage door (coming in from above)?I only know "partition of a set" from mathematics. Or on a hard drive.This isn't as obvious as raising and lowering psychic shields.I have raised shields in real life before, after all.

Could you maybe clear that up? Or perhaps cut down on the ambiguity :)
