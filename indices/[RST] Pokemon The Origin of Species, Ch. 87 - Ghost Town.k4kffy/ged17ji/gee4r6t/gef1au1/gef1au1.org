I suppose it was never spelled out directly.But I read those chapters over quite a bit, trying to make sense of what happened when to whom. And why things happened at all (i.e. why was Lizzy attacked?). It was very confusing, because chapter 86 introduced a third renegade (with a similar name to Rakim, which I originally mixed him up with) in the retelling and then hipster Leaf was being ambiguous about the gender of Maddie.[before you fixed that]Perhaps I finally had a timeline in my head and then fell prey to confirmation bias.But rereading it all, everything seems to point to that.

Chapter 83 Interlude XV - Titans III

So Maria gets directions from Fake-Lizzy, but then the directions change.

#+begin_quote
  She stops in confusion as the mental sense starts directing her somewhere again, still full of fear and a sense of urgency... but the direction she feels her attention being tugged in is different from before. “The direction changed?”
#+end_quote

That would make sense if Lizzy was already safe.Though maybe he just reprioritized on the fly since we get this soon after:

#+begin_quote
  “I don't know.” MG leans against the wall, feeling overwhelmed by the despair and fear and insistent need to get down to where the next murder is going to happen... /murder?/

  She focuses on the feeling again, eyes closed, and feels the psychic impressions mixing with her own... /emergency-danger-pokemon-hurry-victim- searching-KILLINGINTENT.../ MG's eyes snap open as she sucks in a shocked breath at the surge of violent focus she felt, for just a moment. She thought a pokemon had gotten in, somehow, but no, this is something more deliberate...
#+end_quote

But this part happened before Rakim was killed.And KILLINGINTENT was capitalized, kind of like D-E-T-E-R-M-I-N-A-T-I-O-N. So I figured that's Red doing his Sakki-thing on a Pokemon. Since Sakki has been referred to specifically as "killing intent".

Also the hospital:

#+begin_quote
  “You still acted quickly in capturing his pokemon after,” Lizzy says. “That was really brave! I was so shocked by what happened I didn't even think of it, just ran away. I got doubly lucky my renegade's sandslash didn't chase after me, or kill someone else while I was busy with the generator, and just stood around her body until Leaf was able to put it to sleep.”
#+end_quote

So she was only busy with the generator after Maddie was dead, presumably very cautiously tiptoing around a very confused Sandslash that just killed all her Pokémon and its own trainer. [you mentioned in one of the latter comment-threads that her Arcanine didn't stand a chance, because of type advantage and I think she'd throw everything she had at it, to save her own life]\\
And it must have taken her a while, since she was worried that the Sandslash might have gone on another rampage, whilst she did generator repairs aided only by emergency lights. [her Pokémon being dead]

Admittedly the hospital timeline might be part of some convoluted alibi-scheme, but I just took it at face-value.

#+begin_quote
  And...

  The renegade is screaming, horrible high pitched sounds of pain as light bursts from around the corner.

  [then Lizzy captures the Magmar and Golem and helps Glen without much of a delay in any of it]

  “Glen, no, wake up,” light, she needs light to see what she's doing as she sprays the potion, it's hard to make out where the wound is in the red emergency lights...

  A moment later they shut off, and she nearly screams in fear and frustration before the building's regular lights come on, blindingly bright after the red gloom that she feels she's been in for hours. She rapidly blinks, then takes a closer look at Glen's head.
#+end_quote

Between Rakim cuddling with the Vulpix and the light coming back on, there's maybe a minute that's passed.

If Rakim died before Maddie, the following would had to have happened in just one minute:\\
Maddie chases Lizzy with a Sandslash. Presumably away from the generator, not towards it, since that's why she was likely targeted in the first place.\\
Lizzy summons all of her Pokémon to defend herself, till they're either all dead or crippled. Because why wouldn't she? It's been established before that a competent trainer would always sacrifice their Pokémon to save your own life or buy themself time, if need be.\\
Then Maddie's Sandslash turns on her.\\
Then Lizzy carefully tiptoes back around the bloodspattered Sandslash to the generator.\\
Then she fixes it without any Pokémon using only her electrical engineering skills with emergency light only.

That doesn't really seem likely.\\
Red confirms in this chapter, that he had to use Maddie's Sandslash, because he had no other option.\\
Even though he just used the Vulpix hug technique, he couldn't do it with Lizzy's much faster Arcanine (the mate of Soul? Oh God..... Lizzy lost her soulmate!)\\
Even though he has experience with Pikachu's senses, he couldn't do it with a similar enough Flaaffy.\\
Those are good options, that he presumably would have tried.\\
Maybe he couldn't use them, because he was busy controlling the Vulpix at the moment, but there's no reason to assume that it had this highly specific timing.

---\\
Now Lizzy was in Subbasement 1, which has a "turn around the lost tourists"-order, not a "kill all intruders"-order, like subbasement 3.\\
And even Rakim considered not acting on the explicit kill-order, since this was obviously not the situation it was intended for.\\
And Giovanni doesn't hire giggly unstable psychopaths for guard duty.\\
[at least Rakim wasn't and it doesn't seem like the proper fit for the job]

But Maddie trying to kill the girl that loudly announces that it's looking for the generator makes perfect sense.\\
Though unless she's going for the psychopathic employee award of the year, this must have been a direct order from Archer, since she's thereby actively hindering the rescue of her colleagues, fantasy Indigo league competitors and presumably friends.

What doesn't make sense is to kill the girl that just fixed the generators.\\
Much simpler to sneak around her and destroy the generators for good.\\
Lizzy presumably would have been on her way to join up with Glenn and the others.
