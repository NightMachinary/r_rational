I think I would challenge the idea that people can't put this (mostly) together with the text as presented; most people did not seem to have trouble interpreting it as far as I can tell by comments/reviews on those chapters, and when I asked a reader to give an unprompted summary of what they believe occurred, this was their response:

#+begin_quote
  The floor collapsed, because of the earthquakes. Then the Iranian Renegade guy, along with a few others that were stationed there, decide that the risk of being outed as renegades is lower than the risk of the cops investigating the basement, so they go around killing people who fell in accidentally. Red is one of them, he reads the minds of people getting killed and Pokemon doing the killing, and sends out a psychic distress signal to anyone he recognizes within his range. Lizzy and Maria are within his range, they run in to fight the renegades, but they start losing badly. Red panicks, uses sakki on Maria's Vulpix to kill the renegade. (Side note, it's unclear whether that would work on a Pokemon that is more thoroughly trained, Vulpix was recently caught so maybe it would be easier to overcome the conditioning? I forgot to mention that, I thought it would come up) Then Red turns Lizzy's renegade's Sandslash against its trainer, and Leaf put the third to sleep, probably first since Red didn't fall asleep while directing Maria, so the renegades are all taken care of and everyone can focus on rescue operations.

Not everything about this is correct (Lizzy didn't run in to fight the renegades, in her situation it was more of warning that one was approaching her), and there's definitely still some uncertainty inherent to the text due to unreliable narrators and not all the /sakki/ mechanics being fully explained, but it notably doesn't confuse the order-of-events.

Not saying this to dismiss your own experience, I definitely could have written it more clearly and will try to edit it to do so at some point :) Just wanted to point out that some of the assumptions you made while reading it were not necessarily inherent to the text.
