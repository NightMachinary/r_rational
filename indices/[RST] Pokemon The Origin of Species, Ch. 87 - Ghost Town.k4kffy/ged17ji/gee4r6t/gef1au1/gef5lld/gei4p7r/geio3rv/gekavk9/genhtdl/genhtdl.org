Ok, maybe it's not necessarily impossible.\\
But "Rakim, then Maddie" is not "Fair Play:Whodunnit".\\
So we have 60 seconds (or maybe make it 120) after Rakim starts getting burned. Also we know from the text, that it takes a while till he stops screaming, but I suppose Red only had to give the command once and the Vulpix sticks with the attack. Or the Vulpix only attacked once and watched Rakim die slowly from it, without attacking him further.\\
And maybe Red had to choose between helping Maria and helping Lizzy.\\
So Red only had the Sandslash-option, because Lizzy lost her Pokémon already, while he was taking care of Rakim.\\
That works a little better, because now only the Sandslash turning on Maddie had to happen, not the Sandslash slashing almost all of Lizzy's Pokémon first.

So then Lizzy finds the generator, fixes it with the help of at least one surviving Pokémon. Also her hands are surprisingly steady after sprinting, losing many of her beloved Pokémon and seeing a woman get torn to bits in front of her.\\
Maybe Takada-hands are adrenaline-proof as a virtue when it comes to electrical stuff. Or maybe she just had to pull the last lever and it didn't matter.

It's just extremely unlikely timing, that one can't guess or puzzle together from the given information in the text.

I understood those chapters as a puzzle of trying to figure out what was actually going on. Made even more interesting when we got unreliable witness accounts in the hospital scene with everyone keeping secrets from each other or the public.\\
Similar to the Mt. Moon investigation and the exeggcute-arc.

"Roark, Rakim, then Maddie" works best dramatically for Red's gradual descent into renegade-dom, of course.\\
Breaking taboos in sequence is good narrative progression.\\
[though I don't think we know whether Roark was first or last]
