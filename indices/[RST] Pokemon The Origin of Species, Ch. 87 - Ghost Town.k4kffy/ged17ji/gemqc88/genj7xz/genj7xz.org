Ah thanks. I think mostly I read it like that, but I was never sure and when things started going up and down, I got lost at some point.

So when the partition is up, we get happy/cheerful/driven Red as the protagonist.\\
And happy Red is the "partitioned self".\\
And the "partitioned self" is what was in control till the Spinarak broke the partition?\\
Is that about right?

I'll have to reread the Red-scenes again with that cleared up, because I only sorta get his internal dynamics.\\
His cognitive processes are fascinating, but also extremely alien to me.
