I was actually interested in the opposite.

The only people in this world that can lie perfectly currently are dark types; in the future it'll be psychic types too. So there still is a class of people who won't be able to lie (non-dark non-psychic).

My question is: how different is their society from ours, due to the fact that most people's statements can be verified to match their beliefs? The caveat being that it takes effort and an invasion of privacy to do said verification...

Is this why renegade trials can be done so straightforwardly? I haven't seen any other level of implicit trust shown that wouldn't be reasonable in our real world full of doubt and lies.
