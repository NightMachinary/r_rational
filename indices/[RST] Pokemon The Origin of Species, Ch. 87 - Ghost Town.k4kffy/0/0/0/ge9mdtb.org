Yeah, and publishing it would not in fact be wise - but telling your friends is not that for sure. I also think there has to be some recognition that you are in fact a 12 year old boy, and it is extremely likely that you are not the first person to be able to pull this technique off, or something close. There is very high probability that the military or Giovanni or what have you have done at least similar techniques, at least from Red's perspective - like with the Doctor conversation about partitions, where Red believed he had some unique experience but of course a trained specialized knew about other fringe tulpa cases. I would talk to Sabrina about it as well if I were him, as she could put it in proper context.

Of course I get why he isn't - this is not a well-reasoned stance of logic, but an emotional decision based on fear of judgement and guilt over the actions. The poor smol boy!
