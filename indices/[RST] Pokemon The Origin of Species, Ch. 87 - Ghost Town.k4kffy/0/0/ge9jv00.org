This is a dangerous secret. Information security dictates he shouldn't have told Maria, even if doing so was very beneficial to her emotional well being. Ideally he would tell no one. He lives in a world with people who can read minds after all.

It almost certainly would be fine to tell Blue/Leaf, but the main argument for it would be so they can offer emotional support. Considering the stuff Leaf gets up too I doubt she'd take the deception personally even though she'd be concerned about the implications for pokemon if this sakki trick became widespread. I'd have to reread. I remember Leaf and Red having an argument about sakki but can't remember the exact contention.
