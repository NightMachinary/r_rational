Glad to get a Red perspective chapter after so long! Spooky ghosts and conspiracies abound. The gang gets back together for a journey for the first time in many chapters.

I look forward to seeing them all interact together again. It'll probably never be the same as the early days but its exciting to see them move on to bigger things.

Red seems emotionally more stable too despite his most recent trauma. I do wonder if forgetting traumatic past events in his life could have negative consequences. As long as part of him remembers though it seems safe enough.
