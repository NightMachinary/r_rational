It's probably too late to start the trend now, but you could name them after npc trainers in the games and do a little "/wink wink nudge nudge/ they /might/ be the same character"\\
And it would be fun for anyone replaying the game to randomly run into a trainer named "Glen" or something and have a little "Oh hey I know that guy"

It's actually what I thought you were doing at first and why you didn't bother describing any of them.
