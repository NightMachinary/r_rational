I just thought that with me finishing the 87 chapters that are out right now I'd just let my thoughts flow free. First off this has been one of if not the best Pok√©mon fanfic that I have read. (I've read about the top 20 most favorited stories.) It has so much potential with the way you have written the plot and the characters main end goals. The way you write is unique to the other stories where you actually go into detail where most people might not put the effort into. The parts where you talk about one person for a few chapters then switch to a different persons story really makes the book feel more like a tv show than just a book. I don't mean for this to be offensive towards your writing(I have loved the story so far) but I feel as if the main attack with Groudon and Kyogre feels almost a little rushed. With how devastating the Stormbirds attack was and from what I have read that it almost happens yearly with the seasons, I just wish that the story would have a prequel or some more context before Red's story starts. For example with what Giovanni said about humans becoming complacent, that was the first time that I have really wanted more story before Red started his journey and how the world ran. Overall I hope you continue writing the story because of how amazing this book can still grow and flourish. I am still amazed that you have kept so determined to write after 7 years and hope that you stay safe and continue writing. Also this community seems really cool.
