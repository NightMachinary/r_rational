You could make a scan at a lower resolution, and then, when materializing, use an algorithm to fill in the gaps using some high-resolution templates stored in the pokeball. For the biology to work, it doesn't necessarily need to be the same high-resolution data, it only needs to be high-resolution data that perform the same function just as well.

The question is, would the high-res template be destroyed because of the no-cloning theorem, and if so, would we need the cloning pokeball "refilled" on a regular basis?
