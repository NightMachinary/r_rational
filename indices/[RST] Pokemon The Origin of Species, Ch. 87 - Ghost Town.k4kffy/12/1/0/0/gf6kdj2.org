Chansey learn Softboiled and (sometimes) have the Natural Cure ability, so it makes sense that Chansey DNA might /code/ to produce some sort of healing enzyme, or enhanced platelets and antibodies.

But just sticking any DNA into a medicine, all by itself, doesn't make as much sense to me, unless maybe you're trying to treat a genetic disorder. No matter what it codes for, DNA all by itself is just a really big molecule.
