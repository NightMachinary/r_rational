Hey everyone, welcome back! Brief comment about the last chapter's battle: it bent a couple rules from the pokemon game in ways that feel justified, to me. The first was the whirlwind attack being able to clear field hazards the way defog does, since both are essentially the same type of attack, but divided by function. I'm not sure it makes sense for some flying pokemon to be able to create a whirlwind that can blow pokemon away, but not blow objects or fog away, so I'm ignoring the fact that the pidgey line doesn't naturally learn defog outside of egg moves.

The second is ingrain, which normally stops a pokemon from being blown or scared away from battle, but also stops you from being able to withdraw it, which is just... strange. It's not like it stops you from catching a pokemon in the wild, and there's nothing about the move that to me indicates that it should make a pokemon immune to a pokeball's effects. It seems to just be a balance decision they made, logic bedamned, and so I'm okay with putting the logic back in at the cost of game fidelity.

Enjoy the chapter, and hope everyone is staying safe this holiday. It would be a shame to get COVID just before vaccines start to roll out!
