Well I suppose they could be trying to take over the world, maybe in some way that doesn't require toppling existing governments. Then again, just finding really powerful wealthy or influential people and teaching them rationality might be enough that actually taking over the world wouldn't be necessary? I mean it doesn't seem feasible to topple the current system(s) at less not violently. But if they can somehow make it possible for some good and sufficiently wealthy person like Elon Musk to totally outcompete all the other super rich, and then have him or whoever to use the money to leverage saner smarter and more humane policies across the world...I mean that would still be kind of taking over the world right?

The question is how would they make that happen exactly? Maybe invent some kind of new tech that makes a lot of current tech obsolete, and then use ridiculous patents to keep that tech away from the competition? Problem with this is that it might incentivize other wealthy people to change their minds about super-long copyright terms that never seem to end. In which case that might put Elon Musk on the wrong side of public opinion because he would be seen as the one person benefitting from overly restrictive copyright law.
