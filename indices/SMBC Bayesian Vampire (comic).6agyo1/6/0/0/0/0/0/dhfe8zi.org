That clearly isn't the plan, though, as Tesla has released all of its patents to the public.

Of course, they did that so their charging mechanism would one day become the industry standard and because they knew no other company could actually use their ideas because none of them have Elon Musk, but the point is that universal victory by patent trolling isn't the plan.
