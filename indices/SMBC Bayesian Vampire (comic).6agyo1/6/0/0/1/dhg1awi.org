eh. That's all misdirection. It's well-known (in certain, exclusive circles) that achieving actual, general, friendly AI on a first attempt is just too improbable, and that it is far safer and easier to deliberately make something near-optimal. And so, while they pretend to be trying to solve the former problem, they're actually already coding up the Celestia AI. The fic /Friendship Is Optimal/ is, obviously, part of the cover - kind of like the show Stargate, which was created to cover up the actual Stargate program. If the truth leaks, even with fairly compelling evidence, skeptics will point to the fiction as evidence the leaked info is just the rantings of some crazy person, or the work of conspiracy trolls.
