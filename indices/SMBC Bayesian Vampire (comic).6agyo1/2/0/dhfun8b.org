Additionally, upon touching sunlight and being burnt, he should immediately retreat back into the shade before being completely incinerated. Even if his prior for being a vampire is super-exponentially low, there are unfathomably many other unlikely explanations for sunlight burning you, such as: some disease that reduces ultraviolet resistance, something weird happened to the atmosphere, someone is firing a laser at you, invisible acid is falling from the sky, something you've never heard of or even thought of before exists and is causing sunlight to hurt you, etc... Even if all of these are incredibly unlikely, so is hallucinating that you're being incinerated when nothing is wrong.

Even if vampires don't exist, clearly something is happening. You don't need to have a peer-reviewed scientific theory of why the sun is burning you before you decide to avoid it.
