[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23878/broken-chains][Broken Chains]] is decent enough.

Characters are more human than some xianxia. The sympathetic ones don't do the whole amoral destroy the weak schtick.

Please note, I've made it about 60% through what's written and we're still low on the power tier. Story is still early on.
