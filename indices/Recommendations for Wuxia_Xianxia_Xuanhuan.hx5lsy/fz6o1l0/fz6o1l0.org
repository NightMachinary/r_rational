[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4][Arrogant Young Master, Template A Variation 4]] is a light, fairly satirical/genre-aware piece.

If follows a xianxia reader who wakes up to find themselves as the generic early antagonist of a typical xianxia novel. They set about using their genre savviness to escape the traps and tropes such template characters tend to fall into.

I'd not put it down as a great work, but it's a fun enough read to fill time.
