It's not /really/ very rational, but if you want a legitimately great wuxia, I recommend watching Thunderbolt Fantasy. It's a great Taiwanese wuxia show, made with the assistance of a Japanese animation studio.

And while it's mostly just wuxia storytelling, it does have a pretty well-executed "master strategist" character who does some amusing anime-level plans.
