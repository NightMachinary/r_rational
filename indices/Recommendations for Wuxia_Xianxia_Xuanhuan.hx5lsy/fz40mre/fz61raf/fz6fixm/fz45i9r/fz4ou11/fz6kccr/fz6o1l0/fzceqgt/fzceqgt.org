Defiance of the Fall is a litrpg/xianxia hybrid. It's really tropey but written by a western author so no translation or grammar issues. The characters aren't amazing, but they aren't as egregiously bad as you sometimes see in typical xianxia either. The main character isn't too smart or talented, so he has to rely on treasures and his high luck stat to provide him opportunities, which can and does result in him getting hurt or even crippled. But of course, he's the protagonist, so he survives and becomes better than before. I recommend it for light reading.

He who Fights with Monsters is kinda xianxia kinda jrpg. Really neat system with nice power levels. The main character is sorta an asshole though, and sometimes the item and skill descriptions take away from the flow of a chapter. It's better written than Defiance. So if you can handle the assholery of the protagonist, the other characters are actually pretty fun and the humor is usually good.

Paragon of Destruction is also written by a western author, and is on a slightly higher level of quality than Defiance of the Fall. It starts off pretty bad tbh, with the protagonist getting lucky breaks and acquaintances who are willing to raise his power, but it gets better. Once the protagonist starts traveling alone more, he starts taking more initiative. Around chapter 150+ is where it hits its stride imo. Power is still something he wants to attain, but it comes from himself and his ideas instead of random guy turning out to be a sage or something (usually).
