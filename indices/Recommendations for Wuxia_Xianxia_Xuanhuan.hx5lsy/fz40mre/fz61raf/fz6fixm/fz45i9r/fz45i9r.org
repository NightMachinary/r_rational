I really liked /Changing Faces/ (same author as /Street Cultivation/.) It's more LitRPG than cultivation, though. But there are so many times when there's a setup for a dumb choice to drive the plot, and then the characters... just /talk to each other/ instead. Or notice their own irrational habits of thought and consciously try to change them.

If you've ever read /Wheel of Time/ and now have a permanent itch because of how /dumb/ all the characters were, then /Changing Faces/ is like a soothing balm for it.

(Also, it's only three short books with a solid ending.)

[edit: the series is /New Game Minus/, /Changing Faces/ is the name of the first book.]
