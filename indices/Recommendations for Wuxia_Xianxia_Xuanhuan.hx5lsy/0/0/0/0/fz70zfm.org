Yep, Cradle stands as one of the best in progression fantasy in general IMO. Nothing's perfect for everyone however; If you've read two or three (depends on patience) books and still don't like it, then it's probably not for you. Each book is better than the last so sticking with it will be worth it. If you don't like reading about someone seating around in a cave and meditate on the Dao and come out dominating the whole planet, you should start with a steampunk fantasy webnovel from a Chinese author, Lord of the Mysteries. Rather than cultivation, there's potions that gives you powers. And the story-writing and translation quality is so good you read it like a novel from a western author. It'll introduce you to the good parts of Xianxia without the bad parts. It also starts off slow and really picks near the end of the first book. BTW, never search character names as you'll get spoiled even when just looking at an image.

For those accustomed to western media, the characters and settings in Xianxia can feel a bit off but it's something you'll get used to. Things like arrogant young masters, undying immortals, cultivation, etc that's prevalent in Xianxia can be jarring when you're new to the genre but I think Cradle's author tamed it down from the usual of Xianxia novels quite well. Well enough to get introduced and accustomed to them unlike how I started with I Shall Seal the Heavens and went "Why the fuck is everyone acting like POS murderhobo?" and "She just kidnapped you, why do you like her?"

What I like about Xianxia is that it's so different from any other piece of media I've consumed. Most MCs I've read are some Mary Sue or goody two shoes, but in Xianxia, the MC could do a genocide and I'll barely bat an eye and other characters would praise the MC for being 'strong' (Doesn't happen in Cradle and most good stories, so no worries). It really feels like a ruthless world where might makes right before any social reforms could take place, or is squashed before they could. Also, people that are said to be legends and such actually feel powerful; killing with a breath, gory deaths, etc. People actually die on the mass scale, and not just all them just got knocked unconscious somehow.

TLDR: Yep, Cradle's a good first, read Lord of the Mysteries if you hate cultivation.
