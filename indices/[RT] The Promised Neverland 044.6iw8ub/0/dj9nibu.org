I was going to say that I'm disappointed it doesn't look like they'll use those 'Eating' trees. But the more I think about it, the more I'm happy they didn't, because that would put more problems for getting out of the situation than getting in. Surely the demons, if they're intelligent, would know how to handle such things.

As such, the eating trees would only be dangerous if they made a mistake, Ray severely outmaneuvered them, or they had the idiot ball.

A Deus Ex Machina like this is a much better solution, imo.

So long as the story stays consistent within its own rules and no one get an obvious idiot ball, it's good in my book.
