  A Deadly Education A more mature 'magical high school' novel. The setting is deliberately irrational, but the characters take measured actions to achieve their goals. Good, fun read.

I'd like to put forth an anti-recommendation for this one. I had typed out a explanation, but as it turns out the linked goodreads page [[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3585134911][has a great review that very precisely sums up my frustrations with a work that I really wanted to like.]]
