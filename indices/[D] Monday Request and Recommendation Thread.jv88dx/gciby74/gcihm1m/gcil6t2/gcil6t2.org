I think the reviews criticizing Novik of racism in her work (even if they don't go so far as to accuse Novik herself of racism) are really far off the mark. The main character has a very transactional view of relationships as what is clearly a coping mechanism, not as some sort of proxy for denigrating other cultures. Yes, people from other cultures are shown in negative lights, but given the very global nature of the novel's characters, that was practically impossible to avoid. Accusing this novel of being racist when its entire point is to demonstrate the unjust power of entrenched, exclusionary ingroups is to completely miss the point.

Maybe if this had been Novik's debut there would be more reason for suspicion, but her Temeraire series is a pretty pointed critique of imperialism and racism (both in the magical and mundane senses).
