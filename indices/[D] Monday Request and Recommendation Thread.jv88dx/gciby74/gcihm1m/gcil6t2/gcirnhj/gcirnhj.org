My prior enjoyment of the Temeraire novels is one of the reasons I wanted to like this work, and at the same time of of the reasons I was eventually so disappointed with it.

Perhaps it's the case that this specific work hits closer to home as the character and I are of similar backgrounds (which itself is another reason I really wanted to like it - representation in fiction really is nice), but it's only skin-deep at best. To take a line from that review that perfectly encapsulates what I'm not sufficiently eloquent to say: "her Indian heritage is a veneer placed on top of a character who is otherwise just a default white protagonist." The "diversity" depicted in this work is written in an incredibly orientalist and imperialist manner - claiming that a character of one background yet characterized by unrelated tropes shows a basic lack of any research or respect given to the topic at hand, that speaks louder to me than other elements.

I realize that this may sound like strange pedantry from someone who's too close to the topic at hand, but reading this novel was a very dissonant experience, where at every turn I found the details to be in opposition to the greater themes, and as such, despite my best efforts, I couldn't enjoy it.
