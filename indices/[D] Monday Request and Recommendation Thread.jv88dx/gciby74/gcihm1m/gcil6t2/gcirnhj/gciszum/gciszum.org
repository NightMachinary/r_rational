I think you went into this work looking for the chinese students to be chinese, and the arabic students to be arabic, etc. but in the context of this work, the chinese students are chinese /international students/ and the arabic students are arabic /international students/. To the extent that this story is imperialistic, it's that it does recognize the inherently imperialistic nature of modern schooling and globalization. The students resemble many of the foreign students I met in college myself, with different native tongues but western sensibilities. There is a significant difference between your a average, say, indian, and the type of indian that grows up learning foreign languages and consuming foreign media, with the backing necessary to enter a prestegious international school.

In fact, it explicitly points out towards the start of the work that the scholomance's anglocentrism is a direct consequence of how european imperialism affected other populations, and that resurgent foreign enclaves are actually working to subvert that.

And while I would agree with some criticism that the main character is designed to be easy to self insert into (dark witch? Noted several times in the story to be athletic and attractive, but without paying attention to any specific features? Intimidating aura? Catches the eye of the school's most popular boy by acting aloof?) I would take issue with calling her a default /white/ protagonist, especially since she'd singled out among her own childhood community for being nonwhite.
