Couple of short things I wrote:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/jtipl7/timeless_love/][Timeless Love]], a post-canon HPMOR flash-fic. How would HPMOR!Harry react to being dosed with a love potion?

[[https://www.reddit.com/user/Roxolan/comments/hthwp9/extra_shiny_an_ai_dungeon_luminosity_fanfic/][Extra Shiny]], an early attempt to write GPT-3-assisted rationalfic that immediately turned into a rationalfic parody. I kept track of which part were written by me and which by the AI, which I found interesting.
