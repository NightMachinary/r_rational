Even so, that's not the standard terminology, and there are perfectly good ways to describe deciding on something strongly in advance (perhaps, say, "committed to doing x"...)

I get your intended meaning, I just really don't like the phrasing.

ETA: In particular, "precommitment" being Odysseus tying himself to the mast rather than just deciding he really doesn't want to jump into the ocean is a valuable distinction to have, and watering it down in this way seems unhelpful.
