I've surprised myself this November by, on the whole, keeping up with NaNoWriMo, and I think part of what is helping with that is, 1) focusing less on writing something /good/ and more on just writing, and 2) publishing what I write online so that I can track both my wordcounts and people's engagement.

All that said, [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37261/to-hold-dominion][To Hold Dominion]] is a xianxia-inspired (though not particularly xianxia-esque) high fantasy story about three characters from different worlds, and a mysterious tournament. I'm not writing it with any specific rationalist bent other than my own predilection for rational stories... Anyway, I'll copy/paste the Royal Road summary below, which might give a better idea.

Cassiel is a student in the Valley of the Crystal Sun, doomed to obscurity and neglect because of her failure to fully integrate the vaunted Sunlight Crystals.

Iyojin is a studious Weaver in the Paperhall, working to complete her new Chitin weapon in order to graduate, even as pressures mount.

Lairas is a wanderer and a thief, and has just gotten away with the biggest theft of his life - stealing a Spirit of Slaughter from Wellspring Barrow.

Their lives are about to become entangled, as each seeks achievement, insight, and safety in the mysterious Tournament - an event that will pit warriors from across the continent of Inara against each other for glory.
