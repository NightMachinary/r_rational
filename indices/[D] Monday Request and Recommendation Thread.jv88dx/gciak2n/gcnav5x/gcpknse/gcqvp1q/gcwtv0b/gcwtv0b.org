If you're talking about how it was handled, then I'd agree. I don't mind a show having a more politically focused aspect to it, but only if it's done right and not forcing in today's issues. For example, Star Wars the Clone Wars actually had decent politics in it, especially towards the end of season 6 with the banker clans and what not. Can't think of any other at the top of my head though.
