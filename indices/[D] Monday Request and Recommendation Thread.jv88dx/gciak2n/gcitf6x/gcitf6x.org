I know I'm a one-note wonder on this subject, but I found the Commonweal novels by Graydon Saunders to scratch this itch. The first book is pretty much "military SF in a fantasy setting" tropes plot-wise in order to introduce you to the setting, but the second book is sorcery vocational school for a group of adults making a career change into being wizardly.
