not only that, but the island survival part of the book is a good example of early rational fiction. It clearly shows a smart and practical protagonist acting rationally to solve his problems, and only failing due to lack of knowledge, not lack of logical thinking.

I would even go so far as to say that "island survival" is the BEST medium to show a rational, or even rationalist character, because they exist in a sort of isolated vacuum without other people, just them vs nature. Its the easiest medium to show "rational thinking vs practical problem" kind of a plot.
