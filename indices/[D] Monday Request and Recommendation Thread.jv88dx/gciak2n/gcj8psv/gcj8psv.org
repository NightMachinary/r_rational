The best part about Somebody that I Used Tahno is that it ends, satisfyingly. Most plot threads are tied up neatly and the ones that are left aren't big enough that it's annoying.

I really liked the romance too. The characters have their own priorities and motivations and the romance serves to deepen their actual bonds instead of becoming something separate from their roles in the story. It's an overall satisfying package, highly recommend.

Oh and as a rec for your request, if you're able to tolerate the initial inconsistencies in Ar'Kendrythist, it gets really into magic research. Granted it's not really magic grad-school, and there's a few existential threats that get in the way of magic research. It's more like magic professor, except the professor is foreign and has really specialized knowledge. Later on in the story the protagonist works with archmages who are leaders in their own field to research different types of magic or figure out ways to gain spells easier and cheaper. He even joins magic school as a grad student of sorts, and takes classes and does terrible in some and well in others. Even later on he works directly with other archmages to develop new spells, and sometimes gives lectures to other archmages.
