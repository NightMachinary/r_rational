That's a weird fic. A major part of the story is the protagonist being isekai'd into another dimension and passing a bunch of classical music(think Mozart, Beethoven, etc) as his own. Which is fine, do what you gotta do, but the guy does it without expressing a hint of guilt or anything, ever. On top of that he's so smug and proud about all the compliments and accolades he gets. And he NEVER tries to compose his own songs or anything even adapt an existing song a bit, it's ALWAYS plagiarism.

As I read it I couldn't shake this feeling that I was being wooshed, that i had missed an important detail. It was only when I stopped reading the story and thought about it a bit that I realized that I was going through a sort of culture shock. I just couldn't picture someone being so proud of being a plagiarist the way he was, there had to be another element that I was missing.

Like I said, super weird.
