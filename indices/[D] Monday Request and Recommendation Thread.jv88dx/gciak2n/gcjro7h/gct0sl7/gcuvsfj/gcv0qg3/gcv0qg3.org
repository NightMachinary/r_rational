That's an interesting idea. A couple of counterpoints off the top of my head:

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle][Worth the Candle]]. I don't get the impression that anybody in the story has any problem with “stealing” intellectual property.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merchant_Princes][The Merchant Princes]] series. Again, nobody seems to think that importing intellectual property is a big deal.

I don't think I (a left coast American) would have a problem ripping off somebody else's work in another universe, though I would feel weird about accepting praise for it.
