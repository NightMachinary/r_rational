Funny you should say that. In [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/comments/jvchyw/any_cultural_differences_depending_on_an_author/][a recent post]] on [[/r/WormFanfic]] a Russian-speaking poster wrote:

  Recently I've been reading nice [time travel] novel, '[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21322/re-trailer-trash][re: trailer trash]]'. ...

  What surprised me, despite of the fact MC had issues with money, she didn't have the idea of stealing someone's intellectual property.

  She didn't 'invent' Eminem songs lyrics, she didn't write Harry Potter.

  In lot of russian fics with similar plot, MC pretty often does that with absolutely no issues.

  I don't know if it's authors unique position, or is it US authors general approach regards stealing intellectual property.

  It reminds me of a discussion on a Chinese-American forum that I once came across. The posters were saying that life in China was based on the principles "Homo homini lupus est", "every man for himself", etc. There was a good chance that your coworkers, your superiors, your neighbors or even random strangers would try to take advantage of you at the first opportunity. You had to be ruthless in order to succeed.
