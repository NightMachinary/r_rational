First, a meta recommendation: If you have a library card but haven't been going to the library (for obvious reasons, natch) [[https://www.overdrive.com/][Overdrive/Libby]] are services that let you 'check out' virtual books from your library. Wait lines can be fairly long, but the trick there is to just place multiple holds at once, and then at some point the books will start to roll ib.

Their book discovery service is pretty mediocre, so I would recommend setting up a GoodReads profile, tracking the books you've read, and seeing what they recommend you.

Now, for actual pieces of fiction:

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32758901-all-systems-red][All Systems Red]] - Murderbot discovers what it means to have free will. Humorous and well written. Covers a number of rational-adjacent topics, but the main character is deliberately written to be irrational.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50548197-a-deadly-education][A Deadly Education]] A more mature 'magical high school' novel. The setting is deliberately irrational, but the characters take measured actions to achieve their goals. Good, fun read.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/esquestria-the-house-of-the-sun-a-pony-cultist-experience.71721/#post-16913694][Esquestria: The House of the Sun]] Pony cultist quest. Endearing characters, a simulationist take on events (as per the dice rolling), and an author fond of eldritch horror make this a worthwhile read.
