Volume 10 of the Japanese Light Novel series So I'm a Spider, So What? just released earlier today(and it was damn good), and I'd like to recommend it here. Based on previous threads, I see a lot of people like the typical JP isekai setting you always see in manga and anime, although it's unfortunate how most of them tend to be horrible.

I'm really impressed by Spider though, I feel it's the only JP isekai that does the normal isekai story well. Isekai is like the junk food of fantasy imo, the setting and elements are pretty cool, but they're usually done incredibly shallow, with most of them just copying the same tropes and cliches, with very few actually putting in the proper world building, character building, and personality to make it good. Spider is an incredible isekai that really utilizes every element of the typical isekai story properly.

Before I talk more about it, I will say that some may be divisive about it. It starts off as a litrpg monster reincarnation story, but later on it moves away from both the litrpg grinding and monster elements, and some people may be bothered by it. If the fact that it doesn't stay as a litrpg grinding monster story, then I'm sure you'll really like Spider, because the story is fantastic.

Whenever I read or watch an isekai, I'm always very cynical and judgemental, and realize that the worldbuilding is shallow or makes no sense. Questions like 'why is there a litrpg system in the world?' and 'why was the mc even reincarnated and why do they have cheats?' and 'why is it always a hero vs. a demon lord?', tropes and cliches that a lot of series cling to without any proper purpose or reason, it's just there. In Spider, every element of the story has a purpose. There's an important and logical reason why the MC and her classmates were isekai'd, and why they have cheats, and why the MC even reincarnates into a spider. There's a reason why there's a litrpg System governing the World. There's a reason why there are humans, elves, and demons, and there's a reason why there's always a human Hero and a demon Demon Lord, and all these elements are crucial to the overarching story and play into it in very satisfying ways as the mystery of the world is slowly unraveled.

Story elements aside, it has a lot of personality, charm, and soul. [[https://imgur.com/a/SrCiFZy][Here's]] a little excerpt from the latest volume, and the author exudes personality and emotion into the writing, making the novel feel so fresh compared to the dry, exposition-heavy, and boring isekai novels and MCs you usually see. The writing is very balanced. It's not always humorous, the author knows how to write comedic moments and tones, but the character development and emotional scenes are handled exceptionally as well. There's a lot of serious, intelligent, and grim characters too, and the writing captures those moods perfectly. The ending of volume 10 blew me away with the MC's revelation and conviction, but I won't reveal that here as its MAJOR spoilers.

The story is really impressive too. The author respects the readers' intelligence and doesn't do exposition dumps or trite plot points, the way the story progresses, reveals, and misdirects is phenomenal, I'll just leave it at that. The characters are exceptional and all are very well-written, with many being foils to each other or making excellent use of the isekai setting. The MC has been fighting for survival ever since she was born, and through those struggles has the ability to change the world. Another classmate is born as a human prince and serves as commentary on the generic isekai protagonist, clinging to the ideals of his past life and wanting to change the world without sacrifice, except he doesn't have the strength or conviction to carry it out. Another classmate, best friend of the human prince reincarnation, reincarnates as a girl and has to struggle between the identity of her past life and her current one, as well as deal with her ever changing feelings for her best friend(who is unfortunately generic and thus oblivious). This character is actually written and handled exceptionally well, as light novels are notoriously bad at writing women. And so on and so on. Spider takes the typical elements of the generic isekai setting and crafts an absolutely stunning story.

The story is surprisingly rational too. There's a lot of bits about the world and how things work. In this volume the Demon Lord orders her Demon subordinates to put down a rebellion, and the novel goes over how despite there being a litrpg System, virtually everybody has stats in the several hundreds range, with people having stats in the thousands being pretty much legendary warriors, so battles between two armies will be virtually equal. The MC, despite occasionally being a bit goofy, is very competent and tries to optimize her stat and skill growth, especially so when she's training Vampy.

So if you like JP isekais and aren't bothered by the fact that the story shifts away from level grinding or being a monster, I'd very highly recommend this story. I personally think there's no JP isekai better than So I'm a Spider, So What?

The last time I talked about Spider here, some mentioned that the price might be a bit high, as its a light novel series. There are some ...easily accessible methods, if price is a concern for you.

Additionally, the series has some really [[https://imgur.com/a/M5HYfIh][adorable]] illustrations.
