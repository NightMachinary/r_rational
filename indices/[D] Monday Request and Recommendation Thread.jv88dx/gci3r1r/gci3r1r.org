I saw the movie [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3118452/][Circle]] (on Netflix) some time ago and really liked it.

  Held captive and faced with their imminent executions, fifty strangers are forced to choose the one person among them who deserves to live.

Essentially a group of strangers from a pretty wide cross-section of society (race, gender, sexual orientation, wealth, etc.) must convince each other who to kill for one of them to stay alive. They're stuck in a room, each in a small circle, and can't move. They can only interact by talking, so we (as the audience) have to judge each of them based on their values and biases.

The only thing I didn't really like was the end should have been left more open-ended. But other than that the movie was enjoyable.

I've been reading [[https://mangadex.org/title/41161/gorae-byul-the-gyeongseong-mermaid][Gorae Byul - The Gyeongseong Mermaid]] and I really like it. It's a manhwa (Korean comic), but I feel like it's a good fit here, mainly because of the characters. Similar to the above, we really examine their goals and motives.

  "If the life that you had regained, was one that I had breathed back into you... Is it too much to hope for you to love me back with that life?" The year is 1926, in Japan-occupied Joseon. 17-year-old Soo-a is an illiterate handmaiden working for the household of a prominent Japanese collaborator. One day, she discovered an injured young man lying unconscious at the beach, an independence activist called Eui-hyeon. The sweet and innocent Soo-a nursed him back to health, and Eui-hyeon told her the tale of the "Little Mermaid", a princess of the sea who saved a prince from his death. Having fallen in love with Eui-hyeon, Soo-a was determined to meet him once again. But she knew not then, of the fate that awaited the "Little Mermaid" on her quest to reunite with her beloved.

It's very grounded, and shows Korea under Japanese rule, the Korean independence movement, and the people caught in between.
