I sprinted through [[https://fanfiction.net/s/7679074/1/The-Dragon-King-s-Temple][The Dragon King's Temple]] recommended [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/jqz6xm/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/gbqyjif/][last week]], as well as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12063472/1/What-the-Cat-Dragged-In][What the Cat Dragged In]] by the same author. Aside from generally good writing, worldbuilding, characterization, plot, etc, I want to highlight one thing I enjoyed about them:

#+begin_quote
  KRYAL'S CROSSOVER CREED: Equal Opportunity Awesome, and its prerequisites: equal opportunity competence, amazement, and involvement. (Applies to non-crossovers as well.)
#+end_quote

Does anyone have recommendations for crossovers where both sides are treated fairly, the problems they face straddle the lines between the two established worlds so both can contribute, and so on? Most fics that I see tend to tell a story about /one/ side of the crossover while incidentally including the other, but Kryal seemed to (mostly) merge them into a seamless whole.
