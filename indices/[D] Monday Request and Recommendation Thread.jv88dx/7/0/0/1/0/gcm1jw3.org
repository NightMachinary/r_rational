Yeah that's more or less what I meant - the translation is very "keikkaku means plan" / "call a rabbit a smeerp". Pretty much all of the stuff they left untranslated has perfectly serviceable translations, so it just ends up making the thing hard to read.

It also doesn't help that at some point they redid the first 25 chapters in 5 chapter chunks, so you have to go five chapters before you get the annotations.
