  I haven't finished the second series (...) Fitz keeps ruminating on his mistakes and takes steps to fix them, and then falls back to the same self-destructive behaviors that put him there.

There's a plot reason why Fitz is stuck in that rut in the second trilogy. The end of book three heals that problem, so I'm curious to see if he grows more as a person in the third trilogy.
