I'm pretty sure /Blindsight/ applies, Siri Keeton has a lot of other issues, but he's a professional established in his field. Heinlein had a few that are good middle age characters: /The Moon is a Harsh Mistress/ and /The Cat Who Walks Through Walls/ have middle and late middle aged main characters with an established life and second career. Two more transhuman instances are /The Quantum Thief/ trillogy and /Accelerando/. A SCi-fi-ish fantasy or Lovecraftian sci-fi the Laundry files (YMMV but by Stross like accelerando) especially after book 2 deals with a Hacker/Necromancer/Spook working as a troubleshooter/middle management, with an special mention to /The Annihilation Score/ which focuses on the PhD wife of the usual main Character dealing with the severe emotional trauma of her role in wetwork and her spooky effects on her husband while continuing to climb the greasy pole (yes they are both spooky spies).
