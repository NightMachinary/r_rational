Any recommendations for SF/F novels whose protagonists are in their 30s/40s and, like, secure in their lives? I know that's sort of an antipattern in the genre but I'm curious to see if there's a body of work that is rooted in self-knowledge and the sort of steadiness that seems to be so rare in the teen/early-20s protagonists.
