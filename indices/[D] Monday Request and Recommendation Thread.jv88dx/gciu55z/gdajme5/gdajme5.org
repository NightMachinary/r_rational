Malazan Book of the Fallen perhaps? To be fair, there is basically everything in there, you can have a protagonist who's lived through the ice age! Doesn't get much more settled than that!

But yeah jokes aside a lot of the characters are mature adults, not settled in the slice of life way mostly as the books tend to focus mostly on wanderers, soldiers and people in times of great societal change (a feeble attempt to cram the awesome, humongous storyline into some sort of category) but there is a distinct lack of YA-ness even in the young adults that do play a role (it takes like five chapters in the first book for the young officer the story follows early on to get murdered in an alley).

A lot of the characters are fairly sure of their place in life, and settled in their mindset - responsible adults surviving in a dangerous world, basically.\\
FYI the books get very dark at times, but they are also /excellent./
