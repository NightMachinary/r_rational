The [[https://www.amazon.com/Quarter-Share-Traders-Golden-Clipper-ebook/dp/B00AMO7VM4][Quarter Share]] series gets there eventually - by the second or thirdish book the MC is in his 30s and secure in his life.

The story is very slice of life, and the setting is kinda Horatio Hornblower In Space.

There's also the [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K4I391A?ref_=dbs_m_mng_rwt_calw_tkin_0&storeType=ebooks][EarthCent Ambassador]] series, which again starts out with a 20something protagonist who's in her 30's or 40's within a couple of books thanks to time skips.

Also fairly slice of life, but in this case the books remind me of the more laid back Star Trek episodes - there's a focus on dealing with aliens, particularly because she's an ambassador from Earth on a trading station.
