Am I wrong or is the fact that Arthur plagiarized most of his works in WtC definitely a point of contention? I can distinctly remember Juniper and Raven express negative feelings about it, and possibly others as well. The idea is that Uther is an otherworldly, mythically perfect being, but the more they learn about him the more the myth is tarnished by reality, with his unapologetic plagiarism a part of that.

Additionally, Arthur at least had the decency to make his works adaptations, fitting to the time he found himself in. Star Wars becomes a medieval knights tale, for example. And he was doing it purely from memory, so his knowledge and skill as a writer was essential to the stories being viable works or art. Just knowing the plot of Romeo and Juliet is not enough to right a good book about it. In contrast, in Throne of Magical Arcana the MC just inexplicably has a library in his head with perfect copies of an untold number of books in it, including sheet music for countless classical songs that he goes on to recreate exactly and pass off as his own. It's different.
