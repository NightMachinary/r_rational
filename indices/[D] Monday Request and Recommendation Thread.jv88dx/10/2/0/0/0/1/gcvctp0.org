Honestly, if I got heaped with praise for plagiarised achievements, I suspect it'd be pretty hard to not feel smug for having pulled off such a successful trick. Objectively you wouldn't deserve nearly as much praise, but subjectively you'd be justifying it to yourself unless you put actual effort into keeping yourself humble.
