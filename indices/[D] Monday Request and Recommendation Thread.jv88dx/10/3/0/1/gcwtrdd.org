Have you ever watched this? [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhS4a11jZOg]]

It had a huge like to dislike ratio, before that got removed.

To summarise - The Legend of Korra is a bad show attempting to cash-in on the popularity of the original.

It's crew and humour are bland and forced as hell compared to the cast from the original series and it's better than the aspects from the original show that doesn't either care about it or wouldn't have significantly and improved the original show that much.

You can still love it and it has quite a few moments, but there's no way in hell that it holds a candle light to the original in terms of overall quality or someone else put it:

- /I walked into this video like, “I love the Legend of Korra, but somehow, this video will probably still manage to convince me it sucks.” I walked out like, “I still love the Legend of Korra, but now I know IT SUCKS!!!”/
