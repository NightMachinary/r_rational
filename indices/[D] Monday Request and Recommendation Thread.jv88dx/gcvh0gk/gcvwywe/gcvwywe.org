I suggest you use a tool like [[https://redditsearch.io/][Pushshift Reddit Search]] to search the contents of every comment on [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. (I frequently use the version at [[https://camas.github.io/reddit-search/][camas.github.io]] because it has more search refinement options, and it allows me to search through my own comment history.)

According to that tool, the phrase "Baru Cormorant" has been mentioned in a total of 43 comments on this sub.
