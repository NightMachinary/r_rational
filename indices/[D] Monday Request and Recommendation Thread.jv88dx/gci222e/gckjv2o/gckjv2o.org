If you can stand what is probably one of the worst translations ever applied to an otherwise excellent work, maybe try [[https://dreamsofjianghu.ca/%e4%bf%ae%e7%9c%9f%e4%b8%96%e7%95%8c-world-of-cultivation/][World of Cultivation]]?

It's a great story that's totally let down by its translation - but somehow, that doesn't entirely stop it. The MC is a fairly standard cultivator with amnesia (he lost his memories about two years ago), but he's driven to optimize what resources he has in order to get stronger.

The story starts out as almost a cookie clicker type thing - the MC has X fields of spiritual grains which he needs to take care of in order to generate Y income using Z spiritual arts - but the plot quickly smacks him in the face and forces him to scramble to keep up.
