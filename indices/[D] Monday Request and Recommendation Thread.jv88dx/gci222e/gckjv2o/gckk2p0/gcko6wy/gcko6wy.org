In the version I've just started reading, the translation is technically proficient... except that they've chosen not to translate a bunch of terms, saying what they mean in the footnotes once and relying on the reader to remember what they all mean. I'm going to try using an extension (Word Replacer II) to replace those terms with English versions, and I'll see how that pans out.

EDIT: Nope, I've fallen at the first chapter, where /jie/ can be translated as either singular or plural and I'm not sure I understand what some of the other terms mean, even with the footnotes. A great disappointment.
