I thoroughly recommend [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/reverend-insanity/][Reverend Insanity]], the first Cultivation story I've gotten into. The premise is that an evil powerful Cultivator (originally from Earth) is finally struck down by the righteous, just as he manages to get a reincarnation power, so he has the advantage of 500 years hindsight to maximise his paltry resources and get ahead of his rivals. In spite of the OP-sounding premise, his every success feels hard-fought as he navigates between penury, cultivating with his average talent and keeping below the threshold of being targeted by stronger families and institutions for all his outrageous deeds.

The whole thing genuinely feels interwoven and dynamic, the MC desperately struggling to keep ahead of everyone he's abused and slighted. It's like Worm in that aspect, every action having consequences, things that happen in early chapters coming back 100 chapters later. Each chapter is very hard to predict, there's all kinds of 2nd and 3rd level games being played. The other characters act reasonably; MC has to expend effort to push them into a corner and they'll strike back if they can. They have their own goals too.

The whole thing is very very long. If you've ever sighed at seeing a story that's under 100K words because why even bother... there is no such problem here! The translation is good I guess, though I have nothing to compare it too.

On the other hand, the MC is unrepentantly evil. It makes sense for his character, moulded by 500 years of an ultra-Darwinistic world with its own inequality-rich magic system. So if you're on the lookout for an even slightly good MC who'll hesitate before ritually sacrificing a young girl to be eaten by a bear in order to get stronger, this isn't for you. He's much the same as HPMOR Voldemort. If there's a moral of the story, it's: "always go your own way and follow your ambition, no matter the consequences for anyone else." If there's a single theme that stands out it's :"Organizations, tribes and countries are all parasites, trying to lure you in and subjugate you: there is no true right or wrong, only strong or weak". Now I think about it, this might be veiled criticism of the CCP. Overall, the story isn't pointless edge, it's heartfelt, steelmanned and genuinely insightful IMO.
