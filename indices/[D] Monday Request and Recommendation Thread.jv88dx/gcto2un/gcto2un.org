Im looking for some rational, or better, rationalist stories of the "survival" theme.

I can do anything from deserted island survival, wilderness survival, space survival etc. Especially Man vs Nature kind of a book, in which the protag must rationally utilise his knowledge and skils to survive, create primitive technology etc.

Basically Rationalist Minecraft/Rationalist Robinson Crusoe.
