I'd recommend checking out The First Law trilogy by Joe Abercrombie.

A few of the protagonists there are, well, perhaps mature is the right word. They certainly know who they are at the time the series starts, though some of them are trying really hard to deny it.

It's brilliant, the characters are great, and it has the absolutely best depiction of a barbarian in fantasy literature history.

Do be advised, though, that it comes with every trigger warning possible, which will still not prepare you for how grimdark and gritty it is.
