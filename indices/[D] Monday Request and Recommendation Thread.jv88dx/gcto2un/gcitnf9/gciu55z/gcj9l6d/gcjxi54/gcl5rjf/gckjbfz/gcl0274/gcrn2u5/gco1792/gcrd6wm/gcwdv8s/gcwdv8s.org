"Secure in their lives" is a bit of a tall order, since characters need to want /something/. I think the protagonist of the Skylark series has the steadiness you're talking about. There's a few unsettled aspects of his life (e.g. a romantic plot), but he's very sure of who he is, which I think might be the property you're looking for.

In general I think a lot of older sci-fi where the character is a professor will have this property.
