/Alloy of Law/ and the other second-era Mistborn books (by Brandon Sanderson). Wax is in the process of settling down from his adventuring adolescence. He is starting to take his role as a Lord more seriously by undoing the damage that his neglect has caused, but discovers a new case which highlights the tension between his time as an independent lawman from the frontier and his central role in the city's economy and high society.
