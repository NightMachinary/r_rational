"Secure in their lives" would be hard to find unless you're specifically asking for slice-of-life. But you can look at Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan Saga, which starts with Aral Vorkosigan and Cordelia Naismith in their 30's/40's. It then continues with the next generation for long enough that they, too, have whole books as fully adults.

Eh, "read Bujold" is basically an evergreen rec at this point anyways.

You can also look for Asimov, I don't think he ever wrote any character younger than thirty. I guess that's why Robot City was done by other people.

You'll also find that the "steadiness" you're looking for in character written as 40-somethings is as much an illusion in fiction as it is in reality. Because let's be honest here: none of us 40+ know what we're doing any more than we did when younger. We just fake it better and better.
