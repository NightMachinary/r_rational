Funny story: Bujold is how I met my wife, because it was in her OkCupid profile. So yeah, I've definitely read everything Bujold. (Even if Penric Deals With A Plague was just too goddamn on the nose.)

But they are in fact among the perfect examples, because the kind of /supported/ confidence that they bring to the page is really relaxing to me, and I'm glad that she brought that level of confidence and maturity to the other characters over time. (Ivan. <3 )

But yeah, "read Bujold" is definitely an evergreen rec! And I'd say that "read Jemisin" might also qualify. And of course Marie Brennan and Jo Walton have written books from that perspective too.
