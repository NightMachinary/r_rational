Well, I haven't seen that particular video before, but that was kind of my opinion on legend of korra.

It's an alright show. They get most of the combat right, and republic city itself is pretty cool the way only steampunk '20s can be. But I don't think it's as good or as deep as the first avatar and it doesn't give us as much to think about.

I'll give it a watch though and see if that video changes my mind.
