This is actually an anti-recc, because this is what bothers me about [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20644262/chapters/49023794][snipers solve 99% of problems]], a Harry Potter/Full Metal Alchemist crossover. I do actually mostly like this fic -- the characterization and writing are mostly solid, the dialogue is fun, etc. But I get really bothered by how consistently it portrays the FMA characters as smarter and more mature than the HP characters.

And like, look, I get it. Harry Potter suffers from a lot of worldbuilding issues and characters do get handed some pretty big idiot balls. Everybody has read the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/8kr0n1/why_harry_potter_needs_a_gun/][Why Harry Potter needs a gun]] copypasta and HP:MOR. But c'mon, you're just gonna let the FMA characters completely smoke the HP characters? Just off the top of my head, they imply (it hasn't been tested) that they'll just snipe Voldemort to buy themselves some time while he gets a new body, Hawkeye throws off imperio on her first try, Ed beats up Moody and Snape simultaneously, and Ed and Al /create an array to turn off magic/ (I haven't actually watched FMA, I think that one is canon?). Like, if you're gonna curbstomp one setting so hard, why do you need 200,000 words to do it?

It's like, Dumbledore has to be explicitly told "hey, even if we can't kill Voldemort permanently, it took him 13 years to get a new body last time, so why don't we kill him again to buy some time?" Like, in canon, they didn't do that because Voldemort is guerilla fighter who can match Dumbledore 1:1, not because /they didn't think of it/.

That's not even getting into the more minor ways HP characters are dumb, like the teens getting their wands confiscated by Ed multiple times (they try to Obliviate Al for some dumb reason, I forget), or being completely fooled by Mustang's "oh I'm a harmless politician routine", or being confused/horrified by the idea of legal prostitution (yeah, IDK, that one was weird).

(Also, I just realized this fic is 200,000 words long and haven't even made it to Hogwarts yet. Jesus.)
