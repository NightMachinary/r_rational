This may be a bit meta for this thread but is there any good way to search the text of all the comments of the previous threads?

Say I want to see when someone mentioned The Monster Baru Cormorant, searching google usually only gets me to threads about the topic, and doesn't seem to index the comments properly. I often want to look back at a recommendation and I might remember only a few words and I can't

Should I ask this in the Friday Open Thread instead?
