I'd like to third the recommendation for '[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/somebody-that-i-used-tahno-a-lok-si.670771/#post-49799620][Somebody That I Used Tahno]]', recommended here a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/je3ans/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/g9lsiho/][month ago]]. Made my way through it and found it to be quite a page-turner, with character behavior broadly reasonable given their motivations, abilities, and dispositions. Fave part would probably be the slow-burn romance. Currently reading "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13576158/1/Theogony][Theogony]]" -- again, not /rational/, as only a tightly constrained embodiment of rage could be, but well written and I think enjoyable for fans of Worm and the God of War series. It's also got the implausible "all ye olde mythes are /real/" thing going on, but that's a trope I happen to enjoy.

I also have a *request* for a recommendation: I've read a number of magical elementary school stories (e.g. Harry Potter), a few magical high school stories (e.g. Year of the Griffin), and even a magical college story (e.g. The Magicians). Are there any good magical /grad school/ stories, esp. at the doctoral level? Dealing with magical dissertation committees, magical publishing, magical lecturing, a more mature, level-headed approach to magical relationships, etc. Something that has [[http://phdcomics.com/comics/most_popular.php][Piled Higher and Deeper]] energy, e.g. the describing that trope-y first-college-class scene where our fish-out-of-water protagonist looks around the lecture hall and sees the mysterious snake sorcerer cloaked in shadow, a gleaming, armored paladin, a princely middle eastern stereotype adorned in jewels and scimitars, a scantily clad tree nymph, etc. etc. but from the perspective of their seen-it-all-before grad student instructor who just wants to make it through this first lecture to get back to grant writing and experiments. Maybe also something with a harder magic system able to invert Clarke's Third Law (“sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology”).

Alternatively, any (magical or non-magical) fiction that features adult characters experiencing grad school, or else a magical school story told from the perspective of an adult non-student (a groundskeeper, a teacher, etc.). Unseen Academicals comes to mind, but I felt that to be more a story taking place at a university than a story for which the university setting was essential.
