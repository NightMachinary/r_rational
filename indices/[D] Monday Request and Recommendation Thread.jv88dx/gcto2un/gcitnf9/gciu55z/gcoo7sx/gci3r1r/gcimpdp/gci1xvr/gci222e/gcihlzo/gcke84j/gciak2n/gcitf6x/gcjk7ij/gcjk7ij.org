I felt the second book to be such a slog and I barely finished it. I don't know about you but after the ten thousandth description of the exact details and measurements of what they're doing I was bored out of my mind.

Like, as an idea I love it. You get a group of once in a million mages and what's the best use of them, civil engineering of course. It's a fantastic decision.

However, I've never felt more than this story could have shaved thousands if not tens of thousands of words by just fucking drawing it. It's just so bloody dull to read, and there's no payoff for it. Nothing ever comes of knowing that they had to do it by 3m instead of 4m, hell even all the fancy materials they get to use is just, I don't know porn for an engineer about what they'd do if they didn't have a budget? Like, wow it's going to last 10,000 years instead of 1,000 what an exciting thing to tell me, are we going to experience that difference? Is it ever going to matter to the plot or even to the characters? It's like he read the Wikipedia article (or more likely a dozen deeper books) about canals and then wanted to tell me all about that with a practical example. Half of the book could almost be submitted as proof for a civil engineer graduate that they can design a canal from scratch.

The first one was pretty good [well, at least it was interesting/different enough to make up for its flaws] and I don't know about the rest after that since I stopped after finishing the second. It took me two months to read the second one and six days for the first (and tbh the first is already written in an almost obnoxiously difficult manner, it reminds me of reading Robinson Crusoe or something). Compared that to ASOIAF: [[https://i.imgur.com/RXIHpDy.png]]

This is what I wrote in my own notes section on my book history after finishing it:

This is like reading a civil engineers manual, who tf thought this would make for an exciting and interesting story. I get that it's a good way of demonstrating how the characters can really impact the world by massively terraforming and causing huge economic changes but still story benefit do we get out of fifty pages of measurements. If he wanted to do all this he should have just put in pictures. There's a reason irl engineers use blueprints not describe stuff because describing stuff takes forever and is impossible to picture. Also I feel like the constant mention of metals and compounds is meant to be bragging about how amazing they are but he uses it so liberally and they got a house from an elemental with zero cost so why not just do that with whole villages I don't understand why no one would try to do it before on a larger scale. On top of that though they talk about how low the chances of death are they don't talk enough about how lucky there were 5 untrained adult wizards lying about at the exact same time
