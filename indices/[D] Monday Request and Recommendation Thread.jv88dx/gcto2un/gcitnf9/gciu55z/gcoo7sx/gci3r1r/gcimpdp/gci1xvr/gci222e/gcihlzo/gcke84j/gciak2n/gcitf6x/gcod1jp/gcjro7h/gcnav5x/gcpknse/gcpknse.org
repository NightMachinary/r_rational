Not really, IMO. I've watched Korra and also read 'Somebody That I Used Tahno', and feel that both are slightly above average but not great.

Republic City and the bending is all portrayed in the show, and IMO those visuals are the best part of it. In the fic though, lots of the description and interactions in the story assume you know what's going on. It starts in media res /and/ in a flashback /and/ with an unreliable narrator, which is much harder without knowing the plot of the story beforehand. Korra's setting and plot also has idiosyncrasies that the fic just rolls with, which are easier to absorb in a visual medium (eg, like giant mecha exist but guns don't).
