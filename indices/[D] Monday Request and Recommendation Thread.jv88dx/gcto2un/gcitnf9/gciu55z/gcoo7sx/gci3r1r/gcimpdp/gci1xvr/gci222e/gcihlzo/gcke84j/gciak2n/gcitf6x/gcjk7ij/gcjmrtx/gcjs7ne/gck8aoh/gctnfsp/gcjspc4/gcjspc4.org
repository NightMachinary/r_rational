I don't hate Crusoe, actually I quite like it, it was just what comes to mind when I think of nonstandard English. Even looking back at it it wasn't that hard tbh but it was the first time I read anything like that so it was difficult for me even as an avid reader.

It was a book that took a while to read at the same pace and grip me because first I had to do so with the language then the content. I felt similar with some of the language choices in Commonweal, especially the sentence structure.

Could not tell you what age I was, at least 10 I'd guess whereas I'm now 26 so take it with that context

Definitely realise that wasn't clear in my first post
