That last bit they do actually talk about, but maybe not until the third book. Also, they're not all untrained (one of them is trained enough that he has to drop out) and they're not all adults (Zora's underage).

But the fan description of the books is literally "A civil engineering manual lost in a fairytale", so I'm not disagreeing with the main thrust of your statement in the slightest.
