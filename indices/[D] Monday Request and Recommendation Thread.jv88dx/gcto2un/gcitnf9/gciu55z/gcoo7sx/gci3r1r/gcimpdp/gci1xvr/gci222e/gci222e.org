Anybody got some good munchkin stories? I liked both of the Naruto fics I see here all the time, the need to become stronger and the waves arisen. I think because naruto is easily munchkinable. I don't even need strictly-rational books, I once read a munchkined erotica book. So really anything you got for me would be great.

If y'all have any recommendations that'd be great! I like Harry Potter as well and I think I read a minchkined fic of that? But I'm not sure. In general I like Harry Potter fanfiction though.
