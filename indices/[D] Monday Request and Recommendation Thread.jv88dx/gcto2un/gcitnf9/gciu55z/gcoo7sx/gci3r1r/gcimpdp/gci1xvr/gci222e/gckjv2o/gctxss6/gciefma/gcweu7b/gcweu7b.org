You might be thinking of Harry Potter and the Natural 20 for the munchkined fic. If so, The Two Year Emperor is another one in a similar "D&D rules as written" genre. (You'll need to poke around a bit to find the original version, the one on Amazon had all the D&D terms changed for copyright reasons.) There's also Erfworld, if you're down to read a comic.

You might also enjoy some of the time loop Naruto fics. I think people on this sub like Time Braid? Someone's probably already recommended Mother of Learning to you; it's probably the best of the time loop stories.

Dungeon Keeper Ami is my favorite munchkin story of all time. I read it without having seen Sailor Moon /or/ played Dungeon Keeper, and it was really good.
