Having just watched The Vault, I'm going to disrecommend it. The characters are not just slow, they're [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][Holywood zombies]]. Most of the runtime serves no purpose, it's a god-damn mystery box. And the ending was a cowardly mystery box, leaving most questions unresolved and not building upon the rest of the show at all despite the narration trying very hard to pretend otherwise.
