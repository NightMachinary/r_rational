So, I think this might be by the same creators as Circle, but there was a fairly-decent webseries called The Vault where a bunch of college students are locked into individual rooms and have to figure a way out of an elaborate escape room puzzle (which gets weirder and weirder).

If I recall - somewhat clever, and a really cool concept. Sometimes get annoyed at the chars for being a bit slow, but overall interesting. Imo better than Circle (which I thought was a bit one note and heavy handed), but not without its own flaws

(Note: I agree with disrecommendations below, though thought it still had some merit)
