It's been a while since I read them, but I can't remember anything particularly irrational about Gary Paulson's Hatchet books (if you take into account the main character is a kid who doesn't know what he is doing at first).

The TV series Alone is also pretty good if you like survival content. All the footage is self recorded by the contestants who are dropped off in the wilderness somewhere and have to fend for themselves for as long as possible (multiple months sometimes). Not exactly rational content, but the people who learn and adapt and develop better strategies tend to do better.
