I get what you mean, and appreciate your comment.

But it's often used in a not-literally-compulsive sense in the LW community. Since e.g. a human can't physically force their future self to one-box Newcomb but we still need a word for "strongly deciding" to one-box, such that Omega can predict your future actions and find you one-boxing. [[https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/pre-commitment][The wiki]] calls it "effective pre-commitment" (as opposed to a "formal pre-commitment").

Since Harry had not promised in advance to ignore mind-control-induced desires, he can't retroactively stake his devotion to promises on it. Well, he can under some decision theories, but in this fic he does not.
