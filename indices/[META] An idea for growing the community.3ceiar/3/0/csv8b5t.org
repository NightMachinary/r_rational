Very interesting! I didn't even know about rationalfiction.io, but I've checked it out and its looks pretty amazing, great job! And if I implement this, I'm hugely in favour of the route you suggested (of helping implement it as a feature of your site) as that solves many issues I saw on the tech side (lack of easy editor in the tool, having to make it an executable download, etc.). And I can definitely do it in Python (even though I'm a little rusty on Python).

By Hacker News, you mean this site, right?: [[https://news.ycombinator.com/]]
