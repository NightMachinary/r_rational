Thanks for mentioning fictionhub =) To be clear, it's best to use [[http://rationalfiction.io]] instead, it is a branch of fictionhub specifically dedicated to rational fiction.

 

In my personal opinion, sharing stories over many websites is not a very elegant or productive approach for bringing new people into community. People tend to find stories either via social media, or through the website's own discovery system. When they find stories via website's own discovery system, it is just more convenient for them to stay on a website and discuss stories over there, rather than come over to reddit. So I'm not sure how much traffic that approach could bring.

 

I think, it makes more sense to collect all stories in one place, and then just share them via social media. Hint - that is why I am working on rationalfiction.io =) I think it would be more convenient if you guys could just share your stories over there, and I would take care of bringing them more traffic and readers. But, of course, I'm suffering from a strong my-own-precious-project-bias here =)

 

Having said that, if enough people find the resharing idea useful - I can add a reposting feature, so that you could connect your accounts from other websites, and submit a story to them in one click. If you know python, you could help me to [[https://github.com/raymestalez/fictionhub][implement it]]. For example I would take care of the webdev side of things and you would write a script that authenticates on websites and submits stories.

 

Also, I would add Hacker News to your list. I think that stories that have a lot of science/tech/transhumanism/AI themes would be really appreciated over there. For example I have discovered HPMOR and A Bluer Shade of White on HN.
