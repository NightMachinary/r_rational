  The problem is doing this in a deft, unobtrusive way so that you're not just some guy coming in and evangelizing for your pet genre.

Yeah, that's one of my concerns as well. What did you think of the Author's Note idea (where there's an author's note that discussion involving the author takes place on an [[/r/rational]] thread)? Is that too obtrusive? Does an AN like that serve to lower the quality of the experience of reading it? Is it an unreasonable thing to expect of the author?
