If you want to promote something (anything really, not just rational fiction) you need to share it with people. This means going into places where people are talking about something and giving a (hopefully well-written and on-topic) plug. If people are talking about some franchise that there's rational fiction of, you can mention that there's a fanfic /X/ which attempts to answer all the questions that the original fiction raises, and that you found it on [[/r/rational]] (or a different central hub, like [[http://rationalfiction.io]]). Or if the rational fiction is original, you can mention it in passing with the same link to the central hub.

The problem is doing this in a deft, unobtrusive way so that you're not just some guy coming in and evangelizing for your pet genre.
