I don't think saying something like, "This story has been posted to [[/r/rational]], and you can find discussion of it there" is obtrusive; if anything, it's good for the reading experience. However, neither fictionpress nor fanfiction.net (both run by the same people) allow links within stories, which makes crossover a little less likely to actually happen, and means that you can't just link directly to the wider discussion.

I also don't think that just saying, "This story is written with the ethos of rational fiction in mind" is too bad of an idea.
