One good way to deal with infodump is to rework it as looking for answer. For example instead of simply describing countries in a region, reframe it as "which countries are potential allies". Instead of "this is history of this city", "why this city is so rich". It transforms dry informations into clues to mystery. It uses the same principles that makes clickbait so effective.

I think there is such thing as good exposition in itself. If you look how Pratchett, Douglas or Susanne Clarke are doing it they are often present it as a mini story. It has characters, structure, progression, and climax. It takes more words but is more engaging this way.
