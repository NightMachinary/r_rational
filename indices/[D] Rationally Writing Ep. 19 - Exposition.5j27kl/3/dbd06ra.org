in regards to the chinese-ish fantasy world story, i would like to read that. you should have done what the author of "Unsong" did and go back and forth between two different time periods. In "Unsong" there are two main story arcs: the past during the time of the Comet King's war on hell mostly focused on Uriel, Sohu and the Comet King. And the present after the comet king disappeared, which mostly focuses on the main protagonists Aaron and Ana. you could have done something similar, make the past in the fantasy world more relevant to the plot and tie the past and present story arcs together.
