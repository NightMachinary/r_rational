  I'm not too used to the podcast format, which has been holding me back from checking them out.

Assuming that you're not familiar with podcasts in general, my personal recommendation would be to listen to them on the go. If you've got a smartphone, you can just use a podcast app (iTunes for iOS, Pocketcasts on Android, or just use the soundcloud app) and listen at your leisure during downtime. If you don't have a smartphone, hopefully you at least have an MP3 player, and you can use iTunes to download the podcast and then manually transfer it to your listening device like you would any other audio file (or just sync if you have an iPod).

I tend to listen to podcasts when I'm driving, going for a walk, or playing a game that doesn't require a lot of mental attention. I usually find time to listen to 10+ hours worth of podcasts week just letting it fill the empty moments. It's actually probably the easiest type of media for me to consume, as I think it's the only type of media that doesn't really require me to carve time out of my schedule for it; it's easy for me to listen to shows in chunks of 15-20 minutes throughout the day.

If I misunderstood your remark and your issue is not with podcasts as a medium, but rather the format of RW (as compared to other podcasts), it's a conversation-format podcast, it's not overly-produced and they conference remotely, but the audio fidelity is decent enough and it flows well without any big pauses or other hiccups. Also, unlike a lot of other podcasts that use the "two guys talking about a subject" format, Daystar and AW do a good job of sticking to the topic without any pointless digressions; it feels like they're trying to cover a topic, rather than just have a conversation (and I mean that in a good way). To compare it to a similar podcast, I am a big fan of [[http://writingexcuses.com/][Writing Excuses]], which is also a writing podcast with a focus on efficiency of communicating valuable writing advice, but sometimes the WE podcast is so obsessed with finishing things in a "timely" manner that it doesn't feel like they cover topics with the depth they deserve. I feel like Rationally Writing's episodes are usually the perfect length to cover a topic in a satisfying way without getting too bogged down in minutia, a good balance between the hyper-focused Writing Excuses and more rambling shows (like Dead Robot Society), just to name an example.

To give a more succinct review, there are two kinds of podcasts in my feed: ones that I listen to immediately whenever a new episode pops up, and ones that I listen to whenever just want to fill time. Rationally Writing is definitely one of the former.
