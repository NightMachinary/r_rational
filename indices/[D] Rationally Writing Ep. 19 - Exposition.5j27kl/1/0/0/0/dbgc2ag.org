  I always feel guilty if I'm multitasking with them in the background, as if I haven't given it my "full attention".

There are some podcasts that I do try to consume in a controlled environment. Produced radio shows like Love+Radio, The Truth, or Homecoming usually fall into this category, partly because I want to be able to appreciate the sound design, and partly because they tend to be pretty intense and emotionally engaging; shows like The Truth aim to provide an experience that is like "movies for your ears," and hearing a story (sometimes a true story with real people who aren't actors) with serious and somber subject matter isn't really the kind of thing that I want to have as just "background noise" when I'm engaged in some kind of frivolous activity. I usually these kinds of shows for a for times when I have a long, lonely highway drive to listen to them without interruption.

Rationally Writing isn't anything like that. There's no specialized sound design (it's just two guys talking) and the subject matter, while intellectually stimulating, usually doesn't require any emotional engagement on my part, so it's the kind of thing that I can check in and out of, in the same way that I would an interesting blog post or nonfiction book. I sometimes listen to these types of podcasts when I'm in a distracted environment; I listened to five whole seasons of Writing Excuses back when I was working as an intern in a lab doing a lot of data entry.

It's also worth noting that the "informative" podcasts (like Rationally Writing and Writing Excuses) tend to be the ones I go back to for multiple listens over a long period. I started listening to Writing Excuses some time back in 2011-2012 around the time that they were wrapping up season 5, and since then I have gone back and listened to season 5 in its entirety at least three times, and some episodes I've listened to more than that. I tend to treat shows like this more like instruction manuals or textbooks, and I treat it in the same way that I would treat a textbook. It wouldn't make sense for me to check out a textbook from the library, read it cover to cover, and then say, "Okay, done with that, now I never have to open that textbook again." Sometimes I'll go back and listen to my favorite episodes just to remind me about something that I found particularly interesting or motivating; sometimes I'll be mentally "stuck" on a particular topic and go back to a particular podcast episode to help me with that.

The genre of "instructional podcast" is also somewhat textbook-like in that I sometimes just need it to get me started down the right path, and I may not listen to an entire episode in its entirety. For example, sometimes I just won't be in the "mood" to write, and feel like I just need to listen to two authors talk about how they outline effective plots, and then halfway through the episode my mind will begin wandering as I start thinking about the story I'm working on, and by the end of the episode I can't wait to get back to my computer and start typing again. That's not something I ever feel "guilty" about, in fact, it's a good thing! One of the main goals of WE (and I believe RW aims to do this too) is to provide actionable advice, so taking action after you've heard the advice is an important part of the experience. My personal advice would be to listen to the episodes that deal with topics that you specifically find interesting, check in when you need motivation or inspiration (and feel free to check out once you've gotten it), and feel free to go back and re-listen to episodes if you feel that there's still something there for you to engage with.
