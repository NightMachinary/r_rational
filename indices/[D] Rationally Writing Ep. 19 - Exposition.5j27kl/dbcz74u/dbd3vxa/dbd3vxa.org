I've started trying to incorporate this "mini-stories" approach into my own work, because it's definitely my favorite way to learn about a world, and I really enjoy flash fiction. I think it takes a particular type of narrative and a particular type of tone though; it's very much a stylistic thing. And footnotes are my favorite way of delivering side-stories, but they're troublesome if you're targeting multiple platforms, since HTML/PDF/EPUB/MOBI all handle them differently (and in some cases, poorly).
