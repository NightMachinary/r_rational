I'll give it a go. This is super long haha, sorry.

I haven't finished HPMOR yet so I don't know if there are some wack spells that destroy continents or something that HPMOR's Quirrel might have access to, so I'm just going to go with what I know from canon Harry Potter.

I think it comes down to Avada Kedavara, I hope I'm spelling that right. Let's assume souls exist in Worm's world and the spell can properly rip them out or whatever - and bam, Quirrel has a "power" that's beyond anybody else's in Worm minus Contessa. Straight up death. Let's also give him the other two unforgivable curses; it seems reasonable he would know these.

I do this because truthfully I'm just not sure what else we can reliably say Quirrel could do. He had on screen/text spells, yes, but none powerful enough or useful enough, I'd argue, to fight the S9. The HP universe really isn't good at indicating this kind of thing.

Let's also assume Quirrel doesn't have a passenger and operates outside of Worm's rules in that regard.

*Round 1)* Jack has no known limit on how far he can push his blades. If he can aim it right, he could just take a knife and shove it through Quirrel's throat.

That said, again, if we're assuming Quirrel has other magic besides the three curses, which I'm sure he does, all bets are off. I have no idea what the guy could pull to protect himself here, or make it harder for Jack to target him, but he could probably do /something/. Again, this is kind of the problem with HP's universe.

If we assume he can't, then Jack pretty reliably wins 8/10. A thousand meters is enough that the curses wouldn't hit him fast enough, if at all.

If we let Quirrel block the knives somehow, then ultimately it would come down to slowly and painfully closing the distance to Jack until he could have the right range to hit him with the killing curse, or somehow teleporting toward Jack. If we say that the battlefield is so bland/easy to picture that Quirrel can safely apparate, then all bets are off and Quirrel probably wins 7/10, assuming Jack can't predict where he would apparate to.

*Round 2)* This is a lot different. For the arc 11 "original" S9 we have:

Bonesaw Jack Slash The Siberian Shatterbird Burnscar Cherish Mannequin Crawler possibly Pagoda, Murder Rat, and Hack Job but let's not focus on them for the moment.

If all of them start 1000m away from Quirrel, the Jack problem is back, but let's assume he can block it again for the sake of argument, otherwise you just get Round 1's first scenario but way way worse for Quirrel. Now he has to deal with Shatterbird, who can fly at least at a moderately fast pace, Burnscar, who we don't have a range limit for on her fire-creation, and Crawler, who was bigger than a car and fast enough that 1000m probably wouldn't feel like much to him. At the least, others could distract Quirrel until Crawler approached. He isn't slow.

Finally, the Worm Wiki says that Siberian has a range limit (from the wiki) of a few /miles/ on her projection, and she can reform it at will. And let's say Hack Job is there, because Pagoda and Murder Rat probably wouldn't tip the scales much. But Hack Job has Oni Lee's teleportation and is a stupidly tough Brute on top of that. And he can teleport very quickly.

So basically, as soon as this battle starts, Shatterbird is flying toward him, Crawler is running, and Burnscar is getting as close as she possibly can by making fire at her limit and teleporting into it. Siberian would be able to reach him almost instantly and just shove her hand through his throat, and Hack Job is doing much the same, since Oni Lee's teleportation was based on visuals, and this is a flat plane.

Overall with this, I'm not confident Quirrel could survive unless he reacted /fast/. He'd have to immediately zap Siberian to make her fizzle out, killing curse Hack Job and Burnscar both without getting hit by either of them...it'd be tough. I think he could do it, but it'd be really tough.

While this is happening, Jack is trying to knife him, Bonesaw is...steadily walking toward him, I guess, she can't do much at range except send some spiders, Mannequin is running, and so is Cherish.

What's interesting, though, is the imperius curse. If he tried sending Siberian against the Nine, for instance, they would kill Manton or Manton would outmanuever them. So there's a 1/10 that Quirrel controls Manton through Siberian and stomps. Don't think that's likely, though.

Even without her, though, I think Imperio is how he'd win. Fizzle out Siberian, imperio Hack Job and Burnscar and immediately he's got loads of firepower. It might be difficult to control Burnscar if her fire could somehow burn the energy of the spell itself, though. I say that because the kililng curse is viewed as a green physical energy, whereas I'm not sure Imperio ever has something like that. But eventually, I think he could do it.

Assuming Imperio also doesn't work at long distances, he could just wait until Crawler got within range and control him, too, which I have no idea how the Nine could counter that. Siberian could probably kill Crawler, honestly, but if he doesn't go after her first, or goes after Cherish or Mannequin who are closer to him than Jack/Bonesaw/Manton.

And sure, they would definitely figure out "he's controlling us once we get in range", but what could Crawler do besides hang back? The range he could spit acid is probably not much further than the range of the imperius curse.

But let's assume Crawler notices and hangs back, and all Q has going for him is Hack Job and Burnscar.

Once that happens things get weird.

Siberian has just recovered from being fizzled as this happens. This all has to happen in a very short timeframe, otherwise Siberian just keeps spamming Quirrel until he slips up, and she can reform fast, too. It's only the chance of imperio-ing Burnscar that gives Quirrel any edge. So:

Shatterbird probably sends all the sand and glass she can spare to him, but it seems reasonable that Quirrel could block it somehow. Burnscar and Hack Job are attacking Manton, Bonesaw, or Jack, who are all hanging back or not quite to Quirrel yet. They're immune to HJ's power nullification but not immune to very very large amounts of fire...but still, HJ and Burnscar have passengers, and Jack wins by virtue of that. They both could try attacking Bonesaw, but as much as fire still hurts her, she's ludicrously durable. BUT Burnscar and (probably?) Hack Job would be immune to whatever pathogen she could try releasing from her stomach, as she does, or any of her other tricks.

The most likely thing, then, is Quirrel realizing that attacking Jack isn't working, and just trying to burn Manton and Bonesaw into oblivion instead. We can assume he knows about Manton based on the pre-battle knowledge. By this time, Siberian is reformed and has realized what Burnscar is trying to do. She reforms to attack Burnscar and narrowly misses the timeframe. Manton dies in a ball of fire and she fizzles out. This is less likely than Siberian just killing Burnscar, but once that happens, Quirrel has a lot less options unless we buff him, so for Quirrel to have much chance, we have to assume Manton dies.

I think Siberian killing Burnscar and Hack Job in this case is the most likely scenario, including everything leading up to it, so let's say 6/10 to the S9, because of her.

Without that, it's just slow painful avoidance and out-manuevering the S9 against one another. He could do it, but it'd be very complicated and one wrong move would end him. 4/10 to Quirrel on a good day.
