No problem! Didn't even think about brooms.

Where did you get those spells from? I don't remember them.

Tactics wise? I'm not really sure, I was kinda going for "they both just want to kill each other". Tactics wise, the S9 are strong enough and have a consistent enough strategy in the Wormverse that the only way to do anything to them is to pull something completely unexpected, like the ambush that was pulled once the games started. Not sure how Quirrel could play to that imo besides just using something as drastic as Imperius.
