Awesome! Thanks for replying.

Doesn't Professor Quirrel have really strong magical prowess and quite nifty normal spells like Disillusionment (which makes the caster totally invisible), Stunning Spell (which is strong enough to reliably stun any opponent that doesn't have extra magical defenses, like Hagrid's giant-heritage skin) and of course, Avada Kedavra.

I was thinking more like what battle tactics could Jack ( & Co) bring to the table against Prof. Quirrel and vice versa. It's​ of course apparent to Quirrel that his opponents aren't wizards and witches and it's apparent to Jack and Co that Quirrel is a mage (read: wand→ spells, charms etc., probably magical bolts which means long-ranged warfare→ possibly weak physical defenses) and his wand is his sole weapon.

But knowing Prof. Quirrel, it's probably quite safe to assume that he has a spare Firebolt/Nimbus 2000 upon his person, just in case he needed to gain air superiority.
