OK.

I'm not sure if this is the best place (read subreddit) to put this problem forward but I wanted to know who would, rationally, win in a conflict between

A) Both parties are spontaneously teleported within a 1 km radius of each other, in a generic random wasteland like the ones shown in DBZ. Both parties have a general idea about each other's powers; Quirrel is a mage and uses a magical wand, and Jack Slash has a cutting power, for example.

1. Jack Slash versus Professor Quirrel.

2. The S9 versus Professor Quirrel.

B) The same above situation except both parties have zero prior knowledge about the other party.
