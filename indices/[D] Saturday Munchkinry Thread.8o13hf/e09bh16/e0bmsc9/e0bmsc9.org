To protect against the cutting power, Quirrel casts a matter-focussed variant of Protego. Jack notices Quirrel's shard, talks to it, and gets the heck scared of Quirrel's general problem-solving ability, and of his shard having lots of offshoots going all over the world.

Meanwhile, the Simurgh notices a perturbation in time, and that a new shard has always been here. She changes course slightly, and one of its offshoots shall be severed, for that is one of her missives.

Quirrel apparates onto DBZ wasteland pillars, looking for the enemy. Jack wonders where his teammates are, but his shard Taboo's the question. Jack tells Quirrel's shard that he is amused by this Bahl's Stupefaction story - could it illustrate the effects? After a few pillars with no sight of Jack, Quirrel's intent to kill shows him the easiest solution - transfigure some air to poison Jack wherever he might hide. He apparates away to have some celebratory champagne. Jack becomes quite confused as to where he is, to the extent he is allowed to, and begins trying to wander out of the wasteland.

A few hours later, drunk Quirrel doesn't feel so good, and goes to kill the wine-seller who poisoned him. As that one has closed up shop, he places a transfigured troll tooth under the counter, timing the end of the transfiguration such that the shop will be open. He keels over and succumbs behind the till.

Staring at the stars, Quirrel contemplates his mistakes. They are quite unlike earlier follies. He might be getting old. He will have to speed up his acquisition of the Stone, once some schmuck shortly finds one of his less foolishly hidden horcruxes.

On one of her less well-understood paths, Contessa fetches a particular houseplant. The door she opens to it confuses an interdimensional connection, and Quirrel will be sleeping for a long, long time.

Jack Slash starves to death in an uninhabited alternate Earth, for Quirrel never died to end the scenario.

Of course Quirrel wins! Quirrel OP.
