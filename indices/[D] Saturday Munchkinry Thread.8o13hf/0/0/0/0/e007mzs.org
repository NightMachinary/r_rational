Yeah I was thinking more along the lines of theoretical sciences, but it works even for experimental sciences. You don't even have to lie. One of the biggest bottlenecks in experimental sciences is that experiments take time to do and often fail to give good results. By observing your other self, you can avoid doing any of the experiments that failed, and just redo the experiments that succeeded. (Since there is some randomness, you won't be guaranteed the same result, but it is very likely if your experiment is designed correctly.) Simply not having to waste time on experiments that are doomed to failure is a large boon.

  When spectating on alternate-you, do you retain the ability to move and speak?

[[/u/GemOfEvan]] said you're a passive observer, so I'm guessing you literally can't do anything about the other you. And since your ability is "seeing", not "showing", I don't think you can take a video/audio record of the other you's experiences and show them to other people.
