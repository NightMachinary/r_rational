Yah I guess if you're an established career-experimentalist with a preference for high risk, high reward projects where the answer is only interesting if it turns out in a particular way, you could come out ahead, but there'd still be an uncomfortable lag and you might have improved technique and stuff from doing the failed experiments, too. Though you could make one damn good PI by nudging your students/RAs towards stuff that worked in the alternate-verse.

The moving and speaking I meant in our universe --- if you're just sharing a sensorium with alternate you and not e.g. in a paralyzed trance then you can repeat aloud the words alternate-you is looking out for your voice recorder to record, and not have to rely on memorizing stuff or flipping back and forth.
