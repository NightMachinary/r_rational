I'd think spectating on consumption would be much more fruitful than on production, and require much less observation, too. It would benefit most from ideas that are hard to think of/through but easy and fast to write down, understand, or communicate, so the recipient of this power would be much better served if they were otherwise building a career in mathematics or some other theory-driven field, rather than one based more directly on labor

(even "intellectual" labor, ideas being a dime a dozen -- if they're e.g. an experimental or field scientist, fat lotta good copying the papers they read will do ya without the experiments to underlie them, though I guess you could "lie" and say you totally did them yourself. Copying something like an original novel could also work, though it would take a lot more time than a proof or short description of some new algorithm, and probably be less lucrative. Plus, unless you're in the habit of reading novels in a single sitting, you'd have to have impeccable timing skills or be constantly on the watch, lest you miss a chapter or three, vs. short papers that could easily be consumed without break).

When spectating on alternate-you, do you retain the ability to move and speak? If so, acquiring a good voice recorder would be a priority, and maybe hiring a trusted party to transcribe it, too. Perhaps improving touch-typing skills as well, if you can speak and type simultaneously on separate lines of thought and increase your bandwidth that way.

Another first step would be to seed the world with as much randomness as you can, the faster to accelerate divergence between timelines. Established producers might have their work sketched out in broad strokes a decade out, and copying alternate-them's products will look pretty sketchy. But nudging a butterfly that goes on to inspire the next generation of researchers might lead to quite different worlds some time down the line.

Might also be some use in the short term on playing the market, e.g. if some inevitable news breaks in the alternate timeline about some public company's breakthrough/scandal, you can buy/short and make a quick buck.

The riskiest but likely most impactful application of this power would be to go public -- demonstrate to sufficiently wealthy or powerful investors (incl. the gov't) what you can do and have them set up a facility to record your every alternate observation and fund career-switching programs and stuff. Dunno how much danger of being kidnapped and enslaved or vivisected you'd be there, though.
