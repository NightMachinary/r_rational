Step one - see if I can observe while in motion; that is, experience my alternate walking down the street while I am walking down the street.

Try to maintain parity at first, and see how quickly the /rest/ of the universe diverges. This will give me some idea of how much true randomness there is in the universe; how quickly two separate universes drift apart without being pushed apart.

--------------

Step two: Start pushing the worlds apart. Don't respond to reddit posts that my alternate has responded to, and vice versa. Encourage different people (at Internet distances, as well as in person) to do different things. Incidentally, I'd like to encourage everyone who reads this post to greet the next stranger they see with a smile. See if I can get a feel for how much (short-term) influence my choices have on the world.

--------------

Step three: Attempt to open two-way communication with the other world. Have some scientists closely observe me while I am observing my other self's life, and see if they can pick up how itis happening and/or how to artificially replicate it.

If step three is a success, we can then observe random alternate universes and copy their technology.

If not, then... hmmm. Other-timeline me has never been contacted, he doesn't know to do things that I can take advantage of. I'm not quite sure how else to leverage this.
