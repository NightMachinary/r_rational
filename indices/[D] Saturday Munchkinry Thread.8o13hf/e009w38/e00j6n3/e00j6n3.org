Step zero: Read someone's memories, deep enough to understand some of the modern world. First target of opportunity you can be alone with for a few minutes. Steal as much money as you can from them, then wipe their memories of you.

Step one: Spend the money on a plane ticket. Go to a new city, offer to have sex with strangers to get them alone, then rob them and wipe their memories. If you get attacked at this point, you're kinda fucked, so just stay mobile. Keep moving to new cities until you have a decent nest egg.

Step two: Get a mobile home. Live in it long enough for it to become a recall point. Don't use your powers at all during this time.

Step three: Pay someone to continually drive the mobile home across country. That'll give you a recall point that will be difficult to find and stake out. Visit it only often enough to maintain it as your checkpoint, and if never sleeping in the same place twice is enough to never reset home base, never visit and do that instead.

Step four: Become a counselor/life coach/trainer. With your ability to edit memories, you can remove trauma and add on valuable skills. Keep it subtle. Have people take actual classes for a month, then edit in way more information over that month. Coding, law school, languages, any kind of training that requires a lot of memorization. Pay experts for one on one sessions and take more things from them to train others in. As your reputation grows, get bodyguards, and train them as well. It doesn't look like you can put in muscle memory, but memories of sharpshooters and martial arts masters, combined with actual practice, would certainly help.

Step five: Use graduates of your school as spies. Get them hired by top companies, which should be easy with their skills. Suborn superiors. If they can be converted directly by false memories of loyalty, do that. If they can't, hire them away as teachers for your counseling company and let your graduates be promoted. If they don't go for that either, assassinate them. Get access to billionaire CEOs and have them sign away all of their wealth to your most promising student. This should be someone almost as smart as you.

Step six: Edit the memories of your most prominent student to believe that they are an alien with your powers, and that the powers gradually faded away as you adjusted to the new dimension. Use plastic surgery to give them your face, and get a new one. Make them believe that you are merely the excellent teacher they hired after their memory editing skills faded, and that regular one on one meetings with you are normal. Leave the goal of taking over the world.

Step seven: Let your student go off. Keep bodyguards, as is fitting for the student's prized teacher, but spend most of the time in the background. Check in frequently to make sure they're staying loyal and give any more good ideas if you have them. If they badly need information, kidnap and scan whoever you need to, then edit it in and credit the info to spies.

Step eight: If you get attacked earlier than step six by the people from your home world, bail. Mobile home, then fly away as fast as you can. After step six, use the student as bait and try to kill them. If they manage to kill the student, let them believe you're dead, and have a new pawn take their place. After the other aliens are either dead, or believe that you're dead, do the same kind of graduates into access plan that you did on CEOs on world leaders instead. Make each of them believe they're you, and that you are someone they need to maintain regular contact with to maintain their cover.

At this point you've basically won. Maybe set up a world government if you get tired of traveling around to keep editing memories, but it's safer to just keep things looking the way they are. Now you can do whatever your real goal was, with your blue/orange morality.
