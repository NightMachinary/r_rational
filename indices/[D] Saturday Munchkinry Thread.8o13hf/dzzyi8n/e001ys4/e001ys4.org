Let's hope original you is smart, because this power seems tailor made for intellectuals. Simply put, whenever the original you comes up with an idea, you can steal it. He invents something? Steal it. He writes a paper? Steal it. He creates an app? Copy the code and steal it. This saves you a lot of time, since stealing work is much faster than actually doing said work. Time which you can use to do other work to get richer/more famous/more powerful/etc.
