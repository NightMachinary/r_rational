You have been contacted by an otherworldly entity that gives you the ability to see into a parallel universe. This universe is the "regular" one that would have happened if you were not contacted and not given this power.

At any point and for as long as you'd like, you may experience everything your parallel self currently is experiencing. You are a passive observer and do not have access to your other self's memories. If your other self dies or is otherwise incapacitated, you're out of luck.

How can you exploit this power for personal gain or even somehow leverage it for an even greater purpose?
