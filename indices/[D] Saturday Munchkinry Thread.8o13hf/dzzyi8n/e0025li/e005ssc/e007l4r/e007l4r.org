I think it depends on the time scale. Many spikes and dips are event driven. Changes driven by press releases might not be useful (although that provides another target for delays to gain an edge), but changes driven by changes in related indicies (Dow jones, commodities) that are also delayed might be enough of an edge. Also, dips and spikes get amplified by crowd-follower traders and automated trading, so knowing the direction in advance - even by an hour - can yield huge rewards. There is still chaos to cope with, so you can't just keep risking all your capital on each bet, but you'll definitely be able to beat the market.
