I think my most important project would be to study myself when engaging in interdimensional communication, so as to develop a working scientific theory of the phenomena. Goals would include communication with myself and others in same and additional dimensions. Study of the otherworldly being is also of interest, but I assume contact will be rare enough to inhibit useful data gathering.

Assuming none of that pans out, my goal is to establish situations where the other universe acts as a precognitive simulation with respect to 'my' universe. For example paying agents to delay events subject to gambling so that I know the event outcome in advance. Chance still plays a role, but my edge should pay off over time. For stock markets and the like, perhaps targeted network congestion or more severe disruption events. I'd have to be careful since too severe disruptions could cause the worlds to diverge too severely to be useful.

As a longer term strategy, fund a neo-Luddite movement to delay the introduction of technological advances, and use observations from the other 'ahead' universe to inform investments / warn about detrimental trends.
