I'd go to some writers' conferences and academic research institutions and buy rounds of drinks.

Not for any deep purpose. Just to get the butterflies flapping and changing causality.

Hopefully authors in World 2 will be inspired by a slightly different set of ideas than authors in World 1.

Then I'd get really, really good at speed typing and copy books that my World 1 self read.

The typing would be slightly tedious, but I'd be able to publish a couple N.Y. Times bestseller level books a year.
