I've been keeping up with it daily, around where did you stop around?

The story has kept on functioning in various arcs, usually something related to the plot of the show, or OL developing or solving some probable or future problem in contrast to how things are usually done on the common DC universe's, and some social arcs from time to time. Currently the story is in the time between the two seasons of the show, so it has worked with integrating a couple of arcs from the regular DC Universe into the story[[#s][]], while the biggest long term goal is [[#s][]]. There's also the parallel renegade universe which has been confirmed by the writer to eventually going to crossover with the main one.

Other than that it has kept with the same kind of structure, which I can understand which is not for everyone's taste, but which personally I like as to how it balances the social and story side of the characters. OL still suffers for being the most oblivious character when it comes to certain 'situations' [[#s][]], but it's usually well balanced with the action.
