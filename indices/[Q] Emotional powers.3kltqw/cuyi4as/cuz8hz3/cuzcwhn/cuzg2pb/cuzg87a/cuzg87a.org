Yeah it's definitely not the kind of fiction with a very clear end in mind, and more of a gradual read.

In some parts I find it helps to take a week's break which allows one to read half an arc in one single time, other times the serial nature works well with reading it day to day.

I would say that one of the best details which come from the slow evolution of the problem solving is how the SI is not just solving everything by himself, but dragging his surroundings(starting by his friends, stretching to their friends and families and generalizing to the whole governments) into a state where they can solve it by themselves more easily.
