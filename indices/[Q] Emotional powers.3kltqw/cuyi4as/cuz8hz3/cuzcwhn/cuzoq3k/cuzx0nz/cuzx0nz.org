I really don't know, I'm not sure whether there will be any communication between the two parallels to get the readers up to date on the differences, or if the author is just going to assume people have been keeping up.

There's a post with the links for all the renegade chapters separated, but that's also not the easiest way to read because the renegade posts are usually intersected with the regular story to show similar events that are happening on the time. There are even events like [[#s][]] which are told primarily from the renegade perspective with a bit at the end from the main story perspective which shows what happened differently.

In general each bit of the story is told from the perspective of the parallel which obtained the bigger picture of the events. Either way, I don't really think the crossover is going to be any time soon.
