Let me warn you now that there will be a chapter in which the Renegade is the focus and the normal SI just has interlude chapters. Yes, that means that just like most of the Renegade chapters will make zero sense if not read as part of the normal arc the "normal" interludes will make very little sense to anyone who has skipped most of that Renegade-focused arc. And more importantly said arc still has consequences in the overarching story. The arc in question is called "Abberation" and is also quite hard to follow if you haven't kept up at all with the SI vs Renegade differences. But if you really don't want to read that stuff you could instead just read that single Renegade chapter once you're there, accept that you don't get most of the previous references and aren't sure who all the characters on Renegade's team are and as a tradeoff miss pretty much nothing of import from the normal story without having to read /all/ of the Renegade stuff.
