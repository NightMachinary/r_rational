The first six episodes are pretty goofy, yes. Episode 7 is where it gets serious.

To explain the attraction, I want to quote tvtropes:

  Thus begins a rollercoaster ride of Fanservice, over-the-top fight scenes between mecha, hot-bloodedness, epic sunglasses, massive Badassery, and mind-blowing heroism. The show is loads of fun and seldom takes itself seriously; it could be described as the exact polar opposite of Gainax's other famous series about giant mecha, /Evangelion/. Don't try reading any science into the show---common theory says its universe's /laws of physics/ are subservient to the Rule of Cool. On Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness, /Gurren Lagann/ is soft enough to be spread on a bagel.
