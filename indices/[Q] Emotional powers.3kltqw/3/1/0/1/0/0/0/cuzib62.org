Nope, wrong.

  Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face ---

  “AAAARGH!”

  Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain --- his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.

  Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off --- the pain in Harry's head was building --- he couldn't see --- he could only hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other voices, maybe in Harry's own head, crying, “Harry! Harry!”

  He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down...down... down....

Quirrell is dead or just as good by that point. That's not Disney violence.

  “We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.”

That was Dumbledore pulling him off Harry. Quirrell was dead. The last voice was Dumbledore and Voldemort yelling. Quirrell was silent. Because he was dead. Dumbledore pulled the dead body of Quirrell off of Harry.

Only real counterpoint:

  “No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share...not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time --- and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.”

That reads to me as, "Quirrell was too dead to do anything as Voldemort yelled, I showed up and Voldemort ran when he saw me, Quirrell finished dying as or just after I pulled him off you." It doesn't read as "Traumatized? Why, you didn't see anyone die or anything."

Let's see, what else?

You didn't give examples of what you meant about TTGL, you assumed things about my motivations so don't fucking do that, and you suggested watching the Harry Potter movies -- an anathema.

But I don't really care to discuss it any further. Not really worth my time. Point is, Harry totally knows he murdered a dude.
