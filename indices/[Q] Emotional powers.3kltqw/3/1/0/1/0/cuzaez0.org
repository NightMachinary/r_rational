A man died screaming at the end of Philosopher's Stone. On "camera". A boy was beaten unconscious. Another boy fell unconscious from pain while committing homicide.

Hardly standard children's book fare, though Middle Grade is harder-core than most people think.

That's one reason people loved it. It had YA stylings even in the first three books. I contend it has always been a YA series, in fact. Which was one reason it has so much trouble getting published. Middle Grade simply isn't that long and emotionally punchy.

That 2.5 hours would also be a complete story. The suggestion is, it takes that long before TTGL /matters/. That's too much, unless there is one hell of a payoff.
