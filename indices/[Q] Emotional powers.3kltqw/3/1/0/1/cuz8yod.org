To be fair, two and a half hours of reading will get you through Philosopher's Stone and nothing else, and it would make you think it's just a children's book series. "It gets better" actually applies to a /lot/ of stuff.

I personally liked TTGL. It's very much a "feelgood" type of story, but at least it's consistent considering the rule of cool powers everything in the universe. Not every story needs to be rational or deep to be enjoyable. I agree with you on Bleach though.
