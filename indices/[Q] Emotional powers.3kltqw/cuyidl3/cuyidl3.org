I think the general take on it is this: Being 'rationalist' means you think, plan and execute in ways that make sense /given your setting/. So if you have studied the evidence and you determine that Magic Artifact A gives you super strength when angry and seemingly lacks lasting side effects, then you do your damndest to make yourself angry when you need super strength. You can be rational /around/ the emotions, and anyway, none of us are ever completely without them. Rationality helps you do things, it doesn't tell you what your terminal values should be (though it might force you to rethink them if you haven't thought through how you arrived at them).

  Given that they seem anathema to rationalism I wanted to know examples of how they are handled in your stories.

In my world, which is a Fantasy world with ~1910s technology and heavy magic, emotions fuel magic, so suppressing them means you don't get to play at the big boys' table. Your personality (and mood) determine your affinities with the five magic elements, and while yes, there is a strong tendency for methodical, think-it-through people to be particularly strong in Earth, they make what use they can of the other elements too, because anything else would be sub optimal. Of course, there /are/ certain doors that are closed to those who insist on sanity. Fire gets stronger with desire and directed emotion, and rationalists just aren't going to be able to access the most powerful Fire magic without doing something to their brain to shut down the wordy mathsy parts. That said, I once [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2y6r2v/wip_mk_bst_please_break_my_oath_magic_andor/][asked /r/rational for some input on my oath magic,]] and there were a lot of really sneaky buggers here who started suggesting deliberate magical personality rewrites, especially temporary ones tied to triggers.
