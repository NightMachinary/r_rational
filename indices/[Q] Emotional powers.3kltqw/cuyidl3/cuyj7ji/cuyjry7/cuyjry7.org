I have almost finished one book, but it was the first long thing I wrote and out of 130k words I'm dissatisfied with roughly the first half. While I think the rest is great, I can't exactly submit the second half of a book. Rather than rewriting the whole thing I have shelved it and started on a second book (which takes place earlier and in a different part of the world). That second book is sitting at 25k words and I'm happy with it so far. It also has the advantage of working both as a stand alone and as the start of the series.

While the world is huge, this book should be fairly reader friendly. Plot starts with a bunch of people with suspiciously complimentary skills and little knowledge of history waking up outside Evil Capitol which has been abandoned for 300 years, and most of them have no idea what the history of the place is, so things are introduced gradually in a hopefully interesting way.
