That universe will quickly collapse into solipsism or into objectivity. The middle ground is unstable. All you need is one person thinking that it shouldn't work that way, and it works slightly less that way than it did before, which amplifies the effect recursively as it now takes the majority opinion into less consideration as a proportion than the guy who just now thought it shouldn't work that way. The effect compounds over time. If the majority converts, perhaps due to watching the laws change and realizing it no longer is working that way, they might settle in to all have the same objective reality. Otherwise, everyone diverges into solipsism where they are the only real thing in their world and the universe works how they think it should up until they start to think it shouldn't.
