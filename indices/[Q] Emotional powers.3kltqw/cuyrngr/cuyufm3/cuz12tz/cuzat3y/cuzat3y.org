  You have to watch two and a half hours of it to get to the good stuff?

That depends on what you mean by "the good stuff". TTGL is organized into four major arcs, the first three of which are, in true Gainax style, homages to previous approaches to the giant-mecha genre. The fourth is semi-new, giving props to /Getter Robo/ while also setting out its own (batshit insane) way to do giant-mecha.

Episode 7 is, without spoilers, a Wham Episode that forms the border between two of the major arcs.

Again, without spoilers:

- First Arc: the "original" Super Robot shows. Has something of a parodic tone, features lone manly men going up against basically faceless evil oppressors. Episode 4 is the worst in the show and we all wish to forget it existed.

- Second Arc: the original "serious" Super Robot shows. There is now a genuine, continuous plot. The Evil Oppressors have names and faces and a command structure; the heroes have a coherent team structure and definite personalities beyond being Manly Men. Bits of worldbuilding are seeded. A pretty cool Final Battle is had at the end of the arc, culminating in, of course, heroes triumphing, but with more worldbuilding and plot seeds planted for the next arc.

- Time Skip. A lot of people complain about the time skip. Many of us fans, however, say that the time skip lets TTGL show something unusual in most fiction: /progress/. The time skip is seven years, which means that while the main cast end the second arc in their mid-teens, they begin the third arc as young adults. The time skip lets us see some of the /aftermath/ of winning the final battle in the second arc, how the world of the story /kept going/ after what would otherwise have been "the end". This is itself one of the themes of the show: the story /shows/ the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoWhatDoWeDoNow][So What Do We Do Now]] moments, and treats them as more opportunities for the characters to grow.

- Third Arc: A more "modern" treatment of the mecha genre, with Real Robots, moral dilemmas, and politics. Homage to /Gundam/ in its various incarnations. A new villain is introduced, as is an important element of worldbuilding (the Emotion Power itself: Spiral Power = Determinator Energy), and the two are tied together to justify the Serial Escalation trope (and the old villain). New characterization is added in, as we see how the characters grew into stable or less-stable adults and authority figures in the new world they built after overthrowing the second arc's Evil Overlord -- more of this would have been better. Urban mecha combat, more difficult enemies who /can't/ just be shot at until they die, worries about civilians.

- Fourth Arc: Definitively starts some time around when they take Gurren Lagann into space. The first and last arcs are the ones that really make the show famous, and personally, I'd say this is the better of the two. This is the part where TTGL goes from merely /epic/ in its story structure to actually /mythic/, as the show's themes and conflict are extended to their extremes and brought directly into the limelight as important parts of the underlying fabric of life. Moral themes begin to be stated directly, and, this being TTGL, yelled at your face. There are some /very good moments/ in this arc that should have been more than moments, because they demonstrate and magnify the enormity of the show's conflict: /before/ you thought the heroes would inevitably win because /they're Determinator super-robot pilots, that's what they do/, but now you're shown that in fact, they are merely the latest in a long line of rebels across the universe who thought to oppose a /literally/ God-like foe, and that /all previous such attempts ended in death, surrender or treachery/. Until the beginning of the very last episode, /the heroes haven't even accomplished anything new that didn't end in failure before/. Ends with mecha that throw galaxies around as shurikens to fight what is really, underneath, a battle of wills. And note that when I say this arc's foe is God-like, I am not talking about Zeus, I am talking about a Power Who Is, and in fact the nearest that any /mere TV show/ has ever come to portraying the Lone Power on-screen. I am talking about, "Has more energy to use and higher technology than everyone." I am talking about, "Should not appear in a story if you are not willing to arm the heroes with Spiral Power, because there's just no other way to win." I am talking about a multiversal Singleton agent -- that is how powerful this arc's villain is.

- Ending: The characters Earn Their Happy Ending, but not without substantial losses. Life continues to move forwards, and we're shown an epilogue in which the society the characters helped to build has been Marching On.

The show distils the Super Robot genre down to its core tropes and themes, and then first parodies, then reconstructs, then /extends beyond the impossible/ those tropes. It features likeable, fully human characters (yes, even as a giant-robot anime), [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xw/higher_purpose/][provides them with motivations the viewer can root for]], [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/wx/complex_novelty/][puts them in /genuinely/ challenging situations]], and eventually builds up to their fighting a [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/x8/amputation_of_destiny/][destiny-amputating superpower]] /and winning/.

If you hated the first few episodes, then frankly, go ahead and skip to the last arc. It's fucking awesome, and a classic.
