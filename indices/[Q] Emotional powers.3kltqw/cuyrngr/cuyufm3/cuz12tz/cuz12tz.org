You have to watch two and a half hours of it to get to the good stuff? And the good stuff is fanservice and Dragon Ball Z with mecha? Hmm. That's hardcore fan loin-girding, even for anime. I almost didn't watch more Bleach because Eps 2 & 3 were quite bad. I think that's beyond my ability to even. Thanks for the info, though.
