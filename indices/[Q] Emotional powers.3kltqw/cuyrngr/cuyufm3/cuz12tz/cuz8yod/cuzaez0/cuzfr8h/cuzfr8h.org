Not on camera, Harry grabs Quirrell's face, he screams, and Harry falls unconscious. It can be inferred that he died, but you're exaggerating a lot. A kid would just assume Voldemort left his body and Quirrell got sent to the hospital or something.

And kids fall unconscious all the time in Disney movies, it's not exclusively YA material.

Also, you're defending PS because it has some promising elements in the first book, I believe TTGL also has plenty of promising material in its first episodes, even if they can't compare to what comes after. You could always just watch the movies.
