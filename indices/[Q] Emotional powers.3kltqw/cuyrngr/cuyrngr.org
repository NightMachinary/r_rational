The main thing keeping most canon emotional powers stories from being rational isn't a consistent and sane world--that can be fixed easily by fanfic. It's that they aren't about someone (and not necessarily a villain) very quickly just taking carefully measured (but quite large) quantities of controlled substances /all the time/.

Because that's how you actually control emotions, rationally. And that's helpful when how focused, able to visualize, or quick-thinking you are is the difference between beating the world-ending threat and everyone dying. /Everyone/.

Shit. I need to write a Homura-drugging-up-Magical-Girl-candidates PMMM short story one of these days. Poor Sayaka doesn't fare well, but Homura almost has her pre-conversion drug set worked out to make a strong enough wish happen "naturally".

Hard to avoid getting overshadowed and intimidated in the fandom by /To the Stars/, though...

Still don't get people's love of that show. One step up from /One Piece/ in my mind (which is quite, quite low), and this is from someone who watched almost every episode of /Bleach/ and (dog help me) /Naruto/ until late in their runs...as an adult.

Can anyone explain the attraction? Is there good story behind that ehh art style, annoying characters, and goofy (initial?) plot? So many people like it and do fanfic of it...so maybe that means there's something compelling but also other bits that are really flawed--which is all I see in the first few episodes.
