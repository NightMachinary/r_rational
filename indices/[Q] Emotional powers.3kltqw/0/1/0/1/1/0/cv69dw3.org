Did read Aberration. Had been keeping up with the Renegade-Paragon differences. Aberration wasn't /hard to follow/, just "bleah, whatever" and I had to re-contextualize myself at the switch back to Paragon.

Not sure if I'll bother with Renegade sections in the future. But I'm more clueful about the fic now, so maybe I'll be able to see them coming from further away.
