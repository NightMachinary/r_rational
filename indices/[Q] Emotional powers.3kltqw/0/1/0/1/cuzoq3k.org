So wait (I've been binging, some unprintable linked it in the general thread a week ago)--\\
There's planned to be a self-crossover down the line? And it's with, if I understand rightly, the "renegade option"? (And not the blue power ring Ultraman version, which I think would be pretty cool?)

Does this mean I gotta read all of those? They don't quite grab me in the same way, and they're starting to blur together with the "main" plotline pretty bad. I've thought about just skipping them.
