I read a fanfiction called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.272850/][With This Ring]] that is a DC Universe self-insert story about a character with an emotional spectrum ring. His is Orange, and instead of being powered by force of will, like the green ones, his is only powered by avarice, or desire.

It's not a rational work, but the way the character works (for example, trying to meditate on Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs so he desires more complex things) around the weakness of his emotional weapon is clever. When he goes to try to clean the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch][Great Pacific garbage patch]] he has to make himself /want/ the oceans to be clean. Not just in a vaguely "oh, that would be nice" way, and not in a "I will force myself to do this" way (which is what a Green Lantern could do) but in a "I will find a way to make cleaning the thing that I truly /want/" way.

In a world with weapons powered by emotion, it's rational to make sure your emotional weapon is used in a good way. Emotion isn't irrational, any more than having a particular utility function could be irrational. Desires, interests, things you find joy in, and distaste are all orthogonal to rationality. Rationality doesn't prescribe ethics or love. Rationality is a tool.

In any case, a good example might be something like going into a berserker fury if you have control of that. You give up, say, your ability to use magic or your ability to make long-term decisions or distinguish friend from foe to temporarily gain great power in battle. Although during the time when you're berserk you may not be making rational decisions, there's no reason a rationalist wouldn't have this in the list of options they'd consider if it was at their disposal. An author might reasonably want to write this kind of thing out of their work, but there's no inherent problem.
