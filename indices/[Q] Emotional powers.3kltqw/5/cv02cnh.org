One thing that I've observed: mind magic is the enemy of character development. More precisely, mind magic should have read-only access to emotions. If a character is just experiencing emotions because of magic, it's not very engaging. If there's always a possibility that your characters are hallucinating a few chapters, then it's hard to care about what's happening. And so on.
