I looked up "Shroudies" in the rest of the story and only two other chapters use the word. Knowing that it refers to government agents doesn't exactly cause a radical change in the interpretation of those chapters.

Here are the excerpts:

  “So a low-level magician has gone terrorist,” said Ronald. “Killed a Senator. Embarrassing. Certainly something we have to condemn. But by making such a big deal of this, we just reinforce our link to him in the public mind. We should have put out a statement distancing ourselves, sent someone over to the Shroudies to help them catch him, and ignored it.”

  [...]

  “Better send the Shroudies,” said Mark. “I'm telling you, things involving Dylan Alvarez are always hard.”

  [...]

  “Dylan, you killed Senator Henderson with a letterbomb, two days after the Shroudies assigned him a personal bomb squad to search through all his mail. How did you even do that?”

  “You think I can't pull off a convincing Shroudie if I want to?”

  [...]

  “Look, Dylan, it's not that I don't have -- good memories of our times together. It's just -- after what happened with Senator Henderson, and now everything that's happened here tonight -- everyone is after you. The police, the Shroudies -- heck, maybe even UNSONG. And -- well, like I said. I've got a wife and kids. No,” said Mark, finally. “I'm not a terrorist. Kill me if you will.” And he dropped his staff on the ground and held up his hands.

  “We've had a good couple of days. Ms. Lowry here has given us a very new Name, so new the Shroudies don't know it exists, that lets us become invisible. Mr. McCarthy here is one of the top ritual magicians in the world and will be a stupendous boon to our efforts. So I decided -- why not think big? We've already killed a president; killing another would be boring. But Ms. Lowry's sudden appearance has me feeling all Stevensite. So let's kill the head of UNSONG, who also happens to be the only halfway-competent leader the organization has had in its twenty-something-year history. Let's free the Names.”
