#+begin_quote
  This spell cures gout. Place the patient within a circumscribed pentacle drawn on the ground, light a black candle nearby, then slit the throat of a chicken no older than 22 weeks. This spell must be done outdoors under a full moon on a cloudless night.
#+end_quote

Let's consider the amount of effort that has to go into figuring out this one. For a start, it's completely impossible to do it by accident - the intent actually /has to/ be there. (How someone figured out the /first/ ritual is an open question)

#+begin_quote
  Place the patient within a circumscribed pentacle
#+end_quote

How many alternatives are there?

- Place the patient /outside/near to/under/over/(north/east/west/south) of/ a /regular polygon with X sides/other well-defined shape/irregular shape/

#+begin_quote
  drawn
#+end_quote

/carved/molded out of (claylike substance)/laid out in (stringlike substance)/imagined/

#+begin_quote
  on the ground
#+end_quote

on /a table/a rock/dirt/tile/concrete/the wall/paper/

#+begin_quote
  light a black candle nearby
#+end_quote

(Vast numbers of different colour object, non-candle objects, and locations could be placed here)

#+begin_quote
  then
#+end_quote

(ah, so order is important? The candle has to some first?)

#+begin_quote
  slit the throat
#+end_quote

(body parts other than the throat? Destruction by other means, e.g. fire?)

#+begin_quote
  of a chicken
#+end_quote

(other animals?)

#+begin_quote
  no older than 22 weeks
#+end_quote

(older/younger is another bit of uncertainty, and the 22-week figure is probably a good six or seven more bits)

#+begin_quote
  outdoors full moon cloudless night
#+end_quote

Okay. So, then, considering those requirements: an early guess as to a useful spell will involve putting a suffering patient on the specially prepared Testing Floor (consisting of dozens of shapes, all over the place, in a variety of mediums, colours, and shapes) The testers will then carefully light all of close on a hundred candles, then carefully extinguish them all, then activate a great variety of other things (honking horns, juggling, blowing whistles, etc.) - a process which may take a few hours.

Then the sacrifice. A small animal is destroyed in virtually every way; cut through every major organ, stabbed, beheaded, set alight and burned to ash.

/Then/, just in case the secondary action needs to take place /after/ the sacrifice, all the candles are re-lit (and re-extinguished), the horns are re-honked, whistles are re-blown, and so on. (And then all of this will still fail if it is done indoors, or if the Moon is wrong). In the ritual in question, there are a few elements; the age of the chicken, the inside/outside question, the cloudless sky, and the full moon - that are hard to try more than one of at once. (Apparently a chicken can, in theory, live up to about a dozen years, though it's rare. So, let's assume the median chicken, not slaughtered for meat, lives up to six years; and only for 22 weeks is it suitable, which would be about 7% of the chicken's life - let's say about four bits of uncertainty. Then the sky - let's assign two bits for different levels of cloudiness. The Moon - full, waning gibbous, half, waning crescent, new, waxing crescent, half, waxing gibbous - that's eight clear states, so another three bits. Indoors/outdoors is one bit. So, ten bits of uncertainty at least; even with the procedure described above, the odds of finding the spell are no better than one in a /thousand/. And that's before considering whether it /has/ to be a chicken.)

And you never, ever, find a ritual that doesn't do exactly what you intended it would do.

--------------

What I'm getting at is that, for the second class of wizard - the new-spell-hunters - finding a single new spell can be expected to be the culmination of /years/ of trying anything and everything (and cost hundreds of chickens, puppies, kittens, and so forth along the way). Now, it might be that there are actually hundreds of spells that cure gout - and it's merely a matter of coincidence which one a researcher runs across first - but, be that as it may, the knowledge of a spell (especially one that's been properly pared down to its base components) is going to be an /incredibly/ valuable piece of information. Most research wizards would have good reason to be wary of spell thieves (they'd probably keep their notes in code, at the very minimum) and a new spell - especially a new /useful/ spell - could probably be sold for quite a bit (though a cunning wizard might rather opt to sell his spellcasting /services/, casting the spell for a fee, secure in the knowledge that no-one else will be able to figure it out for several years - perhaps even using sleight-of-hand to hide a few crucial parts of the spell if he suspects he's being observed. Imagine being the only person who knows how to cure gout...)
