The smallest spell I currently have in the book requires the user to draw a circle with a drop of blood, which gives a preternatural sense of where people are for a few minutes. Generally speaking, strength of the spell correlates to power, with the weakest possible sacrifice being something like a pinch of salt or a strand of hair.

I think there's probably no way around going through and compiling a list of spells that appear in the book, but that doesn't seem terribly fun.
