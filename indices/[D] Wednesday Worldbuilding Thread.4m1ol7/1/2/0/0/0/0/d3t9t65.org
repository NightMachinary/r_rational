Yeah, that means you have a lot of work ahead for you in defining your magic system. If you've designed the ritual system and the specific effects for each spell, that means you can tweak the effects as needed. I'm going through an emergent system phase right now myself, and I'm coming into just that problem of how I can maintain power levels realistically without anything too arbitrary with the magic system.
