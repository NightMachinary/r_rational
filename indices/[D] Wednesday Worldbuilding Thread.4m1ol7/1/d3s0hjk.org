I have a ritual magic system that needs some inspecting (if not work). Spells consist of:

- Ritual: The things you do.
- Sacrifice: The thing you give up.
- Intent: What you're trying to do.

If you're missing any one of those elements, the spell silently fails. A typical spell can be rigidly described like this:

- This spell cures gout. Place the patient within a circumscribed pentacle drawn on the ground, light a black candle nearby, then slit the throat of a chicken no older than 22 weeks. This spell must be done outdoors under a full moon on a cloudless night.

Or:

- This ritual creates a pocket of breathable air that surrounded the practitioner, which lasts for a single hour. Find a man with at least seven living trueborn sons. Mark his incisors with the medium of your choice. Suffocate or drown him. Remove a marked tooth and crush it beneath the heel of your left foot. Both incisors can be used in this way.

Rituals tend to only care whether you've met the minimum. If you light two black candles instead of one, the ritual will still work fine. If the ritual calls for a drop of blood and you supply a gallon, that works fine too. Overdoing it doesn't make the ritual more powerful. Some rituals are dead simple, while some are quite complex. Only one spell per sacrifice, but you can reuse your ritual components. (Spells are arbitrated by spirits, but that's a whole different thing. Assume that cheesing definitions isn't low-hanging fruit and there's no way to ask the spirits what it is they want.)

I /think/ this segregates out into two different classes of wizardly activity. The first are wizards who just use known rituals, and the worldbuilding impact of those is dependent mostly on what the rituals are capable of doing (but there are a lot of rituals, too many to enumerate here).

The second are wizards who are hunting new spells. They would naturally try to cast as wide a net as possible; if you know that rituals often involve lighting a candle, you would light one for trial and error, since there's never a penalty. Because candle color, scent, and wick all matter, you would light lots and lots of candles all at once. Because you know that inscribed and circumscribed shapes matter, you would probably put them all over the place. Because you don't know the threshold of the sacrifice, you would probably overdo it some, spilling lots of blood. They would try to intend as many things as possible while doing the spell.

Once they found a spell that worked, they would dutifully write down all the circumstances, then either work at narrowing down the /actual/ requirements, or just using it as it was done the first time.
