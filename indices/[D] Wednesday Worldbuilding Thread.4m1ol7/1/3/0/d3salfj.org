Yeah, Unsong basically sunk another project of mine, which had magical factories full of wizards saying different permutations of syllables as a major plot point. That's 55K words down the drain ... here the guesswork isn't very much part of the plot, since this type of magic is illegal and most individual practitioners don't have the resources to test permutations over and over, even if they can narrow their parameters down.

But yes, it's very possible for practitioners to be confused about what their spell(s) are actually doing, and some spells can multicast in a way that makes it seem like it's a single spell that depends on quantity.
