Is there any way of discovering / creating new spells other than by guesswork? I thought Unsong covered that pretty well, with its sweatshops of workers reading out candidate spells to find the one-in-a-billion that works.

Is it possible to cast several spells at once - for example, if you have a spell whose sacrifice component is "spill a drop of blood", and you spill a thousand drops of blood, could you use that to cast the spell a thousand times over? If you manage to satisfy the requirements for two distinct spells at once (bearing in mind that each sacrifice can only fuel one spell), could you cast them simultaneously? Could there be a ritual that everyone thinks is a single spell but is actually casting three or four spells whose requirements overlap?
