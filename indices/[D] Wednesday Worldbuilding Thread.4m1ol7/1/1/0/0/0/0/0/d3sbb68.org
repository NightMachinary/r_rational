All sacrifice requires some amount of destruction of the sacrificed object (just offering it doesn't work), but sometimes failure (or even success) leaves behind something that can be used for a different spell. For example, you might test for a spell that requires you to kill a chicken, but if that fails, you still have a chicken corpse and can test any spell you think might require a chicken bone.
