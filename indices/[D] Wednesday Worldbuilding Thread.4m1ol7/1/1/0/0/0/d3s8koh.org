The caster is considered to be the one who makes the sacrifice, so you'd need multiple sacrifices in order to get it working. If the sacrifice involves slitting a chicken's throat, then you'd need to have both people killing their own chicken. But yes, that could work if you wanted to do trial and error a bit faster and with less cost.
