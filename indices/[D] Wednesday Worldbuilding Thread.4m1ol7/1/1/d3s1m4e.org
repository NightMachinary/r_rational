Is there any pattern as to what kind of effect you get based on the spell? If so, you could at least choose which general area of magic you wanted to research new spells in.

Also, how exact does the Intent need to be? Can you just slap "For enemies" on there, or do you need to repeat spell research over and over again with slight variations in guesses as to which kind of zombie your dread ritual might raise?
