Yeah, I've been working on editing it up and getting back into the groove. My plan is to do /Glimwarden/ three weeks a month and spend the other week on either /The Timewise Tales/ (which is in beta right now) or /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ (though probably not sharing any of that until either the whole thing is done or I sprint to the end during the upcoming NaNo).
