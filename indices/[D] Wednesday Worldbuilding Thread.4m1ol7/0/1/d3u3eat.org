It's always funny when you bump into coincidences like that. Not too long ago I was writing a rules post for my quest, and I picked a couple of random names for the people in the examples. I showed this to one of my co-GMs to get a go / no-go on whether it should become officially sanctioned. That worthy read through it and said "Why are my parents fighting ninja?" Apparently I picked zirs parents' names out of thin air.
