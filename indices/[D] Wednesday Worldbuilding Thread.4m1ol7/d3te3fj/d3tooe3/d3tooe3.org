Dresden Files does this. It's not a Rationalist series, but it's entertaining and the idiot balls are not too plentiful. Takes place in present day Chicago, the main character is a wizard detective, and most people don't believe in magic. Many different kinds of faeries exist, as do vampires, who range from emotion feeders to sex feeders to blood drinkers, as do monsters like Native American Skinwalkers, as do gods and demons and angels (More powerful beings aren't seen very often, and mostly stay in their own realms). I highly recommend the series as entertaining, but if you are a picky reader I suggest you start at book 3 or 4. The author never got anything published before Dresden Files, and the first two books are way less well written and edited than the rest. Book 3 focuses on vampires, and book 4 on faeries. Normal people can see the supernatural just fine, they just don't get exposed to it, and when they do it's usually because something eats them. Supernatural nations don't want the mortals to know about them, because humans are major assholes, and if you somehow convinced a nuclear power that Fairyland existed, they might get Clever Ideas.
