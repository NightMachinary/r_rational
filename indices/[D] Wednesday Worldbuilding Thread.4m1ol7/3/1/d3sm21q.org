[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gate_(novel_series)][Gate: Thus the JSDF Fought There]] has a modern military (the Japanese Self-Defence Forces) invading a bronze-age magical world, and doesn't just do curbstomping. There's diplomacy, there's foreign relations, and above all, the JSDF and Terran governments dealing with a really nasty First Contact scenario.

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1632_series][1632 series of novels]] deals with a West Virginian mining town magically sliced out of time and popped back into Germany near the Thirty Years' War. Coal miners versus calvary, but with acute knowledge of their resource limitations. ([[http://www.baen.com/1632.html][1632 itself]] is legally available free online) This series is part of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assiti_Shards_series][larger universe of fiction dealing with those displacement effects]], and has a serious fan writing community.
