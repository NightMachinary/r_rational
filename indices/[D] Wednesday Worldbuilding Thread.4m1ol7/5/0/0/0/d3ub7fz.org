As I said, they are not too plentiful, and I do enjoy the series and have read everything at least twice. Most of it more than that. Still, there were a few more. Spoilers for you nolrai, obviously.

In the second book, Murphy does not listen to one thing Harry says. Sure, she's feeling hurt and betrayed because he lied about one thing, and he's a suspect. But she hired him in the first place because she knew something really scary was going down, and yet she doesn't even let him explain or warn her about anything. Normally when you have a suspect you /want/ to let them talk, especially when there's a serial killer out there who may or may not be them.

Speaking of Murphy, in the later books, when she's been told about and accepted the reality of magic and the different factions... She knows about the swords. She knows that they are extremely major ancient artefacts with lots of extra pesky rules attached. And she just decides that she's the one to hold on to them. Against the advice and will of Harry /and/ the church. For /years/. Aaaand it's broken. And it's only the power of plot that saves her from the consequences of that.

Speaking of the last book, there were two more in that one. The Archangel risks what seems to be roughly 33% of the military might of heaven to make sure this one specific mortal can take part in a bank heist. Either he has perfect foreknowledge and there is no free will (Which, yes, is a concept that doesn't make sense, but this guy is supposed to be Christian, where Free Will is a big thing), or he gambles with eternity over a small collection of no doubt very useful weapons. Still, that was a xanathos gambit if ever I've seen one.

Also in the last book: Nicodemus is 2000 years old. I know he's super evil and all that, but how can be such a successful villain if he's this extremely stupid and short sighted? He's got the Word of Queen Mab that Harry will not betray first, and that he will help as well as he can. Harry isn't even expecting payment (Beyond a little money Nicodemus can easily afford). And still he betrays. And before that, he doesn't even order Harry to help him get the thing he wants, but some other thing in the same room, leaving Harry wiggle room to steal the thing he /really/ wants. No matter how cartoonishly evil you are, when you are dealing with a supernatural creature that *always* keeps her promises, just tell her what it is you want to steal. That's so infuriatingly obvious.

I'm still excited for the rest of the series, but the last book was definitely one of my least favourite ones, just because there were too many stupid decisions made only because the plot demanded it.
