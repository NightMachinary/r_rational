I've been struggling with how intent actually works. You can't just have a generic "do stuff" that satisfies any result, but you don't need to be extremely specific. How about ... you don't need to specify magnitude, duration, direction, or range, if any apply. But you do need to get fairly close to the actual effect; if the spell cures the causes and symptoms of gout, then "cure gout" works, or "cure the ailment that's causing joint pain", but simply "cure any ailments" would be too broad.

(If someone has a formalization for this, I would appreciate it, but there's an arbitrating authority in the form of spirits, so it's not entirely necessary.)

The system also, /should/ work such that you can chain multiple effects together, so long as one of them is the correct one. In other words "cure gout, cure chlamydia, cure bone cancer" would work even if the spell only cures gout. The practitioner is then limited by how many things they can intend to do at once.
