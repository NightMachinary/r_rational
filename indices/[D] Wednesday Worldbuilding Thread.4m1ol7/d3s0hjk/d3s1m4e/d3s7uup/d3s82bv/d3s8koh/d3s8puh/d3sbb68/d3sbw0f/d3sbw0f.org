All right. Well, spell research seems extremely resource intensive. Which is also good news! In a world like that, I would not expect to see any spells at all that require human sacrifice (Unless there are unearthly beings that occasionally dole out knowledge of new spells). Is spell 'power'/usefulness at all correlated with the preciousness of the sacrifice? If not I'd just focus all research on the cheapest possible things that can be sacrificed.
