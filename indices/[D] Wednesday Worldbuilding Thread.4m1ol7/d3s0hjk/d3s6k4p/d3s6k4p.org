Interesting. I like how you buffer failure with the 'ritual silently fails' - instead of having a more FMA-style "you lost your limbs, and your brother's body has been absorbed".

Are there limits on how small the smallest spell can be? If I was a mage I would be interested in researching the effects of smaller and smaller rituals and seeing if I could get a combinations of small rituals into a large effect. Or could I sacrifice the results of one ritual to feed another?
