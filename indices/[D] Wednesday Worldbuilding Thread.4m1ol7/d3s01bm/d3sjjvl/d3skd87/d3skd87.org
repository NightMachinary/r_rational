I think that's actually addressed in the series - while there is magic anyone can use, most schools either take a) too much time and investment to do two or b) expressly limit the other forms of magic you can use, I.e. the Dragon Slayer's physical transformation or Satan Soul's focus specifically on demonic possession. Most magical items require the expertise to wield actual weapons plus the magical competence to use those weapons without exhausting yourself. Celestial keys are limited by their rarity, and the fact that they require a contract.

I'm fairly certain that it's some kind of attribute point deficiency that forces people to go into one field of magic. Like, there's a specialty they're restricted to or something - Erza is explicitly shown to be competent in many kinds of magic, but that's because she collects an impressive amount of magical weapons and armor. Her actual specialty is Telekinesis.

I don't know, really. The magic is just whatever the author saw fit to include, and any trend I enforce will lose something. That being said, there's a lot of things I think would be really cool if the characters were just a /bit/ smarter.
