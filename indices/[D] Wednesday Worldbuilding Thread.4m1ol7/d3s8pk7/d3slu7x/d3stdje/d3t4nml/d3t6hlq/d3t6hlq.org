Assuming the wish would work, the enchanted item would definitely become a way to facilitate learning and understanding. It may have a memetic/magical property that inspires people to share it with others, but they would still be able to choose whether or not they want to. If someone wanted to get better at math and they had some sheets of paper in front of them when they wished it, then the papers would turn into a form which would help them in the most effective way.

There is a hard limit to where there is nothing which directly affects someone's mind... Enchanted objects can't insert knowledge directly, but they can help people understand if they read the document or use the object.

You have a good point about the stacking objects, so I'm thinking of making a limit of one active object per person at a time. Like if a person is under the effects of the Super man costume, they can't use the Harry Potter wand they wished up until they take off the Super Man costume.
