  Maybe the word limit should actually be a conceptual limit on how much a person can concentrate on at once. For most people, this is around 30 words worth of wish, longer or shorts depending on their efficiency at conceptualization and their memory.

Okay, this reinstates that limit, quite neatly (and allows for a few plot-critical characters to bend the limit at the same time, very nice. Well crafted).
