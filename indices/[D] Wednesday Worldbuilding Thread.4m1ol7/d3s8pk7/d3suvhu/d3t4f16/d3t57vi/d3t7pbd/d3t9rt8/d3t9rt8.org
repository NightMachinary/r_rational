  The magic would still grant a specific lethal object. It would be up to the person wishing to make that revenge real

I guess it depends for how many revenge fantasies are purely fantasies. I guess you could use this for an author tract... if you have a grim view of humanity, then just getting lethal items is enough to motivate people to get violent and you are looking at a lot of bloodbaths. If you have a more optimistic view... even then, 1/10,000, 1/100,000, 1 in a million, either way there are going to be a few Columbine level events. And given the way the media reacts they are going to be emphasized just as much if not more than all the people with healing items volunteering at hospitals.

Imagine these kind of events, all of them that might have happened in a year, happening all at once because they would-be killers now have the means to do it. Now imagine if all of them have powerful items that put them at a level where they can get 10-30 people instead of 0-2, with the occasional lucky power getting over 100-1000. Now imagine the media reaction which would emphasize the most sensationalist aspects.

Your best bet for avoiding this in story is if a lot of would be superheros are out trying to superhero in the first couple of weeks after the wishing hour. Even then, its going to take sensory powers (does this violate the no mind interference rule), pre-cog powers, or rapid emergency communication powers to get the heros to the right place at the right time.

And that gives me a superhero snippet idea. A comic fan, who really obsessively knows super man well (and thus because of their clear concept of "superman" has a proportionately powerful and multi-functional power set with all of superman's abilities at a decent level, i.e. super hearing, super sight, laser vision, freeze breath, super speed, etc.) goes out to superhero. They get contacted by someone with an item that contacts the right person for the job. This person has teamed up with someone with an item for sensing tragedies. The superman spends the first week stopping all kinds of disaster... school shootings, empowered terrorists launching attacks. It could be a deconstruction of the kind of psychological trauma that such a superman would experience as they fly around nearly nonstop just trying stop the worst events. You could also push a moral about the balance of good and evil in humanity. For every bullied teenager or just laid off employee or terrorist ready to cut lose, there are 10 people who are willing to be a hero....

Another story snippet idea. A teenage who has a powerful item from a revenge fantasy, decides instead to be the better person and be a superhero. Interesting twists... they have to stop someone who originally wished for benevolent items but then changed their mind and uses them for crime after the end of the wishing hour.
