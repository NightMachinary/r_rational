In building my own world, I give little nods when I know where ideas came from. Since coming up with names for everything is literally the most difficult thing in the universe, I often slap a borrowed name on such things as well, even when I end up with an idea that is very different from where the inspiration came from. And getting the reference is never anywhere near expected or necessary. But that said, I imagine (If I ever get shit finished) that readers will still go 'oh hey, event/name/location abc seems to be a reference to work xyz, hey maybe there's a twist coming related to abc similar to what happened in xyz'. And usually that's correct, even if the details are different. The seemingly throwaway royal guard who shares a name with the poor guard in The Three Musketeers does indeed go on to be manipulated into assassinating his lord for the woman he loves, and the ancient ruin full of lava that shares a name with a video game location does indeed turn out to have a hidden connection to a source of evil creatures.

But, not everything is meant to be a reference, and there are only so many different names and terms I can think of. So reading /Berserk/ for the first time, as much as I love the manga and will probably end up pilfering a few ideas from it, I learned yesterday that my most noble, loyal and well intentioned general who is also a close friend of the main character shares a title and rare hair colour with a Berserk character who is a noble, loyal and well intentioned general who is also a close friend of the main character. Right up until [[#s][Berserk spoiler]], which doesn't happen in my world. The similarity is complete coincidence, but now I want to leave it in just to troll everyone who picks up on me giving similar meta clues in other cases.

...This is not really a 'problem that needs to be worked through'. I just thought the worldbuilding thread was a reasonable place to mention it. Does anyone else derive joy from the idea of trolling their readers?
