So like Macbeth? It's more common than you think, but I'm pretty sure it generally falls under tragedy. In the book /Seven Basic Plots/, the author mentions it as sort of a dark version of the rags-to-riches story where everything goes right for the protagonist except they fail that final test where they mature as a person.
