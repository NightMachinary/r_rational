Do the intelligence wishes flat out fail, or are the diverted into much weaker effects relevant to the wish. I.e. a kid wishes to be smarter at math so he can pass his test. Instead he gets a piece of paper that shows him the perfect practice problems for learning the math.

Intelligence doesn't work... what about piping knowledge into ones mind? Is all mind interaction banned? If so, that is a pretty solid limit.

Even with these limits, wishing for powerful and diverse divination items could still be game breaking though. You can't wish the knowledge into your head directly, but you could for example wish that a piece of paper shows the appropriate mathematical equation to any problem that you concentrate on, then wish that a calculator can solve any equation/mathematical problem that you can think of while holding it. In between these two things, you could dominate the stock market (save for other powerful wishes), and in general address any problem approachable by mathematics. Stack on several other divination items and you are like a Thinker 8 in worm (instantly blackmail people, find out bank passwords, manipulate others with ease, set up plots, etc.)
