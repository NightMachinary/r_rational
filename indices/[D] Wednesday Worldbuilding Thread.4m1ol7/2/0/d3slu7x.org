So I read your post from last world building Wednesday, and I really liked the response that mentioned you should start from clear cut limits instead of trying to cover all the loopholes of unlimited wishes.

These rules are a good start, but I think I already see some loopholes and possible additional things to cover, if you want to avoid a CK class event in story that is.

  2) On that note, there is a maximum number of words for a wish. No enchantment can take more than approximately 30 or so words, or 180 characters, whichever is least.
#+end_quote

I don't think that will help much against the smartest people that figure out the process earliest in the hour. A bunch of separate items with direct and specific, but general usage and flexible wishes would still be really OP. Maybe to balance this, people are limited in how many wish items they can use at once? (Unless you are going for a CK class scenario). Otherwise, someone wishes for a bunch of interacting intelligence enhancements, which would give them the thought power to get even more efficient intelligence enhancing wishes until they reach whatever limit their is/go insane/ thinker headaches like in worm. They then use their intelligence to ask really effective wishes and basically dominate the setting afterwards.

  4) The affected item doesn't have any concept of ownership. (Anyone grabbing the enchanted device can use it)
#+end_quote

Whoever made wishes related to stealing/taking things and/or finding magic items becomes a God. They use their initial item stealing enchanted objects to steal more wish items, which makes them more powerful/intelligent, which they can then in turn use to steal more. This also ties into the need to limit how many items a person can use at once. Maybe have the enchanted items be weaker for other people besides the wisher? Or have the fate/luck/other phenomena tend to redirect them back to the original wisher unless freely given or something like that. Otherwise you will have runaway power grabs going on.

#+begin_quote
  The wish cannot affect free will directly.
#+end_quote

Does this include the wisher themselves? Might be a way to nerf intelligence items and other mind boosting runaway sequences. Their attempts to boost their intelligence are stopped because anything more than moderate intelligence boosts or very specific abilities would otherwise alter their personality.

#+begin_quote
  Well, because he wished that, any time he wears the super man costume his mom bought him at the store, he gains the power of superman.
#+end_quote

If wishes can grant up to that power level, they are going to be majorly OP. People who wished for multi-function power sets would basically be gods... To nerf... maybe the kid just gets generic flying brick powers that are much more limited? (Unless XK/CK reality ending scenario is the intended plotline)

Other limits you should consider:

- How does the hour affect things globally? If it is the same hour all at once across the world, people in some regions are going to be sleeping and this will upset the balance of power majorly (and you are trying to avoid world ending scenarios?). How about for each person the hour starts whenever noon is for them... hmm but then later time zones would have the advantage of the earlier time zones experience, skewing things as well. What if it is the same hour globally, and people mysteriously woke up at the start of the hour? Might tip some people off... Maybe magic stops the spread of information initially? Or the items are weaker until the hours has finished. Or the hours occur randomly different for each person within a 12 hour period, so not enough time for the information to spread. Or let the chips fall where they may and write about the global consequences.

- Can enchanted objects make more magic. Like if someone wished for an item that can empower other items would that work? Or if they wished for more generic magic power... lets say Harry Potter style wizard powers into a wand, could they use that wand to breed magical creatures and plants, then use the parts from those creatures and plants to make another wand. I do have an idea for balance and a way for this to tie into an overarching scientific investigation plotline... The magic is limited in conceptual priority by extent that is had been replicated from the original item. So in my HP wand example its possible to make more wands, but they will always, no matter what, be weaker than the original wand. If they are matched against an "original" enchanted item (i.e. not derived from another item, from the original wishing hour itself) the original item will always beat the derived item, unless conceptual/elemental rock paper scissors heavily favors the derived item. For example, the superman cape kid can resist all of the knock-off wands, even if someone tried casting an AK on him, however a spell to transfigure kryptonite would weaken him, even if done with a knockoff wand. Also, for further balance and/or to limit munchkin, deriving items weakens the original to some extent.

- Overall, it could be an issue if magic is getting stronger and stronger from items interacting with each other and bootstrapping into stronger magical effects/items. i.e. imagine a Dresdenverse wizard interacting with derived items created with Harry-Potter magic, which in turn are utilized by someone who had Nasu-verse mage style powers. Eventually you would get runaway reality warping that dominates the rest of reality. Conversely, if there was no way to derive more magic, and the enchanted items didn't get any durability or such, then there would be the underlying worry that they would stop working or otherwise fail. What happens when the last healing item breaks after hospitals and doctors and pharmaceutical companies have come to rely on them? You could create a balance where attempting to break an item just causes its magic to spread out further and strengthen other items. So the Harry Potter wand becomes able to do more spells as other items are broken and their enchantment passes on. In between this and the derived item limit, this could create a long-term balance in the level of magical power in the world. Older items that are protected and conserved slowly gain in power as other items are broken or used to derive more but weaker items, until those preserved items are eventually brought into use or broken themselves.

- Figuring out all the limits of magic and the rules could be a long-term plot point, or a background detail exploited in clever ways, depending on if you set your story during or well after the wishing hour.

- Going off the Harry Potter wand example and the superman example, for another possible nerf, wishing to be a wizard/witch/mage/super hero doesn't grant you their full power set, it just grants you the most prominent abilities/powers as you think of the wish. So the wand could maybe do patronous, expliarmous and stupefy and a few transfigurations, but not use the more obscure abilites, like the enchanting used to create items/breed magical creatures that was done off-screen. The superman cape gets flight and durability, but not the freeze breath or the laser vision unless the kid was specifically thinking about them in association with superman also (and maybe the flight and durability are weaker as a result of splitting the wish into so many functions). This would also limit runaway interaction of magic items.

- I think enchanted items need some kind of limit on implied information processing, otherwise you get strong AI in an item, or just a few combination of items. Even just someone wishing for an item that would give them answers about wishes would be really OP. (Then you could ask the item for some reality-breaking combination of items to wish for.) Maybe the implied free will limits prediction/precog items to large scale extrapolation of human behavior and strictly natural phenomena. (Predict a hurricane precisely, but only get a general probability for a terrorist attack)

Let me know what you think. I can elaborate on any of these ideas if they sound good are useful to you. Also, it might help if you have plot/characters, and you go back and solidify the rules after thinking about the direction for them. Hmm... I've got a few snippets in mind about the first people trying to test/exploit their magic items, nothing too long though.
