  This is not a limit.

It sounds like wishes that relate to other wishes in general need to not work to stop runaway loops and exploits. To top your example, instead of wishing for a new language, the person could wish for an item that tells them the ideal wishes to make for their preferences/values. They then make all of those wishes. Maybe the item would suggest your strategy also to get around the word limit.

Maybe the word limit should actually be a conceptual limit on how much a person can concentrate on at once. For most people, this is around 30 words worth of wish, longer or shorts depending on their efficiency at conceptualization and their memory. Thus the redefine "blorg" in Wishtralian strategy wouldn't work because the person couldn't concentrate on 50 pages worth of English at once. If the person already has an imagined language with some highly compact concepts they were used to thinking in and wanted to wish with, this might be a small advantage over their native language.

  This is dangerous. How many primary school children have wished that the strict teacher who gave them detention for not doing their homework would die?

They way Dwood15 describes it, it sounds like they would get a lethally enchanted item as opposed to it automatically killing their teacher. So it wouldn't instant kill, but there would be a lot of magical analogs to school shootings in the next few weeks.
