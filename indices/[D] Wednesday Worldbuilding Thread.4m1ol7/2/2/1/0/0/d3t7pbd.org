You have a good point with that, but if you remember from last week, the magic would generally interpret the wishes in a more positive light allowing the person to romance the individual. It would leave as many of the actions up to the person making the wish unless they were super specific and not violating free will. *(EDIT: I see you mentioned lethal objects. The magic would still grant a specific lethal object. It would be up to the person wishing to make that revenge real)*

The other thing is that may have to be a hole I have to leave open. The magic system isn't going to be bound by any moral code, so it'll be up to the people to be bound morally. Even though the magic won't do anything infringing on free will, people with malicious intent can still have physical power over others.
