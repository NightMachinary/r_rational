Thanks for the anime recommendation!

  I'm mostly interested in group dynamics and which demographics would have the most enchanted items.

Sounds like you have some solid ideas for the wishing hour itself. I think the next most important thing to this is how the magic of the items can be distributed (making more magic from existing items, stealing items from existing users, using multiple items at once, trying to get bigger effects out of item synergies, etc.)
