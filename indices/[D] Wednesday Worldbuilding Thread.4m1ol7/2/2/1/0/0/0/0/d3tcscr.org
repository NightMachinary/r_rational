You have really good story ideas and aspects of humanity we could explore. I imagine that this 'superman' would be absolutely willing to do his thing and save people, but grow weary of the effects of what transpires, especially if it's a worldwide phenomena. There's a decent anime called Charlotte that explores this, iirc it's on Crunchyroll if you were interested in checking it out. Sadly they only got to make 24 episodes so the exploration of the human condition is extremely condensed.

I've basically got the rules down for this 'wishing hour', and a decent way of preventing the death of all life on earth as we know it. If someone figured out wishing hour, and were perceptive enough, they might wish for an item which could prevent catastrophic events, or give them immunity from the effects of all other's magical items. One thing I could explore as well is discovery time. There's potential someone wishes something evil, but doesn't realize what their now-enchanted item does until long after the intense emotion has passed.

As far as the magic power goes, time of day/day of week/season of year for a 'wishing hour' makes a massive difference in the kinds of things people wish for, for example - those in extreme distress would most likely be the ones wishing for revenge, while those who had it light wouldn't have as big of an incentive to go on a murder spree.

If it's akin to a Lunar eclipse where only those under its shadows could make a wish, there could be swaths of people with powers, and a majority of people without it. If it were attached to cosmological coincidences like that, the effects of the 'wishing hour' would be dramatically focused on certain areas, causing massive imbalance. I'm still working on if I want a blanket "everyone can make a wish" or if I want it attached to some predictable event. You could have people working to predict when it would return, and based on how confident they are on the predictions if it ever returns (albeit to a different location on the planet) and if the effects of the first were dramatic enough, there could even be interventions from nations and perhaps attempts from governments to secure the regions where the wishing hour would affect.

Edit: I'm mostly interested in group dynamics and which demographics would have the most enchanted items.
