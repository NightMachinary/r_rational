I can recall thinking of some very specific revenge fantasies after being bullied in middle school. Even only allowing the most specific wishes to manifest as lethal enchanted items, this is still going to be a pretty dangerous number of revenge fantasies ready to carry out. Also, I think a dangerous fraction (not a high percentage, but dangerous in total number) of teenage wishes are going to be kind of rapey even if they can't directly violate free will.
