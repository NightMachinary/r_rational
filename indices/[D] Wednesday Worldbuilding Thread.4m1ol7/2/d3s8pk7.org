If you haven't noticed I'm using this thread to continue my thoughts about my stories. I don't know if I'll ever put the pen to the paper, so if any of my posts inspire a short story or anything, please let me know.

I've thought a lot about last week's weekly building thread, especially the 'wishing hour' thought, and I've decided utter chaos would erupt which may or may not cause the destruction of life as we know it in an [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-234197][XK-class Reality-Ending scenario]].

Now, I'm not a big fan of stuff like that, so I've thought about this. A period of time where items become enchantable with magic power. Any physical object during this 'wishing hour' can gain some magical property based on a persons wish. For example, a kid wearing a super man out fit wishes he could become super man. Well, because he wished that, any time he wears the super man costume his mom bought him at the store, he gains the power of superman. Same with practically any person who wishes that during wishing hour

This enchanting needs the following rules to be met in order for the enchanting to work:

1) A moderately direct and specific wish. "I wish I was good looking" wouldn't work, non-specific.

2) On that note, there is a maximum number of words for a wish. No enchantment can take more than approximately 30 or so words, or 180 characters, whichever is least.

3) Specific wishes can be spoken or unspoken. Less specific wishes must be spoken.

4) The affected item doesn't have any concept of ownership. (Anyone grabbing the enchanted device can use it)

5) The wish cannot affect free will directly. Perhaps a person could wish that everyone would understand the beauties inherent in Marxism, and a nearby paper becomes enchanted with memetic qualities, which transfer Marxism and the desire for everyone to understand it, but that doesn't make the person want Marxism or begin to advocate the people rising up and taking control of the means of production. At the least, if everyone were infected by that enchanted piece of paper, they would end up more knowledgeable.

Thoughts about these rules? Too easy to break? Too rigid? Not clear?
