I'm chasing a [[https://blastfarmer.tumblr.com/post/143509439178/sinesalvatorem-comparativelysuperlative-so][plotbunny that places Uruk-hai armed with gunpowder weapons in Lake-town at the time Smaug attacks the town]].

How would you defeat Smaug, given the following constraints? I have my ideas about how to do it, but I want to be sure I'm not missing anything obvious.

The rules are a mishmash of J. R. R. Tolkein's /Hobbit/ and Peter Jackson's /The Hobbit/:

- Only the dwarf-forged Black Arrow can pierce Smaug's hide, because of its metallurgical properties.
- The Black Arrow is a normal-sized 30-inch-long, 1cm-diameter, bodkin-point arrow, but entirely of Dwarven steel (including the shaft). The fletching is goose.
- Bard is captain of the guard of Laketown.
- The Master of Lake Town is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Vetinari][wanna-be Vetinari]] who acts posh.
- Soldiers riding Wargs can travel from Isengard to Rivendell in one week.
- Soldiers riding Wargs can travel from Isengard to Esgaroth in ~15 days.
- [[http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Thorondor][Thorondir]] is not involved in the events of this story. The eagles available are a [[https://blastfarmer.tumblr.com/post/144076547288/blastfarmer-sinesalvatorem][Minimum Viable Eagle]] of 500 pounds, which works out to a [[https://blastfarmer.tumblr.com/post/144568372953/if-you-want-to-improve-you-eagle-estimation-you][30-foot wingspan and 250-lb carrying capacity]].
- Isengard has developed field guns, which are size-equivalent to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_BL_12-pounder_6_cwt][the Ordnance BL 12-pounder 6cwt]].
- Guns can be hauled from Isengard to Esgaroth in ~30 days.
- Isengard has magically-enhanced R&D divisions, sufficient to develop new weapons (assuming compatibility with existing early Industrial Age technologies) within 3 days.
- Isengard only has smoke-producing gunpowder. Smokeless powder hasn't been developed yet, mostly because of formulation issues.
- Gandalf, Radagast, and Saruman are cooperating. Glorfindiel is off doing his own thing. Galadriel is diminished after the banishment of Sauron, and is recuperating. Elrond is off doing his own thing.
- The Army of the Hand is a mix of created Uruk-hai and hired Men, Orcs, Goblins and Dwarves. Elves can't be bothered.
- The standard soldier in the Army of the Hand has a 11mm breechloading rifle, a full equip of 100 rounds, a triangular bayonet, a utility knife, light armor, and a warg.
- Saruman's crows are intelligent enough to carry messages on their own, but Saruman can possess the crows for telepresence work.

Here's the fixed timeline:

- October 1: Dol Guldur falls
- October 11: One company of Uruk-hai arrive in Lake Town, to warn the town of the approaching army of Sauron and to fortify it
- October 12: Saruman informed of the "Defeat the dragon" mission requirement
- October 25: Smaug attacks
- October 26: 2 companies reinforcements from Isengard arrive, having been dispatched on October 10
- October 29: 1 company reinforcements from Isengard arrive, dispatched October 13, carrying Isengard-produced physical copies of Bard's Black Arrow. They are not magically dwarf-forged, and so cannot pierce Smaug's hide.
