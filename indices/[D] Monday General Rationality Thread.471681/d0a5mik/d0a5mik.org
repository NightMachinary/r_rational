What's a good way to find out a decent place to volunteer?

I think volunteering is probably something I'd enjoy doing, but it's a bit daunting trying to isolate the best/most effective place. The hard part is how to identify a suitable match.

Ideally, it's something I can sink a part of the weekend into.
