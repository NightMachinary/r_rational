  1) go ask in physics.stackexchange.com and some other physics-related forums what (un)known phenomenon could --- hypothetically (they like downvoting inane questions) --- cause such an effect.
#+end_quote

I'll definitely keep that in mind as an option. For now I'm just sticking to [[/r/rational]], and maybe spacebattles, because you guys are fairly likely to humor hypotheticals (and have a lot of experience doing so.)

  1b \ c) go find some more physics kids (undergrads, professor relatives, whatever) and ask them the same.
#+end_quote

I believe that he's not intentionally misrepresenting anything, but there's still a pretty high chance that it's just a minor scientific curiosity. It currently doesn't cost me anything to believe him, but I'd rather not look like a crackpot IRL.

#+begin_quote
  1b \ c) go check the guy for yourself and see that he's not simply attention whoring;
#+end_quote

I'm reasonably certaint he's not, for reasons I won't go into here. He could be, but it's not like believing him is costing me anything, while not believing him would cost me a car trip to prove him wrong.

  2) if still nothing comes up purge your current internet persona, advice the x-guy to do the same and from here on work through i2p\tor
#+end_quote

The benefit to my current internet persona is that I have a /lot/ of stuff posted, as well as several hypotheticals and misleading posts claiming that I wanted to do something like this as a writing experiment. I can easily pass this off as a meta-joke if I need to.

  3) advise him to learn how to properly document scientific studies\experiments and to start doing just that with his daily tries.
#+end_quote

He's been recording this stuff pretty well so far, I'm posting here to see if anyone has ideas for what to control that we might have missed.

#+begin_quote
  4) record his attempts on a high quality camera in a setting that will reveal neither his identity nor his location, then remove all the meta-information from the recording files and put them on an i2p server.
#+end_quote

Unfortunately that's a little out of his price range. I mean, his phone camera is pretty good, but he has some unspecified fears about the NSA. That leaves an older camcorder, and we all know how easy it is to fake footage with lower resolution cameras. /I'm/ convinced for reasons I won't get into here (it has to do with how I initially made contact with him) but I'm not necessarily trying to convince you guys this is real anyways-- if you guys take it as a hypothetical, that's perfectly fine with me as long as you respond seriously.
