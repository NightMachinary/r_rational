I have some pretty convincing evidence, at least to the point where I believe that he isn't /intentionally/ deceiving me about any aspect of the power. It might be something completely explainable by current physics, effectively a false alarm, but for now I'm treating it as real, until experimentation proves or disproves any conjectures we make.

That being said, feel free to not believe me, I just ask that you treat it as a thought exercise for the moment :)
