What do you want exactly? We can't exactly suggest he test new items if the power stopped working. Or if we're trying to determine a natural cause there are a few possibilities.

It could be related to something in his behavior, It could be related to something in the air, Or there could be something in the dust.

A change in one of those might explain why the phenomena is location dependent and stopped working.

That said, My first guess would be something related to static. Since static would account for charge times and interaction with dust if nothing else. I haven't played with static all that much though so I'm not certain it fits all the described phenomena. In any case, you could make a static generator and cross reference the phenomena to see if they match.

Honestly as far as minor superpower gadgets go a personal static generator is one I'd recommend anyway. For the lulz. Speaking of which if it is some supernatural power he could probably disguise it as static anyway. Probably doesn't need to hide it...
