  Under the obvious explanations (magnetism, static electricity, airflow) he should be able to replicate the process by doing much the same thing each time.

Not really. Atmospheric variables change from day to day; it's called weather. "Diverse conditions" doesn't mean you've controlled for everything, particularly when there is /clearly/ some variability of function like you're describing. That reveals dependence, and you don't know what to.

Did you take a measure of humidity, air pressure, particulate content from weather sites when you did these experiments? From any devices specifically in their house? Biometrics? Heart rate, blood pressure, eye dilation, sweat, skin galvanization?

On the crackpot side, emotional state, mood, hunger, thirst, tiredness, physiological arousal? Are any anomalous subjective experiences described, that would be called hallucinations or delusions? Other than the dust thing and the obvious paranoia, I mean.

  To be a bit more specific, his house tends to be rather dusty, and when the action goes off, the dust in a radius of a (up to) few feet of the objects is visibly attracted towards them, although the exact radius depends on objects held.

This, however, would suggest something anomalous, assuming it's even true. Does it appear to act like a force/acceleration? Does it follow an inverse-square law? Is all the dust attracted, or is some left behind? What objects are held and how does radius vary with them?
