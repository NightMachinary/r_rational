  Did you take a measure of humidity, air pressure, particulate content from weather sites when you did these experiments? From any devices specifically in their house? Biometrics? Heart rate, blood pressure, eye dilation, sweat, skin galvanization?

Actually, yes (at least for most of these.) For everything related to the atmosphere, it's a fairly simple matter of just comparing the phenomena to the weather reports-- it's not exactly precise, but so far there's been no observed correlation between the phenomena occurring and differences in the weather. For biometrics, he typically wears a fitbit, and typically observes himself in a mirror to try to see the effect from the different angle (Which works, but hasn't given off much useful data.)

  On the crackpot side, emotional state, mood, hunger, thirst, tiredness, physiological arousal? Are any anomalous subjective experiences described, that would be called hallucinations or delusions? Other than the dust thing and the obvious paranoia, I mean.

He's usually some combination of hungry and thirsty by the time the effect resolves. Interestingly enough, though, it's worked each time he's been eating, as long as he held silverware in each hand. Nothing anomalous psychologically, or at least nothing he's reported. I suppose it's possible, but from my personal judgement of him, it doesn't seem like he'd hold that back. Got nothing on arousal, though. I think he's held a copy of playboy once, but every piece of organic material we tested failed, so results would be inconclusive.

  This, however, would suggest something anomalous, assuming it's even true. Does it appear to act like a force/acceleration? Does it follow an inverse-square law? Is all the dust attracted, or is some left behind? What objects are held and how does radius vary with them?
#+end_quote

It's a little hard to describe exactly, as I've only seen video recordings (where dust doesn't pick up well) but he describes it as the free-floating dust settling into floating bands around the two objects. He's been setting up paper nearby for about a month, and each time it works the dust that falls on the paper lies in fairly neat striations. Not sure on the inverse square law. It's pretty much just dust that was already in the air that's held, as he typically stands up to test. It also works when he sits down, of course, but the effect is more difficult to observe.

edit: yep, I found the playboy test. January 17th, from 4pm to 6pm. Nothing. Other object was a fork, which tends to work more often than not.
