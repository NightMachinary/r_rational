  After hearing this, I doubt that the effect would only occur when your friend holds iron in his hands. In fact, you said that it's strongest when he stands up and a weaker effect when he sits down.

You're right-- he doesn't need to hold iron, just hold something with an iron content.

  So test this by attaching a piece of iron to a string and to minimize human influence, poke it with a stick or some non-organic material when the expected time arrives. I suspect that there is a periodic phenomenon which briefly amplifies magnetic strength twice a day in his hometown. The previous times it occurred was probably due to your friend moving the iron around which made it more obvious when it picked up dust.

That's a really good idea, actually. Now that we know it's iron specifically, he can grab some from his workshop, and the string idea definitely holds.

  I have no idea why times would shift according to the equinoxes. Can you give me the time zone of his town? I want to check the expected time of reversal on the equinox, because if it's something like 12:00 pm, then it's probably human activity causing it, but if it's more like 3:17 am, then it's a natural phenomenon.

Eastern time. I asked him, and he also let me tell you he lives between 45 and 50 north, in case that makes a difference.

  EDIT: You mentioned that he's usually hungry/thirsty when the effect occurs. Is he sure that it's causing him to be hungry/thirsty or it tends to happen at the same time as when he wants to eat/drink?
#+end_quote

It's the second option. It happens around when he used to have breakfast and dinner, so he needs to delay both a bit to make sure he can record the tests.
