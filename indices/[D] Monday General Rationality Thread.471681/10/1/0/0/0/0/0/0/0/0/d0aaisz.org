I have no clue why this would be specific to him and have such a precise change in timing. However, you said that this effect is located in his home town.

Check to see if anyone else has ever had something similar happen to them. Is it a family trait, or can anyone else do it if they did it while in his hometown/house?

If you say yes there are others, then there's probably something going on in his town that involves heavy duty electricity or magnets. Either a business or some regular environmental phenomenon. I'd actually suspect his town to have a lot of lightening storms if it's a phenomenon in nature.

If it's specific to your friend only, then I want to know if the trend reverses based on the equinox. Because you said the trend reversed in December when the winter equinox is December 21st. See if the timing reverses around the spring equinox which is March 20th.

Finally, just play around with a magnet together. If there's something unusual, then he might not have ever noticed thinking it's normal, since he's grown up with it.
