  Also, what's the time range for the effect? Can your friend only do it once, or does he have time to hold a piece of iron, attract dust in one room, put it down, walk into another room, and repeat with another piece of iron? Can he walk around with a piece of iron continuously collecting dust as an easy alternative to vacuuming?

It lasts about 30 seconds. Not exactly (it's a little difficult to time) but within a few seconds of that. Honestly, It's probably something like 29.2 seconds, but the human propensity to like round numbers is screwing with us. If he picks something eligible up /during/ those 30 seconds (it's happened a few times) it works too.

  Okay since he lives in Eastern time, and the effect occurred at about 8:50 am and 5:40 pm on 2/19, then by 3/20 which is 30 days from now and the timing is moving over by a minute per day, then on 3/20 it should occur at about 8:20 am and 6:10 pm respectively with a range of 9 hrs and 50 minutes in between.....

(Out of character, I actually made two pretty bad mistakes tabulating the times. The first one was that each time should have been an hour before (a mix up when converting time zones. I hate them for a reason :P) and the second one I actually don't understand. I've modified the original data set to the correct times, and as an apology, I'm going to give you a hint-- aside from the realization that the phenomena has something to do with magnetism, the single biggest clue I'm leaving as to the explanation are the times combined with the rough latitude. You'll have to look over some previous comments to understand why "he" hasn't realized this, though. I don't actually expect you to get an /exact/ explanation, but once someone gets close enough I'll "figure it out.")

  I have no clue if this is meaningful or what else we can try. Let me know how the string thing works.

No problem. We're guessing that it'll happen around 23:27 UTC, and while he takes a little while to get back to me after tabulating data (And eating dinner), I'll be sure to inform you.

  EDIT: Are you guys sure that this happens only twice a day? Because if no one's ever tried staying up throughout the night, then maybe it happens once every eight hours without anyone realizing it.

Not at all. He thought it was only once a day, but then we found out it happened in the mornings too (by accident, actually. He was eating breakfast.) Of course, the problem with testing whether that happens is that it's, quite frankly, incredibly tedious for him, and while he's /relatively/ sure it's something supernatural, there are still potentially interesting, but natural explanations (especially since we just confirmed it has something to do with either magnetism, electromagnetism, or static electricity.)
