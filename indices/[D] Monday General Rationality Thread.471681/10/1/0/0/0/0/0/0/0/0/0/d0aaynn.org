  I have no clue why this would be specific to him and have such a precise change in timing. However, you said that this effect is located in his home town.

It's not necessarily specific to him, he just wants to keep it relatively quiet so his neighbors don't think he's a crackpot until he gets more information on it. And again, he does want to try and profit from this, at least by submitting it to some Randi Prize equivalent.

  If it's specific to your friend only, then I want to know if the trend reverses based on the equinox. Because you said the trend reversed in December when the winter equinox is December 21st. See if the timing reverses around the spring equinox which is March 20th.

He was gone to visit family from December 18th to January 2nd, and reports that he found out that the trend in times getting later and later must have reversed either around then, or a little later, because when he started at the same time in the morning as the previous day, then waited a little, nothing happened until he moved his time back by thirty minutes a week after returning home. Oh, and the trend where evening times have been getting later and later might be a recent thing too-- he was a less likely to record evening times because it was happening so sporadically when he first started testing, and unfortunately this bad habit took a longer time to break. The data seems pretty strongly in support of the times getting earlier and earlier before he left on the trip (at least, there weren't any occasions where he recorded a later time, providing he used the same clock), but I didn't mention it in the initial paragraph because it was a little iffier.

tl;dr yeah, it seems at least somewhat likely that it did reverse around the winter equinox.
