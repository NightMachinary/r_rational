I feel a bit like an idiot for not asking this earlier, but is the sun rising and setting in that area whenever the effect occurs? I even had a hint to that idea when I realized the connection to the equinoxes. The times roughly match up. I just didn't notice it because I live so far down south.

In addition after wiking [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negaunee,_Michigan][Negaunee, MI]], it mentions the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquette_Iron_Range][Marquette Iron Range]]. I don't know why it would be connected to the sunrise/sunset, but it seems to be a good hypothesis to why the effect occurs and makes sense with your information.

Also if this is true, is there a reason why your friend hasn't noticed that?
