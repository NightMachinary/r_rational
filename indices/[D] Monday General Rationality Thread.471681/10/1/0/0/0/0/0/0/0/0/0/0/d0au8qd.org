After hearing this, I doubt that the effect would only occur when your friend holds iron in his hands. In fact, you said that it's strongest when he /stands/ up and a weaker effect when he sits down.

So test this by attaching a piece of iron to a string and to minimize human influence, poke it with a stick or some non-organic material when the expected time arrives. I suspect that there is a periodic phenomenon which briefly amplifies magnetic strength twice a day in his hometown. The previous times it occurred was probably due to your friend moving the iron around which made it more obvious when it picked up dust.

I have no idea why times would shift according to the equinoxes. Can you give me the time zone of his town? I want to check the expected time of reversal on the equinox, because if it's something like 12:00 pm, then it's probably human activity causing it, but if it's more like 3:17 am, then it's a natural phenomenon.

EDIT: You mentioned that he's usually hungry/thirsty when the effect occurs. Is he sure that it's causing him to be hungry/thirsty or it tends to happen at the same time as when he wants to eat/drink?
