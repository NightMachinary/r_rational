So your friend's ability seems to be operating by taking a piece of iron or something with iron in it, and then the iron attracts dust to it?

There's a couple of complications to that though. What dust is being attracted? Because there's the dust which is formed from skin cells, dust made from dirt, and dust which might be tiny pieces of metal or semi-metallic material. Can you say anything about the type of dust in your friend's house?

When you are talking about "sporadically", what do you mean? Now that your friend knows he needs iron; is he still not having it work multiple times with the same piece of iron in his hands, not all pieces of iron work, or something else?

You said that your friend needs to hold two objects for it to work. Do they both have to be iron or just one of them?

EDIT: Joke idea - has your friend ever taken iron supplements?

EDIT 2: I just read your updates in other comments, and if the effect is only occurring when he has iron in both hands and some iron in the dust, then I suggest getting a strong magnet, a non-magnetic piece of iron, and some iron fillings. First test it yourself to see how the magnet and iron reacts in your hands to the iron fillings and compare how it acts to your friend holding them. In addition, the both of you should play around with the magnet. See if your friend's power is amplifying magnetism. It might be inconsistent due to him expending some sort of energy or charge.
