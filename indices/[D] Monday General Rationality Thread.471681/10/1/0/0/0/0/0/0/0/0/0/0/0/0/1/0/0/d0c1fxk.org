  I feel a bit like an idiot for not asking this earlier, but is the sun rising and setting in that area whenever the effect occurs? I even had a hint to that idea when I realized the connection to the equinoxes. The times roughly match up. I just didn't notice it because I live so far down south.

It seems like sort of an obvious thing to miss... Then again, he's told me he only ever tests at home with the blinds on... And I wouldn't put it past him to have some sort of aluminum foil shielding to prevent observation...

Wait a second, I just need to check back with him to ask him to google sunrise/sunset times.

Edit: turns out that it does. Huh. We're really hitting ourselves over not noticing this.

Edit 2: actually, looking back, our numbers pretty much exactly match with the NOAA website's, which is a little weird. But what causes an electrical phenomena, tied to the sunrise, that has a connection with computer data?

Edit 3: Don't laugh, but he evidently has some solar panels on swiveling mounts. Logically, they /would/ begin their tracking on sunrise, and shut it off on sunset. And they're visible from his window too. But he never saw them, because he was a little too enamored with the idea of discovering magic and paranoid because of it, and I never thought to ask him about whether he owned any nonstandard machinery, because I was having too much fun... Well, it should be fairly simple to test if the phenomena are connected. He just needs to open the blinds and remove anything he has blocking the windows, and we should have the data whenever NOAA predicts the sun will set.
