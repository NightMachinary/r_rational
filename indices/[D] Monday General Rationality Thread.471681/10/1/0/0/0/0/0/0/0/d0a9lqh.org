  There's a couple of complications to that though. What dust is being attracted? Because there's the dust which is formed from skin cells, dust made from dirt, and dust which might be tiny pieces of metal or semi-metallic material. Can you say anything about the type of dust in your friend's house?

He mentioned living near an open-pit mine, once, and he crafts stuff as a hobby (why his house is dusty in the first place) so while I can't give specifics on the dust content, I'd wager it would be relatively high in metal.

  When you are talking about "sporadically", what do you mean?

Two things. The first is that it only works twice each day at most, and the second thing as that it never works at the same time. Today it worked at 12:43 UTC (in the morning) and 23:26 in the afternoon. Yesterday it worked at 12:45 UTC (in the morning) and 23:24 feb 22 in the afternoon. The day before then it worked at 12:47 UTC (in the morning) and 23:23 in the afternoon.

Here's a list, because this is getting a little tedious, actually. Morning times, starting Feb 19 and working backwards:

12:48\\
12:50\\
13:52\\
13:53\\
13:55\\
13:56\\
13:58

Evening times:

23:21\\
23:20\\
23:18\\
23:17\\
23:15\\
23:14\\
23:12

Times are in UTC because it's a pain accounting for timezone.

Hopefully that gets my point across. It's not much of a jump each day, and honestly the amount of sleep he gives up to figure it out is a little overmuch, but the trend reversed back in december and he lost a lot of days with failed tests so he's wary the timing could make a big change.

  Now that your friend knows he needs iron; is he still not having it work multiple times with the same piece of iron, not all pieces of iron work, or something else?
#+end_quote

Nah, using the same items gets the same results, just not at the same times. Though to clarify, I don't think he's every just held a big chunk of iron, he's just held things that have iron in them.
