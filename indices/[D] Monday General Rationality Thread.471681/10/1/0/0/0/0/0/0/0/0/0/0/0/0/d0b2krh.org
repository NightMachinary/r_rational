Okay since he lives in Eastern time, and the effect occurred at about 8:50 am and 5:40 pm on 2/19, then by 3/20 which is 30 days from now and the timing is moving over by a minute per day, then on 3/20 it should occur at about 8:20 am and 6:10 pm respectively with a range of 9 hrs and 50 minutes in between.....

I have no clue if this is meaningful or what else we can try. Let me know how the string thing works.

Thanks for sharing! I had fun thinking of explanations and I believe you guys that this is actually happening.

EDIT: Are you guys /sure/ that this happens only twice a day? Because if no one's ever tried staying up throughout the night, then maybe it happens once every eight hours without anyone realizing it.

Also, what's the time range for the effect? Can your friend only do it once, or does he have time to hold a piece of iron, attract dust in one room, put it down, walk into another room, and repeat with another piece of iron? Can he walk around with a piece of iron continuously collecting dust as an easy alternative to vacuuming?
