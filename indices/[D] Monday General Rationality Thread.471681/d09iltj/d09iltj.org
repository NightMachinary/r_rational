I'm doing a original research final project for AP US History. The issue is that I have no idea what the topic should be on. Specifically, the requirement is that the topic is at least partially related to US History.

I originally thought about talking about encryption and the NSA, but my teacher thought that it was too recent.

Any suggestions?
