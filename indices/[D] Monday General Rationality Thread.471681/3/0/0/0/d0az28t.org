It really depends on what you want to do. Scrivener works just like any other text editor, it's just got it's own file system in the +right-hand+ left-hand pane. If all you want is to organize chapters and scenes in a logical way, you can do that in a matter of seconds. Compiling (where Scrivener turns your writing into a PDF, epub, text document, mobi, etc.) is mostly just a single mouse click, but it depends on how fancy you want to get with it. The presets are pretty good if you follow the suggested file structure of having folders represent chapters which contain files that represent scenes.

So to do the basic stuff (actually writing chapters), there's maybe a minute or two of learning. The more you want to do, the more there is to learn, but I haven't found that it puts any barriers between me and the actual work of writing, and lowers barriers in a few places (mostly by centralizing and organizing projects).
