  What do you want exactly? We can't exactly suggest he test new items if the power stopped working. Or if we're trying to determine a natural cause there are a few possibilities.

The power still works, it's just something of a hassle waking up at 5 o'clock every day to make sure he catches it.

  It could be related to something in his behavior, It could be related to something in the air, Or there could be something in the dust.
#+end_quote

Hmm, those seem like good things to investigate. I'm not sure what to do about behavior, but it should be pretty trivial to buy canned air or grab dirt from somewhere else. I'll suggest those to him, and report back in a few days.

  That said, My first guess would be something related to static. Since static would account for charge times and interaction with dust if nothing else. I haven't played with static all that much though so I'm not certain it fits all the described phenomena. In any case, you could make a static generator and cross reference the phenomena to see if they match.

Actually, I dimly remember sliding down these big, rubber slides as a kid, then levitating small woodchips with the static electricity off of my fingers. The effect happens over a much larger range, though, and it's weird that it only happens qt a few times in the day. How would you recommend measuring static electricity? Cheap suggestions are best.

  Probably doesn't need to hide it...
#+end_quote

Probably not. But at the very least, he wants to get it reproducible before getting too much information out to anyone else, so he can claim a few of the randi-prize imitators.
