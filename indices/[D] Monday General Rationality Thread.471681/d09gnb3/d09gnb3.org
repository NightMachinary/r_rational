*Final update up!*

So does anyone remember when I made a hypothetical post about a poster posting hypothetical questions about powers that actually has those powers in real life?

Not a hypothetical. Or at least, not exactly.

The long and short of it is that I got in contact with someone who has what I'd hesitantly characterize as "magic." (At least until we study it some more.) I won't get into /why/ I believe them, but I do.

I'm keeping his name (and username) in trust, because, hey, while most if you guys seemed to be pretty benevolent in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3mw44m/mkmeta_we_as_a_community_discover_a_poster/][the thread I posted]], a fair few of you were basically treating empowered humans as x-risks. But I would like to get help from you guys on figuring out what exactly their powers are, since we're a little stumped, and because, hey, even if you don't believe me, you guys like puzzles. The general idea seems to be that, if he gets two different objects in his hands, dust gets attracted to those objects, and only if he's close to the ground. Underwhelming, I know.

But there are a /lot/ of bizarre caveats. First off, they can't manage to manifest anything if they're more than a few dozen miles from their home town. Second off, his powers only work a limited amount of times per day. Maybe. We used to think it was just once per day, and only in the afternoon, but then one day he woke up pretty early in the morning and it worked then too, and has every other time he gets up before dawn. Maybe it's something like half a day of chargeup? Third off, it doesn't work for every object, too. Organics never worked once, and neither did plastics. Fabrics alone don't work, but while most shirts are a bust, pants tend to work. He tried a few metal objects, but tinfoil and car keys don't work, while silverware and his macbook did (but only poorly, for the macbook.) He haven't tested any ceramics yet. And if he does the exact same thing at the exact same time twice in a row, it's absolutely guaranteed to not work. I used to be that he would wait a little bit and then it would start, but that stopped working after he left around christmas/new years to visit family.

For reference, this first started happening in august, and he's only ever done it at home with the blinds closed to make sure other people don't notice. When he's out of town travelling, it didn't work in or outside of a house.

Feel free to ask questions about the data we've gathered, there's more to it that this, but I don't know what could be important and it would be potentially dangerous to just post everything at once.

Edit: there are more caveats than these, these are just the ones we're more sure about.

New results are in as of this afternoon! This is pretty blatantly some sort of electromagnetic effect, because he just got a positive test result for extracting iron from crushed cornflakes. Looking back at the tests, it's also been confirmed that the effect only happens when he holds something that contains iron in each hand. (Other ferromagnetic metals don't work.)
