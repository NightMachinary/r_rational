Yeah, I'd go with something static related too. But let's handwave that away and assume it's just a generic [unexplained phenomenon] plot device for an online-published story.

  But I would like to get help from you guys on figuring out what exactly their powers are, since we're a little stumped, and because, hey, even if you don't believe me, you guys like puzzles.

Thinking inside the hypothetical, I'd say the best result is observing a side-effect of a previously unknown phenomenon \ law of nature. So the recommended order of actions would be something like this:

- 1) go ask in physics.stackexchange.com and some other physics-related forums what (un)known phenomenon could --- hypothetically (they like downvoting inane questions) --- cause such an effect.
- 1b \ c) go find some more physics kids (undergrads, professor relatives, whatever) and ask them the same.
- 1b \ c) go check the guy for yourself and see that he's not simply attention whoring;
- 2) if still nothing comes up purge your current internet persona, advice the x-guy to do the same and from here on work through i2p\tor
- 3) advise him to learn how to properly document scientific studies\experiments and to start doing just that with his daily tries.
- 4) record his attempts on a high quality camera in a setting that will reveal neither his identity nor his location, then remove all the meta-information from the recording files and put them on an i2p server.
- 5) ???
