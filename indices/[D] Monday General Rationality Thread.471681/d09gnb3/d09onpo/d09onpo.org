Very low (I don't even know how many zeroes) estimated probability of the phenomenon being evidence for anomalous physics. Low probability (one to two zeroes) of the phenomenon being an undiscovered/unelaborated consequence of known physics. The rest in a known consequence of known physics or an interesting known or unknown consequence of biology.

Accumulation of dust points to static electricity. Temperature, humidity, air flow, particulate composition, all of these atmospheric qualities can affect dust accumulation. Your friend is the other factor. I don't know what electrical properties are relevant there.

I don't know if the guy whose skin was adhesive ("magnetic"), or spontaneous combustion, etc. have all been explained satisfactorily, but I think this fits in that category of useless curiosities. I estimate very low expected utility in the use of this anomaly, and somewhat low expected utility in further investigation.

I have no clue what exactly you think you're describing when you say "dust gets attracted to those objects." This isn't interesting unless you actually describe what is so anomalous about it. A video would be appreciated. Otherwise I'm not even sure why you're being so cagey about it, unless this is an in-character brainstorm, this person you're describing is yourself, this anomaly is significantly more surprising than I'm imagining, you're overreacting to peoples' x-risk assessments of hypothetical powers that are significantly more exploitable than dust-attraction, you're simply the right amount of paranoid about personal information, or you're otherwise lying about something or being fooled.

I mean, that's a lot of options. My biggest point is I'm not sure why you're behaving cagily (I don't think the guy saying he would hunt down that person would consider this worth the trouble), and a visual demonstration would be appreciated. If one cannot be obtained or published, some clarification would be nice.
