  Very low (I don't even know how many zeroes) estimated probability of the phenomenon being evidence for anomalous physics. Low probability (one to two zeroes) of the phenomenon being an undiscovered/unelaborated consequence of known physics. The rest in a known consequence of known physics or an interesting known or unknown consequence of biology. Accumulation of dust points to static electricity. Temperature, humidity, air flow, particulate composition, all of these atmospheric qualities can affect dust accumulation. Your friend is the other factor. I don't know what electrical properties are relevant there. I don't know if the guy whose skin was adhesive ("magnetic"), or spontaneous combustion, etc. have all been explained satisfactorily, but I think this fits in that category of useless curiosities. I estimate very low expected utility in the use of this anomaly, and somewhat low expected utility in further investigation.

A large part of the reason why I think this is so anomalous is that experimenting in the same conditions consistently fails to produce the same results. If nothing else, my curiosity has been piqued pretty badly, so I'd like to find out what exactly is producing the phenomena. If we can get it to be consistently replicated, it's probably at least worthy of minor internet fame, which can still be flipped into cash. I'm not making any expenditures in testing the phenomena, so it's not like it poses much of a risk to me.

And as for the guy himself, he's pretty average, honestly. Around 6 foot, scraggly goatee, no real medical issues besides some family history of type 2 diabetes and an allergy to peanuts. Caucasian, black hair, and that's about as much as I'm comfortable with describing his appearance. I have access to some lower-resolution (720p) videos I can look over, and I can ask him directly if you need anything specific, though.

  I have no clue what exactly you think you're describing when you say "dust gets attracted to those objects."
#+end_quote

To be a bit more specific, his house tends to be rather dusty, and when the action goes off, the dust in a radius of a (up to) few feet of the objects is visibly attracted towards them, although the exact radius depends on objects held.

#+begin_quote
  This isn't interesting unless you actually describe what is so anomalous about it.
#+end_quote

The anomalous part isn't that the dust is attracted, but that it only happens so rarely, and under diverse conditions. Under the obvious explanations (magnetism, static electricity, airflow) he should be able to replicate the process by doing much the same thing each time. As is, though, that doesn't quite work.

  this anomaly is significantly more surprising than I'm imagining, you're overreacting to peoples' x-risk assessments of hypothetical powers that are significantly more exploitable than dust-attraction, you're simply the right amount of paranoid about personal information, or you're otherwise lying about something or being fooled.

It doesn't seem like a very big deal, I admit. But at this point, we're still blindly groping in the dark. It might ultimately just be a scientific curiosity that doesn't really change anything, but at the same time, we just don't know enough about the phenomena to really risk publicizing it. If nothing else, this way, we don't look like crackpots in real life.
