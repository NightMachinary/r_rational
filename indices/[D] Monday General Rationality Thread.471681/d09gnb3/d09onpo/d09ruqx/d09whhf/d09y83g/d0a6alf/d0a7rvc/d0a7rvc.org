  I have no clue what you mean by this. Are they falling in lines like iron fillings do when there is a magnet like this?

He did another test, and it turns out it's /exactly/ like that. He decided to look a little more closely into the "static electricity" route, and came up with the idea to grind up his fortified corn flakes, to see if the iron in them would be attracted, and that's basically what happened when he tried it. I've just gotten the results, and they match up pretty closely to those images.

That seems to demystify things quite a bit-- in fact, if it's almost definitely an electromagnetic phenomena of some sort, I should be able to check back over the list and make sure everything that worked is some sort of

Edit: yep, it seems to be holding. Kind of, at least. Nearly every piece of cutlery tested worked, the pants that worked had zippers, and the metals that didn't work were stuff like car keys or coins, which are made of stuff like zinc and magnesium. Though I will note that nothing made out of nickel (like a a few items of cutlery) without some steel or iron content seems to have worked, though, so it looks like it's just iron, and not just any ferromagnetic metal.

Now it's a matter of figuring out why this only works so sporadically.
