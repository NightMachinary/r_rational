Alright, he just tested your suggestion. Actually, he went even further, and instead of holding the metal, he just suspended it from the ceiling about the same distance as he usually holds the objects, and it /still/ worked. He's a little disappointed that he isn't a wizard, but a haunted house would still be pretty cool to show off. Maybe it's something with the wiring? Still doesn't explain the time shift, though.

At this point, he's more or less been convinced that it's not supernatural after all, merely "weird." It's a pretty massive shift from what he was thinking even two days ago, but I guess he's just quick to accept new evidence. So he said it was OK to tell you he lives in Negaunee, MI. He's not going to post his name, because that's a dumb thing to do on the internet, but it's a pretty small town so you could probably figure out who he is.
