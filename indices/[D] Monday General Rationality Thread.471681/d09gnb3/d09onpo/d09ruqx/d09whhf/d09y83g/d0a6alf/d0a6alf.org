  dust that falls on the paper lies in fairly neat striations.

I have no clue what you mean by this. Are they falling in lines like iron fillings do when there is a magnet like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field][this]]?

If this is true, then your friend has a very useful ability if he can make dust magnetic, because what if he can scale it up to pounds of dirt?
