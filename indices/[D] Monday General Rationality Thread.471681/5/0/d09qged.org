For AP US History, try not to write about anything post 1970s if it can be avoided. If you want to focus on information security, The Underground Railroad is a good thing to write about.

If you're open to other things, basically any of the major movements or events you've learned about are good to write about. Socialism in the US, Women's Suffrage, the series of deals and compromises that Congress tried to use to delay the civil war, are all good things to write about
