Start by volunteering on something enjoyable; if you're doing it for fun that should be obvious but it'll also form some positive associations to keep you going later on more draining stuff.

Often there are local/state/province level groups that manage volunteering (eg community awards, etc) who can put you in touch with something to do. For more detail, what are you interested in and where are you?
