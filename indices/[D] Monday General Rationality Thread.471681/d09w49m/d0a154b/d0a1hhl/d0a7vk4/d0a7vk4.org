Okay, now I'm looking at the creature list, trying to find the "best" legal abilities. So far I've found some funny ones:

- When $THIS enters the battlefield, if you control two or more Swamps, you may return $THIS to its owner's hand.
- When $THIS enters the battlefield, scry 4, then sacrifice $THIS. (pseudo-evoke?)
- At the beginning of your upkeep, tap $THIS and it gets +1/+0 until end of turn.
- Whenever $THIS deals combat damage to a creature, that creature gains haste until end of turn.
- Whenever $THIS attacks, you may have it deal 1 damage to target attacking or blocking creature. (Blockers aren't declared yet, so you can only damage your own creatures)

Some incredibly broken and OP:

- When $THIS enters the battlefield, search your library for a creature card with converted mana cost 3 or less and put it onto the battlefield. Then shuffle your library. (the card has CMC=3)
- At the beginning of your upkeep, you may pay {R}. If you do, take an extra turn after this one.
- When $THIS enters the battlefield, target opponent gains control of all Mountains. (broken, but not really OP)
- Whenever a source an opponent controls deals damage, you gain that much life.
- {0}: $THIS gets +1/+0 until end of turn.
- {T}: Target player skips his or her next untap step. (on a 2 CMC creature)
- Defender, Whenever $THIS is dealt damage, put that many +1/+1 counters on it instead.
- Whenever a creature attacks, each other attacking creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn. (Note: applies to enemies as well)

and some unique and flavorful ones:

- If a spell or ability an opponent controls causes you to discard $THIS, put it onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle your library.
- Whenever $THIS becomes blocked, regenerate it.
- {T}: Return $THIS and target creature you control to their owner's hand.
- Whenever $THIS deals combat damage to a player, look at that player's hand.
- Flying, $THIS can block any number of creatures. 1/2 (chump-block /all/ the things)
- Whenever a creature you control attacks, creatures you control get +0/+4 until end of turn. (with 5 creatures attacking, you get +0/+20)
- Whenever $THIS attacks, each creature you control becomes the color of your choice until end of turn.
- {1}{G}: Put a token that's a copy of $THIS onto the battlefield. (on a {1}{G} 2/1 elf)
- Sacrifice $THIS: Destroy target creature blocking $THIS. (on a 1/1 that costs {W})
- Defender, At the beginning of your upkeep, destroy target land. 0/0 (If you can find some way of keeping this alive, it is powerful. Otherwise, it dies as it enters the battlefield)
- Whenever $THIS deals combat damage to a player, you may sacrifice it. If you do, return it to the battlefield under your control.

EDIT: more of them:

- Your maximum hand size is reduced by seven.
- Whenever $THIS deals combat damage to a player, you may return target land to its owner's hand.
- {T}: Target player draws X cards, where X is the number of cards in your hand.
- {T}: Gain control of target creature blocking or blocked by a creature this turn, $THIS deals 2 damage to that creature.
- When $THIS enters the battlefield, if you control two or more Plains, you may cast an instant or sorcery card from your graveyard.
- Whenever a creature attacks you or a planeswalker you control, put a 1/1 green Saproling creature token onto the battlefield.
- All Sliver creatures have "Whenever this creature attacks, defending player sacrifices a creature.
