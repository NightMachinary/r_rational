Pretend you are five-years old again. In that mind-set, it's a lot easier to come up with goofy or off-the-wall ideas. It's more useful if you are trying to be original.

If you are trying to come up with a different solution to a problem instead of a different idea to test, then pretend you are different people who think differently. Useful models to come up with are stereotypical workers for different careers such as lawyer, construction worker, teacher, cab driver, and so on. They are a mental short-cut for different social groups and classes.

Finally, find a partner. Just talking things out with someone makes you much more creative and even if you can't find someone willing, buy a rubber duck. In computer programming, we are encouraged to talk out the problem and there's a story how one of the founding people of the field often used a rubber duck to talk out his problems to. Often when explaining to the duck, the solution becomes clear.
