Can you guys give me some advice on becoming creative? I absolutely love rational fiction and I really want to be able to write it, but when I'm trying to write it - it's like there's a wall in front of me I can't get past, I just don't know what to say that hasn't already been said before.

Did anyone had this problem and then successfully overcome it?
