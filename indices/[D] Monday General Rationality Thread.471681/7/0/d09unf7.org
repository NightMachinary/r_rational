Ooh, yes - geospatial stuff was one of my minors (and now two jobs).

What you want to do is called "image classification", and it's pretty easy in a program called QGIS.

However getting the input data for Io is a lot harder than Earth. I'd suggest looking for existing geological maps, such as in that image, and picking sites by hand. Remember to account for the map projection!

All this depends on how accurate you want to be of course - if it's enough to spend a weekend learning the tools, I'd be happy to send you in the right direction.
