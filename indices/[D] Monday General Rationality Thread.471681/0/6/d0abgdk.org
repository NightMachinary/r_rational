Not too certain here. Not a D&D player really. Can objects with no weight have any sort of effect on the world? No weight implies no mass, which means it has no energy to be utilized, correct? Burning it would (presumably) result in destroying the object with invisible, intangible flames (as the fire would produce neither light nor heat)

The mere fact that it's visible at all implies it must possess some form of energy. Your challenge, as a noobie lvl 1 starting character, is to figure out what that is and how to use it. I wish you luck.
