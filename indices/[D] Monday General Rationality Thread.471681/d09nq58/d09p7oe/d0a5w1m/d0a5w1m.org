Just playing the devil's advocate here, but I noticed that your argument is making the unspoken assumption that:

Donating money to Africa -> More stability in Africa.

I'm pretty sure that people have made arguments that constantly giving money is making African governments dependent on it as a source of revenue. In addition, corrupt officials have no interest to actually use the given money to improve Africa in a way that would decrease donations.

I can't actually remember what proof there was for the above argument, just that people have stated this was something that happens.
