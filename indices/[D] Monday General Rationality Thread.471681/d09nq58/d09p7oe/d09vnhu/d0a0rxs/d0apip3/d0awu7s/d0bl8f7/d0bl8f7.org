The main impact terrorists have on American well-being isn't killing Americans anyways. Terrorists are like pedophiles or guns (contrast: swimming pools and cigarettes). They seem really bad and scary but they're not actually doing that much harm, in America at least. Most of the harm terrorism causes has to do with money and lives we spend on counter-terrorism efforts that range from modestly effective to "actually causes more terrorism" rather than Americans killed.

Terrorism is interesting to think about stopping, but not actually the main benefit of helping Africa. Getting involved in overseas wars kills more Americans than terrorism. Assuming you could actually spend some kind of money to ensure that all 50 or so countries in Africa became and remained stable, you'd probably save more American lives via reduced need for American intervention than reduced terrorist risk.

Normally like 10 Americans are killed per year tops in this kind of thing. Even 2001, the worst (best?) year for terrorists killing Americans, only about 3,000 died. Contrast 38,000 americans who die per year in car accidents, deaths that are by and large completely avoidable (breathlyser ignitions in every car, for example, or just people not driving when they're sleepy or drunk), or the 21,000 who die via suicide from gunshots, or heck, even the 500 who died via accidental firearm discharge who might have been easier to save than any of these groups.

The CDC estimates the number of alcohol-related deaths to be around 30k per year. So you could have TEN 9/11 terrorist attacks every year, and it STILL might be a better idea (from the point of view of just saving lives) to focus cash and effort on stopping alcohol deaths than terrorist attacks.

I guess I'm just saying, whether or not spending money in Africa stops terrorism, even if it did, it would only prevent like 10 deaths per year, since that's about how much terrorism happens, and even if 9/11 happened every month it still might not be a great idea???
