I saw this mentioned elsewhere, and basically if I understood correctly in this study the difference they made in the exercise was so minor that the participants didn't even realize it was made. Thus for all we know A change "bigger" than what was performed could lower the performance. So it is not exactly clear from the research if and how this could be implemented generally for skills to truly benefit from the effect shown here.

Essentially I would say this is mostly a call for more research to be performed on this to better understand the phenomenon rather than an action point which you should implement right now.
