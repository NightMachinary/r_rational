It's been too long since I've played Magic for me to remember, but depending on when you're allowed to sacrifice the Serra Infantry that's mostly alright? If you can say, sacrifice it when it's been targeted by a kill spell, the spell would fizzle and then the creature would regenerate just fine, I think?

In fact, I swear there used to be a similar creature that exiled itself for a turn instead to avoid attacks in a similar way.
