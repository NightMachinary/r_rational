He says that, but those are extrapolations. The currently allowed weight variance in a baseball regulation ball is 5%, or about 7 grams. Of course if you play baseball when its raining I am fairly sure the difference in the weight in more than 7 grams.

so what is to convince us that we need more difference than the actual differences that happen naturally in the physical world simply because it is not as controlled as the virtual world?

Did the research produce a distribution of the effect based on the variance between the trials?
