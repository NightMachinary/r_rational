People already do something similar when memorizing facts. For example, if you have a bunch of index cards with study questions, then mixing up the order would help to learn the material faster. Using different questions from session to session or a different style of memorization such as a friend quizzing you would also help to learn faster (albeit less people mix things up like this).

I would also like to point out that this study was referring specifically to practicing motor control which is useful to know for martial artists and sports athletes.

Either way, this is helpful to know explicitly that having more variety in one's practice is a good thing, so thanks for the link!
