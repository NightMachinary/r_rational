Nice!

If you're interested in a book that collects a lot of research into learning techniques that optimize for making concepts stick around, try [[http://makeitstick.net/][Make It Stick]].

Seems like massed practice/rereading many chapters to review material is not a good technique. Instead, they recommend mixing up what you're learning, doing retrieval practice with flash cards or simplistic quizzes, doing practice tests, and trying to push hard to get to a difficulty level where you're not already confortable with your perf (depends on what you're comfortable with as a perf level) and then improving that. Among other things.

I employ these kinds of techniques when I'm learning new skills at work. Especially mixed practice and also getting a bit outside my comfort zone. Seem to work well. I have the usual hours but I'm still able to deliver really good outcomes now. It's harder to measure things like this at work though; if you're at school, you at least don't have to solve the measurement problem yourself and you have more easily predictable time frames and topics too.
