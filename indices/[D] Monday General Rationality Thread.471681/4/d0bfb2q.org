The D&D campaign I'm running these days is set in a world where most characters (for unclear reasons) never level up beyond ECL 6 or 7. This setting is set a couple thousand years after the previous setting I ran, which took place in The Age of Legends, when the level cap was 20. During The Age of Legends, most countries were just "the amount of area this particular monster/dragon/magelord can personally project force over" and that was that.

Now, in The Age of Kings, it's plausible that a level 5 or 6 mage (who would be one of the most powerful mages in a country, if not the most powerful) may not be able to just murder the King, seize control of the country, and put down anyone who tries to stop him. A level 6 mage is still a sizeable threat, of course, but has a pretty limited ability to project force. No Teleportation, and a lot of the greatest tricks don't work.

So, most countries are feudal monarchies, with adventurers forming their own companies and guilds. A typical country will have one or two major PMCs operating within its borders, each having a few thousand employees. Most of these will be apprentices (levels 1-2), a couple hundred will be journeyman (levels 3-4), a few dozen will be partners (levels 5-6) and there will be a very small number of masters (levels 7+) who are living legends. Rank in the corp doesn't always correspond to power, but it does most of the time.

In any case, our heroes are traveling in a neighboring country and dodging patrols from from enemy PMCs while they carry out their mission. Along the way, they end up encountering wild cats several times. First, they encounter a mundane Great Cat (like, say, a leopard) and kill it. A few days later, their camp is attacked by several Great Cats, a Greater Cat, and a Greatest Cat. They down the Greater Cat and drive off the Great Cats and the Greatest Cat. The ranger decides to kill and skin the unconscious Greater Cat, refine the hide and use it to create a sweet cape or cloak.

They're traveling on the road a few days later when they spot something flying through the air towards them. It's tough to tell how big it is, but it's too big to be a man, and anything that can fly and is bigger than a man is a potential threat. They calm down the apprentices with them and prepare for the encounter. The creature approaches, and is an elephant-sized quadripedal demon with a huge set of leathery wings that end in clawed hands.

He lands in front of the party and accosts them, accusing them of murder. He introduces himself as Arrkupalak, King of Cats, and charges the party with the murder of Nyanor, his granddaughter. Over the course of the discussion, their defense, and the negotiation of what their penalty should be for killing Nyanor, the party learns more about Arrkupalak.

Arrkupalak is the offspring of a Great Cat and a Demon, born thousands of years ago during The Age of Legends when the barriers between planes were weak and Demons, Gods, and Dragons walked the material plane. Arrkupalak is not a particularly intelligent creature, but he's clever, careful, and has seen The Turning of the Ages, the rise and fall of countless kingdoms and many empires, and more besides. Most of what Arrkupalak does is hang out in the wilderness and mate with Great Cats. He can't die of old age and nothing can really threaten him, so his life is pretty good. He doesn't really venture out of the wilds, except when his children are attacked. All the Greater and Greatest cats in this area, unnaturally large creatures that they are, are his descendants, and he takes attacks on them seriously.

The party makes a decent case for it being self-defense, and he demands services from them (or their descendants; he's a long-lived cat, after all) to be cashed in at a later point as punishment for their catslaughter.

Later, the party does some digging and learns Arrkupalak is known to exist (at the very least as a legend) but the local PMC, Insha Corp, has never made an attempt to kill him. Insha Corp makes a good amount of its income from merchants and caravans hiring it on as guards to take them through Arrkupalak's territory. They carefully frighten away any Greater Cats or Greatest Cats so as not to anger the creature that provides them with so many easy, lucrative, low-risk contracts to fulfill.

I had fun with Arrkupalak's stat-block. I took a Dire Lion and applied the Half-Fiend template to it, and carefully optimized the resulting creature. With 6 Int, 14 Wis, 12 Cha, and millenia of experience (Arrkupalak gets a +15 "lived through it" bonus to knowledge checks related to the Age of Legends, which are normally quite difficult to make), Arrkupalak was difficult to RP. He's not smart, but he's bright, and he's seen it all. The actual statblock he got in the end was pretty solid, too. A Dire Lion that can reason, fly, think (6 int! He's sapient now!), use a couple SLAs etc is good. And he can't really get taken down by town guards, either. With his Damage Reduction, Spell Resistance, and various elemental resistances, there's not really much Arrkupalak fears.

The party could have taken him out, but probably would have lost several apprentices in the fight. Also... it's actually fairly hard to catch Arrkupalak. He can fly. He'll just turn and run if things look rough for whatever reason. This cat has seen the death of an Age, he'll not get crushed by a fight he can easily flee.
