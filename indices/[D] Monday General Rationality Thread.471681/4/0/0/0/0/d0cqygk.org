So the party (and yeah, it's Pathfinder) has:

*1x Wizard* who mostly knows transmutation. Her favorites include Pyrotechnics, Enlarge Person, Glitterdust, Summon Monster II, Haste, and so on. She doesn't have any entangling or web-like spells, and she has a couple evocations like Scorching Ray that she prepares sometimes. She has 7 wisdom, 14 charisma, a huge force of personality and an insane, paranoid irrational fear of birds and bird-based conspiracies. She is risk-averse, but her conception of what constitutes a "risk" is unusual. She is by far the most effective combatant in the right circumstances due to her ability to disable or blind groups of enemies.

*1x Paladin of Law* who in theory hits things with swords but spends 90% of his effort trying to talk his way out of situations. He thinks that violence is a last resort. That said, he is very good at hitting things, and very good at taking hits. He carries a light crossbow in addition to his greatsword. He is a monotheist. He's also the only worshipper of his god, who is named "God", and he's having trouble getting new converts. His goal is to create a continental government and bring order to the land. He is an amiable, ruthless fascist who asks questions first and shoots later.

/Note: Paladins in my campaign setting can be of any alignment as long as they believe in something. Their abilities are "Detect Sinner" and "Smite Sinner" and so on. A Paladin's power comes from faith, rather than the favor of a god. So, for example, a hypocritical LG Paladin that was sufficiently self-righteous would retain powers-- they would not be revoked by his god or pope or whatever. Paladins spend a lot of time praying, meditating, and having religious debates with other members of their orders in order to make sure their faith is correct./

*1x Monk* with a variety of combat abilities and good sneaking skills. He is modestly risk-averse, and usually supports the Paladin's attempts to talk instead of fight whenever possible. However, when there are fights, he leaves no survivors. Fame would be dangerous to him.

*1x Magus* who uses every spell slot for Shocking Grasp (including his level 2 spell slots) and fights with a sword. He is the most risk-averse, advocating running, hiding, and talking whenever possible. Although he's not a huge fan of it, he usually gets talked into executing prisoners and so on after fights because of his risk-averse nature. He's not a big fan of killing innocents.

*17 level 1 and 2 NPCs:* these guys come in various non-casting classes, but there are two sorcerers and a druid. These guys are armed with crossbows, but are fairly flighty. Most of them are in their teens and not used to battle. A PC often has to direct them in combat, yelling at them not to be heroes and to keep shooting. Out of combat, the PCs find themselves often advising and couseling these children, encouraging them to stay with the group and helping them through their problems. They handle the carts, horses, tents, fires, cooking, and so on, in addition to providing support in combat. They are paid little but learn on the job as apprentices.

*1 level 4 Rogue NPC* - This guy is Iraj the Sly (known to most as Iraj the Honest) and is no good in a fight, but has lots of useful plot hooks, er, knowledge, that makes him a useful resource when the party is in a bind. Give him a dagger and he might be able to take an unexpecting enemy down, but he's more of con man / sleight of hand / guy in the know sort of fellow than a fighter.

In general, the party makeup and lack of a Divine spellcaster doesn't reallly have any impact on the party's effectiveness. In a typical session, there will be 5 or 6 encounters, of which one at most is resolved with violence. The Paladin has the ability to do some small amount of healing, but in any sort of fight where the enemies are capable of dealing more than 15 damage quickly, things are gonna go really badly. Most of the PCs are quite devoted to keep their level 1 apprentices alive, so what kind of fights they can get involved in are pretty limited.
