Until the Paladin player joined us, it was pretty hilarious watching the group try to handle every encounter diplomatically and also manage the apprentices. The Wizard has some ranks in Bluff, and the Magus has ranks in Intimidate, but none of them had great charisma (besides the insane Wizard) or ranks in Diplomacy. The Paladin has several ranks in Diplomacy and a decent Charisma score which has helped a lot.
