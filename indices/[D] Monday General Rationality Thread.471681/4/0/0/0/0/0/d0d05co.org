Violence avoiding parties, reasonable. Though, I would note that clerics are useful for considerably more than healing (which, assuming battles are running the ordinary 2-5 rounds, really shouldn't be an in-combat thing anyway).

Given how much the whole party seems to be against violence, a non-violent solution seems like it might be best. Violence or no, however, the party doesn't seem especially suited to it right now. The best bet will either be looking around for a diplomancer-for-hire, or getting one of the newbie sorcerers to start training up for it.

(If violence does turn out to be the solution, a Summoner might be a good thing to look for. A properly spec'd Eidolon should be able to really start helping by around level 3, and once they hit level 5, it should be able to fly up to the target (with greater than 80 ft/round speed, so that's not an issue) and successfully initiate a grapple pretty often, possibly plus some decent extra damage in addition to whatever it lets the rest of the party do by holding him down.)
