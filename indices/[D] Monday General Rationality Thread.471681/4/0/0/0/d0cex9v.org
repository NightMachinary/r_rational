No divine fullcasters? Seems like a bit of poor party management, but can't be fixed shortly.

Summon Monster II does come up a little short. Going from the fact there's a Magus, I'm assuming you're playing Pathfinder? What sort of spells to the party casters know? If I'm guessing wrong and you're not playing Pathfinder, one thing the party could do is see if they can find a partner who's a craft-oriented Warlock, and see if they can kit them out in custom gear.
