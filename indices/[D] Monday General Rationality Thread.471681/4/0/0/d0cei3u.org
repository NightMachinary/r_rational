There's a Magus and a Wizard. The Wizard knows Summon Monster II, so if he prepared only that, he'd be able to summon a good number of creatures. A problem: the only flying things that Summon Monster II can summon are elementals, and at that size they're unlikely to able to overcome Arrkupalak's DR 5/magic, and nothing that can be summoned by summon monster can keep up with his speed (celestial template isn't that great). If he's flying away, it's probably already over.

Arrkupalak's Speed of 80 feet while flying is a huge problem. If the party really wanted to kill Arrkupalak, the main issue is holding him down. I'm guessing the best strategy would be to draw him into melee, feigning weakness, then cast Enlarge Person on the Paladin and have him wrestle the cat. Once they're grappling, try to take Arrkupalak out before he escapes or tries something too tricky (or kills the Paladin)
