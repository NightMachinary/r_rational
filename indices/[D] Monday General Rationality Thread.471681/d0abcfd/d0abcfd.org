Well, this isn't really a rationality related question, I suppose. It could be, but it probably isn't. However, it IS a fiction/author related question, so I figured I could still ask it in the general thread.

I'm about to start a multi-chapter fanfiction story. It won't be a rational work specifically. I haven't really finalized any of the details, but I've had trouble finishing multi-chapter stories in the past. I get about 20, maybe 30k words in before I run out of steam and abandon the project. Here's my question:

To our authors. Those people that have written and completed many chaptered(?) works. What sort of tools/techniques do you use to assist you? Do you storyboard things? Do you build outlines? Do you schedule time just to write? What methods do you find effective in maintaining both your desire to write and your passion for the current story? Some gentlemen of note I'd be interested in hearing from are [[/u/eaglejarl]] and [[/u/alexanderwales]]. I'm sure there are other noteworthy authors here as well, so please comment! :)
