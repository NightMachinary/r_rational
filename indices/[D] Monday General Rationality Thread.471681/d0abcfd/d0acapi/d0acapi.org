I use a program called [[https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php][Scrivener]], which is where I do all my outlining and planning these days. So my whole manuscript looks [[http://i.imgur.com/QqYaRmv.png][like this]] with everything broken down by chapter and scene. Most scenes are planned out ahead of time, if I'm doing things right, and they'll have a single line description like "Sander goes into the woods alone". On a higher level, I tend to plan out story and character arcs, usually with [[http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_104:_The_Juicy_Details][a story circle]]. Breaking a whole big thing down into 20 or so story beats is really helpful, especially if placed along the circular story path.

As far as keeping up motivation ... deadlines tend to help me with that, especially when I've stated them to other people. I definitely set time aside specifically for writing, because it's easier to write when that's part of my routine. Scrivener lets me set session goals and I usually consider par to be 600 words (actual output varies quite a bit depending on what's going on and what I'm trying to write).

If you need a break, take a break, but ideally take a break that you have a set time to come back from. When I was writing /Shadows of the Limelight/ I needed a break so took a week off to write a novella (/The Case of the Sleeping Beauties/). But I had a definite restart date, so it wouldn't have been easy to just let one week off turn into two weeks off, which would have changed into three weeks off, etc. It's still definitely possible to burn out on something and struggle with remembering what attracted you to it in the first place.

Edit: Also, if you want to see some of my planning process and don't care about *spoilers for The Dark Wizard of Donkerk*, in 2014 I wrote three articles ([[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing.html][pt1]], [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing_25.html][pt2]], [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing_28.html][pt3]]) detailing my pre-writing process for National Novel Writing Month (for a story that I'm still in the process of actually writing).
