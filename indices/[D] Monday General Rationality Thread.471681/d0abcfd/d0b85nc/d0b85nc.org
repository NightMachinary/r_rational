It sounds tangential, but one important thing is your physical environment. Make sure that your desk is the right height and etc so that you don't start getting sore shoulders / painful wrists / etc from being at the keyboard a lot.

As to what you asked: for my books until now I didn't do a huge amount of outlining or preplanning, although I'm doing more as I go on. 2YE was written completely off the cuff. Induction was planned on an arc level but the actual writing was pretty freeform. The Tinker's Daughter has much more planning, but still not down to the outline level.

This works really well for me because it makes it fun -- I'm not spending effort writing a novel where I know everything that's happening, I am reading a novel that is exactly tuned to my tastes...I just happen to be writing each sentence down as I read it.

There are some issues with this, of course. I've had things go completely not where I expected -- when I wrote 2YE I never intended for Loki to be in it. He just inserted himself at the end of chapter 21 and started stealing the show. Next thing you know he'd talked me into making him the power behind the throne that was driving most of the plot. Albrecht and Jake making a peace treaty was another surprise -- I had intended to have a big blood-and-thunder war with cannons and fireballs and whatnot. When they sat down and signed a peace treaty I was gobsmacked.

(Note that I'm not being hyperbolic here -- I literally had no intention of these things happening, but that's what my fingers wrote. It makes the writing process a lot of fun, but it can play merry hob with your plans.)

The question I would ask: are you writing this for fun, for money, or for something else? If it's for fun, don't spend a lot of time doing the planning -- just let your fingers create a new novel that is specifically tuned to your tastes.
