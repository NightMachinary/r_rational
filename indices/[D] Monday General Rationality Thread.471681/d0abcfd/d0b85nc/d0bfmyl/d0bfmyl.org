This seems to be in line with how I write now. I always find it pretty interesting when I'm mid sentence and my brain goes "Yo, I know we didn't discuss it, but add this in there!" and I'm like "Thanks brain!"

I mostly write freeform. I'll plot out a general idea of where I want the story to go from beginning to end (/very/ general) and then just see what I come up with. I'll usually end up creating a lot of content for it on the fly.

Also thanks for the feedback!
