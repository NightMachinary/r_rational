Hmm, it's probably a bit of a stretch to say that altruism in Africa is the BEST use of money to help Americans, but it certainly does something to help Americans. The goal of altruism isn't "help me personally" so it's not going to be as helpful as just putting that money in the bank then using it later. Whatever you do is likely to be less useful than buying more stuff for yourself or putting cash aside for a rainy days

That being said, making the world more stable and wealthy in the long run probably makes things better for Americans by providing more trading partners and reducing the likelihood we need to get involved in wars.
