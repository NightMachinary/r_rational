For my English 102 term paper, I want to write about effective altruism, covering specifically pricing lives and triage, QALYs, scope insensitivity and outgroups, diminishing marginal utility of money, and effective measures in Africa. One thing I'm concerned with, though, is an egoist argument for African aid. How would investment in Africa's stability and economic performance instrumentally benefit a US citizen who is terminally fine with letting the outgroup wallow?
