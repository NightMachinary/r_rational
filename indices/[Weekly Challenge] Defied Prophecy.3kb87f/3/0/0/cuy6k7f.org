Thank you for your feedback. I'm hesitant to explain the events of the story, because I wanted a reader to project onto the main character as much as possible. I kept it vague intentionally. I'm not sure how to flesh it out without lessening the impact for those who projected heavily. My own thoughts about what was happening were [[#s][]]

I appreciate the feedback immensely. I typically write for clarity, so I like to put ambiguity into my short stories. Perhaps I should work on making the ambiguity more focused, so that it could be easily stated by a reader.
