Very good story, I liked it a lot! I saw the trick of the protagonist coming, but it was still neatly resolved. I was expecting an explanation for how the prophets could force the prophesy - something based on acausal reasoning manipulated with precommitments in order to end up with only one possible prophesy - but I guess that would have made the story too long and complicated.
