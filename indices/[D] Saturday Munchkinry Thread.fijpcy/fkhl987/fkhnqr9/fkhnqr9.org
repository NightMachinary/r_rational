The fixed altitude at which crystals stop providing lift would probably be useful for a measurement standard: a single crystal on a long string could serve as an altimeter, while a pair of small crystals linked by a string could be a horizontal equivalent to a plumb bob.

You can use the radiation emissions as a scaling factor for the size of vehicles you want to see. If it can be blocked with a thin sheet of metal, windboards might be viable. If even a thick safe can't block it, I'd recommend looking at examples of nuclear-powered rocket ships for design inspirations - Atomic Rockets is a great site for this, as the name suggests.

If crystals can be magically fused, the exponential gain in lift would incentivise a flying island civilisation to obtain a monopoly on the crystals to both give them more land and reduce their competitors for the sky.

The water condensation effect is a nice touch, that would give flying civilisations even more power over groundbound ones by influencing the rainfall.

If the crystals vibrate at a fixed frequency, they might be usable in clocks or as unfortunately radioactive musical instruments. If there's a way for crystals to influence each other at a distance, that gives you an equivalent to radio.
