mining crystals from inhabited floating islands is illegal. because if its not, the island WILL sink as they get mined out.

cost of crystals will define cost of shipping freight. shipping freight is hazardous because you need more crystals to move more cargo...

I imagine a cargo-carrier with the cargo in the middle, between the crystal and the crew. unless the cargo is live animals or passengers.

personal backpack crystals for infantry would be for high-risk boarding actions. crystal harpoons would provide lift to the impaled target, allowing it to be more easily dragged into the sky and aboard the ship.

crystal vibration may be used for industrial processes. ships would have shocks to reduce the amount of vibration the rest of the ship suffers as a result.
