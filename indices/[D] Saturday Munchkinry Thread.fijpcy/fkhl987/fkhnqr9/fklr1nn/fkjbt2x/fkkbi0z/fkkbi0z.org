Good points, I was imagining the islands' structure being studded with a pretty even distribution of the crystals to allow even lift. Structural integrity is a factor I should work through, and whether the crystals can imbue surrounding rock with antigravity, as you suggest

I guess to have islands form and not just have lots of free floating crystals we need some sort of gravitational effect drawing towards the crystals themselves. Should imitate the formation of planetary systems in this regard. There is a massive central obelisk all the crystals stem from, after an initial shattering explosion. There could be some attractive force drawing them back together that results in orbits not unlike planetary bodies.
