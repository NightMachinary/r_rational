You have a fantasy medieval/steampunk society on floating islands. The islands are held aloft by crystals that exert upward force proportional to their size until reaching a specific altitude. Most are burried within the bedrock of the islands themselves but can be mined, with caution to not let them escape. They come in various sizes from a few cm slivers to the massive 10+ meter diameter that hold up the islands themselves.

It takes a volume of about 1/3 a meter cubed to lift 100 kilos but lift scales up exponentially with volume.

The crystals emit radiation that is harmful with any prolonged exposure.

They also tend to cause water vapor to condense into droplets nearby via some field effect.

Crystals are constantly vibrating and emit a low hum that can be felt through contact with nearby surfaces and sometimes through the air.

What contraptions or inventions would you expect?

Some obvious applications are airships, of course, if you have proper containment, but what else might be invented?
