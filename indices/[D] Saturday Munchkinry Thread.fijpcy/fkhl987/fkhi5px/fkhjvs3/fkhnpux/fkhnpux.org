wait you said it couldn't be blocked. Can you explain the last bullet in more detail? Do you mean the user needs to look at the ring to use it and it can't be obstructed by liquid or solid? If so I would try and bait him to a cliff or somewhere he can drop into the ocean and hit him upside the head super hard so he loses consciousness.

Also you can just shoot him in the head. Half a second for activation time is an eternity compared to a bullet.

From Quora: [[https://www.quora.com/How-many-seconds-does-it-take-for-a-bullet-to-hit-the-target]]

A .45 bullet travels at 960 feet per second. Shooting someone 12 feet away means a time of 12/960 = 0.0125 or 12.5 milliseconds which is much smaller than the 500 millisecond activation time.
