Scaling exponentially can mean basically anything depending on the exponent; you should pick one.

Does pressing two crystals together count as one big crystal? (If they're perfectly flush and flat?) If so, you can build a perpetual motion machine out of this - big vertical wheel carries a divided crystal through a channel that splits and rejoins the halves. When split it's too heavy to support itself and falls to the part where the channel presses the halves together to hit the mass threshold needed to float. The structure would have be below crystal-altitude, while most of society would naturally end up above that altitude (resting on crystals, not hanging from), so there's a tunnel or a journey down the side of a floating island involved if you want to visit the power plant.
