You can extract energy from the water vapor thing. The most obvious way is that the air becomes denser when the water vapor in it contracts into droplets, so large crystals will be surrounded by a constant downdraft, which can power a windmill. But you could probably do something cleverer with sealed pistons containing steam, which then collapse when near a crystal to do mechanical work.

In order to have floating islands, big crystals aren't enough. You either need distributed crystal (plus a ton of luck in the formation process), or you need the islands to be made out of diamond, because trying to support an island on a single crystal will just lead to most of it breaking apart and falling away. Basically what you want for the floating islands aesthetic isn't merely a crystal that itself floats, but a crystal that also makes rock touching it float. So if I'm a scientist who sees a floating island, I'm going to try making nearby rocks float using a crystal, and if it works, there's another way to extract energy (e.g. a wheel that floats on one side and falls on the other).
