/(edit: re-positioned some examples)/

I don't care that much how the laws of a LITRPG universe are being explained away because, as you've said, when dealing with any fictional universe you have to accept some basic axioms as granted and proceed from there. It doesn't matter if among those axioms are just superman's [[http://youngjustice.wikia.com/wiki/Superman#Powers_and_abilities][powers and abilities]] or a “rulebook” that describes how all living creatures have stat points and experience bars.

Here are some things that I /do/ care about:

1. Once the postulates have been introduced, any implications that would logically be derived from them should either also take effect on the world or have an explanation for why they are not present.

For instance, if [you kill a creature] → [you get EXP] → [you level up] → [you improve yourself], then:

- either countries have monster farms (if they can be bred in captivity) \ monster capturers so that certain people (royals, researchers, important non-combatant officials, etc) could level up their stats and skills without doing any extra work and risking their lives---
- or there is a specific reason why they are not doing that (high concentration of monsters breeds some other kinds of hazard, there's a specific set of requirement for the experiences gaining to work, etc).

2. The rest of the presented world and phenomena within it must either be consistent with those postulates or have explanations for the existing inconsistencies.

The economic value of gold you mentioned is one example of this.

Another one is that if [creatures have levels], [levels give stat points], [stat points can be used for increasing P.Def], then the level-10 protag with 30 P.ATK can not kill a level-100 rock elemental with 500 P.DEF in a regular physical combat no matter what. Either the author gets clever and comes up with a /really/ good strategy and explanation for how that victory was possible, or the story starts severely straining my suspension of disbelief.

3. Especially in cases when the protagonist has been transported to this RPGMechVerse from our world, they should start actively trying to de-construct the seemingly contradictory and absurd laws of nature to see how these contradictions resolve themselves in experimental situations to make sense.

So far, the only stories I've found that tried having a protag like that and, consequently, to answer the questions that would emerge from such experiments, were [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RyuugisTheGamesWePlay][/The Games We Play/]] and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/DungeonKeeperAmi][/DK AMI/]] (maybe also [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/terror-infinity/][/Terror Infinity/]] to some extent). And even then the authors were shying away from some things. In almost all other stories, the main characters just “go with the flow”, never bothering to wonder, and so coming off as zombies to me-the-reader.

4. Protagonists (and their adversaries) must be clever and not make stupid mistakes.

Goodreads has been a severe disappointment for me in this regard. You try looking for a LITRPG series in the database to read, find [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/179187-chaos-seeds][something popular with an 80% rating or higher,]] and then +the protagonist KEEPS MAKING ONE STUPID MISTAKE AFTER ANOTHER A-A-A-A!!+ the story turns out to be of a very poor quality and you start wondering who were all these people that rated it as a 5/5.

p.s. Regarding the premise of a LITRPG, it's just a preference for me but I generally like when our world is not able to influence the RPG world too much. This, for instance, means that stories like SAO (where the characters are vulnerable to attacks on their bodies and on the game's server) become less enjoyable for me.
