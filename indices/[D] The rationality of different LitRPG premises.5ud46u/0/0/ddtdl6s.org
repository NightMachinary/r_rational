FWIW, TGWP wasn't really about a real protagonist in a game world, it was effectively about a game protagonist in a 'real' world. There was less room for experiments with game physics (although experiments still happened, to help gauge the protagonist's capabilities).

DK Ami is probably much better in that regard.
