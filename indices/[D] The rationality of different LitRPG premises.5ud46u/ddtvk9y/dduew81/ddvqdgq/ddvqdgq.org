I think it's possible to have high stakes in the real world without necessarily having to resort to the protagonist facing the threat of death.

A good example of that is the anime series /Kaiji/, which is about an unemployed, dead-broke guy with a mountain of debt who gets roped into high-stakes gambling games hosted by the local yakuza. If he wins, all his debts are forgiven and he walks away with a tidy sum of cash. If he loses, he'll be forced into a 10-year contract with the gangsters and made to do manual labor underground until his time's up or he dies from the poor working conditions.

I could see something similar happening with an RPG instead of gambling games.
