Working for Megacorp X sounds a lot like stories I've heard about QA for Electronic Arts.

Joking aside, though, I'd be pretty amused to read something like that. The death game premise is still a huge stretch, but I love the idea of QA protagonists. (I started co-writing a book with a QA protagonist a while back, but we haven't finished it.)
