It would have been an interesting---but far more "hard speculative fiction"---angle, if they indeed /had/ just ripped everyone's headsets off, and left them semi-brain-damaged---with the "better half" of each person's mind left uploaded into the game.

The people /in/ the game could then have had a moment where someone from the real world managed to reach them, and told them that "they" were all awake and walking around in the real world, but weren't quite themselves any more---that they had all mostly fallen off the life-paths they were on. The goal would be to merge the parts of them existing in the game back into the parts in physical reality.

It might not even work fully, in the end: their physical selves' minds might be restored, but their digital selves might persist, stuck in the game. Each individual would have their own personal denouement for whether they kept in touch with their digital self afterward. Some might even play games "alongside" their digitally-trapped self. (Which can be a positive thing, if you [[http://megaman.wikia.com/wiki/NetNavi][don't question it much]].)
