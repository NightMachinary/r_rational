There is a fairly good (and hilarious) Russian LitRPG novel [[http://samlib.ru/c/carenko_t_p/reabilitacija.shtml][Реабилитация (en: Rehabilitation)]] which has a premise that does not seem fall into the categories you describe. It is somewhat like /gold farming/ but I believe it is sufficiently different to be mentioned here: present-day MC signed up for cryonics then some years later got shot in some unexplained circumstances and subsequently frozen. About three hundred years later laws are passed that make indefinite life extension a right of every citizen. Any person who's body is unable to continue living for any reason other than destroyed brain and who has not explicitly opted out of this, are uploaded and put into virtual reality of their choice. Specific wording happened to apply to cryonically preserved at any point in the past. So MC gets thawed out, his consciousness digitized and his body disposed of. He is promptly informed of the situation. Getting a new meatspace body is possible but hellishly expensive unless one has a sufficiently high /social significance rating/ IRL, which is similar to what China is currently trying to do with their /social credit system/. Ways this rating can be raised to required levels are limited in VR, and are further limited to those that will not cause extreme future shock. Virtually the only way immediately available to MC is "attaining goodhood" within the stock-fantasy VR game of the setting.
