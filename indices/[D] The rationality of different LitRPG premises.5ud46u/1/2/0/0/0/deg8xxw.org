A twist like that (or some variation thereof) would be great. I'm not sure I'd go about it from a "splitting" standpoint; treating the characters in the game world as being uploaded "copies" of the person would be more believable to me, although that still would probably be beyond the tech level of SAO. (Maybe not, though, if Yui - heh, "Yui" - is an emergent AI.)
