I believe they mentioned later that everyone who was hooked into the machines was moved into hospitals for care. You can see [[#s][spoilers for end of season 1]]

That said, this still would require a method of locating everyone who is hooked into the game and moving them to a hospital. Moreover, it would presumably require maintaining both power and internet connectivity to the game servers the entire time. That makes the hospital solution implausible and compounds the whole "always online" issue even further.
