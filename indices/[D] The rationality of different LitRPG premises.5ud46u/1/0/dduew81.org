  Moreover, SAO itself doesn't play like a just-launched MMO, and certainly not like the first one on a new device. No game-breaking bugs? No server crashes? No client-side memory leaks? I don't believe it in the slightest.

You know, that makes me want to read a story with the following premise:

In ancapdystopiastan, Megacorp X has developed AIs that can program games from scratch, almost entirely without human intervention. But that "almost" is important, and with the codebase being made by robots, it's too difficult to navigate by regular programmers to find issues, and of course all the robot error-checking that could be done, has been done. So instead, QA employees are sent into the game with an ultimatum-- if you die, you die in real life. You get out of the game if you beat it (thus producing useful data for balancing) or if it crashes for you. Thus, the story would be about trying to exploit the game as hard as possible in order to escape.
