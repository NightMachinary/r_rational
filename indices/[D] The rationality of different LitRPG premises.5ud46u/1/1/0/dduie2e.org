Yep, I agree with your general point and the comparison to Star Wars, etc.

I absolutely agree that worlds with UIs and other RPG mechanics feel "designed" rather than natural. To me, at least, that just means the protagonists should at least /think/ about that fact - even if it's never answered within the story. Giving a satisfactory answer would be great, but that's a lot tougher.
