I think your post gets at a larger point, which is that readers are more willing to accept the impossible than the implausible. (Not to veer off topic too much, but I think this is why a lot of Star Wars viewers are fine with "The Force" as a mystical power, but find the idea of midichlorians to be incredibly stupid. Saying "this world was designed by a deity" or "it just exists" could you get away with things more easily than if you tried to come up with an explanation for how some Japanese designer was able to devise and execute it.

However, I feel like litRPG has more problems with this than a "traditional" portal fantasy would (where people just get sucked into a magical world, a la Narnia). The magical world of Narnia is, in many ways, modeled after nature. Things like talking lions and talking mice are inventions of the human imagination, but in an intangible way, they feel more like nature than artifice. LitRPG worlds, on the other hand, are modeled after video games, and therefore they feel inherently more artificial (and less natural in the literal sense of being "less like nature"). When I see a griffin, I think "Oh, this is like a lion and an eagle, both of which are part of nature," and even if I know that griffins are a human invention, that's not where my mind goes instantly; accidents of evolution have already given us plenty of strange creatures. But when I see an HP bar floating over someone's head, or see an axe fail to damage a wooden shield due to arbitrary numbers and levels attached to those items, my mind immediately jumps to the idea that "someone made this." It feels like a designed world, which leads to the obvious question of who the designer is. (This is why I kind of feel like the idea of the world being constructed by a deity works better than the idea that the world "just is.")
