I actually tend to find it easier to suspend disbelief in portal fantasy style LitRPG, as opposed to "death game" style LitRPG like SAO, because the death game style LitRPG often tends to ignore the realities of how the video game development works.

SAO, for example, seems to imply that a single developer is responsible for both major game design decisions and technical features of the hardware. This is to the point where he could sneak in tech that can be used to kill people, as well as make major changes to the game itself (e.g. disabling certain UI functions, like logging out).

Not only is it /extremely/ unlikely that a single person would be responsible for both lead game design responsibilities and designing the hardware, it's implausible to me that he could have gotten away with these changes without being caught at some point in the process of code review, Quality Assurance, etc.

Moreover, SAO itself doesn't play like a just-launched MMO, and certainly not like the first one on a new device. No game-breaking bugs? No server crashes? No client-side memory leaks? I don't believe it in the slightest.

Also, where are all the people from the company that decided to play their own product on launch day? That's a /huge/ thing with MMO development. There would be QA testers and game devs that know the game backwards and forwards all over the place.

I'm ranting about SAO specifically here, but I run into problems like this with a lot of LitRPGs. There seems to be an idealized version of game development and releases that doesn't involve a lot of research. There also are often elements that don't make a lot of sense from a game design standpoint (unique skills for main characters that no one else can get, all sorts of deterministically generated content that would be nightmarish to test, etc.)

I've seen some exceptions. Ascend Online has patches mid-book, for example, and some interesting discussion of user social dynamics and subscription fees, etc. The Proving Grounds actually has a QA department and game devs involved in the plot, which was refreshing to see.
