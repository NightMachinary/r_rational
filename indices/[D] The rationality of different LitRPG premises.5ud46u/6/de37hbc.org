Stephenson's /Reamde/ is a great example of the economic incentive. I think most of the book takes place in the real world, but big chunks of it are in T'Rain because a) T'Rain currency can be mined like Bitcoins and exchanged for dollars, and b) a group of hackers are encrypting players' files and offering the key in exchange for T'Rain currency.

This kind of lampshades your discussion because a lot of the book is actively concerned with the development and functionality of the game world--the creator intentionally built the world to be as rational as possible, and that serves as the fulcrum for much of the plot. Good book, if kind of off-the-wall.
