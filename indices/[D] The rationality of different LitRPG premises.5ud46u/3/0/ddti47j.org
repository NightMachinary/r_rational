  games, and by extension game worlds, have a /ton/ of mechanics.

Even though that's true, consider that when you want to play a videogame you do not first go and read its manual book from cover to cover. You just start playing the game, and along your gameplay progression its mechanics gets gradually unfolded before you.

So I think for LitRPG stories that'd generally be a good strategy to adopt as well --- the reader would explore the world along with the protagonist, and gradually each new unlocked area, item, or important setting rule would introduce its small bit of extra exposition.

[[http://reincarnator.wikia.com/wiki/Reincarnator_Wikia#Site_Navigation][Here's]] the wikia for [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/reincarnator/][/Reincarnator,/]] for example. It has articles about Dimensions and Zones, Powers, Abilities, Item types, and so on. But the story itself doesn't start by explaining all these things that are surely important parts of the setting. Instead, in the introduction the reader is given a glimpse of what the protagonist has to try preventing, and then the story begins where the protagonist has to face one problem after another --- with each new problem arc also coming a new bit of explanation regarding the world's lore and mechanics.

So I think a good approach would be to first keep re-designing if not the entire mechanics system then at least its backbone, until no inconsistencies popped up when you tried simulating the world through time. After that, some of these elements would get shown in the actual story as the tip of the iceberg, while the rest of the sketches would stay under the hood. Those could either be revealed in a complementing blog or side project for those who're interested enough to read your world-building notes (something that MoL's author seems to be doing, for example) or just be left alone, for maybe possible future fanfic writers to explore upon on their own.

This, however, leaves unanswered another problem adjacent to the one you mentioned: how to determine which plot devices, introduced down the line, will the readers perceive as congruent with the previously established setting elements, and which ones will feel like Deus ex machina cop outs to them.
