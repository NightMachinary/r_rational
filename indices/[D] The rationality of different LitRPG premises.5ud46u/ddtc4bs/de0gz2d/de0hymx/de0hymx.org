I've put it for later reading because [[https://thegam3.com/table-of-contents/][it seems to not be finished yet.]]

Unfinished stories are my bane in general, at the moment. Once I've accumulated 10+ stories that were WiPs with various update frequencies, I kinda had no choice but to start putting them in a time capsule for checking up on them some several years later.

Thanks for the recommendation though. Do you maybe know any RPGMech stories that are at least generally rational and contain 300k--500k+ words? So far the only long series that I haven't tried yet is [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/42300-guardians-of-the-flame][/Guardians of the Flame,/]] with almost all the rest ending up being a disappointment.
