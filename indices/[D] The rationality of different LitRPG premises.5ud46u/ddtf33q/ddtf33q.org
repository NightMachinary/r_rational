One thing I'd like to draw attention to is how games, and by extension game worlds, have a /ton/ of mechanics. MMOs most notably, but true for other forms as well, the author simply can't start out the story with a large tutorial that explains every rule of the game. From the simple nature of the mediums, authors have to hoard exposition-minutes like gold, and that means with game worlds they have to cheat.

Even if the game world is properly and fully developed, and every rule is internally consistent and coherent, the readers won't know this because they only got exposition for immediately relevant ones. This makes traps for the author, where they can want to use their entirely coherent and pre-defined mechanic to advance the plot of the game, but since they couldn't afford to mention it in the info dump it's out of left field to the reader. The simplest way of avoiding this trap, of course, is to just not use the mechanic, which eventually creates game worlds with no 'game' to them beyond what's immediately relevant to the player.

There are creative solutions to this, such as making a real-life game (if not as immersive) and using it to teach the more in-depth mechanics of the game, by which point your story is a fanfic and understanding of 'canon' is to be expected, or you could have an encyclopedia full of the game rules to refer to at the start of the book. By far the easiest, though, is to discard game elements whenever convenient and substitute them for more intuitive shounen elements under the guise of "game elements", or something else similar.
