Could you clarify this? I agree posts shouldn't primarily be about non rational subjects but we literally have a [meta] tag for general discussion right? These kinds of posts are the main reason I'm on the sub in the first place.

I believe short thoughts should be in the weekly threads but sufficiently elaborate essays deserve a shot at being a post an sich.
