What about [[http://np.reddit.com/domain/critical-hits.com/][my zillions of links to /Critical Hits/]], of which many have been "abstract discussion"? And this post /does/ explicitly reference several existing works.

You (plural) could at least add [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4v9tx0/dc_the_blistering_stupidity_of_fallout_3/d5wvztt/][these spur-of-the-moment "rules"]] to the sidebar as soon as you decide to institute them.
