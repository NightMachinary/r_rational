Yeah this is actually kinda a bad introduction to SCP Wiki since this article requires you be pretty familiar with an SCP entry, now that I think about it. [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-140][SCP-140]] may be a better introduction, or [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2602][SCP-2602, which used to be a library]].
