It doesn't really work for me. I saw the format, and got really excited for a spin on the [[http://www.damninteresting.com/this-place-is-not-a-place-of-honor/][Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]] - here is a containment procedure that must be readable to people even after the English language no longer exists! The actual document was something of a letdown then.

The document itself is fine, until the "experiment logs" broke my suspension of disbelief. Trying to portray events through cartoons doesn't really make sense when they clearly have video recordings they could have used instead. (Or, since the SCP wiki doesn't allow inline videos, timestamped screenshots from video recordings.) It's just not something a professional research/containment facility would do. I know it would be a lot more work for the author, but they could just as easily have left out the experiments and put something else in.

Also, as I understand this SCP, it's only a danger to people who talk about it. Information about it is self-supressing, it's an antimeme in spirit even if it doesn't fit into the Antimemetics continuity. So... how was it discovered in the first place, and wouldn't it be neutralised if we just destroyed all information about it? Why are we /intentionally/ exposing clearance level 4 staff to a Keter?
