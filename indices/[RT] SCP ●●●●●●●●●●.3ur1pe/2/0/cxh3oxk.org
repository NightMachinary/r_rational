It might not be able to distinguish humans from pencils/papers. It probably just understands the words, and things that generate them proximally.

●●|●●●●●|●●|● looks like it basically takes anything that it understands as knowing about it, or containing information about it. When a human speaks, it seizes the human, but when a human writes, maybe it recognizes the pencil and paper as the "speaker" and doesn't make the connection that the human is involved somehow. This is in the same sense that it doesn't seize the sound system that said to the human, "start writing"-- this kind of stuff is not comprehensible to it.
