It's worth noting that minds /can/ be considered fundamental in the SCP-verse. Coincidentally, this from the point of view of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover][another]] piece of Yudkowski fanfic:

/Anyway, Maria, the logic of the events you're describing is one where consciousness has effects that take precedence over the laws of physics - where lower levels of organization give way to higher levels of organization. There are universes where the visible rules are simple, mathematical, and fundamental, and everything that happens, happens within them. And there are universes where the visible rules are complicated and have explicit special cases for surface phenomena - and usually some of the visible rules are about mental phenomena, and don't visibly reduce to rules about non-mental parts. We call the former sort of universe 'natural', and the latter sort 'magical'./

The SCP-verse definitely qualifies as magical. (referencing Yudkowski to explain everything seems reasonable, considering that I think this is one of the pieces that he will neither confirm nor deny)
