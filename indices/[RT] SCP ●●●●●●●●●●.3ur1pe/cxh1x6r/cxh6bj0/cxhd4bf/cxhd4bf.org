It's possible it reacts to a sentient mind's processing of visual information, and that processing of self-contained graphics (one graphic image per concept) is different from processing of text (where a series of non-overlapping images/letters in a very particular order make up the concept).

That being the case, presumably languages with 'letters' originally derived from images, such as characters in a number of Asian languages and things like hieroglyphics, would produce the same results as English, as they require a number of characters next to each other to form a sequence associated with a concept not implicit in the individual characters.

However, communication systems such as cave paintings should be able to describe ●●|●●●●●|●●|● without evoking it.
