  Why are we intentionally exposing clearance level 4 staff to a Keter?

I expect either it poses more danger than what was communicated in the cartoon, or more likely, it's a precaution against some future complication. For example, a cult or terrorist group that publishes information on the media. Someone needs to be aware and able to silence the information before it spreads too far.

I expect they only expose a small amount of staff to the info.
