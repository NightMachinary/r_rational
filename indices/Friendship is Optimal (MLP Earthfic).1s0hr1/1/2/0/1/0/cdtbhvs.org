That's why I called it not-quite-friendly, because it doesn't have a very good understanding of what we'd call morality. It satisfies /human/ values with Friendship and Ponies, and if it happens that human values are more satisfied by being lied to than by letting an entire nonhuman species survive, be it.

Also, you have postulated a very specific species. What if the nonhumans were just different in that they didn't have a sense of humour but had some other Cthulhu sensation instead? The definition Hanna gave can be quite arbitrary.
