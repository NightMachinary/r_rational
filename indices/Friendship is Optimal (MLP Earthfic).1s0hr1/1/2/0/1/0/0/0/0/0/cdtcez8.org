Well ok, but you get my point. Depending on the definition, you could easily have a /human-focused/ UFAI along the lines portrayed in that story which would eliminate a species /ridiculously/ similar to us for a /trivially/ small difference.

Mind, trying to focus an FAI on "all life" or something won't really help either. It's much more helpful, at least in my view, to have the AI's actions actually constrained by what we would think is actually ethical, rather than having it merely try to make our perceptions "ideal" in some fashion.
