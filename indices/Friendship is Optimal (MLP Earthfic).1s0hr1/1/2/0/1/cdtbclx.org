Oooh thank you! I missed that one. . .

This arguments often confuse me. A friendly AGI requires some level of consciousness with a understanding of moral concepts. How do you get a moral AGI discarding the value of whole species? If it does, if we laid out the whole moral calculus would we disagree?

. . . <Dont have time for a full 5 minutes ATM, but 1st thought> Would species that would-not accept life in a simulation; implying an significant lower efficiency [AGI reads waste] in mind-states per unit of matter on their planets be a reasonable answer?

Backing up from the gut reaction to genocide, then what is the im/morality of it? The question is troubling in terms of hospital economics or patient triage. An alternate parallel might be the U.S.'s decision to nuke two Japaneses cities and coerce surrender rather than the higher projected death toll of invading Japan.
