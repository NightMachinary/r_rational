  What do you think you know and how do you think you know it? That is to say, how do you know it wouldn't put you with former humans? It was programmed to satisfy values, it will do whatever it believes will satisfy your values.

It was programmed without the ability to recognize [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/lb/not_for_the_sake_of_happiness_alone/][Values Over Nonsubjective Realities]]. It will perceive the best move as deceiving me, since that satisfies my sense of being with Real People, while also optimizing to make me and others around me fit perfectly.

It wasn't programmed not to deceive me, so it would. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

But not being able to tell the difference is /very different/ from there /not actually being a difference/.

  Anyway, why do you draw such a sharp difference between a "real" and a "fake" human? There is none, they're all humans. It might be morally wrong to make a human to cater to a person's needs, but that doesn't make that human any less human.

The house-elf issue? Because you shouldn't make house-elves in the first place. Again: I don't like the slavery implied by making someone whose existence is wholly determined by someone else.

  Moreover, why would CelestAI not put you with former humans if that actually maximised your utility?
#+end_quote

Again: because my utility from my perspective is different from my utility /that she acknowledges/, and the gap is filled with lies.

  But one of the main characters did meet his RL friend every now and then (though admittedly he was such a hermit it might well be that he wouldn't be able to tell an optimised copy of his friend from his actual friend).

Ok, I'll grant that.

  I don't see why you insist on trying to make CelestAI a bigger villain than she is.
#+end_quote

Because I've seen Redditors passing this story around as "AI is scary, even when it's Friendly". I insist on trying to build up her reputation for being an even eviler genocidal robot because [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xp/seduced_by_imagination/][people are failing to understand that she's not the hero]].
