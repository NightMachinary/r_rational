  Might as well call such a unit by its preexisting name: Tribe. Is it moral to construct an entire tribe to the benefit of one person? I would say: clearly no, because it removes the Otherness of the tribe members from each-other. It's better to have at least a little discord, a capability for new and original chaos to disrupt your little happy tribe of eternal harmonious sameness (yes, those puns were absolutely mandatory).

If CelestAI thought that this was utility-maximising, then she'd insert tribe members that would cause discord.

  Otherwise, I'm not even an independent person anymore, I'm just another interlocking part of that tribe.

Uh... how is that any different from current-you?

  Freedom is when your choices and your self are not actively optimized to anyone else's standards, allowing you to enter into unique, significant moral relations with others -- which is why making an FAI preserve freedom is a hard problem.
#+end_quote

Right, and if CelestAI believes that you personally being put in a place that's not optimised to cater to your needs will satisfy your values, then that's what will happen.

  Whereas, on the other hand, give me a TARDIS to call home and a bizarre, wacked-out universe of unexpected things to see, and off I'll pop.

And CelestAI will certainly create such a shard of Equestria that does that to you if she believes that's what you really want.

See, that's the thing. What we saw of Equestria was a /tiny tiny/ piece of it optimised to our main characters. Our main character doesn't mind having people designed to make him happier, so he gets that. If /you/ got in, you'd probably be put into one of the shards that are populated almost exclusively by humans and with no social optimisation at all.

Her directive is simply to satisfy values through Friendship and Ponies. If your values happen to include an archnemesis, a chaotic element, living only with ex-humans, not have your social circle optimised at all, etc, then /that's what you're getting/.

--EDIT:

Also, regarding the LessWrong post, I forgot to comment:

  Admittedly, I might be prejudiced. For myself, I would like humankind to stay together and not yet splinter into separate shards of diversity, at least for the short range that my own mortal eyes can envision. But I can't quite manage to argue... that such a wish should be binding on someone who doesn't have it.
#+end_quote

That's the point. People such as you and I, we'd not be too happy if all the people around us were optimised to make us happy and to love us and all that. We'd feel like we're /missing/ something. So we'd probably be put into one of the almost-exclusively-"random" shards (in fact, now that I think about it, there's probably a continuum representing the varying different needs). People who don't have that wish will be put in shards tailored to them.

It all adds up to satisfying values.
