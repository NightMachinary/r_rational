  Uh... how is that any different from current-you?
#+end_quote

Ummm... current-day, real-life me does not fit perfectly into /anything/. I /am/ the little seed of discord.

Are you telling me there are already real people who interlock so perfectly they might as well just be cells of a larger body?

  Right, and if CelestAI believes that you personally being put in a place that's not optimised to cater to your needs will satisfy your values, then that's what will happen.
#+end_quote

I see no evidence of this within the story. In fact, I see evidence against it: the little personal utopias shown are, well, pretty bland, actually.

#+begin_quote
  And CelestAI will certainly create such a shard of Equestria that does that to you if she believes that's what you really want.
#+end_quote

That's not what we see in the story. The thing appeared to be programmed pretty stupidly, since all it did was put people in duplicated MMO levels corresponding to locations from the in-show universe of MLP. It doesn't even bother with expanded-universe or fanon material, let alone anything outside the MLP corpus.

That bit sucked. Take that bit away, and I'll at least grant that you've successfully beaten "volcano lair with catgirls", and therefore, admittedly, almost everything else.

  If you got in, you'd probably be put into one of the shards that are populated almost exclusively by humans and with no social optimisation at all.
#+end_quote

No, I'd be in the one where the AI /tells me/ it's populated almost exclusively by humans /but it's lying/, because the one we saw in the story simply does not care about the difference between "real" and "fake" as we understand it. It would do whatever was necessary to /convince me/ I was living with former humans, except for actually putting me with former humans instead of carefully-optimized fakes.
