Hmmm.... this comment is about to get really disturbing.

I view it as a form of mind-control. People who are optimized for me to like them and them to like me aren't really /separate/ at all; they're tightly controlled parts of a larger system, meant to better the functioning of that system.

Might as well call such a unit by its preexisting name: Tribe. Is it moral to construct an entire tribe to the benefit of one person? I would say: clearly /no/, because it removes the Otherness of the tribe members from each-other. It's better to have at least a little /discord/, a capability for new and original /chaos/ to disrupt your little happy tribe of eternal harmonious sameness (yes, those puns were absolutely mandatory).

Otherwise, /I'm/ not even an independent person anymore, I'm just another interlocking part of that tribe. That's not desirable, that's slavery -- admittedly kinder, gentler, pastel slavery. /Freedom/ is when your choices and your self are not /actively optimized/ to anyone else's standards, allowing you to enter into unique, significant moral relations with others -- which is why making an FAI preserve freedom is a hard problem.

It's part and parcel with the ways in which canon!Equestria /sounds/ nice but would actually be a pretty bad place to live. A whole world built around the tastes of white American female seven-year-olds, and the sweet ones in particular! Fairly nice place to visit, but I'm a 24-year-old, highly-sardonic Israeli Jewish male. If exposed to actual Ponyville, I would, within only a few hours, go insane, strap a bandanna around my face, and start chucking bricks through windows in an anarchist rampage For The Lulz, out of sheer boredom.

Whereas, on the other hand, give me a TARDIS to call home and a bizarre, wacked-out universe of unexpected things to see, and off I'll pop.
