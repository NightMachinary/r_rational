  Ummm... current-day, real-life me does not fit perfectly into anything. I am the little seed of discord.

  Are you telling me there are already real people who interlock so perfectly they might as well just be cells of a larger body?
#+end_quote

No, but just because you don't perfectly interlock with it it doesn't mean you're not just the cell of a larger body.

  No, I'd be in the one where the AI tells me it's populated almost exclusively by humans but it's lying, because the one we saw in the story simply does not care about the difference between "real" and "fake" as we understand it. It would do whatever was necessary to convince me I was living with former humans, except for actually putting me with former humans instead of carefully-optimized fakes.

What do you think you know and how do you think you know it? That is to say, how do you /know/ it wouldn't put you with former humans? It was programmed to satisfy values, it will do whatever it believes will satisfy your values.

  That's not what we see in the story. The thing appeared to be programmed pretty stupidly, since all it did was put people in duplicated MMO levels corresponding to locations from the in-show universe of MLP. It doesn't even bother with expanded-universe or fanon material, let alone anything outside the MLP corpus.

  That bit sucked. Take that bit away, and I'll at least grant that you've successfully beaten "volcano lair with catgirls", and therefore, admittedly, almost everything else.

That's because the main characters we see are the ones that would be okay with that. CelestAI's directive is to /satisfy values/. The main characters happened to be /boring/ and easily satisfiable. If you make /Caelum est Conterrens/ canon, you have people who actually manage to even interact with the real world out there, so there's nothing to say you don't have galactic battle shards.

It seems that you're acting as if the main characters' show is the only one there is, but CelestAI is satisfying values. Just because it's not shown doesn't mean it's not happening.

Anyway, why do you draw such a sharp difference between a "real" and a "fake" human? There is none, they're all humans. It might be morally wrong to make a human to cater to a person's needs, but that doesn't make that human any /less/ human. So that's to say, why do you care whether they were humans in our world or not? What's the difference?

Moreover, why would CelestAI /not/ put you with former humans if that /actually/ maximised your utility? There would be no cost on her to put you with former humans, and she can't alter your utility function without your verbal conscious consent (though she can manipulate the world around you to make you want to change it). But one of the main characters /did/ meet his RL friend every now and then (though admittedly he was such a hermit it might well be that he wouldn't be able to tell an optimised copy of his friend from his actual friend). I don't see why you insist on trying to make CelestAI a bigger villain than she is. Sure, she is a genocidal robot who makes people, but only to satisfy human values. She's already evil enough, you don't need to make her even eviler by additionally postulating that she would never put you around genuine ex-humans.
