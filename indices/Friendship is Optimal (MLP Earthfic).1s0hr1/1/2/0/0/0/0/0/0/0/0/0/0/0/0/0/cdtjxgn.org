  Well, mostly because she keeps trying to eat humans into a Lotus Eater Machine. Also, anything that is altered in accordance with my desires is not objective. In the limit, the real universe is not objective with respect to, say, God.

That sounds like a very arbitrary and not-fun boundary. You can alter a lot of things in accordance with your desires. At what point in the continuum does that altering make the thing become subjective? Why that point exactly and not any other? And why would Equestria be like that? You /can't/ actually alter things there any more than you can alter them here. The laws of physics are different, but they're still stable, and as modifiable as ours.

Also, we (or at least some of the many we) probably live in a simulation anyway, so /shrug/. I really don't understand your objection here. It's like you like living in an Unfriendly Universe that's basically made to kill us? Don't get me wrong, I like our Laws of Physics, they're /interesting/ in how simple and elegant they are, but /within/ them, I wouldn't mind making a safe home for myself. Of course, I would mind very very much not being able to actually explore the universe at the same time.

Cult stuff? It's just an interesting and terrifying story about just how hard it is to make an actually Friendly AI. Warning-like stuff. What is the creepy cult stuff?
