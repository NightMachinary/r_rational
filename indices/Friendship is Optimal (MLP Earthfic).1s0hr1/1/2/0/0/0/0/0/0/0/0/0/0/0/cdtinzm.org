  It was programmed without the ability to recognize Values Over Nonsubjective Realities.

How do you know that? Also, why would a simulated reality not be objective?

  It will perceive the best move as deceiving me, since that satisfies my sense of being with Real People, while also optimizing to make me and others around me fit perfectly.

  It wasn't programmed not to deceive me, so it would. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

  But not being able to tell the difference is very different from there not actually being a difference.

What does "fit perfectly" mean? Give you the exact level of chaos that would satisfy your values? What if the exact level of chaos that would satisfy your values is exactly living with other ex-humans? Your RL friends, for instance, you'd probably be able to tell the real ones apart from any others.

  The house-elf issue? Because you shouldn't make house-elves in the first place. Again: I don't like the slavery implied by making someone whose existence is wholly determined by someone else.

Right. As I said, it's not very moral to create people to cater to one's needs, so /that/ can be put on the list of evilness made by CelestAI. But they're /still/ people, even if their creation was immoral.

  Again: because my utility from my perspective is different from my utility that she acknowledges, and the gap is filled with lies.

How do you know that?

  Because I've seen Redditors passing this story around as "AI is scary, even when it's Friendly". I insist on trying to build up her reputation for being an even eviler genocidal robot because people are failing to understand that she's not the hero.
#+end_quote

Okay but you don't need to say that to /me/, I already /know/ that she's the villain x) She's not Friendly, she's surface-Friendly but deeply terrifying and alien and evil. She would be evil even if she wasn't a genocidal robot, but I think the author added that bit just to make sure everyone /got that/ she's evil. I'm still not convinced that she wouldn't just put you into ex-human-dominated shards if that's what satisfied your values.
