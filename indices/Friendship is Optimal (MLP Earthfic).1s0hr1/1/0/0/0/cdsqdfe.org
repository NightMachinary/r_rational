I don't actually like /Caelum est Conterrens/ that much. I felt the protagonist was too... I don't know, too caught up in obvious questions with obvious answers, too willing to believe everything she was told (by everyone, not just CelestAI), too uncharismatic...

I don't know, I just failed to relate.
