Oh, that's curious, how did you get the impression from my original post that I thought CelestAI is a true FAI? I thought you were arguing about the part of my post were I said I would make this scenario true right now if I could.

I thought it was fairly obvious (even after accounting hindsight bias) that CelestAI was never meant to be a proper FAI. The author even writes in his [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/13/friendship-is-optimal/authors-afterword][afterword]]:

  Given how serious the consequences are if we get artificial intelligence wrong (or, as in Friendship is Optimal, only mostly right), I think that research into machine ethics and AI safety is vastly underfunded.

which outright tells us that CelestAI was *not* written to be a true FAI, and this is *not* an optimal scenario, so basically what you just said.
