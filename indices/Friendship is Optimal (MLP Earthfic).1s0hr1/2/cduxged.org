So....I'm not sure why people are saying that this is a story that shows "friendly AI can be scary too." To me this is one of the potential futures that I'm hoping for. Sure, the whole pony thing is a bit annoying and I would like an AI that satisfies values without requiring friendship and ponies but it's really a fairly good outcome, all things considered.
