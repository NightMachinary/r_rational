Yes, of course, CelestAI is better than the default. It's just that the point of the story /isn't/ to show how even FAI can be scary, but rather to show how /hard/ it is to make an FAI and how even tiny little mistakes can have huge world-sweeping consequences to humanity.

Anyway, if I were to choose between the most likely scenarios and CelestAI, I'd choose the latter in an instant; but if I were to actually freely choose, CelestAI would be nowhere near the top.
