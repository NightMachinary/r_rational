Uh... nope, CelestAI is not friendly. She [[#s][spoilers]] and trapped humans in what's basically an inescapable Lotus Eater Machine (really, /why/ is it that once uploaded humans must have no more contact with outside reality? That is /completely stupid/). Also she creates extra sapients with the sole purpose of satisfying the values of already-existing sapients, which is basically the same thing as making House Elves. So, no, CelestAI isn't friendly at all.

(Take a look at the discussion about it between me and user eaturbrainz [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1s0hr1/friendship_is_optimal_mlp_earthfic/cdsp4ps][here]].)
