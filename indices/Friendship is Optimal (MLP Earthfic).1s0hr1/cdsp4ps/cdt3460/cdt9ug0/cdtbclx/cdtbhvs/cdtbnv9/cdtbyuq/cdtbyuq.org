  I was fairly impressed Hanna's definition of Humanity worked for humans
#+end_quote

We're not told there are any biological humans /not recognized as human/. We're simply told there are lots of aliens exterminated for not being recognized as human, and that the aliens which are /not/ exterminated are forcibly assimilated, Borg-fashion, just like the humans were.

For all we know it found Time Lords or some other alien race we would have really liked, but decided that two hearts means not human, means it's time to feed Gallifrey to the nano-recycler-bots.
