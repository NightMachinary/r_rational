That's more personal, I think. I mean, I personally don't exactly value a "real" mobile phone more than a simulated uploaded mobile phone, or vice-versa; nor do I value a "real" person born in the biological world more than a "nonreal" person/AI simulated in a computer, or vice-versa.

However, I value figuring out the "real" Laws of Physics more than I value figuring out the constructed Equestrian physical Laws.
