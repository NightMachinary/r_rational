  Of course, I would mind very very much not being able to actually explore the universe at the same time.

And this is what makes me object to simulated realities. I'm fine with a "simulation" that I can treat like a piece of real estate: step in or out of my own free will (even if I rarely go out because I'm a massive /nerd/).

Unfortunately, almost nobody has ever actually proposed such a thing. The general rule for simulated-place-to-live proposals seems to be, "Hey everyone, I'mma make us a totally awesome simulation, and you're going to climb in and NEVER LEAVE! Won't it be AWESOME!?"

Which results in me facepalming, because my exposure to TVTropes has rendered me capable of differentiating between a Pocket Universe and a Lotus Eater Machine and I don't understand /why/ people insist on proposing them together /every damn time/.

  Cult stuff? It's just an interesting and terrifying story about just how hard it is to make an actually Friendly AI. Warning-like stuff. What is the creepy cult stuff?

You know how Yudkowsky was reportedly unsure of which option in /Three Worlds Collide/ was the good one? You know how there are people who misclassify this as a successful FAI? You know how there are people who think Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres is a good and rational person?

I mean, hell, you know how Yudkowsky made up his own god/demon-grade monster that can supposedly exist in real life, called an AI ;-)?

Much of the clade known as "rationalists" creep me the hell out, and often seem like a cult. Maybe it's just me, but I never feel sure if I'm in enemy territory or not.
