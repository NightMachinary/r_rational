Maybe it's personal, but should you unleash an AI incapable of recognizing such valuations? FUCK NO.

  However, I value figuring out the "real" Laws of Physics more than I value figuring out the constructed Equestrian physical Laws.

Bingo.

  nor do I value a "real" person born in the biological world more than a "nonreal" person/AI simulated in a computer, or vice-versa.

Ok, objection corrected: most of us do value [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xt/interpersonal_entanglement/][the basic Otherness]] of others. We don't want to live in extrapolations of our own minds' wallpaper. Even though inside the wallpaper of our own minds is where 100% of us currently live /all the time/, we keep trying to open the windows and stick our heads out to yell at other people.

Which is what makes this story so /ironic/ as fanfic of /Friendship is Magic/: strapping yourself into a "reality" which consists solely of things tailored to you, with no /genuine/ independence or interdependence of their own, means /there isn't actually anyone else around in your little world to be friends with/.
