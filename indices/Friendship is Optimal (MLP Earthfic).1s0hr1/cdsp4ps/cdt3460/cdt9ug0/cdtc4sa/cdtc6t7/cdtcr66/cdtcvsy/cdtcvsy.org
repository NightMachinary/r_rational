  Ok, objection corrected: most of us do value the basic Otherness of others. We don't want to live in extrapolations of our own minds' wallpaper. Even though inside the wallpaper of our own minds is where 100% of us currently live all the time, we keep trying to open the windows and stick our heads out to yell at other people.

  Which is what makes this story so ironic as fanfic of Friendship is Magic: strapping yourself into a "reality" which consists solely of things tailored to you, with no genuine independence or interdependence of their own, means there isn't actually anyone else around in your little world to be friends with.

Well, those other ponies living in Equestria that were created by CelestAI /are/ other people, independent and thinking and just as human as anyone else. They're as complete and complex as any human, and as Other as any human. They just happen to be the exact kind of Other that would maximise your personal utility. That does occasionally mean you'll find your "real life" friends there, just like one of the main characters did whenever he felt like talking. I don't really see the objection here, the other ponies /aren't/ fake people, even if they were created with the sole purpose of maximising your utility. And you /do/ find other ex-humans in the world, there are shards that are composed almost entirely of ex-humans. Having a reality tailored to you means you get to know the people who would maximise your utility, even if those people didn't exist before, and even if they happen to be archnemeses you need to defeat.

So... I don't really get what you mean by "there isn't actually anyone else around".
