Thanks! Yeah, I was wondering if the hints might have been too subtle. I seem to run into that problem a lot, where I think I'm being more explicit than I really am. I recently had a few people alpha-read a prologue to a story I'm doing, and they couldn't figure out what the viewpoint character was doing when they were utilizing their superpower.
