The response interface is atrocious. If you would like to read the story in the way I want to tell it, you can find it here: [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3acomx/a_man_and_his_dog/][A Man and His Dog]]

The entire story is roughly 5000 words. I will keep part 1/3 here and go back and repair the terrible things that the Reddit formatter did to it. The link above will be marked with parts 1/2/and 3 so you can quickly find your way to part 2 to continue reading.
