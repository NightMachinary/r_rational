the quote about the xenopsychologist is of course from "Three World's Collide" by Eliezer Yudkowsky. I'm hoping to continue this, but I'm not entirely sure where I want to go with it, it's really more of an exploration of what would happen if I was transported to a medieval fantasy world. I figured that if I can successfully continue writing it, that it will end up too long for the contest, but otherwise the first chapter at least would probably work well as a writing prompt.
