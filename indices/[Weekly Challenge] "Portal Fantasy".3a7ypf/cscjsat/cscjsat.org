“He has returned! The prince has returned.”

It was loud. Who were these people and what were they talking about?

I opened my eyes blearily, and sleepily noticed that it didn't look like I was in my bed at home.

“Where am I?”

“You are in the King, your father's palace. We summoned you here.”

“WHAT!?” I sat up, the sleep now gone from my eyes and from my mind.

“You remember!?”

“No!” I almost shouted. I tried to calm down my heaving, panicked breaths.

Somehow, maybe because this experience was so unexpected and out of place as to be surreal, I managed to look away from my overwhelming panic and confusion to think clearly.

/I know I'm not dreaming. Am I hallucinating? If someone force-fed me a hallucinogenic drug of some kind, it should wear off eventually, I think...I don't see how I could develop a full-blown case of schizophrenia or something overnight. Last I checked, I was sleeping at home in my apartment building. I remembered to lock the door the night before, there have been no significant changes to my psychiatric meds, and I did remember to take them yesterday. Could this be...real? Maybe I'm in the Matrix or something....now I just need to figure out where I am and how to get home./

I opened my mouth to speak, then closed it, and thought for a moment. For some reason, maybe because all of the people in the circle around where I was sitting were wearing flowing wizard's robes and pointy hats, I felt like I had been transported to a medieval fantasy world. No, that was silly. Real life didn't work like that. Besides, what were the odds that I would be transported specifically to a universe whose laws of nature produced a world that actually fit that particular literary genre from my own world?

/Nice try, intuition. You're unusually pessimistic today./ The intuition was still there though.

/Just in case.../

“What do you mean by summoned? You said that you summoned me here?”

One of the more elderly men in the circle stepped forward.

“Yes. We summoned you here, using your unique spiritual signature as a focus for the spell.”

/What? But.../

“You must have made a mistake,” I said. “No wait, you probably made a mistake, it's not absolutely certain...”

“We are experienced magical practitioners, and the summoning spell was invented long ago, and has been perfected over the centuries. We are not mistaken.”

I was still understandably quite skeptical.

“Assuming that I've been somehow transported to a world of the nature that I think I've been transported to, what is the normal range of the summoning spell?” I asked.

One of the wizards scoffed, but the elderly wizard who had stepped forward shushed him with a silencing gesture.

“That should hardly matter. The summoning spell is the same regardless of the range, except that longer distances increase the magical power required to cast the spell, as do higher quantities of magic in the spell's focus.”

“And how much magical power did it take to summon me?”

“The equivalent of transporting something halfway around the world. We were lucky it was not more. We were not entirely sure exactly where you were, you see. It could have drained us of much more of our magic than it did.”

“Hmmm,” I murmured under my breath. Then a thought occurred to me. “What about the direction?”

“Direction?”

“What is the normal range of directions for the spell?”

“By direction, I'm assuming you mean things like left, right, up, down, or north, south, east or west?”

I nodded.

“We were not certain where you were, so we did not specify the direction.”

“Ah. That might be the problem. Although I'm not, as you put it an experienced magical practicioner, nor am I an experienced scien-I mean, knowledge-seeker of my own world, so I could be completely wrong. Still, I don't see what other explanations would make sense, unless my entire life and all of my memories are a lie.”

The elderly wizard's eye was twitching now.

“I suppose we can, with the king's consent, analyze your mind for such anomalies, and rectify them.”

/Uh oh. That's not good. Maybe I should stop talking while I'm ahead, before I dig myself into an even deeper hole...or grave./

“Um...I'm not sure you're understanding my situation,” I said. “Even if they never actually happened, if you get rid of my memories, you get rid of me. Besides, my memories from my home world are a bit too detailed and complex to have been fabricated without a LOT of time and an intelligence vast enough to imagine all of it and feed it into my mind without my even noticing. And I am a smart person. It's rather unlikely that I would not have noticed if someone was mucking about with my mind on that deep a level. And if that person was from your world, this world, then somehow I doubt that they could imagine the kind of world that I come from that easily. Though I might be misjudging the imagination of your world's writers and philosophers, but judging by what little I've seen so far, I would estimate less than 50% probability to that...no offense.”

/Maybe they should just kill me now, and get it over with./

The magicians were starting to look unsettled, some even frightened.

“That is impossible. We specified your unique spiritual signature as the focus of the spell. You were born in this world to the old king, and after he died, you were adopted by his younger brother.”

I shook my head.

I almost said something insulting, but I thought better of it. A different idea came into my mind. I opened my mouth and said,

“In the words of a great philosopher from my own world: 'She was only an apprentice xenopsychologist, no matter that there were no masters anywhere. If she was the foremost xenopsychologist of humankind, then she was also the least, the most foolish. And the most ignorant.'” I paused for a moment.

“It seems to me that you don't know anything about other worlds, or at least, not about /my/ world. The laws of nature---or of magic---that apply in your world, might not in others. While I could be completely wrong, I suspect that what happened is that you specified a unique spiritual signature, but you didn't specify that that signature had to be a spiritual one as you know it. I suspect that what your world knows as a spirit, something that is incorporeal, in my world is a physical organ in the skull. The only reason I have any inkling of what a spirit might be to your world is because the people of my world long believed ourselves to be at least kind of somewhat incorporeal before we actually gained the tools to look inside each other and ourselves and see what we actually looked like. And even then, some myths are hard to dispel. Most of us didn't really think about or even consider the question. I suspect that because you didn't specify that you were looking for a /spiritual/ signature, that the spell could have focused on any number of similar things. I also suspect that I'm among many people who could have been summoned by your spell, and it was only pure chance that caused the spell to summon me.”

The faces of the wizards were gaping at me now, varying mixtures of shock, horror and befuddlement.

The elderly wizard who seemed to be in charge was speechless for a moment. He opened his mouth, then closed it. Then he opened his mouth again and said, “I'm not sure I understood all that, but we will get to the bottom of this.” He turned to his colleagues. “While I still don't quite see how we could have summoned the wrong person, we should check just in case. We should bring him to the court physician. Maybe he will be able to analyze this man's spiritual signature more closely and spot any minute differences, however unlikely, we might have missed. And he can also take a look at this man's mind, while we're at it.

“But!” I started.

“I only said he's going to have a look. Whether your mind is under some sort of enchantment or curse that needs to be removed, that will be for the court physician to determine.”

I sighed. Well, things were looking a bit more hopeful, I supposed. As long as their court physician didn't do anything that caused permanent brain damage.

Well, I doubted I could escape now, and if I did, I would have nowhere to go.

Crap.
