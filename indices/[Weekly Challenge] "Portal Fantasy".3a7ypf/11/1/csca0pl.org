I really enjoyed reading this. However, it doesn't seem to be related to the prompt all that closely. Even quoting the OP--

#+begin_quote
  Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.
#+end_quote

--does not alleviate this feeling. Portal Fantasy doesn't /need/ to included an actual portal, but then it must at least encompass that feeling of having stepped into a different place. This is a wonderful exploration of the potential realities of time-travel, but it is 100% focused on time-travel within our world.
