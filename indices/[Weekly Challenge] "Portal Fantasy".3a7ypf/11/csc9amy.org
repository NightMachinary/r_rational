In the end, it's all a matter of perspective.

When time travel was discovered, the world was alight with the endless possibilities. We could stop Hitler - we could meet Jesus. We could unite the nations and save the planet. We could answer so many questions!

And then the fear came. What if the English prevented the American Revolution? What if Christians stamped out Islam? What if some unlucky chap unintentionally erased Dr. Sugimoto from existence -- rendering time travel once again impossible, to find him-or-herself trapped forever within the paleolithic era?

Couldn't virtually any modern fighting force establish complete world dominance in the blink of an eye -- using their magical metal serpents of obnoxiously loud death to frighten the sword-swinging populace of the past into a state of catatonia? It couldn't be long before someone thought of such a thing -- and immediately seized the opportunity.

Suddenly, there would be modern war erupting in medieval times -- and sooner. Cave men would suddenly find their world embroiled in a tumultuous battle for their primitive hearts and minds. Sorry, neanderthals! One of these fighting forces will rule you with an iron fist -- what is left of you at least.

Naturally there were protests -- what would one expect? The media convinced us -- in a matter of days - that these issues were worth our lives. We fought, and we burned, and we looted. If technology is weeks away from unmaking existence, I should have those things I've always wanted. I should do those things I've always wanted to do.

I should be really fucking drunk and violent.

Sugimoto was killed by a full-on torch-and-pitchfork mob. DomoCorp was ill prepared for the reality of the situation -- they could afford the very best mercenaries, normally, but even the in-house security team would end up siding with the populace. The research was thought lost within the fiery wreckage of what used to be a 59-story research and development building.

Of course, such a discovery could never be lost. In fact -- as the US research team theorized -- from the moment it was used, it would suddenly have always existed. Simultaneously, throughout all periods of time -- the public knowledge of the discovery and successful application of time travel would become common knowledge. There are simultaneous visitors, daily, from all points in the future, coming to see the birth of some minor poet or scribe or the wheat farmer that spawned his-or-her entire bloodline.

The tests were never announced, but the results were paraded loudly. Mucking with the past -- even in the most extreme of ways that the US research team was willing to risk in secret -- has no effect on the present. Our continuity, and our past -- as documented -- remains. Textbooks do not change, memories do not suddenly become modified to reflect some hulking giant of a change inflicted by a minor act of time-traveling carelessness.

The people celebrated, and statues were erected to honor Dr. Sugimoto in eleven cities.

Everyone felt rather silly about all the chaos. DomoCorp would become the site of many a candlelight vigil, and would eventually become a monument of hallowed ground -- a permanent reminder of our lack of progress in the field of combating mob mentality.

But the US research team did not really elaborate on the subject. The wave of relief had cast aside such questions for a time, but eventually the people would demand the full details. What they responded with, and the full extent of their discoveries, were two very different things.

When traveling forward from the past -- even a single week -- the world would forget. Nothing you did in the past would really affect its continuity at all. You were never able to see the results of your actions. The research team presented the theory that each instance of time travel places the traveler in a parallel universe that is only temporary -- ceasing to exist the moment an outside observer (from the future) is no longer present to behold.

Someone at the press release wanted to know about “leaving an observer behind” and seeing if you could hold the team's place in the time line for even a day. The representative responded with a vague answer about ethics and “no man left behind”.

The truth was, the US research team had tried this immediately. The volunteer, a man by the name of J.C. Jones, was lost. Less than a day into the future from their peaceful medieval entry point, there was no trace of his existence -- though he was missed in the present by his family, who received a large settlement and an official explanation of an unforeseen animal attack.

The PR representative was pressed about the future, and shared his prepared response with the exact air of authority and finality in which he had been coached to perfection.

“You cannot travel beyond today. Today is today, no matter what.”

But this wasn't exactly true. The reality was that the research team wasn't sure what to say about travel into the future, because it wasn't very constant and it was quite confusing. They began their research at one week into the future.

By all hypotheses, the future seemed to be affected by the thoughts and emotions of the research team as they traveled. The team quickly discovered that they still existed in this future point in time -- separately, going about their business as if they had never time traveled. The team was afraid of being too close, or even being seen by their future counterpart, and so they would carry out most of their observations in secret.

Each of the researchers was somewhat unsettled by the state of his future counterpart. Some were doing well, some were not -- but each researcher secretly identified with the resulting data. This is a week into the future that I have been manifesting for myself.

The researchers traveled back to the present day and repeated the experiment five times. At this point, the team has become very closely knit. They have been forced to share their flaws with the entire team -- and at only one week into the future, they are having past, present, and future flaws exposed, and it has forged a certain awkward endearment to one another.

Each repetition of the experiment produced drastically different results. By the fifth time, each of the researchers was somehow manifesting a future -- only one week away -- in which all of their dreams were coming true.

I do not know why the US team decided not to share any of this -- I find it vaguely beautiful.

Even more powerful was the second round of experiments into the past -- this time the very recent past. They wanted to observe their lives in secret again and see if perhaps they could influence the near future through subtle means, or even simply experiments of thought. What they experienced was baffling - and is perhaps better left to philosophers to decipher.

The past was affected in a way similar to the future -- by the expectations of the researchers, but mostly grounded in the reality of the past. It was never the same image in upwards of ten trials. It was fluid, and dream-like. Scenery would subtly change as the researchers began to doubt if the images of the surroundings were exactly as they had remembered. One researcher believed that his past counterpart was about to throw a glass of bourbon at his wife -- he warned the team, expressing his regret. The counterpart set the glass down, and embraced his wife, vowing to get help for his alcoholism.

The team was stunned.

I believe that our world is what it is. We cannot change the present by changing the past -- the present is what it is. The future is more malleable -- we shape it day-by-day, reaching or falling short of our goals and punishing or rewarding ourselves accordingly.

The past, however, is also what it is, and nothing more or less. But what we see in the future and how we feel about the present changes the way we observe our own history. When you see the possibilities, each and every failing can be seen as being one step at a time in the right direction.

It's all a matter of perspective.
