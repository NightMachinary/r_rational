I don't think elaboration is a problem.

That's interesting. So the ending may not be as tragic as it seems to be at first. An expanded version of this, with just enough information that the reader can figure out what the protagonist can't (that ze is being horribly manipulated by this AI masquerading as God), would be something that I think you could place at Strange Horizons or Clarkesworld.
