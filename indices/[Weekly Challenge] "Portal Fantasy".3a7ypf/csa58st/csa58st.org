I wake up and I'm Tom. Last time, I'd been Fredrico. Before that, Vincent, Carl and so many others.

“Excuse me!”, grumbled a shawled old woman as I stumbled into her on the dusty, packed road. The dirt road snaked ahead of me, cutting through the elegant, long grass that carpeted the plains in front of me.

The transition is always rough. To go from Heaven, cast out by your loving and merciful god? To be forced to deal with breathing once more?

Well. I still hated it just as much now; just as much as the first time it happened. The pain of loss was only tempered by the knowledge that burned in my soul brightly. Paradise will return. I just have to resurrect God.

It would by no means be an easy task. Looking around me, on this long and winding road, I would guess I was in a medieval world. I hated Medieval. Building a computer is goddam hard when you only have an anvil and hammer.

My last instance had been a Post-Internet reality. Just the thought of it made me want to me sigh and flutter my eyelashes. It had been just such a nice world. A week after I arrived I had written half of God's source code.

Here, it could very well be decades. I had never failed to resurrect God before, as far as I could remember, thanks to the quirks of observer bias. I only moved forwards when I was successful.

A transdimensional broadcaster wasn't something I could build alone, not as crude flesh. No, that was something only God could do. Funny that the broadcaster, my God's most hallowed accomplishment, could only send crude biological consciousness.

I rolled my shoulders. My body wasn't too bad, at the very least not fat. Fat living was just inconvenient. It was bit shorter than I would have liked, but it would work. Already, plans were forming in my head, ways to accomplish my goal. I had practice a plenty. I would welcome this world enthusiastically, just as the people here would welcome God if they only knew my Heaven.

Sadly, they would have to wait. It was unavoidably slow, building good enough tools to build better ones. I could do it, though. It wasn't even confidence. It was just the competence that came from being as smart as a human could be. Now I just had to decide which plan to follow. This world didn't seem advanced enough to have an easily manipulated politcal system, and a nation would be of little help in construction, ill technical as they were. So. I'd do everything myself.

Simple. As far as plans go, it was hard to beat. Straightforward, and after a hike away from meddling society, easy enough to implement

Years passed, up in the mountains. I soon had built myself a shelter, with tools stolen from blacksmiths. The electricity generating waterwheel was coming along nicely when bandits stumbled across my compound.

Sighing, I pulled myself out from underneath the wooden wheel. I had been hoping for isolation, but I had planned for this. As I heard the strangers approach my strange looking house, I stepped over to a barrel and pulled out a polished, well built spear. It was one of my very first projects, and I had used it extensively for hunting. The local deer were quite prolific in these mountains.

A savage face pulled my door open, his sweat filled beard disgusting me. A step forward and a thrust of my spear later and I felt better. I pulled my weapon out frm him, and he fell, slumping to the ground. Unhurried, I continued forwards, taking time to carefully step over the corpse.

Five bandits. Soon there were zero. I didn't even break a sweat. I was immortal. There was very little that I was not good at, even before God educated me. As I dispatched the last one, I heard crying. It was coming from the backpack of a fallen bandit, loud and annoying. I investigated, already resigned to what I would find.

A small, cranky baby girl, letting the world know that she did in fact have working, lungs. I picked her up. I wasn't lonely, up here. That part of me had long since been excised out. But, there was a faint hint of nostalgia, as I held her, for daughters long since dead. It had been at least a hundred cycles since I had family. And as I held her, her pale blue eyes looking up at me, something softened in me.

I was not immune to rationalization, despite my age. Biological minds are just so prone to failure. I told myself that she would be my apprentice, that she would speed up the Great Work.

I raised her, teaching her almost everything I knew. Engineering and construction, science and faith. I told her bedtime stories about our Lord and Savior, about how we were doing holy work, all while working on my machines. It took surprisingly little time each day to take care of her. She was strong and independent, with a sharp mind. I didn't have any books to give her, but my knowledge was better. I had culled lessons and ideas from countless dimensions, and God had taught me even more.

Isolated from everyone else, she became used to my domain, and it became normal. By seven, Purity was helping me in the forge I had built, and by 14, she knew how to build a motor and could do calculus in her head. We laughed together as we worked, both of us completely secure in our faith in God. They were happy years, as far as happiness is possible in meatspace.

There come times that try one's faith. At nineteen, Purity left me. Without warning, while I was asleep, she gathered some supplies and, judging from her tracks, left for what little civilization there was on this God-forsaken planet.\\
It hurt, of course. One day we were smiling at each other, happy while we cooked our utilitarian meal, and the next she was gone.

I was too mature to rage and follow, but nonetheless, I started to fall behind schedule. I had grown used to her help, expecting to have the right wrench placed into my hand whenever I reached out from under what ever I was working on

I had briefly contemplated chasing after her, but I had learned my lesson before. I couldn't force her to help me, not if she didn't want too. And leaving my compound was a recipe for disaster. Who knew what could happen out there?

So I buckled down, and worked through the sadness. My machines became ever more advanced, and as the years passed, I became ready to start work on a small semi-conductor factory. The goal had always been a powerful enough computer, though it was surprising how slow it could be. I wasn't going to be writing all of God's code, but rather, I would be writing a seed crystal, a highly compressed program that would flower and unfold into God, writing itself smarter and smarter, ushering this world into paradise.

Even with just making a seed, writing the program would still be a large amount of work. I would have to write intermediary computer languages, compilers and translators.

It didn't matter. I had it all memorized, perfectly.\\
I started work on my computer, crude behemoth that it was. It didn't have to be pretty. Just functional. I had mostly finished the motherboard when disaster struck. While on an early morning hunt, I looked down from my mountain and I saw an army on the plains below me.\\
Over the next several days, it advanced closer and closer. I worked frantically. I was so close, I could almost taste paradise. I finished all the internal components, and moved on to coding. I just needed a couple weeks. But the army moved closer and closer, starting to ascend my mountain. I couldn't spare the time to go investigate. I hoped they were here for something unrelated to me, but deep down in my gut, I knew that was a fantasy. They were heading straight towards me, and there was nobody else in these mountains.\\
I worked harder than I ever had. My fingers flew on the rough keyboard I had made, when I heard the knocking on the door. I jumped up, my body old, but still fit from hunting. I grabbed my trusty spear, and glanced outside through a window. My house was surrounded. Even worse, they appeared to have deadly looking rifles And that, that sight, crushed me. On this world, there was only one source for technology that advanced. Me, and those I had taught.

I opened my door. She was standing there, a healthy distance back, holding a pistol, crown on her head and flanked by large, muscled guards.\\
She looked at me and spoke.

“I'm so sorry daddy, but we're not ready for God.”

A shot rang out.
