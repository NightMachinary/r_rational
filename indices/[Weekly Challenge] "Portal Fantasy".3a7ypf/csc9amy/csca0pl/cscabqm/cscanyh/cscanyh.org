Ahhh. Knowing that it wasn't written with the prompt in mind makes sense. It really was a great story.

  Is allegory a no-no in rational fiction?

In general? Not any more so than anywhere else. As a response to a specific prompt? Well, this being the first such contest on this sub, I don't think we've yet to establish the boundaries of where a story exits the realm of residing within the spirit of the prompt. This may very well be something that is allowed. My interpretation tells me otherwise, but in the end it's the votes that count, right? I'm sure after we've gone through one or two more of these we'll have a better idea of such limits. For now--well, again, this was excellently written.

Enjoy your introduction to rational fiction! I'd suggest sorting by 'Top' and making your way through the posts there. We were just talking about creating an introductory package for new readers/writers--would have come in handy here. Welcome!
