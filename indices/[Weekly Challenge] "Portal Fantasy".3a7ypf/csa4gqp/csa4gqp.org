The portals were an extinction threat.

According to the laws of physics, wormholes could connect two different spatial locations. But /stable/ wormholes were so difficult to be virtually impossible. But what may apply to one set of laws, may not always apply to another...

When *They* opened up several portals into our world, there was massive damage to our world. I want you to forget the idea that portal transport is anything like walking through a shining hole they talk about in these stupid adventure books.

Even though the portals lead from one area of our world to another area on *Their* world, instead of in the safety of outer space, there are still issues such as pressure differentials.

*They* deliberately choose to connect high pressure areas on *Their* world to low pressure areas on ours. To understand the implications of this, I want you all to imagine a portal connecting the bottom of an ocean to miles above a city, or a valley thousands of miles below sea level connecting to the top of a mountain. The extreme pressure differential caused tsunamis, hurricanes, and other natural disasters.

Multiple animals and major crop species went extinct and the world-wide human population dropped by over 35%. As the global economy collapsed, weaker nations with *Them* invading quickly surrendered to other nations. After all, we were not *Them*. There was a crude governmental body established by the strongest nations to coordinate a counter response. With an outside enemy, humanity banded together.

We responded by sending self-sufficient mobile military units through the portals. They managed to bring back samples of *Their* technology.

As far as we can tell, the fact that *They* have the ability to create the portals and the lack of any other technology significantly different from ours implies that *Their* laws of physics are similar to ours with several important exceptions. The few occasions where we managed to observe some of *Their* non-portal technology seems to indicate that *They* mainly developed technology to take advantage of extreme pressures. *Their* world must have numerous areas with extremely high pressures.

*They* have naturally forming portals.

Since *They* can create and remove portals, we focused on gaining access to *Their* technology. It took several decades, but once we learned how *Their* technology worked, we opened a portal between *Their* world and *Their* star.

*They* made the mistake of assuming that we would want the same thing as *Them*. *Their* society was based around concentrating large amounts of resources into [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1u4de0/the_tippyverse_a_dd_35_campaign_setting_where_the/][areas around the portals]].

*They* thought we would be like *Them* with naturally forming portals and a need to concentrate more resources into isolated points. How foolish of *Them*.

We all know that to prosper, one must spread as far as possible to ensure some of us will survive no matter the threats we may face.

Thank you class. That will be all and I expect you to complete the next two chapters dealing with intergalactic portal travel and how to exploit differences between the two systems of physics for free energy by next class.
