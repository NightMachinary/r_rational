YOU ARE IN A ROOM.

|>__

|> I wasn't sure how I knew that, though. I had no body, no form. The last sensation I'd had was the portal, pulling me in, slowly, inexorably. It was much more likely that I'd hallucinated that, and now was in some sort of coma. How could I know I was in a room without being able to look at the room itself?__

ROOM

THE ROOM IS SPARSELY DECORATED, WITH A TABLE, TWO CHAIRS, AND A SMALL CHEAP RUG. THE TABLE HAS SEVERAL OBJECTS ON IT. THERE IS A DOOR TO THE NORTH.

|>__

|> It was the most bizarre experience. Something was speaking to me. Or, no, not speaking. I wasn't hearing anything. It was more like, something was inside my head, thinking with me. Or at me. Either way, I certainly didn't know anything about any room, but something did, and it was interested in sharing. Tell me about the room.__

ROOM

YOU TELL YOURSELF: “THE ROOM IS SPARSELY DECORATED, WITH A TABLE, TWO CHAIRS, AND A SMALL CHEAP RUG. THE TABLE HAS SEVERAL OBJECTS ON IT. THERE IS A DOOR TO THE NORTH.”

|>__

|> Alright, already. I understood that part. The room is sparsely decorated. Fine. Ugh. I need to sit down.__

CHAIR

YOU ARE SEATED IN ONE OF THE TWO CHAIRS. IN FRONT OF YOU IS THE TABLE. ON THE TABLE IS A BACKPACK, A KNIFE, AND A BOX OF MATCHES.

|>__

|> Okay. Fine. So I'm sitting down. Somehow. And there's some cool stuff here, too. But what do I do with it? I have no hands. I can't just take the stuff.__

CHAIR

YOU TAKE ALL THE OBJECTS. YOU ARE SEATED IN ONE OF THE TWO CHAIRS. IN FRONT OF YOU IS THE TABLE. THERE IS NOTHING ON THE TABLE.

|>__

|> Okay, apparently I can. ...Is it really that easy? Let's see... Stand up.__

ROOM

YOU ARE IN A ROOM, WHICH IS SPARSELY DECORATED, WITH A TABLE, TWO CHAIRS, AND A SMALL CHEAP RUG. THERE IS A DOOR TO THE NORTH.

|>__

|> Righteous. Alright, let's get going.__

I'M SORRY, YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT.

|>__

|> Ooookay, then. Go North?__

ROOM

YOU TRY TO GO NORTH, BUT YOU CAN'T USE THE DOOR. YOUR HANDS ARE FULL.

|>__

|> That didn't help.__
