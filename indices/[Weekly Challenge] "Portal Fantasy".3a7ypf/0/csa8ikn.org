It should have been the greatest sight I had ever beheld. The gems that decorated the emperor's footrest were worth more than enough to sustain me and my loved one for a lifetime. I had met fewer people in all my life than there were mannacrafters sustaining the palace. And yet, if one lays collapsed in the desert awaiting death, a bar of gold becomes dead weight and a drop of water becomes a miracle.

I continued telling the story that brought me here "I gazed into the beam of pure silver light. In an instant the light enveloped me, overcoming all my senses. A wave of supernatural terror passed over me, its strength only matched by the day I saw the light vanish from my love's eyes. And then I felt a hand on my shoulder and a voice spoke: 'Holy shit, you are, like, the best cosplayer ever!'"

Kelonthia was in a state of panicked desperation. It was a year ago today that dread manna had struck her love down. She recalled watching him violently seizing on the ground, the black glow of the manna oozing through his skin and coursing through his veins. She had stood there paralysed with helplessness. She watched as it coalesced in his chest. In time it faded, leaving only the slow rhythmic rise and fall of his breath. She looked into his eyes and saw Vacancy.

And now, a year later, her love's body broke its slumber for the first time since that day. She looked in horror at his skin flaking and turning dark purple, his eyes bleeding, his hair turning iridescent and falling off in chunks, at the black glow shining from his chest, and at his body shaking in unnatural convulsions. Her beloved was likely to survive this first attack, but as time wore on the atrophy that came from motionlessness would sent in. It was nearly inevitable there would come a time when the yearly attack was not survivable.

In her village there were some fellow elves she knew of that did not have a loved one with Vacancy. The only common factor among these elves was that their loved ones weren't elvish.

It would take hours for him to return to the relative tranquillity of his paralysed state. She couldn't handle it any more. She ran. She ran far.

Eventually exhaustion, bleeding feet, and dehydration conspired to collapse her to the ground. She awoke finding herself in Forestria village. She had only been here once before and it was the farthest she'd ever been from home.

The villagers gave her what little food they had and let her rest. After the week it took to fully recover, the villagers, out of their sympathy, let her talk with the wisest elder they knew, Ronethy.

The elder was sitting on the floor of her hut when Kelonthia spoke “Wise elder, my desire is as simple as it is resolute: I must cure my beloved and rid the Vacancy that plagues him.”

“Listen well. The manna flows through the world and the bodies of us all. Without it there would be no life for death to strike down. Using our natural gifts for manipulating the manna has generated more prosperity than all our tinkering of the other substances combined. And yet we know nothing of it. To cure your beloved of Vacancy is to know the ways of manna. To know how it truly functions. Elder after elder has thought about the manna, some devoting their entire lives in deep thought on this very subject. And yet, still we think, and still our use of the manna extends only to the reach of our natural gifts. I, for one, have realized there are some things that are simply mysteries for us to never know. Please, for your own sake, do not live in painful false hope, you must find a way to accept that reality is out of your control. That Vacancy is one part of that uncontrollable reality.”

A moment of pause.

“No.”

She walked back into the forest. An hour later she was lost. A day later she saw a silver light.

--------------

“I looked to the source of the voice. It was that of that race of creature I described for you. A human. I looked around in bewilderment. I saw no sources of manna anywhere and yet I witnessed accomplishments greater than the Mannacrafters of the Veil. I saw buildings taller than giants, a box that emanated unnaturally loud speech, and large objects that moved faster than the Emperor's greatest horse drugged with the purest Vitaela.

My mind was whirling as I turned to the one who spoke to me. He was alarmed at my behaviour and I mumbled 'W-What... what is this place?'

His face turned from alarm to amusement. He replied 'Oooh lol, good RPing mate. You need to meet Steve, he's totally into this shit, guy has ass burgers like nobody's business.'

'I don't have Asperger's Syndrome and that's super fucking offensive, asshole.'

'You spend, like, 50 hours a week LARPing, if that isn't a mental disease, it should be!'

Steve turned to me. Across his brow was a band that appeared silver, yet was not metallic. Attached to the band was a tiny pane of glass with flashing unnatural colours that did not reflect the environment.

'Just ignore Derek, good sir! My name is Steve of House Rodriguez. How may I address you, m'lady?'

I could barely keep my composure but I managed to reply 'I am Kelonthia Fishmonger. Please, tell me what is this place?'

'Its a weeaboo street festival Steve dragged me to.'

'Just fuck off!'

Derek summarily fucked off leaving the two of us alone.”

At that breach of decorum the emperor interrupted “This is simply farcical. Even the tiniest of details make little sense, for you speak as though you remember their words verbatim, yet you say it occurred in a state of shock a year ago. This is a fanciful tale if ever I heard one, but a commoner wasting my time is severely punishable.”

In response I simply pulled out one of many souvenirs from my travel. I replayed the sound from Steve's recording of the day.

“Its The Box That Emanates Sound!” someone shouted, gasps filling Royal Hall.

“Its /a/ box that emanates sound.”

It was two months since Kelonthia had entered through the portal. Steve had made a hobby out of training Kelonthia in the ways of the human world. Though there were definitely quite a few times when Kelonthia had done things Steve judged to be a little unrealistic, he was glad that she had not broken character even once.

That was the day she asked how a computer works.

“Ok that's suuuuper complicated, and I'm not even really sure. But I guess, at the end of the day, its basically just manipulating the flow electrons.”

“Like how the people of my world manipulate the flow of manna?”

“Kinda I guess. Except we don't have much natural talent for manipulating the flow of electrons, in fact we didn't even know they existed for most of our history!”

“How? How could you have such little natural talent for manipulating your world, and yet create all these machines?”

“Well, I guess its just cause we have such a good understanding how things work in a fundamental way that makes it so much easier to manipulate the world. Its like we understand the Way of the Electron, haha!”

Kelonthia paused.

In a moment she gasped in sudden realization and her mind fought with her mouth in an attempt to spew a thousand words in the space of that tiny moment. “How do you know the way of the electron!?” “Our greatest minds have thought about the way of manna for thousands of years!” “I need to know more than I need to breathe!” “Your civilizations are so young, its not possible to have that kind of knowledge!” “Is the mystery solvable!?” “Can I save my love!? Can I save my love!? Can I save my love!?”

After the storm of questions subsided, Steve thought for a moment. “You said the people of your world have thought deeply about manna. What experiments have they done?”

“Experiments?”

Steve smiled.

--------------

It was the first year anniversary of her journey through the portal. Steve's obsession with his hobby was still strong but she could tell it was declining. This was particularly true after she had asked to keep a backpack filled with expensive and questionably legal technology near her at all times should she be sent back by the portal. Though many of the wonders of this new world filled her with awe and amazement, as the days went on and the miracles became mundane, the thoughts of the Vacancy destroying the bher loved one hammered on her heart. Typically, she was successful in burying these emotions by devoting herself whole heartedly to the study and practice of the methods of science and rationality. But this anniversary reminded her of Vacancy's inevitable yearly attacks. In that moment she wanted nothing more than for the portal to take her back. It did.

A flash zapped an elf in the path of the emperor's procession. The Guard descended on this potential threat to the empire with swift and brutal professionalism. It was a minor miracle, then, that her audience with the emperor a day later included such luxurious amenities as her head still being attached to her body.

--------------

“And that's the entirety of the story?” the emperor asked me.

I was omitting a lot of important details, but I continued

“I have omitted only one important detail.” I drew my final souvenir from the backpack. I pointed it to the ceiling and squeezed.

I spoke over the ringing in everyone's ear “This is a gun. If anyone attacks me I will use it to kill them. I have one request: leave me completely alone and in exchange I won't eliminate your armies.”

A half year's journey and I was finally resting by my beloved.

I did not rest long though, I had experiments to run.
