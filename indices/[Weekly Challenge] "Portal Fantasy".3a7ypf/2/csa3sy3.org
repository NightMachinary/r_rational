*Chapter 1*  

      /Everyone sees what you appear to be, few experience what you really are./

 

    Abbigail crept down the narrow stone stairway. Night was a time to be on guard against enemies, and sneaking about the castle aligned her to that unfortunate camp. The library and laboratory was amongst the lowest levels, but scholars enjoyed access to the subterranean levels without the intermediate passage through the castle main entrance. Abbigail hoped that /the/ scholar was in tonight, or her effort might be for nought. Sliding along empty corridors, Abbigail's dark hair and white shift gave her the appearance of ghoul prowling the hallways, her ghastly appearance was mirrored by her dark thoughts; Arthur was away, at another campaign, and Gwen...she didn't think about her mother. Those thoughts were dangerous. Carefully opening the wooden doors that lead into the library stacks, she peeked into the darkness. There was an otherworldly faint blue light much further back, emitting from the direction of the laboratory, towards the library rear. Closing the outer library door, she entered and walked slowly, through the forward, listening.

      No sounds reached her ears. Abbigail was nearly at the door to the laboratory when she stepped on something - someone. A body. Stunned, she stood still, uncomprehending. The library was as silent, the tomes around her seemed to absorb sound as well as knowledge. Abbigail knelt down and looked. She could not make out any distinguishing features, but the body was small. She waited, not moving. Her eyes adjusted to the darkness while she tried to think why of all places, a corpse would left in the library. Deciding it meant nothing good, she unclasped the short dagger she kept; Arthur disapproved, she knew. Abbigail slid her index finger over the edge of the blade, letting a drop of blood streak down the side. A moment later, the blade glowed a faint red, illuminating the room in a weak red light. Not light enough to be noticeable from the other side of the nearby door nor outer hallway, she hoped. Abbigail looked at the the person bound on the ground in the new, grim light of her blade. The bound form was...one of the maids on the cooking staff? The maid still lived too, her earlier judgement had been premature. Abbigail was confused. Carefully, she got the attention of the weeping maid, and gestured her to remain quiet, then removed the maid's gag.

      “Merlin has gone mad” the maid whispered softly. “I was sent to bring a late snack down to the libraries and was attacked by Merlin!”

      “Are you sure? How do you know it...”

      “It was a spell! I saw the magic before I... I...”, and the maid resumed her silent crying.

      Abbigail was only more confused by this information. Looking about the library again in the red gleam of her blade, she saw a plate of spilled food and an empty mug on the ground. She had walked right past it, on her first passage. The evidence in the dull light along with the sheer unlikeliness of the tiny maid being some sinister assassin crossed Abbigail's mind. She decided she could not confront Merlin directly, if the worst was true. Merlin was powerful, and if some power had twisted his mind, she had no hope of resisting. But she might learn exactly what disaster awaited further in order to warn the guards. Turning back to the maid, she cut the remaining bindings, and quietly instructed her to summon the guards. The maid stumbled out of the room.

    Abbigail wiped the blade free of her blood and the red light gleaming from inside the dagger faded. The library was again dark. Abbigail crouched low, and opened the door to the laboratory, hoping the high tables would hide her initial entry. Her hopes seemed to be well founded, the laboratory was well-lit with the peculiar blue glow she had seen from afar previously. Merlin was not immediately visible; she closed the door behind her, silently. Peering about and slowly rising, she spotted Merlin at the far side of the room, along with the source of light in the room, a brilliant blue sphere on the table beside him. Nothing sinister was apparent, no hidden agents seemed to be among the shadows.

      “You can stop crawling about”, Merlin drawled. Abbigail didn't react for a moment, not immediately realizing the meaning of his words, nor its intended audience. She stood.

    Abbigail spoke one word...“Why?”

      “To save the world. Magic is destroying civilization. Every war your father wins, every year of peace won, two more wars begin, two years of death begin anew. Every victory brings us closer to ultimate defeat.” Pounding on the other side of the door, the entrance to the laboratory, could now be heard.

      “You let her go! You alerted the guards!? I did not take you for a fool!” Merlin spat. “Now there is no one to complete the sacrifice.” Merlin paused. “Well, not no one.”

      “Agreed”, Abbigail spoke, as her dagger flew from her hand.

      The dagger bounced uselessly against a blue barrier that appeared inches in front of Merlin, clattering on the ground. “You think I would let an instrument crafted by my hand turn on its maker?” Merlin sneered. Abbigail offered no reply. Merlin picked up the dagger on the floor, running his own finger over the blade. It began to glow blue from his touch on the edge. The ever-present pounding on the door increased in intensity. The guards had found a battering ram, Abbigail noted distantly. She began backing up towards the door.

      “You thought I meant you? My girl, I spoke a binding oath to your father, that while he still lived I would never harm him or his heirs without permission, nor speak an untrue word. I have received no word relaxing the matter in either regard, and he still lives.”

      Abbigail looked on, increasingly confused, searching for a third presence in the room. Her gaze swept not to Merlin, but towards the blue sphere, the strange, beautiful sphere. How had she not noticed its beauty before? The longer she looked the more she felt she understood what the sphere was. Merlin grabbed the blue sphere from the table with one hand, and her gaze followed his hand; with the dagger in the other hand, Merlin cut his own neck. He collapsed immediately, blood pouring all over his robes, sphere falling to the ground.

      Abbigail stared at Merlin, uncomprehending. She noticed absurd details, like that the robes seemed to be impervious to the fluid, the red liquid rolling off the robes as if it had never been there. Her dagger in his still clasped fist, glowing a bright blue. But after a few seconds, the robes suddenly became soaked, the dagger faded to steel, in a final act of betrayal of its master. Above his body, a shimmering blue portal appeared. It showed no view of the other side, if such a location even existed. Abbigail looked at the portal for a moment; the splintering of the door behind her brought her back to the present. The situation looked grim. She was the only witness to Merlin's “suicide”. The guards would never believe he killed himself. Princess or not, she would face a tribunal, and she could not see any outcome excepting banishment or execution. Unacceptable outcomes. Scooping up the blue sphere, she noticed it was warm to the touch; the sphere seemed to repel the blood all around. She also retrieved her dagger from its unopposing wielder. Abbigail cast her gaze around the room one last time. She spotted a book of spells underneath one of the stacks of tomes that Merlin had often consulted, and deciding the knowledge might prove useful, she stole the book as well. It was with a certain irony that she realized that fate had made her a thief and enemy this night, after all. Not caring, Abbigail stepped through the portal.

      The portal was gone. Abbigail looked up, there was no castle ceiling above her any longer, instead she could see the sky. It was still night, but there were no stars in the cloudless sky. Instead of the comforting stellar constellations familiar to her, an eerie, ethereal glow filled the edges of the sky and appeared to come from all directions. Strange mechanical-sounding noises filled the air. Tall straight mountains seemed to fill the sky all around her, much, much higher than her former home. A few trees surrounded her immediate area, and she saw a path leading in two directions. Choosing one at random, she walked a short distance. She stopped again, staring, as she observed the tall mountains more clearly. They were not mountains at all. Massive structures with endless windows. Lights from some of the windows provided the glow around her. Monstrosities, looking something akin to beetles, but only thousands of times larger, sped around on straight paths, all around. She gripped her dagger harder, and an unseen drop of her blood from an earlier cut fell, making it glow red. Massive signs in the sky proclaimed with bizarre words, but many of them shared the same pattern, one she recognized. /York/. /New York./
