Paige rolls to a stop at the cross street a block past the house, and for a few moments there's no sound but the happy sputter of my old Volkswagen's engine.

"Trouble?" I say, rolling down the window. A dry breeze wafts in from the foul, Fresno afternoon, but compared to the smell of baked upholstery it's positively fresh.

Paige reaches up and adjusts the rear-view mirror. "That was the rabbit."

I spin around, checking yards and alleys.

"Can I see?" says a voice from the footwell behind us.

"No," says Paige, eyes not leaving the mirror, "There in the street. The old man."

"/That's/ the rabbit?" He looks ancient but terribly ordinary: Thrift store clothes, maybe a little too tall, with large hands and a shock of wild white hair. "Just out in the open talking to the mailman?"

"Crazy, huh? Everybody in the neighborhood is convinced, but Heather confirmed it."

"I'm still here," says the voice.

"You're not Heather," says Paige.

There's sudden laughter from the mailman, loud enough that we can hear it. I lean to the left until I make eye-contact with Paige in the mirror. "Can we still do this?"

"Probably?" She's gnawing on a thumbnail "If he turns out to be self-aware, we can interrogate him. If not, he'll try to maneuver us into some sort of basement. Heather was certain the gate is underground."

"Still here. Tied up." I turn and peer over the back of the seat at the bound woman on the floor. Sweat has stuck tendrils of long black hair to her forehead and cheeks. She pleads with her eyes. I apologize with mine.

Paige ignores her. "If we're as smart as usual and he's as harmless as he looks, this could be a lot more productive than the stakeout."

"We need a plan," I say, "while he's still outside and less likely to risk anything that would make the neighbors suspicious."

She grimaces. "No time, we improvise. Open the glove-box and get my paperwork. Either we fail and run, he takes the bait, or he doesn't know any better." She checks the diagram atop the gearshift, waggles it into reverse, and heads their way.

When she's not scowling like a war veteran or plotting like a retired spy, it's easy to forget that Paige has lived decades more than either of us. She grins and opens her eyes wide and suddenly she's fifteen again. "Hey, Uncle Archie! I've got my learner's permit and Edie let me drive!"

I pull out the slip of paper from the DMV and display it awkwardly. "Super exciting," I say, scanning the house: Bungalo architecture, wood and plaster, with a detached garage and a long driveway on one side. "We've got your groceries in back. Can we just pull into the carport?"

"Grosser-what?" says the voice behind us. Nobody outside seems to hear.

Archie, stepping closer, doesn't miss a beat. "Nicely done, kid! Sure, Edie. Kitchen's open." He peeks in my window and from this close I can see his big yellow teeth and dark eyes. His breath smells like gingerbread.

Paige wrenches the wheel around and hits the gas, clipping the curb and the corner of the lawn on her way. "Sorry," she shouts and then the teenage glee vanishes as quickly as it appeared. "Right. Of course the kitchen's open. Why would a rabbit ever lock the doors?"

Once she's parked, she pops the hood and heads outside. I get my laptop bag off the back seat and check the road through the rear window. Archie is laughing and waving the mailman goodbye as he heads up the driveway. I step outside, pull the seat forward, and make eye contact with our captive. "Can you walk, or will we have to carry you?"

"I can walk," she says, overly proud. "I'm ana-tomic-ly correct."

Making sure the mailman is gone, I haul her out by the shoulders and help her to her feet.

The rabbit pauses, maybe fifteen feet away, grinning and grandfatherly. "Well I'll be. Some surprises come in threes."

Paige slams the hood shut, wearing her lit mining hat and armed with the air horn and a loop of nylon rope. "Sure Archie," she says, "Curiouser and curiouser." Then she pushes the door open, gives the kitchen a critical glance, and dashes inside.

"Hi not Archie, I'm not Heather. My name is Scamper. What's yours?" Heather is -- far more obviously than either Paige or myself -- a grown woman. To be frank, she's sort of a hottie in a middle-aged librarian way. Half of her years in The Farther West were spent in a coma when she fell out of a tree-house in 1975. Scamper took over for the rest. Scamper will always be four. They've reached an uneasy truce, and now the little creature only puppeteers while Heather is exploring.

"Hatch," says the rabbit, tipping an imaginary hat, "Archibald Wilbur Hatch."

"Hi Hatch. I've been bad so I got tied up. Are you going to be bad?"

He hasn't moved. "I endeavor ever to be decent."

Scamper giggles. "End-ever ever ever ever..."

"Clear!" calls Paige from somewhere indoors.

I hang the laptop bag over Scamper's shoulder. "Take this straight to Paige and I'll give you some pepperoni."

She nods, serious, and marches inside.

That leaves the rabbit for me.

"Where are you from, Mr. Hatch?"

"A little bit of here and there. A man like me gets--"

"Where were you /born/?"

"First generation American, my family came to California during the depression. No work worth--"

"What day is it today?"

"Wednesday, third of June."

"Who is the president?"

He starts walking closer again, casually. "Voting is a rube's game. Can't say I've approved--"

"What do you do for a living?"

"I've been relaxed and retired near on twenty--"

"What /did/ you do for a living?"

"Always said it's a poor fellow who gets defined by his career. I like to think of myself--"

"I'm here about the craigslist ad. Room to rent? I hope I'm not too late."

"Oh no, believe it or not you're the first to--"

"What about Cody Oaks?"

He stops, just beyond the rear bumper. "Is that a name I ought to--"

"Jasper wretched lightbulb ratify salt or easy."

No response, but his attentive smile doesn't waver.

I try again: "Bingo parson flowering gone typewriter thunk."

"Say, you won't believe what--"

"Nice chat we've had, Mr. Hatch."

"Well I'm not about to rent you a room before you've seen it. Come inside, Edie. Bet you're thirsty in this heat."

"Yes, sir. What was the girl with the learner's permit wearing on her head?"

He steps gently past me into the kitchen. "Come on, let's ask her."

I follow him in.

It looks like a safe bet that nobody has ever spilled on that stove or left dirty dishes in that sink. All tile sparkles, all chrome gleams. No sound from the odd bank-safe of a fridge, though, so more like a museum display than a magazine article: Life in the 1930's. I pick a high cabinet at random and open it. Antique cereal boxes.

"Glasses are in the one over the bread box."

"Thank you, Mr. Hatch."

"Call me Archie. You a local or here for college?"

"Call me Edith. I was born in Ridgway, Illinois in 1894. Rainbow swarms of glowing moths led me down a creek one night when I was eight years old. Spent a few weeks in a mystic wood called Polly Hollow. Wandered out of a drainage ditch a century later. Most people hear something a little odd in my accent."

He opens the fridge. The silent, museum fridge. A breeze passes through the room, temperature dropping maybe twenty degrees, and the air turns thick with the smell of orchards in autumn. When he closes it again, summer returns, and he's holding a perfect pitcher of lemonade.

"City college or Cal State?"

Definitely something not to drink.

Scamper appears in the dining room archway, hands untied. She holds one out. “Pepperoni.”

I fish a plastic baggie out of my left skirt pocket and give her two slices. She pops them in her mouth with incandescent joy.

“Where's Paige?”

She points with her whole arm. “Bedroom.”

Archie is filling a fourth glass. I can smell it from here. So can Scamper.

“No lemonade or you'll get sick, like you did in San Diego. Come with me.”

“Aw, okay.”

The dining room is just as pristine as the kitchen, and it's got a radio the size of a washing machine against the far wall. No photos in the hall, and the only open door reveals a surprisingly sparse and unfurnished room. Paige is sitting on a bed without a mattress, looking grim.

“This house has wi-fi.”

I direct Scamper to a rocking chair. “Everywhere has wi-fi.”

“No, I get five bars in the hall. There's a router in the attic or the basement. I think this is a Sears Craftsman house. Was built in the 1920's and only ever had one name on the deed: Archibald Hatch. What's the prognosis on the rabbit?”

“I don't think he's a rabbit. I mean... he's definitely playing rabbit here, but I think he was originally a fairy. Did you hear Scamper call him ‘not Archie'? He fumbles the heavy Turing and would fail any Voight-Kampff, but he's great so long as he stays on script. I don't imagine the police ever gave him a second thought.”

She frowns. “Coherent enough to place ads?”

“Maybe? Oh, also he linked some lemonade out of the dead fridge. Probably keeps the house in state the same way.”

“Ffffudge. Dangerous?”

“Other than the fact that he's been disappearing people for eighty years?”

“Yes, are we trapped?”

“Maybe, but that's not the important part. Somebody knows how to synthesize a rabbit. This gate doesn't belong to a Pan. We've found another Wizard.”

“Then Heather must be--” but then she's looking over my shoulder.

Archie's at the door, sipping a lemonade.

“Sorry about the state of the room. I haven't used it in years.”

“I think it's fine,” says Scamper, rocking.

“If you like,” he says, interrupting Paige before she can quip, “I've got some old furniture in the cellar. We could see if anything matches your fancy.”

Paige grins, girlish again. “Why yes, Hatch, I think something might.”
