The rat was being very patient with Kate, which she appreciated tremendously. It was all she could do to not scream about how they were too tiny to be sapient.

“When you're done communicating, raise your paws,” she said. The rat nodded. As she had expected, when he had raised his paws she was still hearing the message unfold in her head.

“The prophecy did not say you would be so interested in the fundamentals of communication,” he said.

/Communication/. “Speech” was something that ghouls did; they had the vocal cords for it. Rats didn't. Rats “communicated” from mind to mind, and Kate believed that they were going at it concept by concept, rather than word by word.

“Lots of people could meet the requirements, and I'm not ready to throw causality out just yet. It's more likely that somebody made it up at some point. But if I'm going to help your people then I need to know how everything works.”

The rat nodded again, which was really starting to creep her out. They hadn't done it at all until they had seen her do it. She didn't think that she was prepared to be Messiah of the Telepathic Rats.

Wait. He hadn't once asked for clarification about any cultural referents that she had used since coming here. That gave her an idea.

“I'm going to give you some names. Raise your paws when communication has ended.”

The rat nodded.

“Zeus,” she said, and then, a few seconds later, “Jupiter.” It took longer for him to raise his paws the second time. “What was communicated the first time?”

“Powerful spirit of the high places who was revered by the lovers of wisdom.” Kate had been worried that it would come back to her as “Zeus,” but it seemed that intent mattered. “And the second time?”

“Powerful spirit of the high places who was revered by the law-making people, similar to but not identical with the first.”

Huh. Apparently the concepts that were being communicated could be understood relative to other concepts on a case-by-case basis.

/Wait/. Forget about fairy tales and pop culture references. If she tried to communicate scientific principles to the rats, would the same thing happen?
