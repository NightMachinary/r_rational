I've really been loving time loop things lately. I've read Innortal's time loops in the universes I cared about, I REALLY wish there was a lot more Mother of Learning, I also liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2829366/1/Dimension-Hopping-for-Beginners][Dimension Hopping for Beginners]] which is along those lines. Anyone have any suggestions for other stories along the same lines?
