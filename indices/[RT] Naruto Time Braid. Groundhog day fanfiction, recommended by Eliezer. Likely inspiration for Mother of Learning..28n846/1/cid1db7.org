Far better than the fic that inspired it, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/1/Chunin-Exam-Day][Chunin Exam Day]]. Unlike that huge pile of mess, this one is relatively tightly plotted. Rules are consistent. Writing is good, with only a few proofreading misses in the entire fic. The author doesn't act (and write like) a spoiled child in ANs that are still there years later.

tl;dr Good and sexy timeloop fun.

--------------

Several people have commented on the sexual content. It is well under the "M" rating on FFN, and also logically follows from the characters' given histories and personality traits. It also involves women liking and seeking out sex, open and poly relationships, and same-sex relations. All things with which rational readers should have no problem at all. But this is an area some people have trouble with, a bias many have trouble overcoming because of their lifetime cultural influences.

Sex is tastefully done here, if you like reading about adults with centuries of personal experience having complicated sexual relationships. Casual sex is had, and no one is Magically Married by Destiny. The closest it gets to that is rather an existential horror show that needs to be resolved before any meaningful relationships can actually happen.

What it is clearly not, however, is some teen wet-dream fantasy. People have problems in their relationships in this story, including jealousy, and overcome them through logical events and personal development. As in real life, people are drawn together not by fate, but by experiencing events together. It is part of the plot, not merely tagged on.

If it wasn't clear, this is one of my all-time favorite fanfics, representing some of the best the genre has to offer.
