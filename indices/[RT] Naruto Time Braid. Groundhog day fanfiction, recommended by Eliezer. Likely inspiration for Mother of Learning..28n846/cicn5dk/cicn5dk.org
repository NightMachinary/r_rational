This is probably my favorite Naruto FF. The writing is good, the characters are interesting, there is a novel plot. Nothing is worse than fanfiction that follows cannon exactly except for one stupid extra character thrown in.

I particularly like how it expands on concepts already present in canon in an interesting way without going completely batshit crazy like many fics do. The protagonists become overpowered, but through somewhat justifiable means, and the antagonist does as well. The OC abilities are believable and thematically appropriate. Canon is altered slightly to make things more believable/interesting.

The only thing I didn't like was that it spends more time focusing on sex than necessary (nothing too graphic), but at least a justification is provided (spending 30 years as a hormone driven teenager is going to mess with your head).
