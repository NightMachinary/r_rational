I agree that the T rated crap is not as interesting, but I disagree that the relationships portrayed are particularly 'realistic' =)

Granted, there are some significant differences from normal reality including the aforementioned permanent teen-hood, existence of sex-magic, pressures resulting from a near constant state of warfare plus the bizarre circumstances the characters find themselves in, and a semi-schizophrenic protagonist.

I don't read a lot of material with smut, but I didn't find the content objectionable. It was just a little out of place with the rest of the novel.
