  The only thing I didn't like was that it spends more time focusing on sex than necessary (nothing too graphic), but at least a justification is provided (spending 30 years as a hormone driven teenager is going to mess with your head).

Very much personal opinion, obviously.

I prefer realistic human relationships to nearly asexual characters blushing at each other in a "T" rated fic for 200k words and three hundred years of relative personal experience. But again, personal preference.

I also thought [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2841153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor][Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor]] was hilarious, so my tastes might be significantly different.
