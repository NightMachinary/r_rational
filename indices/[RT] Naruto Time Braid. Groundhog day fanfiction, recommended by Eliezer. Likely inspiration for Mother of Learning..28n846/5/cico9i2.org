Read most of this one, will probably finish it soon.

My feelings on it are not as positive as others here. My main problems are:

- The writing style. It sometimes feels.. sloppy. A bit anachronistic, a bit immature (in the sense that the writer isn't experienced).

- The grammar mistakes/typos. They're unavoidable to some extent, but there's a lot more of them here than in more professional stories linked on this sub.

- The sheer amount of sexual adventuring. It reads like someone's daydreams written down, at times. This is justified to an extent, and would work in terms of story if it was toned down a bit and better written, but as it is, it's annoying.

All that said, I agree with all the positive points others have made. It's a decent read if you can get past the issues (which I did), but I wouldn't consider it as good as most of the stuff posted here.

As an example of a fic that I enjoyed a bit more, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8654967/1/Black-Cloaks-Red-Clouds][Black Cloaks, Red Clouds]]. Far from perfect, but doesn't have the issues mentioned above.
