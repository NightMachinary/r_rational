I agree - my favorite part is that it's 1) a time loop, 2) which actually has a tense and driving plot, with time-sensitive crises. Ans lastly, 3) it introduces new and interesting "magic system" / universe-building elements.

If anyone has good time-loop recommendations, I'd love to hear 'em.

Here's a good MLP time-loop, which I enjoyed despite having only watched 4 episodes of the show. [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset]] It only really provides #1 of my criteria above, but it's quite regardless, and its sequels provide #2 and #3. In the story, Twilight's characterization would greatly appeal to HPMOR/LW fans, and I had the impression that the author was already part of the community.

Nartuo: Ramen Days is short, fun, and unfinished. My opinion: the story stops before it would get boring. Also in the Videogame-saves=time-loops genre.
