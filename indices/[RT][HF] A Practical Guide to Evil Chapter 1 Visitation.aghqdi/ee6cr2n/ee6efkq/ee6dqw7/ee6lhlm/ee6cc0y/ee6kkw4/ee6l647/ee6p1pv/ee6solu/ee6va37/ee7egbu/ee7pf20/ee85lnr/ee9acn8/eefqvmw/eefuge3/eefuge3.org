That's why I said long term. Yes, neither Praes nor Procer are in any shape to fight the drow right now. But there's a reason the Dead King, by far the most powerful being in Calernia, has never seriously tried to bring down the Principate or even expand his territory. Because the last time an all-powerful villain swept across the continent, killing and conquering with sheer magical might, she was brought down within five years of her victory.

The drow could destroy Procer with ease, but every victory would produce more heroes and add weight to a counter-story that would soon be irresistible. That's the entire point of Black's teachings -vast magical power and demigods at war work well at first, but in the end they are always, always brought down by a peasant with a magic sword.
