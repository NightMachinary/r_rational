  I'm sorry, I misspoke. When I said one full chapter, I meant one regular chapter. Which is the only one that is really super relevant here.
#+end_quote

Don't worry, you were perfectly clear. I just disagreed.

  Interludes rarely, if ever, have much to do with Cat, and if they do they do so tangentially. Epilogues and prologues briefly touch on Catherine (a couple paragraphs, vs. several for other characters). Bonus chapters again, touch on Cat tangentially at most, and usually take place in the past.
#+end_quote

There isn't a divine mandate dictating when interludes happen. There are a few rules, like bonus chapters at the start of a month, but even those are self imposed. It is the author who decides when we get other kinds of chapters.

  Like I said before, I'm just not sure what you want done differently?
#+end_quote

Not end on a cliffhanger if he was going to spend so long away from the protagonist.

  Would you have preferred EE to skip out on Triptych, so that we'd miss how things were playing out in Procer and with the dwarves? The epilogue, so we wouldn't see what was going on with Tyrant/Heirarch and Black? The prologue so we wouldn't see what was happening with Malicia or Cordelia? Spend a bonus chapter, which have always provided story on someone other than Cat, on Cat?
#+end_quote

Simple, a section of the epilogue from Sve Noc's perspective post deal, showing their views towards Cat as well as some of the mechanics of their relationship.

#+begin_quote
  Spend all of this chapter on a giant info dump of Cat's terms with Sve Noc, regarding the mind reading, her role in the Night hierarchy, her new powers, how this all affects Callow? Sure, it would answer your questions, but it would be awful, awful storytelling.

If he hadn't spent five chapters faffing about with other crap he wouldn't need to, would he?
