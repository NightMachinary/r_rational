  We have had: One interlude, one epilogue, one prologue, one bonus chapter /and/ one regular chapter.

I'm sorry, I misspoke. When I said one full chapter, I meant one regular chapter. Which is the only one that is really super relevant here.

Interludes rarely, if ever, have much to do with Cat, and if they do they do so tangentially. Epilogues and prologues briefly touch on Catherine (a couple paragraphs, vs. several for other characters). Bonus chapters again, touch on Cat tangentially at most, and usually take place in the past.

Like I said before, I'm just not sure what you want done differently? Would you have preferred EE to skip out on Triptych, so that we'd miss how things were playing out in Procer and with the dwarves? The epilogue, so we wouldn't see what was going on with Tyrant/Heirarch and Black? The prologue so we wouldn't see what was happening with Malicia or Cordelia? Spend a bonus chapter, which have always provided story on someone other than Cat, on Cat?

Spend all of this chapter on a giant info dump of Cat's terms with Sve Noc, regarding the mind reading, her role in the Night hierarchy, her new powers, how this all affects Callow? Sure, it would answer your questions, but it would be awful, awful storytelling.
