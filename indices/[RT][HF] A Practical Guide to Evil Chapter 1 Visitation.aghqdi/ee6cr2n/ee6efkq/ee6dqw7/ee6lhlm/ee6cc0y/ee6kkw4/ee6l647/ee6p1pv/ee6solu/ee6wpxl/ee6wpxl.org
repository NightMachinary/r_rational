  You are forgetting the guy they are going to fight
#+end_quote

I'm really not. All of Neshama's horrors were deliberate choices, not incompetence.

  and the fact that Sve Noc did most of their atrocities to prevent their people from being eliminated and another Kingdom of the Dead from being created.
#+end_quote

Yeah, the best they could squeak out in their attempt to avoid it was a monument to deranged viciousness. It speaks very poorly of their capability.

As much as I dislike Malicia, she has at the very least been /competent/, until recently. Cat traded a vicious but successful boss she was almost free of for a vicious boss who needed her to empower them and whom she is now tied to in ways that are deliberately obscured.

  Also, the most harmful thing they've done so far was not talking to her for a couple of days.
#+end_quote

No, the most harmful thing they have done is the *millenia of ritualistic slavery and drow sacrifice*. And then fucking up their own apotheosis badly enough they needed a godling unwilling to exercise her power (and therefore far easier to take) to stumble in.

#+begin_quote
  They ar treating Cat as an equal, just as she treated them as peers worty of judging her.
#+end_quote

They very clearly are not.

  “So *where'd we land on whether or not I have power of expulsion* from the faith again?” I finally asked crow-Andronike.

  “No,” she replied.

  “Maybe,” crow-Komena said at the same time.

  “You just wait,” I grunted. “One of these days I'll *talk the damned crows into letting me* write your holy book and there'll be an entire hymn about how much of a prick you are.”
#+end_quote

Even in jokes, there is a strict hierarchical line. She needs to ask /permission/. She needs to talk them into /letting/ her do things.

This is an entirely new kind of relationship, something as yet unseen in the narrative, for good or ill. Whether or not someone likes it, it shouldn't be written the same as other relationships have.

As yet the relationship itself is worryingly undefined and has been for far too long. We badly need to learn the specifics of their arrangement. In the mean time, not having this new Goddess-Priest relationship written with the same casual informality which defines her relationship with her oldest and most beloved friends isn't a lot to ask.

#+begin_quote
  Give up.
