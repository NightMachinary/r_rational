  Well it was presumably healing her up

Clearly not fully, as she still has her limp. She would need a conscious use of power to dismiss the pain of it. Either they are unwilling or /unable/ to heal her completely.

  and making her essentially their arch-pope.

Right, but what does that /mean/? Rumena is apparently in command of this expedition. Is that in command the same way Juniper is in command of Callow's army, where she still answers to Cat? The fact that he is reporting to Cat strongly suggests as much, but he isn't showing her the obeisance typical to drow when interacting with a superior. Then there is:

#+begin_quote
  It had amused the Sisters to send what little remained of the army I'd once led against them on the southern expedition. I wasn't complaining: the oaths binding us might have been broken, but they were quicker to obey my orders than most drow.
#+end_quote

So, most drow are hesitant to follow her orders? Or are the drow she previously worked with just /really/ quick to obey?

What is Cat's place in their culture and society? How much of a commitment is it? Is she allowed to leave? If so, does she keep her partially healed body? If so, does she keep her powers? Hell *what are her powers?*

How does all this factor in to her rulership of Callow? How much authority does Sve Noc have over her? They can hear her thoughts with no effort, can they also alter them?

All other forms of authority have been granted transactionally - Further Black's agenda by being a Callowan Named working for the tower, get broad authority and a legion of her own. Is this the same but with the transaction hidden from the audience, or is it different with that difference hidden from the audience?

Either way I don't know shit and I don't like it.

#+begin_quote
  Everything else aside, if I had just given Cat (of all people) that kind of authority and power I'd certainly want representatives there to watch over her.
#+end_quote

Rumena strikes me as an appropriate agent. Permanent mind reading is something we have seen twice before in the narrative - In an absurdist tyrannical dictatorship, Bellerophon, and from Above's agents as they use Pilgrim. Both cases are very clearly not good things.

#+begin_quote
  Aside from that, I'm fairly sure they can just hear Cat's thoughts all the time, gods do tend to have a strong bond to their appointed representative.
#+end_quote

This kind of thing shouldn't be guesswork, at this point.
