  Yeah, the best they could squeak out in their attempt to avoid it was a monument to deranged viciousness.

It's almost like the Twilight Sages' fuckup has left them with only one possible solution and nothing to pay for it. Reread their conversation with the Envoy: they weren't malicious, just desperate, and the Below twisted their arms into pretty much everything you blame them for. I'm not saying it /isn't/ unimaginably horrible, just that no currently present character was there in time for better options to be availiable.

  No, the most harmful thing they have done is the millenia of ritualistic slavery and drow sacrifice.

Sorry, missed a word: the most harmful thing they've done /to her/ so far was not talking to her for a couple of days.

  She needs to ask permission.

Only for the stuff that affects the drow (either long-term or the immediate commands), which is reasonable, considering that Cat cares about the drow only as long as they further her agenda and they all know it. This also happens to be near all of her decisions of import, since the only people in her army that aren't going to have to follow her decrees as the Priestess of the Night are Archer and Diabolist - but then again we didn't see them even close to those two's interactions with Cat, so far (and even then I'd argue that Akua is disposable enough to be fair game). Besides, Cat was going to do pretty much the same thing, only with Winter making the slope even more slippery and no supervision from the conquered drow, so this is arguably fair. I'd withhold the judgement until we see how firm is their grip beyond that.

  Whether or not someone likes it, it shouldn't be written the same as other relationships have. Not having this new Goddess-Priest relationship written with the same casual informality which defines her relationship with her oldest and most beloved friends isn't a lot to ask.

I think it's more a combination of Cat sassing any higher power she comes across, the crows barely classifying even as half a divine avatar each, and Sve Noc having absorbed a mantle of power with Cat's soul inscribed on it (see also: Diabolist changing her narrative arc by leaning into the same influence).
