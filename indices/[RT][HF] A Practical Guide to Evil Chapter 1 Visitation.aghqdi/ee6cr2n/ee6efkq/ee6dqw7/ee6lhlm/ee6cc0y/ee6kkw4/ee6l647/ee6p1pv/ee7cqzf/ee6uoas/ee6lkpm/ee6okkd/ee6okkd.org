I do think the once a month bonus chapters (ala Peregrine II) should be combined with the same day release chapters. As for the regular chapters, i personally find the discussion threads on [[/r/PracticalGuideToEvil][r/PracticalGuideToEvil]] too 'fanboyish' and full of epistemologically suspect theories and prefer the quality of discussion we get here.
