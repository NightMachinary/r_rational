So.....they are not only actively watching but also actively /policing/ her thoughts, even if it is just [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology][Insistent Terminology]] for humours sake.

Like all of her interactions with them this chapter, it fell completely flat to me. EE is writing them as if they are the Woe, the old buddies she has known and worked with forever, but they /aren't/. They are two of the oldest, most blood drenched monster there ever was. And we /still/ don't know the specifics of their relationship. We saw /her/ act of faith but their response was obscured.

At this point they are still just a pair of overpowered assholes with more death and chaos because of their incompetence then anyone else in the world.
