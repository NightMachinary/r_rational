  i personally find the discussion threads on [[/r/PracticalGuideToEvil][r/PracticalGuideToEvil]] too 'fanboyish' and full of epistemologically suspect theories and prefer the quality of discussion we get here.

As someone from visit both subreddit's threads there's really no difference whatsoever. The only difference is that you guys /think/ you have good discussions where the [[/r/PracticalGuideToEvil]] subreddit is there for the ride and having fun.
