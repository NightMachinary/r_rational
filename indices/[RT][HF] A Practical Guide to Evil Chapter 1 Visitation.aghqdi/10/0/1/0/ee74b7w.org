I think it's more "Cat's the protagonist and a hypocrite and the heroes are the antagonists and are a bunch of hypocrites" brigade.

Also, calling it a brigade when it's literally just the community over there is a bit much. Though I do find the lack of pretentiousness in [[/r/PracticalGuideToEvil]] a much greater experience.

Talking about epistemologically suspect theories over here when you guys are just as wrong or more wrong than the theories in the PGtE subreddit. You guys get basic plot facts wrong that we don't.
