Because if they conquered Callow they'd be surrounded by Praes, Procer and the Golden Bloom, none of whom would ever tolerate having the drow for a neighbour, especially if they'd just conquered an entire human nation.

They aren't fighting the Dead King because of a bargain with Cat. They didn't even know about her Keter settlement plan when she gave them her power. They're fighting him because it's one of the only reasons the dwarves would let them go, and because they recognise that the best way to rejoin the wider continent is to do it in a way that benefits the surface nations.

If they emerged in any other way they would be a net drain on the surface world, earning the enmity of every other nation, which would be disastrous in the long term. Especially with the Wandering Bard out there to shape the story against them. With Cat's plan however, the forces of the continent will likely actively help the drow rather than hinder them.
