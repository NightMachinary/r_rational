What are Praes and Procer going to do about it? From what we saw pre Sve Noc becoming a literal god with all the power of the Winter Court and the power of the Night, a power which becomes stronger every time you kill someone they aren't anything.

That one Mighty from near the start who was a nobody from the boonies could decimate everythingeither kingdom has except maybe Pilgrim, Saint and Warlock. Of those 3, Warlocks dead while the Saint and Pilgrim are actively working against Procer.

The Golden Bloom fucked off to Arcadia and Procer and Praes are both only technically still kingdoms with arge, active elements trying to burn them down.
