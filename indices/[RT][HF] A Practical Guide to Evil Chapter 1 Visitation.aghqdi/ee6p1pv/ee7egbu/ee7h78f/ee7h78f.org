This is a really interesting perspective I hadn't considered. I don't entirely agree with it, but I thank you for sharing it.

  The crows were made with the specific purpose of letting Catherine communicate with her goddesses in a way which she finds intuitive, and to let them keep a close eye on her from a perspective that wasn't inside her own skull.

In particular I am curious why you say this. It is reasonable speculation based what little information we have but you present it as fact so I am wondering if it is something I missed.

  Therefore, it makes the most sense for Komena and Andronike to make the crows out of fragments of themselves which seem most agreeable to Catherine. It isn't that the goddesses are now Cat's old buddies, it's that they created constructs which would behave like old buddies of Cat's in order to best serve their own purposes.

This part, though, I particularly like as an explanation. I still don't think Cat should be barter-sassing back and forth with them the way she does others (variety is important - the protagonist can't interact with everyone the same way) but this serves as a functional justification.
