Well it was presumably healing her up and making her essentially their arch-pope. Everything else aside, if I had just given Cat (of all people) that kind of authority and power I'd certainly want representatives there to watch over her. Aside from that, I'm fairly sure they can just hear Cat's thoughts all the time, gods do tend to have a strong bond to their appointed representative.
