We've had a grand total of one full chapter (this one) from Cat's perspective since the Underdark arc came to an end. I'm sure quite a few of these questions will be answered in time, through further insights into Cat's thoughts, her interactions with Sve Noc, and other bits of plot and character interaction.

I'm not fully sure what you're expecting, here, to be honest. Sure, we could get the information faster, but I think an info dump as rapid/dense as you seem to be looking for would basically put every other bit of plot advancement, character development, and character interaction to a halt for at least a full chapter.
