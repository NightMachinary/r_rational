We have had: One interlude, one epilogue, one prologue, one bonus chapter /and/ one regular chapter. That is a hell of a lot of content spent dancing around the issue. Since Chapter 82 I have read all of it with these questions in mind, and haven't got a single answer.

In real world time, it has been over five weeks.

I have nothing against EE taking a break. Everyone needs work-life balance and it /was/ the holidays. But there are too many questions that are too important and have remained unanswered for too long.

None of this would be an issue if he hadn't concluded chapter 82 on a cliffhanger. I get it, they are utterly essential for a serial where the success of the work and the authors livelihood itself rest on pulling people back, but if you leave people dangling off that cliff too long they fall.

This has gone from being my favourite series to teetering on the edge of being dropped.
