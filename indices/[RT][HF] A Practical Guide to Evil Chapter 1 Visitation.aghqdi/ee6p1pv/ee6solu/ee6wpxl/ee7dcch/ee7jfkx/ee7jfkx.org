  It's almost like the Twilight Sages' fuckup has left them with only one possible solution and nothing to pay for it. Reread their conversation with the Envoy: they weren't malicious, just desperate, and the Below twisted their arms into pretty much everything you blame them for. I'm not saying it isn't unimaginably horrible, just that no currently present character was there in time for better options to be availiable.

Justifications only matter to the Just.

I am not really condemning them as /people/. My only real interest in them is as Cat's new masters and, frankly, I don't consider them worthy of that. Their story was one of failure and horror.

  Sorry, missed a word: the most harmful thing they've done to her so far was not talking to her for a couple of days.
#+end_quote

Did you mean the most harmful /unprovoked/ thing? Because there was that whole thing with the tearing open her soul.......

Anyway, that isn't really relevant. My issue is characters crammed into the story so quickly we needed a literal tour through their memories to establish them in time, given such authority over the protagonist when they have neither the moral standing nor the record of success that would make them worthy of it, while the narrative and author do everything possible to hide the actual details and facts regarding their new relationship.

Them having not done much to her is part of the issue. At least if they had I would know what they were about. Malicia is an asshole and I can't wait for Cat to set her on fire but I always knew what their relationship was, nuanced as it might be.

  Only for the stuff that affects the drow (either long-term or the immediate commands), which is reasonable, considering that Cat cares about the drow only as long as they further her agenda and they all know it. This also happens to be near all of her decisions of import, since the only people in her army that aren't going to have to follow her decrees as the Priestess of the Night are Archer and Diabolist - but then again we didn't see them even close to those two's interactions with Cat, so far (and even then I'd argue that Akua is disposable enough to be fair game). Besides, Cat was going to do pretty much the same thing, only with Winter making the slope even more slippery and no supervision from the conquered drow, so this is arguably fair. I'd withhold the judgement until we see how firm is their grip beyond that.

So, again, we know fuck all. More than a month back the protagonist took a leap of faith and we still don't know where she landed.

  I think it's more a combination of Cat sassing any higher power she comes across, the crows barely classifying even as half a divine avatar each, and Sve Noc having absorbed a mantle of power with Cat's soul inscribed on it (see also: Diabolist changing her narrative arc by leaning into the same influence).

This seems like a quick and hasty excuse more than an actual reason.

Even if it ultimately comes with a great excuse, it is still a problem for me. EE is fucking incredible at banter and sass, but that can't be the protagonists /only/ way of interacting with people. This is a unique and distinct relationship, it should feel that way.
