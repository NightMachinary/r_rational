The process through which the crows were made was described as pinching off slivers of divinity. The crows were made with the specific purpose of letting Catherine communicate with her goddesses in a way which she finds intuitive, and to let them keep a close eye on her from a perspective that wasn't inside her own skull. Both of these goals are facilitated if the crows are things Catherine enjoys keeping around. She wouldn't talk to minders she hates, after all.

Therefore, it makes the most sense for Komena and Andronike to make the crows out of fragments of themselves which seem most agreeable to Catherine. It isn't that the goddesses are now Cat's old buddies, it's that they created constructs which would behave like old buddies of Cat's in order to best serve their own purposes.
