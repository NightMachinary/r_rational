The problem is that we've never seen that once. Dozens of heroes appeared post conquest and the Calamities dealt with this issue by murdering them all. Against the legions 50,000 men and 14 heroes with the story of a crusade against evilto prevent them from being able to open permanent hellgates wherever they want vs an army with all their big weapons comatose and did nothing. The White Knight and his band went against the most stereotypical villain possible who actively screwed himself for funsies and only lived by the will of Mighty Bellerophon, Greatest of the Free Cities.

Heroes are built up as some great threat with the scales weighted in their favour by an elephant but every time they fight they get slaughtered. The one victory against a villain we've seen involved the Bard actively fiddling and required a dead hero as fuel. We saw a peasant with a magic sword rise up against the Empire to cast off their chains and take vengeance, the story of Callow. He was slaughtered and his plan ended up as fodder to resurrect a villain.
