[[/u/alexanderwales]] has a very good start that covers all of the basics. To add a few more ideas:

Find out what atium's other alloys are. WoG states that there are more than 16 and less than 100, IIRC, so malatium (seeing someone else as if they had made a different choice in the past) isn't the only one. Test them with both Allomancy and Feruchemy.

+Immerse myself in liquid atium/platinum, assuming that I can heal faster than the molten metal can burn me. This would hopefully duplicate the effects of the Well of Ascension, even though it is based on a different god.+ This is a terrible idea. Channeling pure "Preservation" seems safe, as far as godly powers go. Channeling pure "Ruin" is almost certainly suicide.

Try to find Lerasium to create more Mistborn. Since Atium exists, it might exist too.

Have a lot of children. Both Feruchemy and Allomancy can be passed on to children, so it seems worthwhile.
