Constantly burning all allomantic metals to store their investiture in Nicrosil metalminds, and then compounding that investiture would be my first thought.

Being able to use pure Investiture to fuel your other abilities at the drop of a hat would be pretty crazy. I think you would be able to just slap on any random piece of gold, or steel or whatever, and begin using it as a metalmind immediately. If that would work, then it should also be possible to use your Allomantic abilities even without metals to burn.

Just make sure to keep those Nicrosilminds well hidden, preferably implanted somewhere beneath your skin.
