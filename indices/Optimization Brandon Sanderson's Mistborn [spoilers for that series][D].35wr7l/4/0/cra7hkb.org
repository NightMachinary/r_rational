Atium is generated in the Pits of Hathsin because that's where Ruin's Shardpool is. Since the Well of Ascension is Preservation's Shardpool, that's where you'll find lerasium. I think it's the ONLY place where lerasium can come from, actually.

As to swimming in molten atium, I doubt that's how it would work. Shardpools are the Cognitive essence of the Shard manifested in the Physical Realm. You couldn't create another one just by getting a bunch of atium. What you want to do is create a bunch of atium spikes, stab a bunch of guys, and /then/ swim in molten atium. As it hardens and forms a shell around your skin, hopefully the hemalurgic properties of the spikes they used to be will mean that you get some kind of crazy powers.
