I just finished this series a few days ago, so this stuff is pretty fresh in my mind. I loved it, really well-written.

One of the biggest obstacles is the lack of information on how Allomancy and Feruchemy function. There are a lot of questions, and some of them can be answered with simple research:

- How much metal is required to perform a given function?
- Are burning and flaring binary actions? Can you adjust how quickly a metal is burned to get partial effects?
- If a metalmind is divided in half, or if two metalminds are affixed together, how is the storage affected?

Other questions are more difficult to answer, or may never have an answer:

- How does one measure the trait a metalmind stores?
- What is the upper limit of storage for a given metalmind?
- How does the purity of a metalmind effect its storage capacity?
- What is the multiplier applied when compounding? How is it affected by flaring?

Since I don't know the composition of allomantic alloys, I'd have to start by using the pure metals. Gold and zinc will be easy to come by, and will assist in my research. To ensure I can compound properly, I'll need to obtain a gold metalmind, preferably something I can embed in my body, and some gold flakes. I fill the flakes with health, swallow them, then burn them. The resulting extra health is then immediately channeled into the metalmind, ready to use whenever I need it.

Money will be a big issue, since Allomancy consumes the metals involved. I'll need a steady supply. Revealing myself as a god is probably not the best idea, but I can use chromium to store up luck, then visit a casino or work the stock market. That will be the easiest way to make a lot of money without drawing too much attention.

As soon as I have a steady supply of gold and platinum, I can pretty much live however I want. I'm immortal and invulnerable, and I have pewter and tin to make me totally untouchable. At this point, I can reveal myself to the world as a superhuman, and spend my free time flying through cities and stopping crime. I would also make it a priority to start a family, since my abilities can be passed to my children.
