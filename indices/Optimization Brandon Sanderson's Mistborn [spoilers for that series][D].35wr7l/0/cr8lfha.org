Assuming (non-plot) spoilers for all the /Mistborn/ books including /Alloy of Law/, because if you haven't read those I have no idea what you're doing in this thread. I can't consult the /Ars Arcanum/ from the back of /Alloy of Law/ (which I lent out to a friend), so I guess the wiki will have to do.

Step one, experiment with metals and try to work out a system to figure out which metals provide which benefits. Since new metals /are/ discovered, that means that the knowledge of metals is incomplete, which means that I might find more of them with new abilities, such as those known at the time of /Alloy of Law/ (if I didn't know those already).

Compounding is straight busted. Compounded gold is the one that makes you nearly impervious to physical attack, so that's the one I start with. Rapid regeneration allows me to have a wide variety of metals implanted under my skin, which ensures that no one can easily take them away from me. Electrum stores determination, and compounding it means I have super-willpower to let me do anything I want. Zinc stores mental speed, which means that zinc compounding lets me think really, really fast (probably start with this one).

Of the new metals, chromium allows you to store fortune, which means that compounded chromium lets you go recursive with luck - making yourself hundreds of times more lucky than anyone else. Nicrosil allows you to store Investure, which is basically the Cosmere's "source of all magic", and which I assume is going to play a big role in some future book - having access to a source of it is really important, though the details haven't been revealed (I'm pretty sure that this would allow me to be better at the metallic magics). Cadmium compounding would allow me to go without breathing; bendalloy compounding would allow me to go without eating. Duralumin compounding would allow me to quickly form relationships with people, probably to be used in conjunction with my emotional powers.

*tl;dr*; So once that's all done, I'm eternally young, eternally healthy, have no need to eat, drink, or breath, I can form relationships with people nigh-instantly, I have ridiculous amounts of strength, speed, and endurance, I don't need to sleep, and I'm ridiculously lucky. I would really like to see what's left as a challenge to me.
