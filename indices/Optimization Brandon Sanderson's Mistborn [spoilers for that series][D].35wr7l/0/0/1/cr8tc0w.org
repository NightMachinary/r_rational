Here are some zinc stunts they note, from the roleplay book on compounding zinc.

  Inhuman Insight (Compounding): You think so fast that you can process and understand the world in ways impossible for ordinary humans to understand. At the beginning of Step 1 of a Conflict, you may spend 10 Compounded charges of men- tal speed to declare your action as if you had Wits 11 (see the Mistborn Adventure Game, page 174). Additionally, you may take this action at any point in Step 2 that you wish --- going first, last, or immediately after any other action. You cannot inter- rupt another character's action in this way, and if you choose to act at the same time as another character using this Stunt, your actions occur simultaneously. Additionally, you may spend 10 Compounded charges of Zinc to ignore the effects of declaring a new action during a Conflict (see the Mistborn Adventure Game, page 180).

  Lateral Link (Compounding): By spending 10 or more Compounded charges of mental speed, you can make complicated logical connections rapidly (such as discovering a secret about a situation, determining weaknesses in a plan, sussing out a connection between two people, etc.). Making these lateral links costs 10 Compounded charges, plus an additional 10 for each correct logical leap you have to make (usually because you lack information). The Narrator tells you each logical leap you make, and you may continue tapping charges until you find out what you were looking for, until you run out of Compounded charges, or until you give up on finding the answer.

It's certainly helpful, but you're limited by the fact that you're not actually any faster than enemies, you don't get any new knowledge. Tin compounding would be more useful in many situations, with abilities like seeing through any non metallic object.
