Compounding zinc jumped out at me when I read the appendix to /Alloy of Law/, yeah. Perhaps /Shadows of Self/ will introduce someone with that power, or address it in some other way - though I'd assign a pretty high probability that if it shows up/is mentioned, Sanderson would explicitly try to shoot down its apparent brokenness.
