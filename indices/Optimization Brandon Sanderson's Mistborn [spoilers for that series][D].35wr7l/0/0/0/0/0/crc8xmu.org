There's a very good reason why one might not compound zinc: dependency.

In Alloy of Law, it mentions once you start compounding Gold (for health), you can't stop, or you'll die - possibly from the shock of nolonger having massively magically enhanced health. This is consistent with Well of Ascension's talk of Adepts, who have become dependent on burning their metal 24/7.

If you're immortal, you lack many significant challenges in your life, and your only real life purpose is to live for 1000 years to renew the prison on an evil god, then repeat ad-nauseum... you probably wouldn't want to live all that in slow-motion.
