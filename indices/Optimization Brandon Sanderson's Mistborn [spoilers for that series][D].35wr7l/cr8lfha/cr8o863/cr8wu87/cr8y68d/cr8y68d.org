Beyond establishing somewhat arbitrary constraints on your access to metals...

The somewhat pat answer would be "another Fullborn, but better". So you just woke up today with those powers and someone else has had them for the last century and sees you as a threat. Or, if we're to stick with the cosmere and make the other guy have a strictly better powerset, someone who's also used Hemalurgy to get some of the more interesting powers from other magic systems: all that you have /plus/ being able to teleport and shoot fire out of the air might give him an edge.
