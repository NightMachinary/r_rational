It's fairly easy to become an unstoppable fighter. The big problem is Ruin. He's going to get free eventually and then no amount of petty powers is going to win you this. What he needs to do is start invading other worlds and pick up a shard somewhere. Dominion perhaps, or Honor. He needs some method of mind control that Ruin can't intercept.

To really tap the mysteries of identity and joining other magics he needs feruchemists. He needs nicrominds to draw in power. I would start an extensive breeding program for feruchemists, isolated from all culture, and a breeding program for mistborn. I'd then find a way to send them out from world to world to explore. Once they find a world I'd start to conquer it.
