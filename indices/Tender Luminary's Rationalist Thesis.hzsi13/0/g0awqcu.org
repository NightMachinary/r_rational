My go-to "rationalist fic done right" is generally Pokemon: The Origin of Species. Exploring the themes of how people think, how we weigh risks, etc, without the same arrogance. A different kind of arrogance, perhaps, but if so, a much softer kind than HJPEV.

I did read quite a bit of Animorphs: The Reckoning, but eventually wasn't enjoying it enough to continue (I vaguely recall the Visser using Leeran Hypersight to ambush the heroes although it was confusing).
