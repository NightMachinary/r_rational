That is definitely an issue that leads to a similar outcome, in your case more of a the author planned this much story but people want more and his editors and employers force him to continue until it stops making money.

It happens a lot with tv shows, anime and anything that it's existence is dependent on it's popularity and (or) it's inherent purpose is generating income. I think some of the bad arcs and the decay that tends to happen can and often are a conscious decision of the author.

Sometimes the story is over and you just want to move on and start the next one but you can't because your editor or publisher won't let you because this one is at peak popularity, which is arguably the perfect point to stop quality wise but the worst one financially.

My issue with lack of power caps comes more from, what I already said and, how they remove some of my favorite parts and interesting situations I'd like to see explored in that world / magic system. I prefer nuanced creative displays of skill, rather than my number is higher / I trained harder / I have an OP gimmick (that's not munchkin and I lucked upon) so I win.
