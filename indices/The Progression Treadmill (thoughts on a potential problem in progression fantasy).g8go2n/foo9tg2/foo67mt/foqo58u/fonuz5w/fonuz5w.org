In EverQuest and World of Warcraft and most other MMORPGs, there is "mudflation" of skills and abilities and power levels with every release of new content.

Consider the strongest monster in a game, a scourge on the world that takes dozens of the strongest players in a raid to defeat (and we will hand wave away the fact that it respawns for another raid an hour or a day later). Then a new expansion comes out with a higher level cap, better gear, and a new strongest monster. Suddenly it only takes one group (usually 5-6) of players to defeat the old big boss. Then yet another expansion comes out, and some players can solo the original big boss.

But of course these players still can't handle the guards in the main city. Why aren't those guards going out and clearing the world of the sorts of menace represented by the original big boss?
