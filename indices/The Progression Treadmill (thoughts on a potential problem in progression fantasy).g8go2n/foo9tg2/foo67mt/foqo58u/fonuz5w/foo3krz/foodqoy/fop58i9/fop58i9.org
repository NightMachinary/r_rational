I think this is true of a lot more than just progression fantasy. /Most/ fantasy stories, even ones that have flat power levels, frame all problems in terms of "how do we punch it to death". It's pretty rare to have a story where the challenge is "how do you get disparate interests to agree on a single solution to structural problems", and even when you do that's often a backdrop to some more direct conflict.
