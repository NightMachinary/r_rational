I agree with you generally but it doesn't have to be bad writing ( though clearly is in DBZ) It doesn't make sense that someone relatively weak has heard to the most powerful people in the universe. Part of the treadmill is that you gain agency that you also will also gain awareness or the ability to travel farther. When you're a kid your world is limited to first walking around the house , then your neighborhood with a bike, and the the city with the car. People in the city aren't going to solve the problem of the bully on your cul de sac because they're working at their job not patrolling for places they can intervene.
