This entire setup is based upon the false assumption that you need character growth only along a single axis, and that 'power' only exists on that axis, and that there are no drawbacks for using it. It assumes the "Goku problem".

Such limited works, such as DBZ, invariably write themselves into a corner both because they never considered this when they started, and the series went on for far too long. If the series had ended after the first few major story arcs, it wouldn't have been so bad, but the /first arc of the series/ had people who could move at FTL in hand-to-hand combat while also being capable of employing attacks that could /destroy a planet/. And this was /excluding/ any transformations or 'power upgrades' (well, except by the main protagonist, who had to use his semi-transformation to keep up with the villain). Each new arc just cranked things up to a ridiculous level, but the writers would try and obfuscate this with the numbers, nevermind that later they claimed certain feats were impossible or had the characters gasp in awe at something one did... even though such a thing may have been done many times in previous arcs.

What do you do when your dial was already cranked up to 11 in a story based around combat? The wrong choice is to just stay on that one axis and crank up the numbers, which eventually gives you the "Goku problem".

The trick is to write your stories that use more than one axis for measuring their characters--so that they can have things outside their comfort zone that require growth and so that other characters might have a chance to shine with their set of skills. Or both.

This is what I like to call the "Superman solution".

Take Superman. He is functionally the most physically powerful being in his multiverse. There is no real limit to his strength. He has literally lifted objects of infinite weight. *But*... he has many other limitations. He is not omnipresent, he is not omniscient, and he adheres to a code of morality. In his universe, he could easily go out and murder anyone who opposed him with only the barest minimum of effort, if he chose. Lex Luthor? Easily dealt with (and no, not that Metropolitan Man nonsense that requires you to hand him a giant Idiot Ball to lose with). Even high tier threats like Darkseid can be defeated locally, if not permanently. The thing is, he /won't/ choose to use this power except under certain conditions. In short, he is really good at *hitting things*. So what do the writers do? If he's a main character, they put him in situations where /hitting things can't solve his problems/.

Then there's the kryptonite issue (as well as the 'weakness' to magic). His power has loopholes which can be abused, such that his ability to instantly win can be potentially be taken away. There are threats which he can not deal with directly, but he /can/ think his way around them, either coming up with another solution, or being forced to rely on *other people with different skills* to assist him. Sometimes the former is the latter, and so you see him ask help from the Justice League, or even his non superpowered friends. Sometimes, though, the guy who is good at hitting things has to surprise his opponents by /outsmarting/ them.

A third potential possibility is to include *drawbacks* for using ones strength. In both DBZ and DC, the higher power 'good guys' generally don't want to unleash their maximum potential inside an inhabited area, while the 'bad guys' sometimes have no issue with this. Thus, the characters can't just unload at full strength, but have to get crafty. (DBZ loses this later, obviously, by setting everything in places the audience doesn't really care about.) Another option is to seed a 'cost' or 'drawback' into the primary axis of power. Male Channelers in the /Wheel of Time/ series by Robert Jordan steadily went crazy the more magic they used. In the case of /Avatar, the Last Airbender/, the Avatar State was an insane power upgrade, but if the Avatar ever died in that state, *it was gone forever*, and for a protagonist who reincarnates down through the ages, that was a truly final fate. Both are extreme examples, but it's not difficult to come up with lesser scenarios.

There are numerous ways to handle the "Goku problem", but most of them require a bit of planning and forethought... both in worldbuilding, and what the story hopes to accomplish. Also, it helps to assume (even if unlikely) that at some point you might want to write more, so leaving an 'out' as to how to continue it from the beginning is probably a good idea.
