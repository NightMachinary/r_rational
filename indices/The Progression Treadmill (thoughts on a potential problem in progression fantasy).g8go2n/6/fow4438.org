I think this view of the problem misses the mark. Construing it as a treadmill of power is actually a way to lead yourself right towards the mistake. What causes stories to go stale so quickly is that their authors don't know how to keep them fresh, not so much that what they're doing is intrinsically an issue. The problem with Progression Fantasy specifically is more than the wealth of examples new writers have are not very good at mitigating structural problems.

Stories need to constantly and consistently reinvent themselves to stay fresh. New character dynamics need to be introduced, new situations, new information. A powerup is a possible answer, but has diminishing returns when used over and over again, so good stories know how to pace those and sandwich them between other fresh ingredients. I would argue the main problem Progression Fantasy stories have with mitigating staleness is that most of the effort that goes into the writing is poured into the powers and their escalation, while all those other ingredients are left in a superficial state and not developed very much. They usually end up reading like some kind of novelized walkthrough to a videogame, rather than the experiences of a character (or more) being faced with new situations and having a reaction to them. Emotions are muted. The writing doesn't give developments the weight they need.

The Gamer, to use a well-known example, has Gamer's Mind, an ability that exists solely to justify the flat emotional landscape of the protagonist and the superficial nature of his relationships with others. Is it fun to see him gain more and more power? Yes. But when the story tries to sandwich that between interactions with the setting or other characters it ends up feeling immaterial and like a waste of time. Eventually the escalation loses luster and the story feels stale.

To use another well-known example: "Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka?" spends so much time with the protagonist killing and eating in a survival scenario that it fails to develop anything else, and by the time it tries to shift gears there's no way to salvage it. Very few people will accept and enjoy the shift to third person and to seeing the protagonist from the perspective of weaker characters.

The simplest way to give weight and depth to things is to dedicate wordcount to them. Falling into the trap of having most of your wordcount be an exploration of numbers going up without a plan B is a recipe for staleness.
