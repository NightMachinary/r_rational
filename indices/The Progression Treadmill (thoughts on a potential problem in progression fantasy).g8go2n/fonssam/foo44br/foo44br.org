The formatting confused it a little (maybe a code block next time?) but I generally agree.

These are the conclusions I came to when writing my litrpg. Going for primarily 1 (setting to accommodate), but a little bit of 2 (power level/conflict is not source of tension). I won't talk about 1, because that would be way too specific to my story and way too long. But as far as 2 goes I am using rationalism to solve it; people here like paragraphs of text thinking through problems, identifying biases, solving mysteries, deconstructing tropes, and often accept that as a decent form of tension.

Heck my first major conflict stretches across three chapters (4.5k words) but I'm pretty sure less than 10% of that is the actual conflict.
