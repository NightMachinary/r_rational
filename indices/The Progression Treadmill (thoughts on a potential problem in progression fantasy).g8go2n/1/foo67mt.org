People may not like it but IMHO power caps are good and make stories more interesting. When there's a power cap suddenly strategy, tactics, deceit and other interesting combat methods mean something.

​

You can have armies, and other valid group on group combat situations. Little optimizations and interesting combinations make a difference. Armor, weapons and equipment tend to be more relevant.

​

It's the old 'Limitations are what make anything interesting' and it's variances in writing and game design advice. If characters can just get more powerful indefinitely suddenly a lot of interesting scenarios and events, will never be able to appear in the story coherently or rationally.
