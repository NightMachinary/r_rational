  But then in the second season, he discovers that there's another conspiracy. And then another one after that. And so on for seven seasons, until it becomes total absurd.

What I hate about this trope is that it retroactively ruins great character dynamics, especially between a protagonist and a foil.

To use another example: The Daniel Craig Bond films.

You start out with "Le Chiffre is working with terrorists." That's set up at the very start of the film. Then you take a step back, and learn that Le Chiffre and Vesper Lind are under the thumb of a mysterious organization called Quantum. This is set up in the first film, and paid off in the next; that's all fine.

But, in the third film, we meet Raoul Silva, who is set up as a foil to Bond, that is, a character who is much like the protagonist; someone who the protagonist can be easily contrasted against. Both of them have been through trauma at the hands of MI6, both have reasons to turn against it and to seek revenge against M. Silva does, Bond doesn't. That is the basis for a great character dynamic.

Then /SPECTRE/ comes along, and Silva is now, retroactively, a pawn of Blofeld's. Instead of being about a man who remains loyal to an organization and its ideals, despite all of the abuse it's inflicted upon him, against a man who is willing to bring that organization down because of the abuse /he/ has suffered, /Skyfall/ becomes... the agent of "the good guys" against the agent of "the bad guys."

And that seems to be the pattern with Matryoshka conspiracies; they're set up to be some sort of foil to the good guys and their intentions and goals, but then the next layer of the onion is revealed, and the relationship between the protagonists and the layer they just defeated no longer makes sense, as the old villain wasn't /really/ out for their own twisted version of what the main characters want, they were just pawns in a bigger game.
