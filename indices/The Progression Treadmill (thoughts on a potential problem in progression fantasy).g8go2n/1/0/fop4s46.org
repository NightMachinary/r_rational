I don't think it's a lack of a power cap that causes the problem. I think it's the lack of a plan. You can see very similar phenomena with "event fatigue" or stories that keep throwing out big reveals with no overarching plan.

As a case in point, /Burn Notice/. If you're unfamiliar, the story of /Burn Notice/ is that Michael Westen used to be a spy, but got burned by forces unknown, and is now trying to track them down. And then at the end of the first season he does that. But then in the second season, he discovers that there's another conspiracy. And then another one after that. And so on for seven seasons, until it becomes total absurd.

So the key is not to stop advancement, but to have some idea of what people are advancing /to/. You have to understand in advance what the end-state of the progression is, and write things so that getting there is satisfying. And my impression is that DBZ pretty much didn't do that at all. It just keeps not getting cancelled and they just keep making characters more powerful, without any overarching logic.
