Bear in mind that, if you're stuck living in an MMO, your life is an endless, tedious grind of going off and killing 12 Fnargbats to bring their hides to Old Auntie Gnome for middling XP. You're constantly traveling and facing danger and inflation's a total bitch. What happens when you finally climb to the top in such a world? You retire and take a quiet job as a town guard, and leave the battles with demon kings to the young punks.
