I think this kind of thinking is missing the forest for the trees. The reason progression fantasy gets stale is the same reason series where the status quo is God get stale. Except unlike those stories, which usually at least have a broad cast of characters that interact with each other, progoression fantasy is set up so that any excess narrative weight gets discarded, like alliances, characters, motivations, and everything else.

Relaged to that problem, we never see characters in situations where "punch problem to make it stop" is not a valid solution. Drought? Don't worry. Plague? Not in this story. Character conflict? You'll get to punch them later.
