  Relaged to that problem, we never see characters in situations where "punch problem to make it stop" is not a valid solution.

There's a webcomic, Strong Female Protagonist, that is explicitly about this. The main character retires from superheroing because she realizes that most of the world's problems are unpunchable, and the stories are mostly about her trying to figure out what she /should/ be doing with her tragically punching-centric powerset. Unfortunately it's been on hiatus for a long time and is probably dead.
