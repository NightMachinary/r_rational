  My issue with lack of power caps comes more from, what I already said and, how they remove some of my favorite parts and interesting situations I'd like to see explored in that world / magic system. I prefer nuanced creative uses of magic, rather than my number is higher / I trained harder / I have an OP gimmick so I win.

But don't you still get that dynamic for everyone below the power cap? Even if you can only go up to 10, you can still beat up someone who's an 8 by training more.

Ultimately, I don't think there's a setting-level way to avoid this kind of problem. If there's any power variance (and there always will be, even if it's just "I am the President and you are not"), there will always be underleveled opposition to fight. The author just has to be smart enough to realize that a story about a guy who goes around curb stomping everyone who gets in his way isn't very interesting, and opt to write a story about appropriately leveled opposition instead.
