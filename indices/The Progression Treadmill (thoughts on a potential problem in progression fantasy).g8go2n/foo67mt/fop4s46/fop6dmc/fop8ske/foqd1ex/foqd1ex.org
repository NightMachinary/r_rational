The problem isn't that there's variance and that people can have different levels of power, but more so that if there isn't a limit to individual power levels problems tend to rise up.

There are ways of making power scales where numbers still matter even when the difference isn't stupid like 10v1, where raw power isn't the defining factor in combat, where there can't be such a high difference in speed and response time between elites that most combatants become irrelevant..
