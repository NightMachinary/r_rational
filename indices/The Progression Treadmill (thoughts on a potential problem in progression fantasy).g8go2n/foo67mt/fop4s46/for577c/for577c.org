I think /Burn Notice/ works as an episodic show because it has one formula, the formula works, and it sticks to it without fail. Any given episode is a tightly plotted story with some action, some explosions, and some spy intrigue. The episodes are very formulaic, with Michael his pals bringing the same skills to the table each time, and in each episode you can generally rely on a twist or two followed by some improvisation. But it works because each time you get to wonder, /okay, how is Michael going to bluff his way out of this one?/ and it always manages to be entertaining. And every once in a while you'll get a Big Villain like Larry to spice things up, and on occasion it will have a nice way of tying in the overarching plot to the plot-of-the-episode.

I don't think the series' overarching plot is its strong point, and I also agree that it sometimes throws things out without a plan, as evidenced by some of its loose ends, but I disagree with your characterization of it as 'conspiracy behind a conspiracy', and I'd say each season generally moves the story forward with reasonable pacing. Season 1, Michael is out in the cold, know idea what's going on. Season 2, he's forced to work for the conspiracy. Season 3, he's rebuked their help, he's out in the cold again, trying to get back in with the gov. That blows up. Season 4 is somewhat similar to season 2, but he's more than just a grunt in the organization now, and he actually strikes a deadly blow against the conspiracy at the end. Time skip here, good decision, we don't have to sit through them working their way through every grunt of this org. Season 5-6, dealing with the very last man from this same conspiracy. This part has some good reveals in it, too. Season 7, new villains entirely, but now it's the government with their screws in Michael. I think this last season was the weakest, actually, and I also thought Tom Card was an uninteresting villain, but for seasons 1 - half of 6, Michael isn't dealing with a conspiracy-behind-a-conspiracy-behind... he's mostly just making actual progress clawing through one big conspiracy. The audience understands the end-goal: take down the conspiracy that burned Michael and get back in with the government. This /actually happens,/ and then we get a new goal: Michael is sick of this shit and starts talking about retiring with Fi, and Michael has to spend the last couple of seasons dealing with the obstacles towards that goal.
