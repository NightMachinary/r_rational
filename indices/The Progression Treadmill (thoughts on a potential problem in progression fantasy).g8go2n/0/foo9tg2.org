I think it's more that "power level" type stuff is a profoundly lazy way to set things up. I haven't watched much of DBZ, but from what I've seen of the combat a fight between the strongest people in the universe this week is (as you say) much the same as a fight between the strongest people in the universe two months ago. They grunt and float and teleport around punching, kicking, and launching big flashy orbs and rays of energy. We're just meant to understand that this week's big glowy ball represents ... more joules of spirit energy, I guess? They're moving faster, punching harder, and absorbing harder hits, but all this is under-the-hood because there's no way to depict that in a visually coherent way with a cartoon.

In RPG terms, they're using the same old techniques, but with higher stats. Good RPGs don't do that; they gradually introduce new abilities that expand your options and broaden gameplay. If a new DBZ enemy required a change in tactics, or if the main character acquired a remarkably different new ability, that would mix things up. It would also require considerably greater effort to pull off and keep going long-term, so they have power levels. Raising numbers is easy, and they don't even have to tell you what the numbers are in this case.
