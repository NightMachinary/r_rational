Well, in this chapter Emma said there's a field followed by a possible forest. The binoculars should help figure out what's immediately outside the wall. For the world, apparently they're going to use secret messenges from that author to figure out what to do.

So I assume with these things being mentioned this chapter, the author has some idea of where the story is going to go after they escape.
