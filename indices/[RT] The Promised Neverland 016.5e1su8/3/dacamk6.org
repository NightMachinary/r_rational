I keep going to check the latest edition of Jump magazine, which is available in every conbini around where I live, and I can never see any sign of this manga. Where are they coming from?? To be fair, I can't read Japanese very well, and there do seem to be about 20 different titles in each edition, so I might just be missing it.
