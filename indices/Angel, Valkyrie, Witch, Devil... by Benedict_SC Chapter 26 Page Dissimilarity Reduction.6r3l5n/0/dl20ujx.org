In this chapter we learn that courts have a higher requisite for evidence and that groups of similar thinking people can decide on a idea based on emotional reasoning. Good thing robo-monk is here to save the day, at least until the resident time traveler gives a vague enough warning that renders all the evidence talk unnecessary.

Benedict , I have to say letting the group be swayed by their friends warning is character consistent but not rational consistent. I can understand if you're pushing for plot advancement over detailed discussion though.
