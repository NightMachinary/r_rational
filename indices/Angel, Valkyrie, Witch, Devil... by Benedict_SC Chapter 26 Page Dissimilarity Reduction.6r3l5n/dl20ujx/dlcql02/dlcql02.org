That's pretty much exactly the fight I had with myself while writing the chapter. They /don't/ have a lot of hard evidence, and should be looking at this more carefully. (I think they /do/ have enough evidence to promote it as a hypothesis and justify an intelligence-gathering mission.) I was going to get into a whole thing with using Athena to figure out if Sombra was trying to trick them, but I was having trouble figuring out how to structure that with Athena's panic shutdown- and eventually realized I could just short-circuit that scene with some time travel stuff I needed to set up anyway.

Like you said, I ultimately decided to push for character-consistent plot advancement over rationality-consistent detailed discussion- that kind of thing is why I don't describe AVWD as rationalfic. (Nonetheless, it inevitably shows up on this subreddit because of the material it deals with and the people that read my work.)

That said, the discussion isn't totally over, yet- there's an upcoming chapter wherein they need to convince /Symmetra/ to help them with the mission, which is going to require a considerably more careful analysis of the Lakshmi hypothesis. Mercy's also going to get a chance to weigh in, and should notice some flaws in the reasoning that were predictably overlooked by a room full of keyed-up Gryffindors.
