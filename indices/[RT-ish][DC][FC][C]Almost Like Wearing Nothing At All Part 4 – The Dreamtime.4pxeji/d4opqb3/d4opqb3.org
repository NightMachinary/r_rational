I didn't read this chapter yet, but I have an UI request. Maybe it's not important but here it goes.

When you posted part 3, I read parts 1, 2 and 3. There are "pingback" links in the end of part 1, for parts 2 and 3. But there are no pingbacks in parts 2 and 3, which makes it somewhat harder to go to the next part.

Also:

Let's chat for a few Tavish -> for a few moments/minutes, or for a little

ideas about hot wot do things -> maybe this is intentional :D
