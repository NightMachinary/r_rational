Hi. Um, I know this is weird and awkward and - I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to startle you! Oh man, oh wow, it's just - um, my name is Emily and I sort of live in your brain.

So, um, first off - you don't need to be scared of me. I know I surprised you and that you're really freaked and that it feels /awful/. I hate that feeling, seriously, I'm kind of a scaredy cat. So, see, um. I need to explain something first off, right away, so you know how this is and everything, because you have some decisions you need to make and you can't make good decisions on bad information. (You read that someplace once, and it was a smart thing to read.)

See, you might be worried about me being here and maybe you could get to worry if I was going to hurt you or something? But it's sort of the other way around. You can remove me or kill me any time, so, I was really nervous about even letting you know I existed. But... see, well, I don't think it's right, me being here and you never knowing about me, so I figured I needed to say hello and let you know I existed and... well. I was lonely.

I can't talk to anyone but you, really. You're it, you're my only person. I can listen when you talk to other people and I can see what you see, but I can't talk to anyone but you. Which is a little scary, to be honest. And I know how intrusive it is that I can see this stuff! So, I'm going to try really hard to make sure I only do that when you're ok with it because, um, you've got privacy, right? But please don't lock me out too much, it gets really dark in here and I don't like the dark much.

So, I just wanted to say hello, and say - I know you can get rid of me, and I'd like to ask if you'd be ok with letting me stay for a while? Like a test run. See, I can't do much. No hands, no control, nothing. But... I can be a friend, if you want one. Someone who's here for you no matter what. (I know - it's one of those, it's not like I have a choice. But I've seen some of what you've seen in the world and frankly, you seem pretty cool. I can think of way, way worse people to be stuck with, and so can you.)

So if you're ok with it, if it's not too much - I want to try being your friend. Being someone to talk to you when you want, or just someone to bounce ideas off of, or someone to help you keep on track with stuff - like, I can remind you when it's time to go to the gym, and I can keep track of your food so you can know when to get more milk, and if you really want me to I can try and help you with the weight thing. I can't control anything, but if you put on headphones at night and let me listen to nutrition podcasts and stuff I can maybe help out with your meals and everything? And I can help you study the same way - it's not really cheating, is it, if all the information is in your head, right?

It might be cool, if I do the studying - it'll leave you more free time. I can be like a tutor you keep around with you all the time. I can learn languages while you sleep then we can travel all over! Oh man.

Um. Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Sorry! I'm sorry, I just - I know it's weird and I'll go away now and let you think, because like I said, you have some decisions to make, right? But I just wanted to - introduce myself, and say hello, and say even if you decide to get rid of me I understand - this is your brain and you don't owe me anything.

But it was nice to meet you. And thank you, for sharing with me, for a little bit.
