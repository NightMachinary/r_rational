Well, you don't really have the option of using the “defect” button because your host holds all the cards; you can't do anything without them, they can get rid of you but not vice versa and you don't have anything to offer them besides being a conversation partner.

You're basically a boxed AI, except you're not a superintelligence and your host doesn't even have the /option/ of letting you out the box.
