So when you start out with little power, do what you can-noticing things, being an alarm so they don't miss events, anything you can do. As they begin to trust their internal voice, keep pretending to be the internal voice and make "cravings" subconscious noises (wouldn't that something healthy be tasty now) to cement you are "good". Slowly shift this to whatever it is you need. Slow and steady wins the race.
