- 1. You play as a harmless growth that has appeared on an adult person's brain.

  - 1.1. If given the opportunity, you'll eventually increase to a certain size and stop developing any further.
  - 1.2. For whatever reason, this encroachment of your “body” into your host's brain's real estate wouldn't damage your host's brain\mind.
  - 1.3. To be able to grow to your full size and potential (#3.), you'll need your host to consume certain substances that to a regular person would've been quite toxic.

- 2. When you appear (that is, appear in your “level 1” size and develop your own consciousness), your host becomes aware of you and the connection between their mind and yours.

  - 2.1. You have access to all the data that your host gets from their senses.
  - 2.2. You and your host can communicate with each other, exchanging verbalised messages and pockets of larger data.

- 3. In your fully developed state, your mind will have its own “computational power” that is independent from that of your host's brain and roughly equal to the capabilities of a baseline adult human mind.

  - 3.1. Other than that (and if we ignore #1.2. and #1.3.) you don't have any superpowers or paranormal qualities.

1. How do you convince your host that you do not pose any threat to them, and that they do not have to surgically get rid of you, etc?
2. How can you and your host benefit the most from your unique position, use it as a unique competitive edge over other people, etc?
