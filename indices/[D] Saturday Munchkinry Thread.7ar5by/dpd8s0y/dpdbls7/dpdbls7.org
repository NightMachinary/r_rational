If you've ever played a tabletop role-playing game in the tradition of D&D, you'll know there are rules. And there is a sort of player who, while never at any point actually breaking the written rules, nonetheless ends up with a character doing three times as much damage as anyone else despite being a level behind.

That is munchkinning - being absurdly powerful and/or effective without actually breaking the rules (but you can totally bend them, depending how well you can talk the GM into it)
