This one is tricky to munchkin. One minor thing is that you could use this as a weight loss trick, just find something that scares the shit out of you and lose fat (and unfortunately muscle) tissue directly.

Does this ability work if you clone parts of your body using your DNA? If so, then with a bit of future tech this could potentially be a useful component in some kind of automated terraforming scheme. You can convert whatever growth medium you need to grow cultured meat (+ sweat glands) with your dna into living breathing organisms.

And.. that's as far as I got. Presumably the spiders come with all sorts of bacteria that can decompose the dead spiders bodies, but the problem is that you need to have fatty tissue already available in order to create the spiders and I can't figure out a way to use this were it wouldn't be better to just use the fat as biomass directly.

There is one species of spiders that are herbivores and I know some spiders eat other spiders, so in theory you could be able to set up an ecosystem this way, but that requires that you have the entire plant population set up already, in which case it shouldn't be that much effort to just import a bunch of animals from earth to begin with.
