damnit i forgot about this thread i wanted to post this idea maybe next week

anyway:

your power is that all your fear sweat is spiders.

clarifications:

- just your fear sweat not your exercise sweat, and if you exercise and then get scared the only sweat that becomes spiders is that which is directly attributable to the exercise not the fear

- the size of spiders is basically the entire spider size continuum. the number of spiders is proportional to their size

- spiders do not come out of nowhere but instead build on your fat or muscle or tissue reserves, but do weigh more than sweat you otherwise would have sweated out

- you are immune to any venom the spiders have but don't have control over them
