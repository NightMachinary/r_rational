  Pretty sure OP was hinting this method would not work.

Cloning people should work, provided they are fully sentient. What I think wouldn't work is trying to engineer a situation where something can say the command without being sentient (thereby giving you a moral method to get a limitless supply of breaths).

Since the person you are responding to is clearly willing to cross several moral event horizons on his path to world domination, that shouldn't be a problem.
