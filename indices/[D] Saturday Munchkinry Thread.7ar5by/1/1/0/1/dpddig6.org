  Mass awaken tiny objects that float in the air, like plant spores or iron sand. Command them to fly into the lungs of all enemy humans (basically everyone but you and your slaves) and then rip their lungs to shreds from the inside.

You'd need /a lot/ of breath to pull this of. Even if one plant spore is enough to kill a person and you only need single digit number of breaths to awaken it, that's billions of clones that you need to grow until they are old enough to give up their breath.

I guess you have time, given that you are ageless, but it seems like someone is going to notice your secret facilities eventually.
