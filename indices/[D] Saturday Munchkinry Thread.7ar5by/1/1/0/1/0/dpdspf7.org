Good point. After giving it some thought, I realized I was being silly, there's a much faster way to take over the world.

Step 2) Craft a power suit for yourself, where the power source is breaths rather than electricity. Since objects can be awakened to move telekinetically, it should be possible to give them commands like "don't move when hit", effectively rendering you immune to physical attacks since they stop the force from going through and reaching your body. It should also be possible to give commands like "stay at room temperature". After all, heat is essentially just vibration, so telekinetically controlling the rate of vibration should be able to set the amount of heat.

Best of all, your power suit can probably be made entirely out of cloth, so it doesn't look intimidating and you can walk around without people screaming in terror.

Never ever take off the power suit. Your 2000+ breaths from step 1 should make you immune to hygiene issues.

Step 3) Claim to have the ability to temporarily resurrect the recently dead (because you do) once a week (so you don't get swarmed and drained of all your breaths). After doing so a few times for free to prove that you can, you can now start auctioning your weekly resurrection, getting filthy rich. Your power suit from step 2 and your 2000+ breaths from step 1 will help fend off any assassination attempts.

Step 4) Now that you are more or less immortal and have a method for generating large amounts of money, sooner or later you will have enough money to dominate the world economy. Dominating the world itself is then fairly easy, seeing as you can throw tons of bribes around and assassinate anyone you don't like with lung-shredding nanomachines. This is the point in time when you should set up your secret facilities, since you now have the money to build them and bribe people into ignoring them.
