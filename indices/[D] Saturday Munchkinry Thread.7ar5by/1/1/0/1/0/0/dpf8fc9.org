  Craft a power suit for yourself, where the power source is breaths rather than electricity. Since objects can be awakened to move telekinetically, it should be possible to give them commands like "don't move when hit", effectively rendering you immune to physical attacks since they stop the force from going through and reaching your body.

That should work, though there is a limit to the strength of awakened objects so they might not be able to stop (high calibre) bullets. It definitely does work against melee weapons though (if I remember correctly there are people in the books using awakened cloaks to catch swords and punches). Maybe have some kind of shawl with metal plates woven in that jumps into place to protect you from gunfire?

  It should also be possible to give commands like "stay at room temperature". After all, heat is essentially just vibration, so telekinetically controlling the rate of vibration should be able to set the amount of heat.

Don't know about this, there might well be some limit to the amount of precision with which an awakened object can control its movement.

Stacking up awakened objects for personal protection seems like a decent plan regardless and the rest of your plan seems sound (provided lifeless remember enough of their past lives to put on a convincing show, I don't remember if it ever comes up what memories they keep exactly). I don't know if you can get to world dominating levels of money with it, though it should definitely make acquiring breaths a lot easier and in the later stages it should help keep your secret facilities secret.
