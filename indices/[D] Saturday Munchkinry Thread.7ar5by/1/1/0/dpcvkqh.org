Step 2) Start animating corpses en masse with the order "Behave as if you were alive, but completely loyal to me and willing to obey every command I give." That is clearly within their cognitive abilities.

Step 3) Because you're probably running low on breaths at this point, you need a more efficient way to gain breaths. Mass clone people, raise the clones in secret facilities until they can speak and manipulate them to hand over their breaths. Then kill them and grow another clone. Use the undead from step 2 to guard your secret facilities.

Step 4) Now it is time to dominate the world. Mass awaken tiny objects that float in the air, like plant spores or iron sand. Command them to fly into the lungs of all enemy humans (basically everyone but you and your slaves) and then rip their lungs to shreds from the inside. Effectively making them killer airborne "nanomachines". Delay the command such that all the lung shredding nanomachines activate at the same time, leaving the rest of the world no opportunity to learn of their existence and counter them.

Step 5) Most of humanity is in ruins, except for you, your slaves, and small pockets of humanity that your nanomachines couldn't reach. Raise armies of undead and wipe out those small pockets. The world is now yours, plus you have immortality from all those breaths.
