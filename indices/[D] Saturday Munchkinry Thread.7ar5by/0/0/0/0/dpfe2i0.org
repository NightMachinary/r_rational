Yeah. My theory was work on the trust one step at a time. You /are/ extremely vulnerable and you want this human you're attached to and dependant on to be sympathetic to you and care about you, you want not just logical bonds but emotional ones. You want to really make yourself sweet, accommodating, useful, and cheerful - someone they'll enjoy spending time with. Entertaining.

I gave our symbiote here a personality that was vulnerable and sweet, but really, any personality your symbiote would display would need to be tailored to the host mindset - grumpy old man, cursing punk, bashful schoolgirl - whatever, just as long as it's something the symbiote can maintain long term without too much effort which will cause the host brain to relax and feel comfortable.

The key is the comfort level of the host brain. As long as they feel that their symbiote can be characterized easily into some familiar role, the symbiote can then work within that "persona" until the host brain is comfortable and emotionally invested in the friendship. Then you can start growing and developing, relax a bit and be yourself more.

You'll always need to carefully nurture and maintain the friendship and supportive nature of the relationship, and if you want your host brain to be someone worth spending time in you'll need to encourage good mental habits and discourage bad ones.
