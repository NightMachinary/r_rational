Yeah, this seems like the best approach, just be honest and open about stuff. There is a chance that your host is going to think they are becoming delusional and have you removed anyway, but if you get them to listen to you you should be able to come up with some kind of test that proves you are an independent mind (listening to a podcast while your host is focussed on reading something, for instance).

Once they are convinced you are not a figment of their imagination, you still have to convince them that you are not a threat and aren't, for instance, going to take control after a while. Game theoretically you really have no way of doing this, but telling them how to remove you should count in your favour. Beyond that, just be empathic, try to get them to see that you are a person too and that you are on their side.

Probably also hold of on mentioning that you need them to eat toxic stuff in order to reach your full potential for a while.
