Since the host doesn't know you are a growth in their brain they are rather unlikely to even think of removing you unless you do something stupid like telling them what you are. So if you host hears you talking to them they will almost certainly just think they're crazy, which wouldn't negatively impact you /that/ strongly since it doesn't impact you.

Anyway the path of least resistance here would probably be to just incessantly nag your host until they try a small amount of the toxic material you need to grow. Once they've tried it and found it didn't hurt them you can almost certainly nag them into eating enough of it for you to reach full size.

Once you've succeeded at getting to full size you could probably make your host a minor celebrity by demonstrating tricks like being able to demonstrate amazing multitasking ability far beyond what even a split brain patient could hope to achieve.\\
This is of course assuming at full development you don't have any different mental abilities than a normal human, and can't say do things that a human level AGI could do. If you could do things like that then you could demonstrate a litany of vastly more impressive abilities.
