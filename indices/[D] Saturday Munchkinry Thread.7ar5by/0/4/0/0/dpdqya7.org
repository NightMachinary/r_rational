I think our first disagreement is just about definitions of what's regular/magic.

Do I have access to the non-episodic memories of my host, such as what a table is?

If my host sits down at a computer and writes as I dictate, and out come compiling programs, that would have been strong evidence that I have previous memories.

What is my explanation for knowing those substances wouldn't be as toxic to my host as to a regular person?
