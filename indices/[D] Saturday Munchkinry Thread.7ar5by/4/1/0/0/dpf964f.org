Depends on how the power tells fear sweat and exercise sweat apart. If it is just about which hormones trigger the sweat glands we might get away with just injecting those hormones into the cloned tissue. If it is the actual experience of fear then we're probably out of luck.

Maybe you can give a different animal a skin graft with cloned skin that has your DNA? It's definitely animal abuse and not really good for any practical purpose, but a pig that starts spawning spiders when it's scared should be hilarious to see.
