Are we assuming that we are Thor and have control over the hammer? Because then it doesn't even need to be munchkined, it's just plain overpowered with no need to be clever. If there are no upper bounds on the mass and momentum then you can destroy literally anything by just choosing a sufficiently large momentum [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/][see xkcd description of relativistic baseball]].

You basically have an infinite source of kinetic and gravitational potential energy. Aside from infinite combat ability, you can generate electricity by building a generator that can generate massive amounts of power from gravitational potential energy. Just give it low mass, raise it up high, and then increase the mass and let it push down to make a wheel spin and/or raise other weights that can be used to store potential energy for later (since the hammer requires manual labor to move, but can accomplish unlimited work while being used.)

I don't think the actual Thor hammer has truly unlimited range on its attributes, or else Thor would be able to single-highhandedly defeat any enemy with a physical body with a single hit (one punch man anyone?) but this description does, and is completely overpowered.
