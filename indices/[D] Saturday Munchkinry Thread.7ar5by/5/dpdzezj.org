You are a [tinker]{[[http://worm.wikia.com/wiki/Tinker]]} which is a human who have the ability to create beyond-our-world technology only within a specific niche. Technology created by tinkers requires maintenance and as such works poorly for mass production.

Your niche allows you to combine up to three pieces of modern day non-tinker technology or equiptment. Here technology is unfortunately not explicitly defined but generally requires some ammount of what the general populance considers science. Examples include wodden floors, anything running on electricity(and no that doesn't include the brain), sword, armor, chloroform, drugs, isolated protein, but does not include origami.

The power is so broad that my mind is having difficulties really munchkinning it. I am interested in general munchkinning in addition to figuring out if we can make inventions that can

- Stop natural death.
- Generate money.
- Skyrocket fighting powers
- Find people we want to find, including people we haven't met.
- Teleport.
- Store brain electronically and upload to new body in case of death.
- Dominate the world
- Solve world hunger.

Examples of previously created gear includes

- boots+jetpack: Boots that can fly ironman style.
- Glasses+x-ray equipment: Light-weight glasses that can use x-ray(unfortunately not superman x-ray).
- Nitrous Oxide+a wooden floor+coke: wooden floor that secretes gas that is addictive and makes you laugh
- Ibuprofen+Erythroprotein+Adrennaline: Can bring someone back from the brink of death and into a frenzied berserker that for a short time.
