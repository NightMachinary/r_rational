  The power is so broad that my mind is having difficulties really munchkinning it.

The broadness is exactly /why/ it's so easy to munchkin. Just combine say some sort of machine that is involved with genetic engineering with a 3d printer and say a computer that is specced for some sort of coding that would count as specializing code for your own purposes or something (just use anything that could be said to "customize" something). Do something like that and boom you can 3d print anything biological, so 3d print an army of superhuman ubermensch and take over the world.

Or for instance combine a FMRI with a printer/scanner. Now you can upload simulations of people. These copies could then be transferred onto a supercomputer you then combine the EM's with different AI to get a humanlike GAI that tries to maximize your utility function, is extremely fast/efficient and can self improve in a way a normal upload couldn't.

Then combine some robot capable of limited self replication (in only very limited environments) with a upload created previously and some piece of nanotech. Boom you've got self replicating nanobots with a GAI loaded onto them, at which point you win.

This is of course just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to exploits. However technology that lets you customize biology/nanotech or mess with intelligence is uniquely suited for massive exploitation so if you want to take over the world relatively quickly that's probably what you go with.\\
Ooh another exploit: Combine combine one of those cockroach mind control rigs with say a transcranial stimulation device and a radio antenna and now you can transmit mind control waves.
