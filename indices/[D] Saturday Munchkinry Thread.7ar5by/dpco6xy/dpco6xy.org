The immortality of Henrietta Lacks. HeLa cell lines have been used for many, many experiments. Due to bad laboratory technique and very creative attempts to get around the restrictions on fetal stem cells a very.. interesting cell line arises. Attempts are replicating it are shockingly difficult, but it is.. usable, as is, if you are willing to put up with some rather amusing side effects.

Anyone injected with a sufficient dose of HeLa Omega gains a omnipresent population of youthful .. and highly invasive, stem cells. Any part of your body which is not functioning properly will over the course of the years be replaced by Henrietta Lacks.

Basically, you can have eternal youth and full (although slow. You are not wolverine. Regrowing a leg would take years) regeneration if you do not mind the process turning you into a moderately attractive black woman.

Neural architecture is mostly preserved, although subjects do report and are confirmed by testing to have far, far higher plasticity than any adult on record. For a couple of years, at least. This extends to preferences otherwise not subject to change, and is suspected to be the main reason male subjects do not experience extreme dysmorphia.

What are the consequences of this?
