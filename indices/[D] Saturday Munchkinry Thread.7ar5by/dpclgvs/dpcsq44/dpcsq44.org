Step 1) Go to a third-world country or somewhere with lots of poor people. Offer them money to give you breath (without telling them how giving you breath actually affects them). You don't even need a lot of money to do this, since there are plenty of poor starving people everywhere who would gladly say "My life to yours, my Breath become yours" for 10 dollars (since they don't know about the magic system). $20000 dollars later, you now have 2000 breaths. With more bargaining, you can probably get more souls for cheaper.

Step 2 later, gtg for now.
