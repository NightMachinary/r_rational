  Lifeless still decay, it would be tough to get them to pass as normal people.

Not even in full body armor covering them from head-to-toe?

  The world would quickly realize that zombies are real and on the loose, and would start hunting down your "armies"
#+end_quote

But they aren't infectious, brain-dead or even aggressive. Why would they think "zombie" or think to "hunt them down"? To them, the undead just look like heavily injured, but otherwise sentient people.

  Pretty sure OP was hinting this method would not work.

  there are people happily selling their breath in the book
#+end_quote

If people can sell their breaths, it is obviously possible to trick them into giving you their breaths. Just promise them riches if they give you their breath, and then don't pay up. Same thing with the children, brainwash them from young to think that giving you their breath is a great privilege.

  Plus, last I checked, we don't currently have the technology to raise clone armies.
#+end_quote

Actually we do, just not from artificial wombs. We already have the technology to clone embryos, so all you need are surrogate mothers. Which would mean you need to kidnap lots of people if the undead can't be surrogate mothers. So I guess that's a problem.

  Does it count as world domination if everyone else is dead?
#+end_quote

Not everyone! Your slaves are still alive! As in, the children raised in your secret facilities. You can leave some alive for whatever purposes you desire.
