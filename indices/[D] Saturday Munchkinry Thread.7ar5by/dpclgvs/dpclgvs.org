Let's munchkin biochromatic breath, from Brandon Sandersons Warbreaker.

Possibly redundant spoiler warning: This post will contain spoilers for the book Warbreaker.

*Breath*

Each person is born with one biochromatic breath and the ability to give that breath away if they choose to do so, this requires physical contact and a spoken command ('My life to yours, my Breath become yours'). It's not explicit from the text, but since it needs to be done willingly I'm assuming using this command requires sentience (just to put a damper on any embryo farming suggestions).

People without breath have a slightly weakened immune system, a slightly lessened ability to feel happiness and colours appear slightly faded to them. It should be noted that, despite the gravity implied by the command, all of these downsides are pretty minor and there are people happily selling their breath in the book, though there are others that are horrified at the thought.

If you acquire more than one breath you get an aura that makes colours appear very slightly more vibrant around you. Any breaths that you acquire beyond your first increases the intensity of this aura as well as your general health and life expectancy. In addition, at certain thresholds (called heightenings) you gain additional abilities. These are detailed [[https://coppermind.net/wiki/Heightening][here]], but they are largely not super interesting for munchkinery. The one exception is that at the fifth heightening, 2000 breaths, you become ageless and immune to disease, poison and most other physical ailments.

*Awakening*

Breath can be used to awaken inanimate objects to move around and perform a single command. This command needs to be a short spoken sentence and has a complexity limit that is related to the awakeners ability to visualize what the object needs to do.

Uttering the command temporarily stores a number of breaths inside the object and drains some colour from other nearby objects, turning them grey. Breaths stored in an object can be retrieved by the person that awakened it at any time, but the change in colour is permanent.

For people without the sixth heightening there is some experimentation involved in figuring out which commands work and which don't (more so for complicated commands). Awakened objects have some limited awereness of their surroundings and a limited ability to process information. One of the simplest commands, 'grab things', makes a piece of rope or cloth wrap itself around the first thing it touches that isn't the awakener, but more complicated commands like 'fetch keys' and 'upon call, become my fingers and grip' are also possible.

The amount of breaths needed to awaken something is inversely proportional to the similarity between the shape and material of an awakened object and that of a living thing; Bone is easier to awaken than cloth and a piece of cloth cut in the shape of a puppet is easier to awaken than a handkerchief.

*Lifeless*

Animating corpses is a special case. It requires only one breath and creates a lifeless (read: zombie) that has all the abilities it had in life and executes one command to the best of its ability. Unlike an awakened object, commands used to create a lifeless have no complexity limit other than the cognitive abilities of the body in question. This means that commands like 'Follow every order that starts with <insert password here>' are possible.

The lifeless will not be able to execute a command it does not understand and although its internal organs do not need to function, it will stop functioning when it gets damaged or decayes beyond a certain point. The other mayor downside to using lifeless is that the breath used to awaken them cannot be extracted, it is lost forever.

*Munchkinery*

Let's assume that this magic system suddenly becomes active on earth. Everyone is able to use it, but you are the only person to know about it initially. What do you do?
