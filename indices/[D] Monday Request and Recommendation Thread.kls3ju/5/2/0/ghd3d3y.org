For some reason, I couldn't get past the very first chapter (after the prologue) on this one for, like, the past year or even longer. There have been five instances where I tried to start reading but couldn't progress. My eyes glazed over the page.

I really, /really/ want to read this one, it's been recommended to me very often, and I love the premise---but I am simply /unable to/.
