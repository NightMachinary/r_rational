Saga of soul is a magical girl story, a type of media that involves young kids, usually girls, with magical powers, a costumed transformation, and fighting villains of some variety or another; there's some overlap with superhero fiction, but they're distinct. Saga of Soul in specific is a magical girl story with additional emphasis placed on coherent worldbuilding and, if not physical lausibility, at least physical coherence. The core idea is that the MC, Eriko, has a near death experience and returns from her coma with the ability to use magic to create portals, matter, and a few other specifically outlined effects. There's also a strong rational adjacent aesthetic in both the world itself and the main character.

In Memoriam is a massive AU of the world of A Certain Scientific Index. It has some fantastic worldbuilding and characters, particularly on the magic side, which was (especially early on) a really weak and uninteresting story arc for ToAru, while being obviously recognizable as the same setting with similar rules, albeit with less reliance on bad techno- and magibabble. Characters make creative use of abilities and work intelligently to acheive their goals.
