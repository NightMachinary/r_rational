I had it on my mental to-read list but not the digital one. Thanks for reminding me, added it to the latter as well.

Unfortunately, I'm a bit burned out on large stories for a moment. I usually look for ones with /more/ than 300k words, but a stressful month left me wanting something I can consume in one sitting with a slice of pizza in one hand.

Thank you very much for your reply!
