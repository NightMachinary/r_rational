Sounds very interesting. Unfinished works do not scare me, but bad translations do, unfortunately. I know a bit of Japanese, but not enough to read LNs in the original language. Well, I can always try DeepL---nowadays it's better than amateur translators for sure.

I've read some of it aaaall the way back when it first started to come out, in 2012 or so, and by now I'm thoroughly tired of it, sorry.

I don't mind such plagiarizing in free web content, but putting it into an LN is a dick move for sure. I might give this one a try anway, the premise sounds mildly intriguing.

Thank you very much!
