If you're down with LNs of questionable quality, I can add a few more recs.

Ouroboros Record has been slowly translated for years now. MC gets isekai'd as a noble's kid in a darker than average fantasy world, with his only pick-up from the experience being vague and horrific memories of what his soul felt throughout the process, instead of any "cheat skills." Said experience gives him an incredible phobia of death and the singular ambition of doing research into finding immortality, so as to never experience that process again. It's a good change of pace to have an single-minded protag, instead of generic isekai harem+demonking-slaying schlock, although the protagonist is decidedly evil, to the point of making inroads into Josef Mengele-esque territory. Also, the first arc is an intro, then there's a very short second arc where the perspective shifts to an pseudo-police investigator looking into the stuff the protag got up to when he went to school by doing a few interviews, and it's a bit of an awkward interlude before everything goes back to normal.

Translation quality and speed is mediocre. Chapters are decently long, there's about 40 done so far, and there's about another 40 chapters worth of content to go. It got printed from a web novel into 3 light novel volumes that got sold by a small time publisher without making a splash, and then the author vanished into thin air a few years back, so even if the novel does some things that are reasonably interesting, it's not going to be finished. That said, it's still probably sticking on your "to read" list, just at the bottom...

Overlord is good, there's a reason it's got several anime seasons, some spin-off content and ended up on lists of best selling Light Novels. That said, the anime gets worse past the first season and you're much better off just reading all the light novels instead. The author is a bit weird, he loves character creation arguably too much, several of the novels have different protagonists instead of the "main character." Out of 14 novels, 4 of them are mostly told by other characters (volumes 4, 7, and 12+13). It's a more unique and novel method than it is particularly good tbh, I mean volume 4 is about a lizardman hero uniting a bunch of disconnected lizardman villages to fight against the invasion my the actual main character and his forces, before they get absolutely stomped, volume 7 is about several teams of adventurers (and one team as the protagonists more or less) sent to check out the main character's base, a tomb that has suddenly appeared in a previously massive and empty plains months earlier, before they all get slaughtered and the main character uses the 'invasion' as a casus belli for his army/country to invade the country that sent the adventurers (after being manipulated to do that in the first place), volumes 12 and 13 are better, because Neia is best girl, but the story is about the main character having one of his top advisors round up a bunch of monsters to attack another country while disguised, demolish half of it, then for the main character himself to step in, fight off the horde, and save the day. The protagonist, Neia, was a squire to a paladin order who gets handed the role of escort/watcher for the main character because she's the least useful member of the paladins, and she basically starts a religion centred around the main character that becomes a significant power in her home country by the end of the two novels. All the characters have their contribution to the world and story, but they generally end up in the background at best once their novel/s are over. Also the fan translations are better than the official ones.

Dungeon Defense is interesting, it's kinda like a crossover between Code Geass and Overlord. I read the 5 light novels or so ages back, but apparently they took a different direction from the webnovel so there's technically two stories there. It's pretty good, but the author disappeared after it came out a bunch of the speeches from the webnovel (not the light novel though?) were plagiarised from famous speakers, thinkers and philosophers. Whether or not that's a deal breaker is up to you, I'll probably do a light novel reread or webnovel read once I've worked through most of my more pressing reads, because it's still one of the better amateur web/light novels out there, even if the author's pretty much a twat.
