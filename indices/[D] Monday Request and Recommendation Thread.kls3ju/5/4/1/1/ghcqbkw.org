Yeah I feel the same about Shade-touched. I guess it might be because of the lack of concrete goal besides "learn more stuff" again and again?

A Journey of Black and Red is on Royalroad and pretty solid, I'd lump it with Superminion in terms of my enjoyment (which is probs a bit higher than your enjoyment, but eh).

Humble Life of a Skill Trainer is about a LitRPG teacher (not an isekai tho), Delve is isekai LitRPG with more math than normal, I Don't Want to be the Hive Queen is an "isekai'd into a monster cut off from civilisation" story, Menocht Loop is a "grow magic in time loop" story that skips the first 4 years of groundwork study and gets into the Actual Events. All those stories on Royalroad I would say are worth at least trying.

There's not much I'd super-recommend right now that isn't already widely known in this subreddit. My strongest recommendation would be for There Is Nothing To Fear, but that's Harry Potter fanfic so your mileage may vary.
