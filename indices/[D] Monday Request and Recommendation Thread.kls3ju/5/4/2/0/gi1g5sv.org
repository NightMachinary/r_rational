Sadly, I don't have /that/ much more with nonhuman MC's. It's pretty niche for some reason, and a lot of stories that do it abandon it eventually for reasons I'll never comprehend.

Are you interested in hearing more of my recommendations anyway, not on the basis of nonhuman characters, but instead on the basis of us maybe enjoying the same sort of writing styles?
