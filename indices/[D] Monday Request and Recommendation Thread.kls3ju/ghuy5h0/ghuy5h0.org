So. A gamer/system/progression fiction is a thing. A very large thing. I have realized that one of the things about it that vexes me the most is that it is just about all heavy on the soloing.... Which is just wrong, and not true to the games that obviously inspired all of this, so can anyone think of any good examples that.. Do not do this? Have an actual adventuring party instead?
