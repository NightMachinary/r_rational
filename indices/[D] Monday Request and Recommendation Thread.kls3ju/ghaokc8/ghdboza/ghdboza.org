If it weren't for length, I'd reccomend Luminosity. It's one of Alicorn's best works and seems to fit in with the ones you liked, but it's 200k words and has another 200k sequel.

You might like Saga of Soul, but it updates very infrequently.

You've probably seen branches on the tree of time if you've seen metropolitan man, but in case you haven't its very good too.

In Memoriam by Shockz hasn't been reccomended here in a while, but it still stands up. I've heard mixed things about how easy it is to get without being familiar with Raildex already, but if you are it's definitely a read and only about 80k.

Unfortunately, most of the stories I'd reccomend based on what you seem to like are either dead or way more over your cap, so hopefully at least one of these is what you're looking for.
