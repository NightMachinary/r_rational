I really want to ask for recommendations, but I can't really choose a specific trope or genre to ask for---there's too much of a variety in fun stuff I have found on this subreddit.

So instead, here's some works commonly recommended here I liked, found okay, and didn't like.

The works I *liked*:

- HPMoR

- /Cordyceps/

- /Mud's Mission/

- /The Metropolitan Man/

- Maybe /Octo/, though it's too early to tell

The works I found *okay*:

- /The Erogamer/ (I prefer it to everything else on this sublist, but not enough to put into the category above)

- /Mother of Learning/ (I enjoyed chapters ~20--~80 a lot but didn't like the rest)

- /Super Minion/

- /The World As It Appears To Be/, /Dave Scum/, and other works by Benedict_SC that are not /Cordyceps/

- The /Antimemetics Division/ series on SCP

- /Chili and the Chocolate Factory: Fudge Revelation/

The works I *didn't like*:

- /Time Braid/ (I enjoyed it more than everything else on the sublist, but the demon stuff was too much of a turn-off for me)

- /This Is How You Lose A Time War/ (I really wanted to like it but got bored to tears half-way through)

- /Baru Cormorant/

- /Never Die Twice/

- /The Waves Arisen/ (probably the only dislike on the list in the category "I regret reading it")

I couldn't get through the first few chapters of such works as /Purple Days/ and /Onwards to Providence/ because of the overwhelming number of grammar mistakes in former's case and typos in latter's.

I'm looking for something available for free online, but I won't mind published books and such.

The only restriction is that it should be medium length: not above 150k words but not short enough for its ideas to feel underdeveloped.

*Edit*: Some elaboration on the list.

"Liked" are basically the works I tend to randomly get positive thoughts about. They are stories I come back to in my mind, which inspire me and bring enjoyment long after I finished reading them.

"Okay" are those I enjoyed reading but feel entirely neutral towards after I finished reading them.

"Didn't like" are the works I didn't enjoy reading, no matter how I feel about them now.

Some examples of why I liked/okay-ed/disliked something:

Liked:

- HPMoR: I loved the characters, especially Harry, Hermione, and Quirrell, but almost all secondary characters as well. I found the plot to be very tight and gripping, and writing to be competent. It's also very funny when it wants to be. I didn't like the ending when it first came out and still stand by this opinion to this day, but I mellowed out and consider it to be merely unsatisfactory now.

- /Mud's Mission/: I greatly enjoyed how inhuman MC is portrayed and found his antics to be very fun to follow because of that.

Okay:

- /The Erogamer/: The meta (both metaphysical and meta-story) shenanigans are incredible, and the character writing is very solid. I found the beginning a tad too slow, and got bored by the end---not sure if the rape subplot contributed to me dropping the story, but it didn't help. Even though I'm /massively/ into that thing in fiction. Make of that what you will.

- /Chili and the Chocolate Factory: Fudge Revelation/: I feel like the first half is too disconnected from the second half, even though I understand the reason. Overall, it was very competent, but aside from the commentary on this very community, I can't name anything specific that it does exceptionally well.

Didn't like:

- /Never Die Twice/: I've made an [[https://reddit.com/r/rational/comments/jig6bi/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/gac2p12/?context=3][extensive explanation]] on why I don't recommend it.

- /The Waves Arisen/: Didn't like the concept the story was building up to, didn't like the final confrontation nor the ending, didn't like most of the new character interpretations. Also, at times it felt too dark for the sake of being dark---I understand that it was an attempt to bring plausibility into the world of warring ninjas, but I would've rather redone the world itself than kill off most of the cast. These are the first things that come to mind, but there definitely were more issues.
