Naruto was OP already by that point, more realistically he'd have started the world conquest first, and later been involved with the Rinnegan dude showing up as a response to his actions rather than what happened.

​

It'd have been more interesting, seeing the beginning of the conquest, the part with highest chance of encountering problems and difficulty, so that we later could have a final confrontation with a guy nobody knows about that's absurdly powerful, maybe he'd team up with some of the Kages in a coalition against the Naruto Wave.

​

Much cooler imho. The way the Rinnegan was handled was not perfect though, I agree.
