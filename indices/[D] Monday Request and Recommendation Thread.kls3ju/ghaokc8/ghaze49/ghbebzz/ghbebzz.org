I didn't particularly enjoy The Waves Arisen, and HPMOR is my favourite work of fiction. It felt like someone read HPMOR and was so infatuated with it they directly copied what they enjoyed into a setting that often doesn't fit at the level they've written it to, and miss out on some of the nuances.

Mildly plot-relevant spoiler from toward the end of The Waves Arisen: An example of what I mean by the former would be Naruto's summoning animal being a human. In HPMOR, Harry's patronus being Homo Sapiens both made sense with how Dementors worked (a more sensible interpretation even of just the facts in canon, even), and tied into the larger themes of the story. In the Naruto world (including that of the fanfic), it feels like a forced stretch.

Very heavy plot spoiler from the end of The Waves Arisen: An example of what I mean with the latter is the climax to the final fight when Naruto uses topology to combine chakra in new ways. In HPMOR, Harry's advantages came from leveraging the power of a scientific civilization centuries ahead of the world of magic. In The Waves Arisen, he's just an ordinary ninja. And yet, in the incredibly competitive ninja world where highly trained jonin scramble for any advantage available, none ever related topology to chakra over centuries. This, along with other similar plot points (like Naruto realizing he'd get the Rinnegan if they opened all their gates) made me give a small measure of credence to the argument against some rational fiction that we change the rules just to buff up our characters. Stuff like the Eternal Mangekyo's new rules for activating are more sensical interpretations of canon, but stuff like this is changing the world to fit the character buff.

Don't get me wrong, I did like reading it. There are some very cool moments like the entire final fight right up until the end being one of my favourite fights in fiction and world-building, like the reasoning behind the world map being what it is. But I see people often pointing to Eliezer as the author, and while I can't speak for the level to which he'd obscure his writing to make it not-obvious it's him, I don't think he'd spend his time writing the same very high-level ideas in a different world without changing the low-level details with anywhere near the precision he did in HPMOR.
