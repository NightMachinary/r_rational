  I greatly enjoyed how inhuman MC is portrayed

You might enjoy [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests][Everybody Loves Large Chests]], [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34473/shade-touched][Shade Touched]], [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34030/artificial-jelly][Artificial Jelly]], and [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15130/threadbare][Threadbare]].

ELLC and Shade Touched both have some vague rationalist undertones. They both kind of start to drag later on in my opinion, but are still pretty good. Meanwhile, Artificial Jelly and Threadbare aren't really rational at all, and I've not yet finished either, but I find them very enjoyable.

  The meta (both metaphysical and meta-story) shenanigans are incredible

You might get a kick out of the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KojTtZMZm4&ab_channel=Digi][KUSOMEGA]] books? Trigger warning for like basically everything, and it's a different brand of meta than Erogamer, but it's pretty well done, and feels a little similar to me at times. Also, if you can't stand the voices used or just don't want to listen to an audiobook, you can also just read the books by opening the google docs linked in the videos descriptions.

Oh, and this has nothing to do with anything else, but since I don't see it on your list despite it being a staple of the sub, I guess I'll recommend [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/][Worm]], though it's of course /way/ longer than your 150k limit. I would still recommend it just on the basis that "most people like it" if nothing else, if you happen to find the time.
