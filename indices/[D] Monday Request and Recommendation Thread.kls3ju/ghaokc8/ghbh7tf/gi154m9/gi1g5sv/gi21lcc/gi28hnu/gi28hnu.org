Eh, I can always just repost it it there it need be. Also, I would feel a bit odd putting it up without the context of someone directly asking for it, considering most of these aren't really rationalfic. Which, I think is allowed, but not necessarily in the spirit of the thread, I guess? I dunno. Anyway:

[[https://www.homestuck.com/story][Homestuck]]. Best webcomic ever, absolute classic, has it's issues but they pale in comparison to it's strengths. Could be said to start slow, so don't expect it be be amazing right of the bat, but I personally find even the early sections engaging. I'm literally taking a break right now from writing a Homestuck fanfic to write this comment. Complete, and has a sequel that updates every month. Said sequel is generally considered to be hot garbage, but I personally think it's "meh" at worst, and has some good moments.

I'm not going to give /to/ much detail about the plot for fear of spoiling it, but if you like complex stories and systems with a lot of characters, fanfic fuel, good music and art, and nerdy nonsense, it's fantastic. Just try not to get lost in the complexity- it personally took me two read throughs to grasp some of the major plot points.

[[https://www.prequeladventure.com/2011/03/prequel-begin/][Prequel]]. Another webcomic. Sort of depressing at times, but very fun all the same. Based off of elder scrolls, specifically it's a prequel to the events of oblivion, but I don't think you need to have played any of the games to understand it, though you may miss a few hints at things here and there.

It's about a khajiit (a cat person) who moves to get away from her old life, but is continually haunted by her old vices, mental issues, and general uselessness that led to her first life being such a disaster. I must stress that despite this, it's pretty funny. It also has a maddening update schedule that I think broke me, and now I have effectively infinite patience when waiting for updates to basically anything, which is cool.

[[https://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/stories.shtml][Basically everything every written by Alicorn]]. Interestingly, her most popular story seems to be [[https://luminous.elcenia.com/][Luminosity]], which I actually didn't really like? I felt like it followed the tracks of canon far too closely, at least at first, and I just don't think the Cullen family is very interesting. Much more tolerable is it's weird semi-sequel, [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/effulgence/TOC.html][Effulgence]]. With that said, I still don't exactly love it. Too much fluff, not enough plot, at least for my tastes. Still, you might want to give it a shot (even if you, like me don't like/didn't read Twilight and Luminosity).

[[https://cosmosdex.com/fortuna/p/0][Fortuna]]. Yet another webcomic. I'm actually not even sure what I like about so much, I guess it's just got a lot of neat concepts? Like, I enjoy the /idea/ of the plot? And the writing is competent enough for me to read it by virtue of simply wanting to see this story written, even if I don't think this execution is the most interesting way of doing it. Sort of a similar feeling to Effulgence, where it's a lot of fluff with little substance, but the substance that's there is really good. I know that I'm not exactly selling it hard here, but I personally think it's really underrated.

As for the actual plot, you, the reader, are a person playing a sci-fi video game, but the game is weirdly technologically advanced, and the AI seems almost human at times. The plot of said game is that the player controls a semi-randomly generated crew of cool and wacky aliens on their way to the planet "Fortuna", where an amazing treasure supposedly resides.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21322/re-trailer-trash][RE: Trailer Trash]]. Really interesting. It's about a woman who is reincarnated in her own younger body like fifty years ago, and is forced to deal with and confront the awful realities of her childhood. Totally mundane realistic setting aside from the time travel (and dream sequences kooky enough to have been written by Gazemaize lol). I think that it's really cool to see how the MC basically does a speedrun of getting her life on track, but doesn't really have any advantages beyond her (very spotty) future knowledge.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36950/borne-of-caution][Borne of Caution]]. I think the beginning chapters are maybe not so great, but once the story gets going, it's a lot of fun. Still in it's early stages right now, so there isn't that much of it, but what's there is pretty good. It's basically about a guy who worked at a zoo being isekaied to the Pokémon world, and using his skill with real animals to connect to and understand Pokémon on a level most can't. A neat concept, I think.

[[http://www.leftoversoup.com/first.php][Leftover Soup]]. Can you tell I like webcomics? This one is even completed, and MASSIVELY underrated. Also pretty rational, I think. It's ostensibly about a down-on-his-luck cook named Jamie who moves in with a new roommate. What it's ACTUALLY about is a really deep exploration of the author's philosophy. Which is fine enough, because he's a pretty interesting guy! I don't agree with all of the things he believes, but even the objectionable stuff tends to have interesting rationale behind it. Protip: Read the authors notes below each comic. They tend to be just as (if not more) interesting, and it's really easy to misinterpret what he means sometimes without reading the explanations.

Anyway, I want say more, but I've ran out of easy things to write about, and it's five AM where I am and I'm pretty tired. Might come back and edit this later.
