When I started reading it a few weeks ago, I thought this is going to be one of my favorite works on RR. For some absolutely inexplicable reason, I dropped it on chapter 37. I absolutely loved reading it, still subscribed, but every time I open the chapter I just can't bring myself to read. Mysterious.

It's on my to-read list, I planned to try it out if I get no replies to this comment.

Dropped it really early a few months ago for reasons I don't remember.

First time hearing about this one. Is it a light novel? I might give it a read right now.

  Oh, and this has nothing to do with anything else, but since I don't see it on your list despite it being a staple of the sub, I guess I'll recommend Worm

It's on me for not merging it for the main comment, but I replied to my own post with

"I'm also aware of many other popular works such as Unsong, Ra, WtC, and Worm but haven't finished them for one reason or the other---even though I plan to. If it's commonly mentioned, I definitely have my eye on it already."

Thank you a lot for the recommendations! I'll take a look at /Artificial Jelly/ and KUSOMEGA.
