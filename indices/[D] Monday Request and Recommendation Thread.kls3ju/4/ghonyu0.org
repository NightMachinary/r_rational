I took a shot at What's Her Name in Hufflepuff. It turned out to be a much more enjoyable read than I expected. It was pretty much a breath of fresh air in the HP SI fanfics. Are there any HP SI you guys have found to be an enjoyable reads?

Azarinth Healer was a decent popcorn read. The plot gets a bit murky after 300 or so chapters and it starts to rinse and repeat in a near xianxia type pattern of unlock location->grind->smack op bosses->return with treasure->repeat.
