I'll second that, I read the first 20 chapters the last time it was recced and enjoyed it and now I read the next 20 and it's pretty good.

I will say that reading it back to back sometimes it can get a bit repetitive, the reminders of previous events, and the circular thinking that doesn't seem to end. I was starting to skim over the internal thought loops that didn't seem to be going anywhere.

Overall though, great concept, and done pretty well, if you know anything about RPGs you'll get it and can laugh loudly. Curious where it will go.
