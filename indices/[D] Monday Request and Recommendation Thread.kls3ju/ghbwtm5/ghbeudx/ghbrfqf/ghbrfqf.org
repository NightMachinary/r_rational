Prophecy Approved Companion [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35549/prophecy-approved-companion]]

Found this a few days ago and enjoyed it. Sapient NPC works around game rules when the player tries to break everything. Some munchkining, interesting cognition from the sapient npcs which are forced into their roles. Pokes fun at common unrealistic elements in RPG's. Still in progress.
