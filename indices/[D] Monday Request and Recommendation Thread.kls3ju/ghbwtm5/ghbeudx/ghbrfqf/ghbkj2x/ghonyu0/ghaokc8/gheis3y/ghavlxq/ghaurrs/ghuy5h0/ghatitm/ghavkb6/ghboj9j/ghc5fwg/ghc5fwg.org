By that are you looking for a weak monster MC that grows and evolves?

If so, it's a pretty sparse genre, and the only two good ones I know of are the Japanese light novel series So I'm a Spider, So What? and the English webnovel Chrysalis. Spider is my personal favorite monster MC novel, but every time I rec it here there are people who seem to dislike it, so there's that. Of course, don't expect rationality and character development and writing on par with works like Worm, but I do consider it the best monster MC novel. MC is quite competent and the litrpg elements are pretty good and not as awkward and clunky as Systems usually go. As a light novel series, you'll also have to buy each volume of course, and they can be a bit pricey if you don't sail the high seas.

Chrysalis has a bit of a strange litrpg system that I'm frankly not a fan of and the MC can be really stupid at times, but it's still quite decent, especially considering how terrible most of these types of novels tend to go.

You may also consider Everybody Loves Large Chests. It's actually quite decent, but the disgusting, violent, and explicit sex and the garbage endings are major negatives.

There's a pretty new novel on RoyalRoad about a newborn demon called Salvos, inspired by the other big litrpgs on RR like Wandering Inn and novels like Spider. It's still really early on but I find it decent, for what it's worth.
