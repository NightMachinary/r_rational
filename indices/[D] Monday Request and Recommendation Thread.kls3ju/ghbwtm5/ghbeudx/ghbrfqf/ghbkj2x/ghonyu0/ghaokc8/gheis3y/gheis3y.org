I need help remembering the names of two stories I read here but forgot their names.

The first one is about a group of people with magic powers (red super strength, green animal shape-shift, pink makes the person fall in love, orange is like super manager / authority, yellow is like genius, I think gray was mind reading, etc) and the end of the story was about the heat death of the universe.

The second story was about this guy in "purgatory" where there's millions/billions of people and every direction of travels are these towers and the whole point of anything/everything was to answers the question if some coffee mug in 1980s/1990s issue of Garfield contained "inappropriate" matter or not.
