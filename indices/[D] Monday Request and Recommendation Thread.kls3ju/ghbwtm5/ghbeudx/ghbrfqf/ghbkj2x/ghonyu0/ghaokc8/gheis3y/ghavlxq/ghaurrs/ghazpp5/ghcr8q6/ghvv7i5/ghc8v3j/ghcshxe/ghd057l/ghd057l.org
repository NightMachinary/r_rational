It's alright. It bounces around a lot between the main story (Master Chief, Sergeant Johnson, and Elder Devil Shepard in separate teams dealing with Reapers and other problems), background about the crossover, and sidestories IIRC. If you don't like the premise I don't think you need to bother with this one.
