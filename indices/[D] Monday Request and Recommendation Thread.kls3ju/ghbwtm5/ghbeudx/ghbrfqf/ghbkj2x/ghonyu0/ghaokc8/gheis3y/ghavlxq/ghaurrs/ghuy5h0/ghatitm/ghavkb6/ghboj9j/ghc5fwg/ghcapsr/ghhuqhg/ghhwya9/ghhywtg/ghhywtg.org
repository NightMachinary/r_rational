I think they're all too similar to spider and most of the ones I've read were unfinished, so I wouldn't be ready to recommend them, since they may go for a similar 'twist'. I didn't mean to imply I know a ton about the genre in general, just that I've seen Spider spawn a lot of these grindy and entirely stream of thought oriented monster litrpgs.

Spider is a unique case, because the reason I wouldn't recommend it personally is that the grinding is a slog, but when it suddenly abandons the grinding it also loses the appeal that it used to have for people that could enjoy that. It ends with me wondering who the story should really be recommended to, at least in the state it was when I read a translation.
