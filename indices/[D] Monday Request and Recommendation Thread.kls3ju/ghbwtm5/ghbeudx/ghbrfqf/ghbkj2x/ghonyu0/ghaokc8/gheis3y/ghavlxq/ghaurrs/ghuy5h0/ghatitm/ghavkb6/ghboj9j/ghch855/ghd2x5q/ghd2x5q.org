I disagree that Max Lord comes across as sympathetic, the character is unapologetically, cartoonishly evil. The only person Max Lord has empathy for is his son. When the rival oil baron wishes for an ethnostate and Lord takes his security in exchange, Lord is enthused to have gotten one over him. No thought is given to the consequences of what he has enabled, no attempt to cause another wish to undo the damage. He happily causes untold suffering, seemingly perfectly fine with destroying the world as long as he is on top. The only thing that causes him to stop is that his son is in danger, and one can assume he will start the whole cycle over after ensuring his son's safety. I was sorry Wonder Woman didn't execute him.
