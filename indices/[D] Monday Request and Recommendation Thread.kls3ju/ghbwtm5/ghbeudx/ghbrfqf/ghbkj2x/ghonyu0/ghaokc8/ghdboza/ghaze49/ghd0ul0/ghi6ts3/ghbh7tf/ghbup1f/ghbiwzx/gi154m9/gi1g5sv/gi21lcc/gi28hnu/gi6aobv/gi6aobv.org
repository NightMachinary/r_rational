Thank you for the detailed recommendations once again, it's really appreciated.

I've already read RE: Trailer Trash, so I ended up trying out Artificial Jelly last night, which I also ended up binging. That's two fun nights now, thanks to you. Are you interested in recs yourself?

  Which, I think is allowed, but not necessarily in the spirit of the thread, I guess?

I think if you're a [[/r/rational]]-goer and like certain things, then posting them in the recs thread is perfectly fine, since others on this sub may have large overlap with your likes, even if it's not strictly rational. Just put a disclaimer and others might rec similar stuff in turn.
