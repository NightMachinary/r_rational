There's a work on Royalroad name "Isekai speedrun" or something that I tried yonks back. It wasn't my thing, but didn't seem too bad?

Doing God's Work is about a Divine Call Centre. It's sat on my "read eventually" list for ages, first dozen chapters were good but I had other stuff on my plate.

Those aren't exact fits for your description, but ballpark enough to mention.
