That's what I like, actually! As a person whose goal at life is to "learn more stuff," I liked reading about main character accomplishing that goal effectively. I think, it's the interactions with humans that broke me for some reason.

Hated it, sorry. At least in some part because it skipped the groundwork, but also for other reasons.

I think I've read everything from the series except /Hermione Granger and the Silent Country/. I don't get what's everyone so crazy about when it comes to this story, but it's quite alright nonetheless.

The rest I've heard about, so I might give some of them a try. For now, I'm reading an LN recommended above, but I'll put them on my to-read list, thanks!

And thank you for taking the time to reply!
