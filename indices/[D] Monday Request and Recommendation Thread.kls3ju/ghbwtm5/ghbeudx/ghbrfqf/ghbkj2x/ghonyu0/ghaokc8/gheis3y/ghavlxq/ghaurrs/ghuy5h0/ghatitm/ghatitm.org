I started reading Witch Hat Atelier this week. The plot is pretty standard so far, and the characters, while entertaining, aren't overly unique. The art is probably the best I've ever read in a manga, and I'm probably buying the entire collection so far because of how good it looks. The magic system is great as well - it's one of the most promising I remember coming across.
