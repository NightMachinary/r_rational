I agree that the villain was a bit clever and very evil, willing to destroy the world for a bit of power. Seems about right for a DC villain.

Things seem to escalate much too quickly.

I don't really understand the ending or the moral (truth conquers all? Don't follow the dreams and acknowledge the truth that you're a loser? Nuclear weapons are bad and giant walls tend to cause issues? Be careful what you wish for?).

Also, they completely glossed over the immorality of having your boyfriend randomly possessing some dude and taking his stuff.
