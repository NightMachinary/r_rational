Huh. Can you go into more detail on /why/ you liked/disliked some of this stuff? I honestly can't really get a good picture of your taste from this. (You like HPMOR, and hate The Waves Arisen? What?)

With that said, I tentatively recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/1/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation][Chili and the Chocolate Factory: Fudge Revelation]]. One of my all-time favorites. Read the Reddit discussion alongside each chapter for the best effect, I think.
