My search for quality pokemon fanfic has given me a recommendation for y'all.[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12523562/1/Arbitrary-Execution]]I am not done reading it, but it is listed as complete.

The reasons I am recommending it: It has some really interesting world-building and a look at the world of pokemon that reminds me of pokemon: OOS, but from a more hopeful perspective if that makes sense. The plot is also interesting and makes sense in the pokemon world.

Reasons people may not like it: The MC is not all that rational and the focus is not on gaining power or even being powerful. The MC is a trans woman and has her problems with the transition, which means the cool world-building is not focused on. Not a problem for me, but I figure that would frustrate some people.
