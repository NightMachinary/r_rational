What do you mean weird narrative changes? I read it a while ago but didn't feel weird to me.

For the second point, I would actually make sure to mention that that CHANGES later in the story; at the time I hadn't read much so I got through the grind, but that's something that I may have dropped it for now if I hadn't known that it changes later.

But also; what Monster MC stories (especially Isekaied monster MC stories with a decent amount of chapters) do you think are /better/ than spider?
