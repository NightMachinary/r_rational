That Naruto would get the Rinnegan isn't something I was in doubt of (Kishimoto actually admitted his mistake in canon with Boruto not awakening one, if I remember correctly). My peeve was with him having a sudden, unforeseen insight on how to awaken it in the middle of battle by opening all his gates without having to wait decades like Madara did.
