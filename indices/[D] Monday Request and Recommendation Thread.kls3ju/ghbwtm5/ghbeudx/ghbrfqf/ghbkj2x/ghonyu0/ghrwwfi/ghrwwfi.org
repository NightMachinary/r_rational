It's not quite an SI, but if you liked Azarinth Healer I could see you liking *[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-wand-for-skitter.730018/][A Wand for Skitter]]* too. It's not exactly a masterpiece or anything, but it does feature an out-of-context character mucking about in a moderately-AU version of the Potterverse. I enjoyed it myself, so if you're looking for something to read, feel free to give it a try.
