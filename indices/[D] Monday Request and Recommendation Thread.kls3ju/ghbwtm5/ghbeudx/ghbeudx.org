I just finished watching [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088479/][ANZACS]], a 1985 mini-series that follows Australian soldiers who served in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_and_New_Zealand_Army_Corps][Australia and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZAC) during World War I. It starts right before war breaks out, with the first episode having the main character enlist and go through training before being shipped off to Gallipoli to fight the Turks (not France as they'd expected) as part of the 8th Battalion of the Australian Imperial Force. Following that, we see the major events as the war progresses, such as the battle of the Somme and Ypres, until the war's end in 1918.

For a series that was made 35 years ago, it holds up surprisingly well. The series deals with WW1 very well, showing the contrast between men on the ground doing the fighting, and those in the rear doing the planning. There are a few major themes that stood out to me: the brotherhood of the soldiers in war, nationalism (Australians view Australia as a nation, the British as an unruly colony), class divides (British officers were mainly old-school nobles, while the foot soldiers were from the lower rungs of society) and Imperialism/jingoism (the main character's pro-British father toasts the war a a "spring breeze to clear the air over Europe"), and the nihilism felt by the troops.

There only thing I really didn't like was that at some times they would inject comedy in parts I felt should be a bit more serious. I really didn't like the jingle they came up with either.

It's mostly historically accurate (as far as I can tell), though there were parts that seemed to take liberties; Haig is portrayed as almost a villain, who sends the Australian men to die in the hopes they'll respect British authority more and is constantly fighting with the PM as much as the Germans (the latter is somewhat true, though the extent of it I'm not sure). I do know that they whitewashed the character of Keith Murdoch, who in real life was lobbied against Major General [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Monash][John Monash]] taking control of the Australian forces in part because of his Jewish/German heritage, and went as far as spreading lies to the Australian government that senior officers hated Monash, when the opposite was true.

It's made in the same vein as /All Quiet on the Western Front/ or /Band of Brothers/, though a bit more lighthearted. Definitely a good series for those who like military/history films.

As a bonus, it stars some very famous Australians, including Paul Hogan, who would go on to film Crocodile Dundee a year later.
