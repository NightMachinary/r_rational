My kid sister recs it to me around one year ago. But all I found was pretty pictures and mediocre everything else. I thought at that time, my sister being college-taught artist might influence how she perceive which work is good. Maybe that's why I'm not a little bit curious on how story will develop. Tell me, is it gonna get riveting later on? I value a solid story telling (that's why I'm in this subreddit).
