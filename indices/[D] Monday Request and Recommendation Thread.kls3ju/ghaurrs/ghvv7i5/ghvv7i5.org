  I am looking for recs that take a ridiculous setting (porn, comedy, etc) and try to take it seriously.

[[https://the-last-sovereign.blogspot.com/][The Last Sovereign]] is this in RPG form. To copy the last time I recommended it here:

In short it's a smutty rpg about a jaded veteran who gains a sex based power from the same source as the evil overlord who is plaguing his Homeland.

There's a pretty strong emphasis on sensible decision-making and a use of "soft power" like economics and diplomacy that I've not seen in any rpg, adult or otherwise. The setting is explicitly non rational, but the response to it from the main characters is exactly what anyone from this subreddit might hope for.

To be honest, I might even go so far as to call it the most rational RPG I can recall playing, even among major franchises, but I'm far from widely played enough to call it the most rational ever.
