I usually de-rec it when I see it, because of the weird narrative changes in later volumes (entirely different narration/focus) and the way the novels handle that transition.

It also has that "Monster MC isekai'd so far away from people that it's just a record of grinding" thing going on, that it may even have invented but I still think is worth knowing before picking it up.
