A couple questions about whether certain things are still active:

Is Alicorn's Elcenia setting still being written, or is it dead?

Is To The Stars (the PMMM fanfic) still being written, or is it dead?

What about Lighting Up The Dark (the naruto fanfic)?

Also, is the Wizard's Bane / Wiz Biz series worth reading?
