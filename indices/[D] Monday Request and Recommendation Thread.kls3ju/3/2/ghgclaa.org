Elcenia hasn't updated since 2015 and is disclaimed on the author page as "not looking likely to be a priority soon."

She does have some other fiction out, including [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/stories.shtml][three new stories]] of ~50k, ~6k and ~6k respectively all released this year. I personally found Zusan to be kinda adorable.
