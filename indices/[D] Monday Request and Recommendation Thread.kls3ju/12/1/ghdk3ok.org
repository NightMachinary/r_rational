Re:monster is a light novel and manga about a guy that has the ability to get powers from any creatures he eats and gets reincarnated as a goblin in an litrpg world. A big part of the story is about monsters ranking up and evolving into their next form.

The start is solid but it jumps the shark after a bit, the MC gets too OP imo. Probably still worth a read of you're looking for that kind of thing.
