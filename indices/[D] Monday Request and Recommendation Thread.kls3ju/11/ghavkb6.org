Ar'kendrithyst ended book 4 last week on patreon, and I thought it was a very good ending. Better than any of the other books so far. We learned about almost all the relevant lore behind magic (and it is interesting) and we really got to see Erick reach his potential as a good person. Probably the first time in the novel where we see his goodness be celebrated instead of mocked/subverted by other people. Erick is also probably the most good protagonist I've ever read about. I'd highly recommend reading it if you were able to get past erick's character at the start.
