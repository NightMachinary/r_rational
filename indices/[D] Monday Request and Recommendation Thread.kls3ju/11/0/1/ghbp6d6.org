Those characters are paragons of utilitarianism. Erick represents a distinctly different flavour of moral good, one that is refreshing to read about. Especially so in contrast with a lot of the rat!fic standards like you mentioned.

I'm not OP; I don't think Erick is the most good protagonist ever, but it's nice to read about a character whose principles are principal, if you catch my drift. In fact the worst parts of ArKendrithyst for me have been the segments where every other character piles on Erick for being dumb and naive and so on.
