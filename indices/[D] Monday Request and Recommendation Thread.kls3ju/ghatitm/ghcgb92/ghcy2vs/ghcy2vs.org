I'm only a volume in and I'm holding off on reading the rest until I can buy the physical copies - I enjoy reading on my Kindle, so I try to spend most of my book money on manga and graphic novels now. The story as such isn't great so far, but neither did I think it was bad enough to put down. I'm probably more influenced by the art, because I'm an artist (very infrequently). That said, I do see a lot of potential for the magic system, a slight level of in-world munchkinry with it, and none of the characters being particularly stupid, so I think even without the art, I might have read more.
