I'd argue against "Cartoonishly Evil", in that he mirrors real-world figures like Bernie Madoff and John Rockefeller

As for Sympathetic, I agree he's evil and that that overrides what mellowing parts he has, but I refer more to the way he looks when he realizes he's about to become a huge public failure, and his backstory later showing he was a poor immigrant kid who really did start off with a small business and a dream.. His sympathetic parts are closer to, e.g., Vulture from Spiderman Homecoming. He has a sympathetic motive (if less so than "The Big man screwed me over", but you understand he's still an unrepentant murder.

Perhaps it's a difference of usage here. I don't mean, for instance, that a character is one I approve of, or want to succeed, or need to think of as at least having their heart in the right place, just one with sympathetic parts. An unsympathetic villain, at least how I use the term, is closer to Beria from /The Death of Stalin/, who is an unrepentant rapist and murderer without even the lip service to the "Good of the Soviet State" that the other characters have.
