About the "Cartoonishly Evil" bit, I would consider those two and modern day equivalents to fit the description. As in, the actions of massive corporations / the ultra rich are something you would see on a Saturday morning cartoon, evil with no possible justification. Things like funding research to discredit climate change or raising the price of essential medicines to absurd levels.

I agree that Max Lord has moments that seem sympathetic in the film, but these seem intentionally undermined: He is shown starting a business, classic American dream, but his business is an oil drilling company - pretty much /the/ symbol of greed and environmental destruction.
