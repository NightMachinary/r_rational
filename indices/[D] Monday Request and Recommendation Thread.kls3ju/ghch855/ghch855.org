I saw /Wonder Woman 1984/ this weekend, on HBO Max.

I liked it, although the general response on [[/r/movies]] was negative. The opening was cheesy, though in a good way (comparable to the Reeves Superman movies), and the middle had a few bumps (like why (Medium spoiler) a plane stored at the Smithsonian would be well-kept enough to have fuel at all, much less enough to cross the Atlantic twice, if such a thing was possible with relevant-era planes or (major ending spoiler) How everyone on Earth agreed to recant their wishes, unless the Lasso of Truth over super-TV is just that good.)

The villains plan was actually quite clever, and the main reason why I'd suggest it here at all: He uses the one-time ironic-wish Dreamstone to ask to become it and gain its powers. He then uses his new-found wish granting powers to give people what they want, then either declaring the consequence in a manner benefiting him, or just tricking them into wishing for what he wants anyways, and countering the ironic twist of him rapidly losing health by taking people's good health in exchange.

Pedro Pascal steals the show as Max Lord, in a great performance. He really manages to sell his character as both clever and in over his head, as slimy and cool and sympathetic all at once. Chris Pine and Gal Godot's chemistry was good enough to make the relevant romance scenes work. The new fish-out-of-water elements are charming, and the romp about the 1980s never dives too deeply into nostalgia for its own sake.

Overall, I'd say good, better than its peers in the DCCU, if a slight bit worse than Shazam or Wonder Woman. You'll likely like it if you like the median Marvel movie, or want to a clever Munchkin of a plan.
