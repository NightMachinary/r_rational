I taught Middle School English last year and my kids really liked this story. I liked using flash fiction as a warm up activity; it gave the kids badly needed variety and let them practice skills on a quick variety of different authors. I actually got one kid to write a pretty good sci-fi story about a ship that crashes into mars told through audiologs without prompting or an assignment.

Of course, finding flash that was half as good as this made it a real problem. Two more the kids really liked were Riddle by Ogbewe Amadin and Felicity by Amy Rivers. Neither one of which are ration, but both are good fun.
