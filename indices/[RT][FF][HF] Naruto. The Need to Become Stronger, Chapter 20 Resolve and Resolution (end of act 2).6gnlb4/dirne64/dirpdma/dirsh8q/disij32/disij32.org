Hahah, of course I'm going to reply, receiving this kind of feedback is enormously helpful to me as a writer. :)

I think you hit the nail on the head when you mention Naruto's relation to other characters. It's not so much that he's stupid, just that he's being outshone by the other characters in every instance. That might also be the result of his personality being based on canon!Naruto, where exactly that is also the case except there it's in terms of power. Strangely enough it doesn't seem to cause any issues there, but perhaps that's because canon!Naruto has just enough awesome moments that the audience keeps rooting for him even though Sasuke upstages him for example. On the other hand, canon!Sakura has the exact same issue - she is useless in EVERY fight, and then complains about it, which makes the audience hate her. On the other hand, if she just had a few cool moments the audience would be much quicker to forgive her, but the fact that she doesn't have any powers makes that impossible.

Another part of the problem, I think, is that the reader associates social status with competence - if everyone treats Naruto like an idiot and makes him look like an idiot, then the reader will think he's an idiot even if he's not. In canon Naruto can show off his shadow clones to prove he's strong even if he's treated like dirt, but showing off intelligence in the same situation is not nearly as easy.

The final part of the issue is that I can't just have him think brilliant thoughts by himself, because that's just bad storytelling. I mean, yeah, The Waves Arisen makes Naruto look very smart by doing endless research into his powers by himself, but by god is it boring to read. And it serves no real purpose for the main story. Everything the main character does has to be in relation to other characters, because that's the reason people read stories in the first place.

So yeah, I think you're right: Naruto needs a clear area in which he excels, so that other characters can go "Huh, I guess he's not an idiot after all." And in Naruto's case, that has to be his ability to think outside of the box, as you mentioned. Naruto has basically no status awareness, has his social cluelessness makes him look like an idiot but it also allows him to come up with thoughts and ideas that Sakura would not dare dream of for example. He already has that ability, but he just hasn't had the chance to really show it off, and I need to focus on fixing that.

I've definitely read Worm, and it's a fantastic story for its immersion and worldbuilding. I'm not sure it's all that rational though, as everyone holds the conflict ball and people never go "Just shoot him with a sniper rifle, w/e". I mean, Skitter has a long range telepathic swarm at her disposal with no physical superpowers, and yet, how often does she end up just punching the villain into submission? It's ridiculous. :P

Also, Regent is awesome and should have gotten way more screentime.

(I've actually written two short Worm Omakes as part of the filler updates while I get the next act in order - maybe you'll like them)

I'm glad that you're enjoying the discussion! You mentioned being an aspiring writer yourself - is there anything you would like me to read or give feedback on?
