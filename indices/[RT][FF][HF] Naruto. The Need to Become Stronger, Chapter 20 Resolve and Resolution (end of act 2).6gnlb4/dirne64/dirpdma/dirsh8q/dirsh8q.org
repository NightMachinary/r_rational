Wow. I did not expect to get any kind of response to my comment. Thanks. This actually means so much to me. So much that I actually took the time to read the first few chapters again, in order to try and find out exactly where my feelings are coming from.

And after reading up to the point where Mizuki is captured, I feel like I've found where my opinion comes from. Naruto, when he is by himself, is not smart. Naruto makes all his insightful comments, interesting arguments, and odd, yet novel opinions, when is talking to other people. For example, the first chapter establishes Naruto as someone who wants to research the true nature of chakra and ninja techniques. And yet, except for the opening scene in which he is caught after having finished experimenting with the body flicker, we don't get to see this. Sure, Naruto is interesting when is talking to Sakura, but given the fact that Sakura is established as smart by the narration (due to her room being full of books, the fact that she is a good student Naruto goes to for help studying, etc...) it comes across more as Naruto acting as a creative Watson to Sakura's Holmes.

And this is problematic, because it means the only really interesting thing about Naruto (at that point in the story), is stuff he's been born with. Those of us who've read canon know his heritage. He has a lot of chakra, so he can use the shadow clone technique (and yes, he also has a flexible mind, but this hasn't really been shown at this point in the story). Sasuke is established as the better fighter in the beginning of the story, and the interactions between him and Sakura (first at her house, then at the library) establishes her as the better thinker. And this even gets meta (which makes me think its kind of intended) when Mizuki's words are considered. There are plenty of 'better/more skilled/ smarter' people in this setting, but like how Mizuki says some people can't become top tier ninjas without access to top tier secret knowledge, they aren't the main characters of this story. Naruto is. And it seems like he's the main character not because of anything he is, or has done, but because of who he was born as, something even thought by Naruto in the story itself.

And it is at this point in the story, when Naruto think this, that could have (in my lowly, unskilled opinion as a very, very, very amateur writer who could create something as awesome as what you've written so far if he tried for twice as long) been a turning point in the story, a hook that gave the readers some mental aptitude of Naruto (after all, this is a rat fic) to hold on to. The main thrust of my argument is that Naruto does not seem smart by himself. If the twist in Chapter 4 had been intended by Naruto, if he had sensed something was off about Mizuki, or had a thought-sequence where did some planning and came to conclusion, or anything really, and had decided to send a clone to the meeting with Mizuki with this in mind, then Naruto's first 'victory', his 'defeat' of Mizuki, would have been in a part due to his brains. He would have been established as cunning, and the reader could go 'oh! This Naruto may not be the best student, or the best fighter, but he's tricky and now his cunning has been amplified by his shadow clones! That's why he's the main character!".

Instead the only reason Mizuki is able to actually take Naruto hostage, is due to blind luck. Naruto got lucky, and sent a shadow clone to the meeting, and then his real body blew the whistle after realising the danger. And this makes reading the beginning of this story (it gets better, much better later, but suffers from the same flaws) feel a bit like you're reading a version of HPMOR where, while the setting has been made rational, the main character isn't actually very smart. And instead we're watching canon Harry be manipulated by Dumbledore into killing Voldemort, winning battles because he got lucky, or because of someone else's awesome plan that just had to involve him because he's the chosen one.

And while the Wave arc kind of makes up for this, it still falls into the same trap. When we are finally given an instance of Naruto actually thinking tactically about how to beat his enemy, it is under cut by the fact that it is Sakura giving the reader the conclusions. Any sense of brainy rational-ness Naruto could have achieved here is destroyed by the fact that he is once more made a foil to Sakura's own intelligence. He is thinking 'along' with her true, but it's a lot more like he is a field Watson feeding data into a Mission Control Holmes, who then draws the conclusions needed to win. That is why Sakura feels so much smarter than Naruto, because it is her job in the story to be smart, not Naruto, which is odd because I feel (not know, I'm no rational fiction god, but I feel this way) that it should be the job of the main character in a rational story to be smart, not a side characters job.

Worm got around having a smart side character by having Tattletale take a side role, as an actual Mission Control / Exposition side character who used her intelligence to give the reader more information on the setting, while letting the main character (Taylor) do the tactical thinking needed to win the actual fights. I don't know if you've read Worm, but if you have, imagine how much less epic the fight against Mannequin would feel, if Taylor had been talking to Tattletale over an ear piece, and it had been Tattletale that told her how to beat him?

What I feel this Naruto needs to do to make him seem smart, is to establish a mental area where he reigns supreme (in HPMOR Harry may not be as academic as Hermione [much to his chargin], and it is kind of implied that Draco is the better politician, but he is a tactical god compared to them both once he gets going), and then be shown using his prowess in that area to win. If his thing is going to be seeing novel ways to use existing techniques, then perhaps you could have a thought-sequence showing him figuring out a new way to use clones, or substition, and then make that discovery relevant to a future problem, so he can be shown achieving a victory via his brains, and his own brains alone? This is the reason I enjoyed the HPMOR Army Battles. In a plot where Harry really is outmached by everyone around him, the Battles remind us why Harry is the main character, not Hermione or Draco. This version of Naruto, I feel, needs something like that. Sorry for the rambling response, but I'm writing this excited because I've never had to chance to have such a good discussion with an author before and I cant wait for your answer.
