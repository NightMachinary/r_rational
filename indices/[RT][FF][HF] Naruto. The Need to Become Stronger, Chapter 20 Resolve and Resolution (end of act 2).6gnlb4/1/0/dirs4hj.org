I'm glad you like the characters! One of the things that keeps me writing is that I absolutely love getting into the heads of Team Seven and all the side-characters. I dunno, I guess it's because Naruto has so many characters with great potential that are just never really explored, and we haven't even gotten to the chunin exams arc yet. Talk about wasted potential there!

Seriously, why did Kishi write characters like Neji and then not do anything with them? His whole backstory with Hinata being kidnapped could have been resolved so beautifully after the Shinobi joined into an alliance with the Raikage taking the lead. Neji could have refused or better yet, tried to assassinated the Raikage, only for his uncle and Hinata to stop him. It would have tied in perfectly with the whole quest to get everyone to cooperate for the sake of peace, and would have made his ultimate sacrifice so much more meaningful.
