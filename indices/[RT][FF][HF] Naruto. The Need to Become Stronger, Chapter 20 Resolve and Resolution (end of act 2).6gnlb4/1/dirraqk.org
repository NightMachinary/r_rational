Whoop, another chapter. Very enjoyable. Something I really like about your writing is the characterization. Every character feels like they have their own hopes, dreams, deceptions yada yada. They all seem to have something 'more' to them. It's great to read something where everyone has depth to them and not just the main characters in a see of 2-dimensional cardboard cutouts.

I do agree with your main concern about making Naruto intelligent but not overtly so. It is a precarious balance to strike. As long as he grows over time and slowly becomes more experienced at actually applying his intelligence, with a side order of investigations in the nature of Chakra (even if he is just rehashing something all major villages have done at some point), I'll be happy. :)

Anyhoo, keep up the good work!
