I think that Naruto would be served well by going on a training montage once he gets back from the Land of Waves. He's seen that going on a low rank mission is no guarantee that it will stay that way. He's seen that he will be facing very intelligent people who have special abilities that he can't match with brute force. Yes, being intelligent is very helpful, but it can only do so much if Naruto only knows a handful of techniques. I've read a decent amount of Naruto fics recently, so I don't remember precisely what Naruto was doing before the Land of Waves in this fic, but he doesn't seem to have learned all that many techniques.

When he gets back, he needs to seriously put some effort into training. Learn sealing, or wind jutsu for AoE disruption, or Earth jutsu to create cover and manipulate the battlefield, or even just learn proficiency with weapons.

Essentially, he now recognizes The Need to become Stronger. And it's time he acts on it, or he will swiftly become hopelessly outgunned and unable to keep up with his team.
