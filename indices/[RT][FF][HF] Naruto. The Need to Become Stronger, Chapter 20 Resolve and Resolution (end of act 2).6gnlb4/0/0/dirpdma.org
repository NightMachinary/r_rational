Wow, what an in-depth review - that's always fantastic to see after writing a new chapter. :)

The main reason why Naruto has to be the main character is because most of the story's characters and events only have emotional relevance in relation to him. I do think Sakura has potential as main character (and I like writing from her perspective), but though her outsider status allows for an interesting rationalist take it also presents the problem that most of the story's events have no relevance to her. She's aloof. She's intellectual. She has no special interest in the Kyubi's attack on Konoha or the legendary Sannin or the Hokage or any of the other relevant factors. It could still be done but I would have had to really play up the "civilian outsider becomes a ninja and her unique perspective lets her munchkin the entire setting" angle, where the world itself is the final villain, or reinvent the whole setting ala Time Braid.

I think Sasuke could have been an interesting main character too, due to his cynicism which allows for a unique take on things, but I suspect his perspective would have been tiring to read because it would be too dark after a while.

The reason I chose Naruto is because ultimately, my main priority was in writing a good story that's also rationalist, rather than the other way around. He's supposed to be the anti-thesis to HPMOR's main character: Someone who succeeds despite his environment rather than because of it, whose abilities are highlighted by his actions instead of having others marvel at how brilliant he is. And I do think this Naruto is much smarter than people give him credit for - he just takes to heart Kakashi's lesson that you should go for the simplest possible strategy and use common sense, rather than constantly showing off how brilliant he is.

But it's true that he does not "Feel" that brilliant, so the question is, how to fix this? I already wanted to rewrite the first chapter, but if it's a problem throughout the entire story then that's harder to solve. So what is it, exactly, that makes Sakura feel so much smarter to you? Is there anything in particular that she does that I could have Naruto do as well? Or is it the way she talks, acts, and carries herself? If you have any advice for me on how to solve this, please let me know, because it really is the story's #1 problem!

(He does become more awesome later, but that's kinda moot as readers might drop off long before that point)
