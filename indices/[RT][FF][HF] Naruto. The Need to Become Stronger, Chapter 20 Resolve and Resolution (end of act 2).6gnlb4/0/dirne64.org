OK, so I definitely like how you've fleshed out the characters of Sakura and Sasuke in this fic. Every rational fic needs an abundance of smart characters with different world views to avoid becoming a boring Mary Sue type story.

But I can't help but feel that Naruto is the least intelligent member of Team 7, and that bugs me. Because in a way, Sasuke is right. In the world of Naruto, where individuals are capable of being overwhelmingly more powerful than each other, being born a civilian is a fatal mistake. I feel like, given that this is a rational take on Naruto where the main characters "Therapy no jutsu" is presumably not going to take instant affect on characters like Nagato, Naruto is being naive.

And while Sasuke hasn't shown that much innate intelligence either, other than perhaps, arguably his more realistic pessimism (my argument here being that, given the world Naruto takes place in, his world view is far more justified than Naruto's), his character isn't the main problem I feel I have with this fic.

The thing about this awesomely written and well plotted fic, filled with interesting characters, is that I can't figure out why Sakura isn't the main character. She is very intelligent. She is close enough to the main plot to have a justified presence at all the canon plot points. And her great chakra control makes her a perfect candidate to explore one of the most interesting areas in which this fic differs from canon- here, non-sharingan genjutsu seems to have the potential to be actually useful, and Sakura would have served as a wonderful vehicle for exploring the new reality that would create.

Furthermore, Sakura would actually have to investigate all the hidden background lore of canon, instead of just being told it be by characters like Jiraiya, and this would have made for epic reveals where stuff from canon has been changed in new and exciting ways in order to be rational.

And given all this, and seeing Naruto in this fic, it seems like he's only the main character because the fic is called Naruto. I mean, I probably missed something in the story where this is explained, but one of the main good points about Naruto in this story, that speaks to his intelligence, is that he sees non-weaponized uses for jutsu. And yet, I don't remember him using his own most special ability, shadow clones, to make money on the side.

One of the main appeals of a rational story is watching the main character munchkin the setting. And so far, this characterisation of Naruto doesn't feel like he's heading in that direction. Sure, his planning during the Haku fight was nice, but even that was helped along by Sakura. It would have been just as interesting, perhaps more so, to follow the genjutsu wielding medic Sakura as she skirted around the sides of the battle, helping her team mates figure out how to win. And furthermore, it would have given the role of support ninja ( a role essentially glossed over in canon) a rational twist; in any fight, they are the ninja who have the most time to actually think, rather than just react to whatever their opponent is doing.

Sorry for the criticism, and I know some of my points probably aren't as logical or rational as I think they are, but I feel like it had to be said, because I love your writing style, and I love the idea of a rational Naruto. I just don't see (so far) why Naruto is the main character of this story, other than the fact that he is the main character of canon.

Maybe he could start trying to do interesting stuff with sealing?
