And that's it! That's the end of act 2. Let me know what you thought of the story arc, if it was sufficiently original, if you thought all the plot points were neatly resolved, or whatever else is on your mind. It's always great to receive feedback.

There will probably be a delay of one week as I get the next Act in order -- it's always tricky to get everything to match up with the plot and make sure I don't contradict myself. I also want to finally take a stab at rewriting the first (few) chapter(s) to make them more in line with the rest of the story, especially in terms of characterisation.

In the meantime, I'll probably put up a few Omake's / Crossover stories that I wrote some time ago so you guys won't get bored waiting for the next chapter. Stay tuned!
