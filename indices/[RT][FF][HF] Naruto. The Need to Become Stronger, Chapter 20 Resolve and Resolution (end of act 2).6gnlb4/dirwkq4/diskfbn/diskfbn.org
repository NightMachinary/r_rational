Yup, the darkness technique is definitely one of the major NTBS-only plotpoints. Though not, necessarily, something I just pulled out of nowhere. It's supposed to be one of those solvable mysteries like in HPMOR that make you go "oh, huh, that makes a lot of sense actually."

The next few (non-omake) chapters should give a better impression of how this technique functions. Should be interesting to see if people will start to speculate on it then.
