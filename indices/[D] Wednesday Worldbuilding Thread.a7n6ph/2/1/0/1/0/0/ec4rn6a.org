Suppose the immigrant sneaks in and sets up camp near a village. Just to make things extra hard, suppose that his stated reason isn't wanting to trade, but wanting to be near his expecting lover from several months back--a woman of the tribe who also wants him near.

I imagine banishment for the male, option to leave for the female. Would they kill the squatter if he refused to vacate?

This sort of situation will arise. Probably not terribly often, but it will be something they need a protocol for--and a protocol that everyone knows, so that it doesn't usually get to "he could only be convinced to leave with force" stage.

Another question is, what does the tribe do to prevent male conceptions? If the method has a failure rate, how does it treat members of the tribe who accidentally conceive a male?
