When designing these civilizations, I'd think about birth-rates, and what it takes to have a stable population.

Up until the modern era, the average woman had around 5-7 kids over her lifetime. This creates an /incredible/ amount of pressure for civilizations to expand. A farmer's first son might inherit his farm. But the 2nd and 3rd sons need to go out and find their own land.

Failing that, they become tenant farmers somewhere, and have to live on denser and denser plots of land, until they can't feed themselves. This is a major factor in why Europe was able to have so many wars. Sure, war sucks. But if the alternative is slow starvation as a subsistence farmer, war gets more appealing.

So, my first question is why your Amazons haven't had their lands annexed by their faster-growing neighbors.

You could do it. Maybe the Amazons live on the other side of a river or something, and this provides a natural boundary line. The Amazons respond harshly whenever someone tries to carve out even a small farm in 'their' woods. But that's going to have a duality. You're nice to /your/ people, while being willing to murder the poor 3rd son of a farmer who's trying to get himself a half-acre of land and not hurt anyone.
