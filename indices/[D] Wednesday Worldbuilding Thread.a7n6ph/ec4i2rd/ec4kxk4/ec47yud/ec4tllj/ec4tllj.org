  What I'd like help with is suggestions for sexual and non-sexual interactions that capture a sense of emotional awakening.

I'm imagining a dialogue at the beginning of their interaction. The leaders (or interested parties if the amazons don't think in terms of leaders) are trying to decide whether to let him in or not. Before the discussion, to the MC's surprise, they invite him to be a part of it. He at least gets to contribute to the discussion of what will be done with him.

It is decided he will remain with them for a time. In light of the fact that his death would cause the apocalypse, he gets assigned guards. While learning the amazon's way of life over several days, he gets restless and bored. He doesn't hunt, he isn't skilled in non-hunting activities. He feels like he isn't contributing, and naturally he feels like he has to contribute to be of value (he grew up in the other cultures, after all.) The guards maintain their distance from him, knowing an emotional attachment to a man is a liability--but other members of the tribe might take advantage of having a willing reproduction partner in their midst. Traveling to the borders is a pain.

Reluctantly (his death would cause the apocalypse!) the guards agree to take him out on hunting expeditions so that he can stop feeling useless. He witnesses their approach to hunting, comes to terms with the fact that the merit-chosen amazon hunters are way better at it than him. Social interactions around the campfire abound. While he isn't the best hunter, he isn't the /worst/ either, and he befriends the companions over their shared work and interest in providing for the tribe. If he sleeps with one of them, it becomes a difficult situation--they similarly don't want an emotional attachment, he does. Maybe he decides to stop traveling with the hunting party when he realizes how much of a problem it would be to get monogamous feelings for one of the hunters.

Things are easier when they get back. The MC is now more enthusiastic about learning skills outside his comfort zone, having witnessed how the amazons foster growth instead of demanding competence. He starts to learn the patience and acceptance of the tribe in their endeavors.

Then something makes him leave.
