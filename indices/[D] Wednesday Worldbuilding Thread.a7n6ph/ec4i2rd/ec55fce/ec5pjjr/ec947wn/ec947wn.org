Here's an idea - FTL provides travel to another world which (at least within the galaxy) has costs (both time and money) largely /independent/ of the location of the start and end points.

Along with that, far-future terraforming technology is more than capable of (with large but not unattainable resources) terraform any world in the galaxy.

The net result of this is that there are just /so many/ habitable worlds that there are plenty of easily accessible empty worlds; and that, in turn, means that a group of settlers with a unified vision can pool their resources to create a colony on any world that they choose, running under any philosophy that they choose. Petty tyrants can create one-world slave empires, people can create societies where social position is defined by skill at Go, or whatever.

In this way, it's easy to imagine a few worlds which were purposely settled /without/ the supermajority civilisation - and unless they advertise their location, they won't be getting any immigrants either (unless a ship full of a new lot of settlers looking for an empty world pops up one day).
