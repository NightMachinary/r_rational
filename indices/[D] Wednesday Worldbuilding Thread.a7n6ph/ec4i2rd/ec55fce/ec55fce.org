Here's the vague outlines of an idea.

The most populous civilization - let's call them the Heralds - was the one to develop the FTL and distribute it to the other civilizations.

The Herald's FTL engines are obtusely designed and basically unserviceable except by trained Herald technicians. The technicians are almost cult-like in their secrecy. There are plenty of alien firms who have built knockoff drives, but those are still heavily based on the Herald Drives, and the software is just a straight copy. The knockoffs tend to be unreliable, and the Heralds refuse to service drives that weren't made by them, so the knockoffs aren't very common anyways.

The minority civilizations grumble about this economic control, but the Heralds provide the engines at a fair price and repair them incredibly cheaply, so there isn't a strong economic incentive to invest the huge amounts of capital needed to R&D a new non-herald design from scratch. (And the Heralds sabotage such projects.)

Why all this effort to maintain control of the FTL engine tech? Because each engine has the mind of a Herald inside. Choose either an AI based on a scanned Herald mind, or some sort of nasty biotech stuff, depending on your preferred aestethic.

These engineminds monitor the cargo of the ships they're warping, and if they catch a whiff of anthing dangerous (like a megalaser), well... everyone knows that FTL ships just sometimes never arrive at their destination. Oh well. That's a danger of the technology.
