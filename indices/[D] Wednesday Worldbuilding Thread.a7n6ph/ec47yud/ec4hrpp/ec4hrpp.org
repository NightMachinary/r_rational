I'd have to wonder how open and empathetic these Amazons would be to having/helping a man in their territory. In order for a group of people to self segregate as these Amazons do, they'd have to have fairly strong opinions about their outgroup/s, I'm having trouble rationalizing how this wouldn't ultimately be driven by strong negative prejudices towards men. If you were to frame this by race instead of gender, the Amazons would essentially be an ethnostate which I think kind of de-romanticizes this scenario and alludes to what sort of people self segregate to this degree. I'm just imagining how a black person walking into a white ethnostate would be received and I'm not seeing empathy and acceptance. Perhaps the Amazons and the guy could use each other to work through their toxic ideologies and misconceptions together, but I could just as easily imagine the guy having his toxic ideas reinforced after being met with bigotry from the Amazons (which could be an interesting way to challenge him later in the story after having made progress away from his own toxic behaviors/beliefs). Maybe a matriarchal society would work better to represent what the Amazons are meant to represent without the baggage that a uni-gender society would carry? Also, if there's going to be polyamory that isn't purely between women, what sort of birth control is available, if any?
