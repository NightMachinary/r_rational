>Perhaps an important facet I failed to emphasize is that the 'amazons' are, like, decent people in general. Is that hard to believe? ... They see the other cultures as misguided and orthogonal to their own culture, but not from a bigoted perspective.

I guess my point is that for full segregation like they have, it's going to take a little more than minor cultural differences. Not allowing any men in their society would require them to believe all men are incapable, on a biological level, of integrating into their society, so much so that they are clearly getting rid of their male children (unless they only produce females?). Even if the segregation is somehow purely ideological, you could relate it to immigration bans on Muslims, and depending on your views there, it might not cast a very flattering light on the Amazons. If you're preventing anyone that subscribes to a specific ideology from entering your society you must think their ideology is extremely abhorrent, which is either because it is that abhorrent or there's bigotry involved (and the beliefs of the non-Amazons doesn't sound that bad).

>I'm curious why you ask.

Your description of the Amazon's society felt kind of bonobo-esque (very sexually active) but it also sounded like they only use men when they want babies. If you intend to have the guy have sex with the Amazons and for them to be open to this it's either cuz they want babies or they have some means of birth control so it isn't a factor, idk. Also, if the society is all female maybe they're aborting male children? I don't remember why I even asked that part.
