  It's interesting to think about but I'm doubtful that it's taking us toward meaningful story content.

These kinds of questions are vital to the interactions and story you want to write.

If the culture of the Amazons weren't important to the story, then sure, you could just paint them as generically good and ignore the implications of their societal structure. That's fine.

But if you're interested in writing a story about a man overcoming his toxic masculinity and learning to value other people and cultures, then having those people and cultures be fully realized is pretty dang important. If you just set up a paper-thin society of woman whose entire existence revolves around furthering the growth of the main character (and having consequence-free sex with him?!), then you haven't fully internalized the message that you want to convey.

(By the way, is this story a Legend of Zelda fic?)
