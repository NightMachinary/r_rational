That's a really good point. You could explain his restlessness as wanderlust instead of dissatisfaction, in that case--and maybe when he gets back, he has a new appreciation but never intends to stay.

  it carries a sense of secrecy, like such an encounter is clandestine and only likely to happen away from their society

Wouldn't all of their encounters with men be that way? Indeed, deciding to go on a hunting trip might subtly signal that you want children--it would give you a reason to travel to the border. The actual man you meet would of course not be seen by most of your people, making it seem clandestine. "Hunting" to this society could have a double meaning.

Our hapless MC won't know he's volunteering to travel with a (higher than background rate) of women who want to reproduce or otherwise seek out men, which might be a fun surprise. He'll get a second surprise, when most of them prefer to wait for a greater selection rather than use him. After all, if they were actually interested in him as a reproductive partner, they would have asked him while he was at the village instead of bothering with the trip in the first place.

Or maybe most of the hunters he travels with like hunting for its own sake. The culture's double association with traveling isn't very likely to be universal, just like such associations in other cultures.
