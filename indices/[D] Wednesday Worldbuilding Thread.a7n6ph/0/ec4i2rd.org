I seem to have run into an issue regarding what happens when you have a galaxy with multiple intelligent civilizations, ubiquitous FTL, but only one civilization surpassed K1 by the time of said FTL, meaning that said civilization outpopulates all the others combined by a factor of 2000, being generous to the smaller civilizations.

It's supposed to be a tentative Pax Galactica, where technology permits nondestructive solutions to a majority of problems that would otherwise be resolved through violence, effectively post-scarcity, the lowest population worlds extra peaceful courtesy a mix of native culture, the tech, and probably convenient timing of contact.

Aside from such a massive population ruining some plot-points, it raises a few issues, the most glaring of which is the massive power imbalance. There's US states getting 2 senators when a couple cities outpopulate some states, then there's 2000:1, or more accurately, 200000:120:20:15:5. I could put half of the big civ into Virtual Utopias and the problem would be unaffected.

There's also the slight problem of whether or not any propulsion lasers still exist, or how difficult it would be to police their production. The level of Orwellian surveillance necessary to track everything that could be used to sneak off, build a superweapon, and bring it home is mindboggling. (FTL is designed such that it does not work as kinetic weapon, there is somewhat Orwellian surveillance in place to catch more easily-detected locally-made weapons, nothing that could stop someone from flying off somewhere, making a bunch of gunpowder, and coming home with viable gunpowder weapons, but those would be caught before entering effective range. By the time anyone notices that someone brought a megalaser home, it doesn't seem implausible that it could have already been fired.)

It also seems likely that, due to the numbers, these people would be a supermajority /everywhere/, unless there is a strong disincentive to emigrate or vacation to certain places. I can imagine a "minimal impact" policy that would discourage supermajorities of this group from popping up on inhabited planets, but I don't want them to just not be elsewhere /at all/. If there's some kind of quota system, I'm not sure how it would be enforced, or how the enforcers would decide who gets to go to a protected place.

I'd also like to minimize things that look like totalitarianism, and while I can see FTL-capable vehicles being manufactured with automated reporting, and /maybe/ (big maybe) some way to be overridden remotely, actually using that for anything short of preventing terrorism and warcrimes is anti-preferred. It probably helps that, while things overall are post-scarcity, FTL-capable vehicles might still be costly to obtain. Given a K2-sized civ that could use FTL to set up production anywhere, I'm not sure how believable that is, but I suppose production might be artificially limited due to the impossibility of effectively policing.

I'm sure there are other issues not coming to mind at present. Feedback on how to deal with this is appreciated.
