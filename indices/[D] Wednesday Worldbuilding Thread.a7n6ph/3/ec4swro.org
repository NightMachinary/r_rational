- memories and records about the past are not guaranteed to be true, even for the past of only several days ago. There are tools / powers available in the world that make it relatively easy for a creature or a group to forge 100% genuine-looking objects, memories, and records even en masse.
- information about the present is not guaranteed to be true. It's relatively easy to implant false knowledge, false long-term and sort-term memories, false sensory input information in a single creature or in a group of creatures.
- a creature's knowledge about themselves is not guaranteed to be true. There is a high likelihood that the creature will discover about themselves to be a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror][tomato in the mirror,]] a simulated consciousness, an artificial personality created by someone/something else only hours, minutes, or moments ago, etc.
- a creature's physical appearance, core and peripheral personality traits, muscle memories, acquired reflexes, etc can be permanently changed relatively easily.
- most inhabitants of the setting are aware how elusive and unstable the world around them and their knowledge about it are.
