How would a battle play out between a superpowered army consisting of only said superpowered infantry and a combined arms land force(Armor, artillery, infantry) of equal numbers? In this scenario, the superpowered army is assaulting an enemy city from the north.

The powers range from standard elementary powers to classic sci-fi energy shields (health bars, really) to 'hax' like teleportation and intangibility. In general, the firepower or protection offered by the powers are not significantly more powerful than the military equivalent, but packed within an infantry's associated cost and benefits. It is also notable that they haven't received much formal training, so a strategy would likely to be more effective if they played to the individual's strength rather than advanced military knowledge and steadfast discipline.

One likely plan of attack would be infiltration in my opinion. Send a small team of select powers to the city and scout out the positions, numbers and leadership, capturing important people and sabotaging where possible, eventually weathering down the opposition until a direct confrontation is trivial. However, I feel a strict entrance/exit control can easily shut it down without including power that is excessively powerful.

How would you suggest an order of battle?
