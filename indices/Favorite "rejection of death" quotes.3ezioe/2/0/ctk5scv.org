The Lovecraft quote reminds me of a variation from /Caleum Est Conterrens/:

#+begin_quote
  For strange aeons had come to pass, and death itself had indeed finally died, and that which the long dead would have called the real was strange, and the living lived only because of the benevolent grace of an eternal lie.
#+end_quote

Not really the sort of quote you were looking for, I know.
