It's funny, but shonen anime is actually a great source for these kinds of quotes, as their plots and themes frequently revolve around refusal to accept the status quo, and the power of Human Intellect And Will to overcome just about any challenge, no matter how impossible.

Literally every popular quote from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann can be applied here.

  The tomorrow we're trying to reach is...not a tomorrow you've decided on! We... by ourselves... choose our tomorrow from the infinite universes! We will fight through it... we will fight through it and protect the universe!
