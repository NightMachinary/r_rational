I'm not sure why you set the sell rate for crystals different to the buy rate. I'm not sure it serves any purpose, and it really only serves to make micromanagement slightly more inconvenient.

Having to reload the page and start over any time you want to slightly tweak something is a bit annoying, i'm not really sure why you changed it.

Unless you have a really good reason to keep it the way it is I would recommend you change it back, for ease of use.
