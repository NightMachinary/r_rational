Hmm it does see though that since so few things actually grant you vitalite (compared to the other gems) if you want to succeed that route it would make sense to go all out and punishing refunds isn't going to make a difference.

As for the refunding things after you used them to get a skill, well that's a blatant exploit/cheat, and if they are willing to do that then I can't imagine why they wouldn't just pick a more powerful background starting out, it's not like there's a penalty. Also even with the refund penalty that doesn't in theory make that exploit no longer effective, it just makes it slightly less efficient.

Honestly the only way I can think of to exploit the system if refunds weren't penalized, would be to refund a bunch of magicite (since so many things give you that) and then use that to get a bunch of vitalite.

The problem with trying to do that is that magicite is just more valuable than vitalite. You can do more with magicite than you can with vitalite, for instance indestructibility and other such abilities render most of the highest tier vitalite abilities pointless.

This is hardly something I would blame you for however, in pretty much every rpg at high levels magic always outstrips brawn.

So yeah to reiterate: refunding penalties only make a difference, if the game gives you a whole bunch of one resource, and another resource is more valuable. However your game gives you mostly magicite and and spiritite which are also the resources you need for any remotely optimized build. So in reality I see the refund penalty as kind of a unnecessary annoyance.
