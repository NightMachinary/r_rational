Yea all good points... I think I need to work on balancing the gems and ability costs and everything.

The other main purpose of vitalite is for healing afflictions, which is a feature I haven't implemented. Basic idea would be that opportunities have a chance of causing afflictions, which could cost more to heal than the benefits of the opportunity; so that everything you choose is a gamble. Could also be extended to getting skills, ie. picking up teleporting could get you splinched, etc. The more opportunities you pick up, the more afflictions you'd wind up getting. This would also act to counterbalance unscrupulous characters simply picking up all the opportunities.
