Thanks, you have no idea how happy I am that you thought deeply enough about the lore and worldbuilding to notice these issues!

The idea is supposed to be

- Ruby + the blood of the ritually slain = vitalite
- Vitalite is a measure of life force; it is the sum total of 1) your innate life force, 2) any loose vitalite you're carrying; 3) any vitalite you've swallowed; 4) any vitalite inset in artifacts you're carrying.
- Sapphire + luminaria = magicite
- Magicite is a measure of skill versatility; it is the sum total of 1) your bloodline's versatility, 2) any loose magicite you're carrying; 3) any magicite you've swallowed; 4) any luminaria you've taken into yourself; 5) any magicite inset in artifacts you're carrying; 6) any spells you've learned.
- Onyx + the soul trapped within it = spiritite
- Spiritite is a measure of magical power; it is the sum total of 1) your bloodline's power, 2) any loose spiritite you're carrying; 3) any spiritite you've swallowed; 4) any spiritite inset in artfacts you're carrying; 5) power gains from spellcasting practice. But it is /also/ a measure of intellectual power, since it's spiritual/mental power; /and/ it can be inset into your minions (which 'reserves' your spiritite).
- You can also extract your own innate life force / bloodline power etc, and put it into gems (though obviously not learned spells / power gain from spellcasting practice).

The underlying problem is that

- I don't want there to be too many numbers at the top of the page (Age of Empires 2 has 4 resources, and that's already a hassle, etc);
- I want the numbers to be something concrete and physical as it's easier to relate to and easier to depict (gemstones) and which make sense as something tradable;
- I want to include a lot of variety and comprehensive worldbuilding, which involves a wide variety of aspects, much of which can't be condensed into 'gems'.

But because I can only use 4 numbers (3 gem types + gold), these different things have to get aggregated. So you wind up with like 30 spiritite when maybe 10 of that is coming from spellcasting experience and another 10 from bloodline potency, etc.

There's also the issue that yes, I need to somehow identify/deactivate those skills you don't have sufficient spiritite for.

Also, thanks for catching that, I'll have to update the Soul Trapping description.
