One other thing. The purple numbers are Spiritite required to actually cast your spells as I understand it. (I assume this doesn't use up the spiritite but that isn't explicit.) Do I have to actually carry it all around? How heavy will my bag have to be to cast temporal alteration 2?

AHEM, sorry distracted, I was saying, the CYOA prevents you from buying an ability if you would have less Spiritite than the purple number after buying it. But what you can do is buy an ability that requires Spiritite... and then sell it all, or use it all on mental things, etc.

The CYOA should either not let you do that, or specify in the final synopsis that you can't actually cast any of your spells until you come across more Spiritite.

Also out of pure curiosity... Vitalite is concentrated life and blood. Spiritite comes from trapped souls according to Soul Entrapment. Magicite... well, Soul Trapping does mention trapping souls in Magicite, but that feels like it might be a typo. Other than that the only mention is finding Magicite in ruins. Where does it actually come from? Mysteries upon mysteries....
