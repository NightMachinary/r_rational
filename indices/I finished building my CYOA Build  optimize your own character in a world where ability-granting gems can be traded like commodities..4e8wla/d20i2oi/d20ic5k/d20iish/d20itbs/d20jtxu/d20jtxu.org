Well yes I suppose this won't be a problem for everybody. However someone like me can't rest, until I have achieved the maximum efficiency!

And if getting the best build requires using pen and paper then it kind of renders the whole code kind of pointless, because if you are doing the math yourself then you might as well just consult a written list of the options.

Also I'm not sure what you mean when you worry about them being interchangeable, I'm just not sure what specific scenario you hope to avert?
