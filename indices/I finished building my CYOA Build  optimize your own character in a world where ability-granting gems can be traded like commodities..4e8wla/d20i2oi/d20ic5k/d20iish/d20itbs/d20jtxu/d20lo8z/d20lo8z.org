well, the situation where someone picks options that add a lot of vitalite to start them off, then instead of getting physical abilities they roll it all over into magicite and get spellcasting abilities instead... or where someone picks up a prereq for an opportunity to get the extra points then rolls their points into another ability to get extra points from a different opportunity, etc.

The point isn't exactly to get the most min/maxed build, though I'm sure that's a major interest to people on [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. It's also to build a character according to how you'd want them to be; in other words, qualitative rather than quantitative.
