Sure. Well, if it were all just perfectly interchangeable then there'd be no difference between the 4 resources, and everything then just simplifies into being a single cost. This way I make the distribution of the 4 resources you get actually matter in a small way. Much the same way as the market in AoE 2 having a bid-ask spread makes you consider your options more carefully, I think this makes for more careful consideration of options before making a decision. I've noticed that in the games I've played, I tend to pay closer attention to the details of each option, and weigh things in my mind more, when I can't respec costlessly.
