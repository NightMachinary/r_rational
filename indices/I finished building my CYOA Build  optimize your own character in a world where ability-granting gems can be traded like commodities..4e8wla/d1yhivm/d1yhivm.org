Pfft. I don't know what everyone else is whining about [[https://i.imgur.com/o7UxDBR.png][seems balanced to me]] I wasn't even able to buy everything! only like, half.

Edit: Oh also, I found myself unable to buy Sigil Invention or Magicite Discovery for some reason. I had the prerequisites, no box came up telling me I needed something, I just clicked to no effect.

Edit2: Also, from a story perspective, why was I only able to find one virgin maiden to sacrifice? Surely I couldve extorted a yearly tithe of virgin maidens out of the nobles of the land to continuously increase my power. Speaking of which, I start with 250 cash for being royalty, but extorting the royals only gives me an additional 125! What gives! I'm assasinating these cheapasses first thing.
