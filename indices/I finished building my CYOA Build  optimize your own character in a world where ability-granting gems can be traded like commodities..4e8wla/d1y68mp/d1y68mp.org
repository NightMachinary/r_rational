  You grew up an orphan on the streets of a town or city. You have nothing to your name. You travel from village to village, singing of epic tales and great deeds done. Along the way you start to learn from them, and become a sort of jack of all trades.

  As a reborn god of Luminara, you have pure divine essence invested within you. Unbridled power radiates from your very skin. Your family acquired you the services of a tutor in the magical arts. From youth you had learned the ways of spellcasting, and now it flows from you with almost instinctive ease.

There doesn't seem to be any disadvantages to purely picking options that give the most resources. If certain opportunities were only accessible by a slave, for instance, people might be incentivized to try for characters of weaker backgrounds.

Unique take on the concept! Feels like a good beginning to a fun text-based adventure game.
