Depending on your starting resources it seems either horribly broken or ridiculously weak.

Given that you can freely convert between gold and the magic gems having multiple resources is just annoying because of having to convert between them to meet prerequisites. Choosing magical blood gives you magicite and spiricite but nothing stops you from going to the conversion area and converting it into gold and then into vitalite. The simplest way to fix the problem in the short term would be to change the error code to perform automatic conversions of your resources to obtain whatever is missing

There is way too many options. You have 20 categories of abilities for goodness sake. The mistform, flameform, earthform and so on abilities render most other regeneration and physical durability enhancements irrelevant.

I think the abilities should be divided into three main categories based on whether they are physical, spiritual or magical enhancements.

Physical would contain the regeneration, immortality, shapeshifting, sensory options (excluding mage sight universal communication and animal communication.). It would also contain the resistance abilities and transformative abilities (excluding transmutation)

Mental would contain all the intellectual abilities, psychic abilities, soul abilities, command abilities and some eldritch abilities.

Magic would contain the vorpal, metamagic, abjuration, corporeal, temporal and elemental abilities, universal communication and animal communication

Life stealing kiss and life granting kiss are excessive. You only need the touch options. I'm also not sure how the youth stealing works with eternal youth and regeneration.

Doom marking, unhealing, Pain wracking and blood parasitism don't really deserve to be separate options. You only really need one excruciating death curse. (The biological options would render blood parasitism redundant anyway). The same thing with Banishment, Reality Tearing and Annihilation. You only need one erase from existence spell and they are kind of redundant with disintegration from energy casting. ( I understand that they are different in that planar travel counters banishment but it's still a boring choice for a player to make. If someone is immune to conventional attacks and banishment then you are probably out of your league in any case (particularly with the high cost of planar travel)

The illusion abilities seem largely useless compared to the other options, especially with how cheap true sight is. The camouflage option only lets you camouflage your skin which is blatantly useless and embarrassing. The telekinesis options are similarly boring.

Water walking should be in the same category as water breathing not in telekinesis with the other option.

I do like the art though and the design of the layout, it's quite nice. I have noticed the background image stutters when I scroll with the mouse. It might just be my browser but I think it might be that you are respositioning it using javascript in which case I'd suggest you change it to use CSS with background-attachment:fixed;
