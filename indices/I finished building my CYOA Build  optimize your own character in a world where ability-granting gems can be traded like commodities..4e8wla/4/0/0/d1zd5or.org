Lore wise I don't see how your medieval society avoids becoming a technologically advanced transhumanism mess ruled by warring god kings that horde all the magical enhancement stones. Having some abilities more powerful per unit cost is fine the problem is that it's just the more expensive abilities that give more bang for your buck. For example acute hearing is one vitacite and eternal youth is nine when acute hearing is nowhere near ninth the value that eternal youth is. The pattern holds true for other things as well such that a little bit of additional wealth can make a character an order of magnitude more powerful. It would be much more balanced if the earlier and cheaper upgrades were more powerful and getting additional advantages provided diminishing returns.

There are also so many abilities that you have no idea of the value of because you don't know the local meta-game. For example if there are a lot of stealthy people then 360 vision increases in value. If there are a lot of guards with 360 degree vision then buying stealth massively decreases in usefulness. A player cannot really make an informed choice without more knowledge about your setting. A number of other choices have similar issues banishment/planar travel, mental protection/mind altering, true sight/illusions and so on.

Choosing a challenge is perfectly fine though I find it odd that some starting backgrounds don't give you anything or only let you afford a single shard of vitacite.

You can further subdivide them if you want. The main purpose of the division is to allow players to focus on defensive, offensive or cognitive / trump-card abilities.

I've found out the stuttering was actually just the browser I was using at the time.
