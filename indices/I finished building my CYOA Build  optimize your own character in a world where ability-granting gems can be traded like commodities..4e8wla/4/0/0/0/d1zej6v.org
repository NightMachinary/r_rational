  Lore wise I don't see how your medieval society avoids becoming a technologically advanced transhumanism mess ruled by warring god kings that horde all the magical enhancement stones.

Yeah, I don't know either. :(

I didn't want magicite cost to be a min/maxing reflection of the utility of an ability, but rather the number of different subabilities making up that ability. For example firecasting is 3 because you can create, snuff out, and move fire; soul trapping is 2 because you can trap a soul and you can free it, etc. It also means firecasting 2 only costs 1 magicite and not say 10. Or, that's the general idea. Clearly didn't work out all that well since eternal youth is 9 when it should have just been 1. It makes sense from a lore wise approach (in the setting there's different kinds of magicite each granting its own distinct ability, and they wouldn't be priced the same; but that's far too complex to present in the website). I just don't know how to balance it.

  A player cannot really make an informed choice without more knowledge about your setting.

Good point! Any idea how I can get this into the website unobtrusively (ie lore)?

Some backgrounds are very poor because once again it makes sense from a lore perspective. Given how expensive powers are, being an orphan and being a laborer doesn't really make much of a difference, you aren't getting gems either way.

I updated the website with bid-ask spreads, and made the spellcasting sections start off collapsed. I also inserted a few pieces of writing to break up the monotony of the spellcasting lists, but I clearly need more lore.
