You raise a lot of good points!

I really should make the exchange have a bid-ask spread, like 4 gold to sell but 5 to buy, for each of the three gems.

I want to give users the opportunity to build characters the way they want, not just min/max the hell out of it. Lore-wise, it makes perfect sense that nobility will have more opportunities and thus get more powers than orphans, etc. But if users want to create an orphan character for more of a challenge / a character with weaker abilities, they have the option to do that too. Same with the abilities - some are more powerful per unit cost than others, but the point is to give users the opportunity to discover this for themselves. But I should have all those spellcasting sections start collapsed be expandable.

Having just three sections for abilities won't look good - the spellcasting abilities are far too extensive, and it'll be more overwhelming if I turned it into a single list.

I'm using background-attachment:fixed; . I never saw any stuttering. Could be a slow computer or something? :/
