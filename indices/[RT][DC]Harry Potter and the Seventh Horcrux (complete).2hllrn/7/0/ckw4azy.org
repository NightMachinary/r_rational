I agree. I've usually resorted to copy-and-pasting each post into Sigil (an epub generating program,) but that is both time consuming and opens up the work for infinite formatting errors. I would love a conversion option. (Not volunteering, of course. I have no programming expertise, but I would gladly cheer on and offer no real help to someone who can.)
