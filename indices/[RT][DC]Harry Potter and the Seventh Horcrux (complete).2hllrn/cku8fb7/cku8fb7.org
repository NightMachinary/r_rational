Shit, this was fantastic. I finished it in one sitting, and now I want more Harrymort. Or aspiring-Dark-Lord Hermione (which the author makes a surprisingly good case for, using only canon plot pieces, too). Or Bellaginny. Or Rose Weasley ([[#s][epilogue]]), or even Gilderoy Potter. Seriously. Just ... more.

On that note, insightful quote from [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/SeventhHorcrux][the TVT page]]:

  Voldemort is like the old person who doesn't understand computers at all, but knows that sometimes viruses cause them problems, so if something goes wrong with his computer he assumes it has a virus. Except the computers are people and the virus is love.
