I really enjoyed this fic. Although it wasn't rational, the author clearly put a lot of thought into it, and it was hilarious. I got lots of entertainment out of it. There were unique perspectives and I can say I'm glad this was posted. I will not downvote, even though I downvote off-topic non-rational fics I don't like. I'm horribly inconsistent this way.
