Yeah, I was debating back and forth about whether this fic could really be called rational. On the one hand, it has some really devious bits of munchkinry. On the other hand the main character is insane, which isn't rational at all.

In the end I posted it because while Harry isn't really rational, he looks at the world from a radically unique viewpoint. The fact that he imperioused himself means that he believes everything he says. His total inability to understand love or normal human interaction causes him to see things that everyone else misses. He exemplifies poor decisions well executed. He isn't really evil, so much as too clever for his own good while being totally lacking in empathy and foresight.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I think that exploring unusual ways of thinking and viewing the world is useful and relevant to this subreddit, and this fic has a viewpoint I haven't seen in any other piece of fiction. It features unique and interesting thinking, so it belongs here.

And of course, it's really funny.
