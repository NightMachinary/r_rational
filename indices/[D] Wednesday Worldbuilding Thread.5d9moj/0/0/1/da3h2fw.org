  I'm having a hard time imagining any situation where this could occur except in the case of an anarcho-capitalist society. It would require a kind of peculiar anarcho-capitalist society where particularly heinous actions like rape and murder are punishable by death, but no centralized legal system exists to arrest, convict, and execute people for doing such things.

Except that we have historical things like lynchings, where the act is "illegal" but no one actually gets punished for, investigations mysteriously stall out, or juries find in favor of the defendant despite overwhelming evidence. Or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honour_killing_in_Pakistan#Pakistani_law][honor killings in the Middle East]], where:

  An Amnesty International report noted "the failure of the authorities to prevent these killings by investigating and punishing the perpetrators." Honour killings are supposed to be prosecuted as ordinary murder, but in practice, police and prosecutors often ignore it.

Essentially, I'm imagining a world where sure, assassination is "illegal" but so long as a murder is clearly an assassination the investigation will have no time or money put into it, and no one will really expect it to result in consequences for anyone ... so long as it's done in a civilized fashion.

Is there any reason that you can't stitch your rules onto a more traditional pseudo common law system? That is, certain things are still illegal and tried/punished by the state, but other things fall into the realm of this extrajudicial system which the judicial system turns a blind eye to, or which has state approval.

The inside view being something like, "Do you remember the bad old days when assassination was illegal? We still had assassins and killings, but they were far more violent and brutal. Assassins these days are professionals. No one actually wants to go back to people hiring back alley assassins." Or "If you outlaw assassination, only outlaws will hire assassins. You're asking good people to unilaterally give up a method of remediation."
