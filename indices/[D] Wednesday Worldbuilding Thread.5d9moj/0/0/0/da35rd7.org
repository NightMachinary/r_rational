  You must exercise due diligence to verify that your target has indeed committed an action which justifies assassination. If your target did not actually commit any action to justify assassination yet you kill them anyway, then you and your employer both become justifiable targets of assassination.

You might not get a single assassins' *guild* with this (you could, but you don't have to), but this would probably mean the development of, so to speak, assassination firms, with separate arms for investigation and contract fulfillment.

Some firms might center around just one or a handful of assassins, while others might be much bigger.
