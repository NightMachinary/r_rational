As one example, look at lynching in America. The federal government didn't find it politically expedient to do much about lynching except in the most egregious cases, and at the state level many prosecutors, sheriffs, etc. were complicit in lynchings.

/Obviously/ lynching someone is illegal, but the lynch mob makes no attempt to hide or mask their violence, going so far as to send out post card commemorating the event and taking out ads in newspapers to announce it, the local and state police don't do anything about it, and the federal government doesn't act unless there are riots or national protests.
