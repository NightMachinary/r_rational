  In a world where assassination is legal, or illegal but with poor enforcement and tacit understanding that the police won't look into it too heavily, what spoken and unspoken rules govern assassinations?
#+end_quote

I'm having a hard time imagining any situation where this could occur except in the case of an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism][anarcho-capitalist]] society. It would require a kind of peculiar anarcho-capitalist society where particularly heinous actions like rape and murder are punishable by death, but no centralized legal system exists to arrest, convict, and execute people for doing such things. In lieu of that, private assassins could be hired to carry out death sentences against such people.

The rules would most likely be as follows:

- You must be part of an assassin's guild. If you are not, it is treated as a vigilante killing and you may be justifiably assassinated if you are caught or identified.

- You must be paid. If you are not, it is treated as a vigilante killing.

- You must have no relationship (family or close friendship) with the person who hires you, nor with the person you have been hired to kill. If you are related to the person who hires you, it is treated as a vigilante killing. If you are related to the person you kill, it is treated as unjustifiable assassination and you may be justifiably assassinated if you are caught or identified.

- You must exercise due diligence to verify that your target has indeed committed an action which justifies assassination. If your target did not actually commit any action to justify assassination yet you kill them anyway, then you and your employer both become justifiable targets of assassination.

- You must only kill the target you are hired for. You may incapacitate others who stand in your way, but you can be sued for their injuries. Killing anyone other than your target is treated as vigilante killing.

- You must kill your target in a humane way, offering a quick and close-to-painless death. Families can sue you for causing inhumane deaths.

- You must leave a unique calling card to identify your guild and to anonymously but uniquely identify yourself. This allows anyone you attacked in the process of your assassination to sue you indirectly through your guild. Suits for inhumane death can use the same process. Failure to leave your calling card is treated as a vigilante killing.

That basically gets you an anarcho-capitalist society with a death penalty. Really, really weird.
