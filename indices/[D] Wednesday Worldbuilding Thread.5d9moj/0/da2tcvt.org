I asked this on Discord, but here's a revised version of the question:

1. In a world where assassination is legal, or illegal but with poor enforcement and tacit understanding that the police won't look into it too heavily, what spoken and unspoken rules govern assassinations?

2. What do you expect to be true about a world where assassination is de facto legal with codified rules that govern it?

I want something like a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_duello][code duello]] for assassination, which probably requires building from both ends; the assassin rules answer half of the problems with the concept, while the worldbuilding answers the other half.

Terry Pratchett's Discworld has an institutionalized assassin's guild /which actually tries to make a bit of sense/ but it's also plastered over with humor. So far as I can see it, the rules there are:

1.  One assassin at a time.
2.  Assassinations are for large sums of money.
3.  No killing people not on contract (except maybe guards).
4.  Assassinations are not public things.
5.  No guns, no poisons.
6.  Assassination ideally takes place in the home or business.
7.  No torture.
8.  No robbery.
9.  Assassins must wear black.
10. Assassins must have style.

But that set of rules is largely playing the concept for laughs, rather than taking it deadly seriously (ha) as something which exists within the world as one of those screwed up things that makes sense for chaotic-agents-working-at-cross-purposes reasons but which doesn't make sense if you were building a society from the ground up. Much like dueling.

Edit: Another real-world example might be honor killings, though I don't really know much about them.
