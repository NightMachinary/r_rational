The joy there is vicarious triumph over impossible challenges.

No joy might be the reduction of an urchin or king to motes of dust or broken rubble over the course of 150,000 humorless words, followed by their death and a switch to a new protagonist halfway through the novel. Or perhaps the urchin or king rises again to greater heights over the next 150,000 words. Either way few readers will trudge through those first 150,000 thousand.

I don't think anyone wants to read a joyless novel unless it's a clearly structured exploration of a foreign mindset.
