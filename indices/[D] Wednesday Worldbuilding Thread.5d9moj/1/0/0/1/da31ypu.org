I think it depends on how audience members define a victory. I suffered from Darkness Induced Audience Apathy while reading Worm because I only saw Taylor as surviving rather than succeeding. Even if she kept defeating her adversaries, the situation she was in only seemed to get worse with little hope of reprieve.

It started to hit me after Leviathan and I finally stopped reading after Jack Slash and Bonesaw apparently escaped the city. That, on top of the death and destruction that had been caused and the clearly malicious conspiracy among the Protectorate, was just too much for me.
