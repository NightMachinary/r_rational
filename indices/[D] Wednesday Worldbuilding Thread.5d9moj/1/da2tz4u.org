Off topic: is there a Tuesday thread that didn't get posted? Or am I just imagining something?

What is the perfect amount of grimdark for world building? I mean, obviously, it depends on people's taste, but there has to be a pretty stable equilibrium. Shows like /Game of Thrones/ seem to be reasonably popular, but other gritty things seem to scare a small part of the market away.

Do you think rationalizing (rationalifying? sensibiliting?) a setting makes grimdark more tolerable? (ie. Worm, HPMOR) Or does it make the grimdark less tolerable, because it presents a paradigm where the only logical conclusion is saddening?
