The Vlad taltos novels have something like this. [[http://dragaera.wikia.com/wiki/Jhereg]]

It's fairly different in that theres the ability to resurrect someone if the body isn't to damaged and they haven't been killed with a weapon meant to prevent this. You end up with normal assassination being a sort of statement telling people to back off. The person assassinated wakes up a bit latter and someone had to pay quite a bit for the resurrection.

I also read a story recently where the government of a system was only in place so that it could fill what was mandated by a greater charter. As such they had no active police force and instead had bounties issued by the government. As there was no sanctioned police force resisting capture was perfectly legal. Killing a bounty hunter would meant that future ones would bring lethal force to bear immediately though and that your bounty could increase.
