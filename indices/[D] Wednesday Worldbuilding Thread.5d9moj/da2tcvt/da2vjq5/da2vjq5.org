The trouble with solving all your problems with murder is that if everyone does it, pretty soon most of the population will be dead. This is why dueling has been illegal for so much of history - it only glamorizes daring young men getting themselves pointlessly killed. It may be cool, but if too many people get themselves killed over trivial arguments, there won't be anyone left alive to actually run society.

So one reason assassination might have codified rules and traditions is to ensure that it doesn't happen very often. The victim is told ahead of time who wants them dead, and why, so that they have a chance to make amends and avoid their fate. Or to hire guards, or to bribe the assassin back, or in some other way resolve the situation. Rules of protocol for hiring assassins would delay the process further, ensuring that the would-be client cannot make a spur-of-the-moment decision in the throes of anger. Maybe they're very expensive to ensure that most people simply can't afford to hire an official assassin.

It would be a nuclear option for high-society types against each other, often invoked as a bluff but hardly ever used. One might threaten to assassinate someone simply to ensure that they don't go out in public, so they miss some important social event.
