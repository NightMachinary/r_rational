In C.J. Cherryh's Chanur series, one of the alien species (the Kif) have a society in which assassination is not merely legal, but an accepted part of said society. (In fact, not much is illegal in Kifish society - the law basically comes down to "Do Not Make The Hakkikt* Angry").

Some consequences of this include:

- All Kif are armed. All the time. Guns and knives.
- All Kif dress exactly the same way (long, hooded black cloaks). Anyone going after an individual Kif needs to first figure out which of the hundreds of cloak-wearing shapes is the one he is after.
- Attempting to kill a Kif will result in him defending himself (and it's not illegal for /him/ to kill, either).
- In Kifish society, "do this or I'll kill you" is not exaggeration; it is understood to mean the same as "you have a choice; complete this task or try to kill me first"
- If you value your life, you do not sneak up on a Kif.

From the point of view of other races, the Kif are commonly derided as bandits and pirates, and not without reason. They do not find employment on other races' ships, other races tend to give Kifish bars a wide berth, and it takes a certain amount of courage or stupidity to try to trade at a Kifish spaceport unless you know exactly what you're doing.

(Their society's really quite fascinating. It's pretty much a deconstruction of the Always Chaotic Evil trope)

*Hakkikt: - This word is probably best translated as "Prince" or "Leader". One can become the Hakkikt by killing the previous Hakkikt and then surviving.
