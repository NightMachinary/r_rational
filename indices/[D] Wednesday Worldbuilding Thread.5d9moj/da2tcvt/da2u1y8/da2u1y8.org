Taken from Dragon Age:

It's a game, part of a social dance, and informing someone a contract has been put on their life is mandatory courtesy for any respectable company of assassins.

--------------

While that sounds nice, in a society where assassination is commonplace at all, I can't imagine the most successful assassins needing to conform to rules like courtesy and assassin's codes. They'd be too stealthy, too competent to need to bother.

I can see a secret language of symbols, though, meaning a certain target is off limits. Whether it's because that person is a fellow assassin or another reason no one would know, hence the identity-obfuscating purpose behind the symbols. If anyone were to kill an off-limits target, all cooperating assassins agree to kill the defector in order to return to their Nash equilibrium. Few assassins will want the worry that comes with a constant risk of being assassinated.

I can see some assassins would want to hunt other assassins for sport - not sure what other rules would evolve from that threat.
