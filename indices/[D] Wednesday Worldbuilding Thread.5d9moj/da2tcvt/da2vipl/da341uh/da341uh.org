I don't know if it necessarily has to be anarcho-capitalistic, just effectively anarchic. Imagine a government that lacked the power to enforce its goals, but did keep a stable economy by having a stranglehold (or something similar on industry). This doesn't have to fully manifest itself - it could just be bad enough to warrant an improvised justice system. Remember, hired killers exist in real life too.
