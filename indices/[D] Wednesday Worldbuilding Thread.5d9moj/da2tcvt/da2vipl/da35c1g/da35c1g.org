For a one-off roleplaying game, I produced a dystopian society in which (among other things) everyone's life had a value based on previous investment and current wages. When people died there was money owed to the various parties who depended upon those individuals' output plus whatever debt they had accrued while educating themselves to the investors who had backed that education.

If that price were paid in advance, and certain legal obstacles were cleared, it was perfectly within the law to have someone killed.

Assassins operated as a side-business of some law offices, navigating the necessary loopholes and paying the necessary beneficiaries as well as carrying out the actual killing in a way that didn't step on any of the wrong persons' toes. So long as they were performing per a contract, they weren't liable for the death at all. It remained a business arrangement between their clients and their targets' assorted bag holders. As such, assassins could be flamboyant public figures rather than skulking in the shadows.

Private police operated in a similar way with regard to incidental deaths, injuries, and property damage.

All law was contract law, and absolutely everything could be settled in cash... or, in this case, the decaying [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freigeld][freigeld]] cryptocurrency that the tiny, bathtub-drowned government maintained via a negligible transaction tax on its secure federal exchanges.

The session focused on investigation and legal wrangling surrounding an assassination firm having killed somebody's decoy duplicate rather than the actual person... essentially a wrongful death suit issued by the decoy's relatives with the help of the decoy's employer: the original target.
