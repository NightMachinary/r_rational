A/N: Hey all, I'm posting this from sunny and beautiful Greece. I hoped you liked the chapter. I will do my best to post the next chapter next week on sunday and get back to something approximating a consistent update schedule.

I spent a lot of time trying to decide on the Haku POV in this chapter: My beta reader said I should leave it out because it diminishes tension to have a segment from the villain's perspective right before the fight (instead of leaving the reader in the dark), but I left it in because I liked the segment. What do you guys think? Good decision or not?
