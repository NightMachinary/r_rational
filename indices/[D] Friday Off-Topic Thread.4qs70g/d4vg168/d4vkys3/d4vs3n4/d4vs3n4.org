  If you are not caught up yet, the most recent episode will be suffering of a very different kind than just being killed over and over.

Just caught up yesterday. It was great and he deserved it. Their relationship felt [[#s][Re:Zero]]

Hopefully he gets better afterwards, I read the author hates harem and classical shounen tropes and made the story to break from them so hopefully he grows beyond the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero][Idiot Hero]] trope.

I thought of making a fic with Kazuma ending up in the Re:Zero world, I guess I'll add it to the endless pile of ideas that haven't been able to start LOL

  If you are still on Hiragana, I found tofugu to be great for both Hiragana and Katakana. Also this drag and drop exercise

Thanks for the resources! Currently was using spaced repetition with [[http://ankisrs.net][Anki]] but that site looks neat, will check.
