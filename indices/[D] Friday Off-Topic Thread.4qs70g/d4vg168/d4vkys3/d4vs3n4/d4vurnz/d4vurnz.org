Wanikani is another site that uses spaced repetition, although it assumes you know all Hiragana and starts with radicals and kanji. It's free for the first few weeks, and I found it helpful. That said, it only teaches you about 100 kanji per month, so lots of people just do the free levels and then switch over completely to Anki.
