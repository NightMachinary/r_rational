Yeah, I would definitely say mixed. I think that it's really weird that it's only /sometimes/ a deconstruction of anime tropes, while other times playing them completely straight. It makes the anime tropes that it's playing straight stand out way more than they should and creates a tonal inconsistency that I find really grating.

Subaru only sort of works as a character and I feel like he's inconsistent or off-kilter somehow, beyond just what they're trying to do with the deconstruction. Yes, I do want to shake him like a baby, but I think what bothers me is that I don't feel like he's a hundred percent /real/. I'm having trouble articulating it, but everytime I see the comments on [[/r/anime]] justifying some aspect of the character, it feels like they're talking about someone I wasn't actually watching. I'm fine with having a protagonist with all sorts of fault, so long as they're eventually punished for them, but it's the characterization at the heart of the show that doesn't quite sit right with me. (Most of the other characters are quite flat at this point, though the Rem stuff made me hopeful that there will be more depth in the future.)

So yeah, it's strange and uneven, but I'm willing to stick with it.
