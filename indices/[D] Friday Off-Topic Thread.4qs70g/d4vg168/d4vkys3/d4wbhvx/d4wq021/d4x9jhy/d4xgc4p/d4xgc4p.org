I'm missing the right vocabulary for this.

Usually, in a deconstruction, you replace the cliché protagonist with an actual human being and watch how all the setting's assumptions catch fire.

But Subaru is not an actual human being. He's your bog-standard Hollywood-zombie anime protagonist. He just happens to be /in the wrong genre/ for his brand of cliché.

So he gets messed up, and that's really unusual and interesting to watch. It just isn't how a /real human being/ would get messed up. It's a robot going "ERROR ERROR I HAVE NOT BEEN PROGRAMMED FOR DESPAIR", with increasingly frantic attempts to stick to what he was /born/ to be.
