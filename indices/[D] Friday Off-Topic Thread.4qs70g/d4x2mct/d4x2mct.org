Tried out the M&M pen and paper gaming system today with a new group, and I'm pretty happy with how it went. I need to re-think my character a bit now that I know how things work, but the group itself seems like a lot of fun.

If people want to arrange more games, there's a discord channel set up where players can co-ordinate, though I think the games we've got at the minute are mostly full.
