Basically, it's like D&D but instead of each player controlling a character, all the players jointly control a single character. This is usually done via voting. The character interacts with the rest of the world as written by the author, but character sheet generation and certain key decisions are up to the players. It's usually expected that the author use some kind of RPG system as a base to provide a framework for character generation and actions.

I wrote Shinji Quest in an attempt to do daily writing and hit 50,000 words. It's not actually great writing, but I don't think I'd have been able to write so much without the quest framework to motivate me.
