As far as I'm aware, some operate according to an established structure of stats and skills (like a slimmed-down version of D&D) and give only some liberty to the DM/GM/QM; others roll with only the vaguest stats and penalties and give tons of liberty to the DM/GM/QM (e.g., Roll to Dodge); and still others have no die rolls at all and let the DM/GM/QM use his unfettered judgment. Formats vary /very/ widely.

Both 4chan (the new /qst/ board) and Sufficient Velocity (the Quests subforum) contain many easily-perusable examples of the various kinds of interactive stories, and I occasionally see similar endeavors on FIMFiction.net. (FanFiction.net has banned them.)
