The quest I was writing, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shinji-quest-bleach-fate-stay-night-crossover-complete.389478/][Shinji Quest]], has come to an end with 55,000 words. It's the longest thing I've written, and I almost didn't complete it. I'm glad I did. It felt good to actually complete something, even if it's just a quest.

I've started my new quest, [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/national-spirit-an-empire-quest.29956/][National Spirit]], and I have high hopes for it.
