I think it's worth distinguishing between individual pieces of intellectual property and categories/genres of them.

Individual works can lose value when they get replaced by something better, get more competition (of roughly equal quality), or else saturate their markets. They also lose value whenever their entire genre does as well.

Genres/categories don't lose value nearly as quickly or as much. For example, I can't see "transportation" or "communication" becoming less valuable in total, despite trains and post offices losing business. Things like "propaganda" and "Morality tales (for one specific set of morals)" /can/ lose value over the entire genre.

Technologies only lose value when it is replaced by something better. Literature can lose value when the culture shifts away from it as well.
