I agree with you, but I'm not at all an economist. My reasoning is basically:

There are a limited number of sentient beings the planet can support (even if you go fully transhuman and convert the people to ems and the planet to computronium). Assuming that we want the term "value" to have any meaning, then there's a limit on the amount of value that a single person can place on ... well, everything they value. If you push a mind to the limit, you can get a single person to value saturation, where it's no longer possible to create more value for them. If this is the case for all minds, then no additional value can be created, and the economy as a whole is no longer growing.

I don't know how long that would take, but that's a scenario where (I believe) you reach the end of economic growth with a single planet's budget.
