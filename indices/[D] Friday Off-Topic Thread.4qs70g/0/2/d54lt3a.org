As usual, the "Parable of the Skills Gap" post has reminded me how terrible I am at understanding extended metaphor. Somewhere buried in the comments somebody explains what real situation each parable is meant to evoke (which I definitely did not understand on my own) and even so, I still feel like I'm missing something. I get the feeling that Ozy had a fundamental /point/ to zer post, and I have no idea what it was. This is a feeling I experience very frequently with extended allegories where the exact correspondences are not made explicitly clear.
