I think the essay's point on new art being a drain on the economy is wrong. When it comes down to it, actual monetary resources are the only things expended on movies - the human effort and material effort is low. The effect is to make a few people rich, and facilitate economic flow for the rest of us. The point being that the trade in entertainment resources is an important part of the economy, and with the presence of digital media the only way to /effectively/ trade entertainment is by making something new.

His point about copyright somehow reinforcing the entertainment industry is, to put it lightly, completely fucking retarded. I don't know how someone could draw this conclusion (an irrational hate-boner for copyright or something) but it is most definitely wrong. Remember what I said in the last paragraph, about how the presence of digital storage and the internet made trading old works obsolete? Copyright deals exclusively in the rights of (now digital) distribution - that is, who is the one making money off of that Netflix deal. It's one of the /very/ few pillars making traditional media distribution possible. Taking it away would strengthen the ability of content creators, not stop the tide of art and artistry.

If you want to get a glimpse at where entertainment is headed, look at YouTube or DeviantArt - on DA, artists will take commissions (normal) to create a drawing that anyone can download and mess around with (not normal). The artist has made the money and the reputation, and the commissioner has the right to use the picture for commercial works. But if you want to gaze at the picture, hoping to find inspiration? Well go right ahead - it's not in a museum, it's on DeviantArt! In fact, there's nothing stopping you from downloading it and printing off your own poster, so long as you don't sell it. On YouTube, the majority of money made off of a video is made within the first month. After that, it's up to you to make a new video so that you can continue your profits. To a normal viewer, it's free - so long as you are willing to watch a fifteen second advertisement, the only limit on your time watching YouTube is your time. A producer might cut a sponsorship deal with something like Crunchyroll or Audible, but that goes on behind the scenes. Most advertisement is unobtrusive, so as to not scare off the audience. In both the case of YouTube and DeviantArt, the content and the distribution is basically free, but the creator is paid and the audience is satisfied.

There are still a few kinks to work out, but that's the direction I think /all/ entertainment is going.
