I'm seriously starting to wonder whether training like an athlete is worth it for me anymore. It's incredibly enjoyable, and I adore being strong and becoming stronger as a powerlifter, but the injuries are starting to become a problem, and for now I'm not willing to get on drugs, which would help a lot with injuries and recovery.

On the other side, if I drop to a bodybuilding routine I would stop being competitive, and I do enjoy meets a lot, both for the competition and for the people.

Guess I'll continue until I'm either willing to get on drugs or I get injured enough that I can't compete regardless.
