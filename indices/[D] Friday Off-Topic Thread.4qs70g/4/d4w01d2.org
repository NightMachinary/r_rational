How do you make modern gunpowder from scratch?

Black powder is comparatively easy for me to understand; find a surface source of sulfur, make a nitrary using manure and urine for saltpeter, burn wood to get charcoal, then mix them 10:75:15. Each step there is complicated with steps I don't exactly know, but at a high level I have little trouble with it.

But how would you go about making modern smokeless powders (or even something like cordite) from base materials if you didn't have access to modern supply chains?

Edit: Alright, someone correct me if I'm wrong. To make cordite you need nitroglycerin, nitrocellulose, and petroleum jelly.

Nitrocellulose is made by dipping cotton into nitric acid. To make nitric acid, you run air through an electric current to create hot nitric oxide. This combines with atmospheric oxygen to create nitrogen dioxide. You dissolve that in water to create the nitric acid. So all we really need for base materials are water, cotton, and a powerful electric arc (the last one not really being a problem for my purposes).

Nitroglycerin is made from white fuming nitric acid, sulfuric acid, and glycerol. You make WFNA by purifying nitric acid (somehow) and leaving a specific amount of water (again, somehow). Sulfuric acid can be made by burning sulfur with saltpeter in the presence of water. Glycerol can be made by gathering animal tallow and adding lye; it's part of the process for making soaps. Mix that all together in the right way to get nitroglycerin.

Petroleum jelly ... that's a comparatively harder thing to get, it seems, but I don't know what function it serves in cordite and whether it can be replaced with a material that doesn't require comparatively modern and infrastructure heavy natural gas. Chemistry is a weak point for me.

If any chemists are reading this, I'd like to know whether I can somehow get by without sulfur, natural gas, or any petroleum products, or any exotic metals (and I'm hoping that the answer is no, because I'd like for sulfur mines to be a plot point).
