...I couldn't tell you how it was done from memory, but I do know that in Jules Verne's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mysterious_Island][The Mysterious Island]] a group of characters, shipwrecked on an island, manage to use what natural materials they find in the area to create quite a lot of stuff from scratch... including nitoglycerin (can't remember off-hand why they needed it, but I do remember that the process /was/ described). Quite possibly gunpowder as well, but I'm less sure about that one.
