Years long lurker here posting for the first time, hello everyone! With all the awesomely intelligent and creative people here I wanted to ask some quick questions:

I've been recently wanting to recreate my online ID's and was wondering how everyone else runs theirs. I currently run 3 groups of emails and account: personal, professional, and fun(gaming/reddit/reading). With overlap between personal and professional I've decided to merge the two as best I can. The current debate I'm having is weather or not to merge my fun account into it. So I was wondering how everyone here felt/thought. Do you keep your online personalities separate from each other? From your personal identity?

Also: I'm a avid note taker/theorizer/research compiler kind of person and I've realized that OneNote is becoming/is a mess once you reach a point. Does anyone have any suggestions on all the different software out there for personal databases? I'm currently honed in on ConnectedText but was wondering if anyone here had any hands on experience with other systems?
