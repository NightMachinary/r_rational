In playing /[[https://www.gog.com/game/star_wars_tie_fighter_special_edition][Star Wars: TIE Fighter]]/ a few days ago ([[https://youtu.be/e1GegZSOblA?t=21m18s][video]]), I was reminded of one of /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Vehicles][GURPS]]/'s most awesome optional rules: [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42443024/Dogfighting%20Combat.html][abstract dogfighting]]! In wondering whether these rules could be applied to /Star Wars/ vehicles, I ran across [[http://www.theforce.net/swtc/units.html#lucasarts][this /Star Wars/ Technical Commentaries page]] that shows how /TIE Fighter/ represents snubfighters as moving at only around 100 m/s (360 km/h, 224 mi/h). It's funny to imagine [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/TIE/ad_starfighter][the top-of-the-line TIE Advanced]] moving at a speed of only 540 km/h when high-tier propeller-driven planes in /[[https://warthunder.com/en/game/about][War Thunder]]/ regularly exceed /700/ km/h ([[https://youtu.be/BZ9AD9v6ZA4?t=4m35s][example]])--to say nothing of the /jet/-propelled aircraft that are playable in the same game!

On the other hand, of course, a starfighter also is far more maneuverable at such speeds than any fixed-wing aircraft could be, with [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Inertial_compensator][inertial compensators]] and no resistance except [[http://allthetropes.wikia.com/wiki/Space_Friction][Space Friction]]. Based on personal experiments, I estimate that all the /TIE Fighter/ spacecraft have a maximum pitch rate of around 72 deg/s. (On the TIE Fighter, TIE Advanced, and Missile Boat, I can get 36 deg/s with the mouse controls, and I assume that I could manage twice this rate with a joystick, based on how quickly the mouse controls automatically recenter and decelerate the pitching.) This implies maximum G-forces (in /GURPS/ terms, aMR--aerial Maneuver Rating) of 72 deg/s × π rad/180 deg × 100 m/s ÷ 9.81 (m/s^{2})/G = 13 G for a TIE fighter, or 19 G for a TIE Advanced. (Modern fighter aircraft, in contrast, have [[https://defenseissues.wordpress.com/2014/01/11/comparing-modern-western-fighters][turn rates around 30 deg/s]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-22_Raptor#Specifications_.28F-22A.29][aMRs around 9 G]].)

Of course, there are several other items whose determination would be necessary for conducting an abstract dogfight in /GURPS/ with /TIE Fighter/'s vehicles--most obviously, aAccel (Aerial Acceleration), shield generators, armor, and weapons, to say nothing of the other components that go into a starfighter (sensors, cockpit, power plant...). There might also have to be some house rules adjusting the G-forces, since a pilot (HT [Health] 10, plus a G-suit and a G-seat to reduce the effects of high acceleration) risks blacking out when pulling maneuvers above 8 G without resorting to ultra-tech items (e.g., inertial compensators).

Someone in [[/r/ParadoxPlaza][r/ParadoxPlaza]] came up with [[http://np.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/4q68gu][an awesome idea]]: Play an /infinite/ megacampaign of grand-strategy games by assuming that, after 1936 or 1950 (whenever your preferred /[[http://www.reddit.com/r/Victoria2][Victoria 2]]/ mod ends), the world falls into chaos (due to war or plague) and reverts to the level of 769 or 867 (whenever your preferred /[[http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings][Crusader Kings 2]]/ mod begins)!

In scrolling through [[https://www.patreon.com/collateralds][this page of hilarious comics]] (found [[http://np.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/4qaayo/anime_irl/d4rd66i][here]]), I was very surprised to see [[http://i.imgur.com/I6bfb6r.png][a funny comment from Mr. Yudkowsky]]!

I was somewhat astonished to come across these old Facebook posts ([[http://i.imgur.com/6rF8PjH.png][1]] [[http://i.imgur.com/hAzHaRP.png][2]]) stating unambiguously that, at some point, I named /[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198][Background Pony]]/ over /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ as my official Favorite Story Ever, and kept it in that position for more than six months! My recollection of events surrounding /Background Pony/ is that it was /tied/ with /Time Braid/ after my first reading of it, and that it sank to second-favorite fanfiction story after my second (and most recent) reading--but, of course, memories can be incorrect.

[[http://i.imgur.com/rudPvJI.png][2013]]: I apparently considered /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2122][The Fountainhead]]/ to be on the same level as /Time Braid/ and /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35461.Traitor][Traitor]]/!

[[http://i.imgur.com/8tcbn0x.png][A side-splittingly hilarious example]] of the incredible awesomeness of the MEIOU & Taxes mod for /[[http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4][Europa Universalis IV]]/: A player whines about how the people of his humongous, multiethnic, solidly-Catholic empire are turning to Protestantism during the Catholic Reformation! The modder with whom he's arguing explicitly compares his problems directly to the totally-historical situations of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Compromise_of_1867][Austria-Hungary]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Wars_of_Religion][France]]!

  Put yourself in the shoes of the king of France, whose vast Kingdom was divided by heresy in a short time. He would probably have also railed against the unfairness of it all.

I mean, being annoyed at history is fine! A few months ago, I myself rage-quitted a campaign as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinid_dynasty][Fez]] because my country--in possession of all of North Africa, but still a pathetic weakling compared to Western Europe--was about to be stomped flat by the aggression of Spain and its ally the Netherlands. (Thinking back on it, I probably should have just capitulated, moved my capital to Tunis, and continued the game. [shrugs]) However, complaining about historical accuracy to modders who have made historical accuracy their /goal/ seems rather hilariously pointless.

An interesting opinion: [[https://www.gwern.net/Culture%20is%20not%20about%20Esthetics#lets-ban-new-books][Let's Ban New Books]]!

#+begin_quote
  1. Society ought to discourage economically inefficient activities.

  2. If some good /a/ can be created to fill a need, and there is an existing and available good /b/ that fills that need equally well, then it is economically inefficient to use /a/ and not /b/.

  3. Consumers of new art would be equally satisfied by existing art.

  4. By 2 and 3: it is economically inefficient to produce new art.

  ∴ By 1 and 4: Society ought to discourage new art.
