I know several people on this forum have pointed out similarities between publicly traded companies and Unfriendly AIs optimising for a quantity called "shareholder value", and though the metaphor has holes in it it's not a bad place to start. (For-profit companies are not in any way /required/ to maximise profits. They're strongly incentivized to, but other incentives exist.)

Something like that chain of logic is why, say, Coca-Cola doesn't write poetry (except for adverts, which doesn't count). Though they don't care at all whether other people write poetry, as long as it's not done on company time. Even from the perspective of an unfriendly AI, I would amend point 1 to "I should not perform economically inefficient activities" and change the conclusion accordingly.
