  Different ways to plot meteorological data?
#+end_quote

I've been sitting on this for a while, but yes! As part of my Honours thesis I spent a month or so working out how to show fairly subtle local seasonality with custom meteorological figures.

The first (F4.1) is a pretty standard [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climograph][climograph]], though I show both max and min temperature as well as dewpoint (at which relative humidity would be 100%, a measure of moisture content which is very high in this area).

The second (F4.2) shows wind direction, which is important in local Indigenous seasons. The monsoon south-east winds are clear! (further explanation in caption)

Finally, F4.4 shows every day of observation for each of the eight variables, since the station opened ~15 years ago. Tricky to read, but very very useful when I didn't yet know what I was looking at... and to show examiners that it's a complex topic!
