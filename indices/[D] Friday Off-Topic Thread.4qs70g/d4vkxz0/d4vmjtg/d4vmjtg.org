So ... what exactly is a quest? I feel like I see them posted a lot and never read them. It's like some kind of reader-mediated prose fiction? People vote on where the story goes or something? But I've also seen them with stats and dice rolling, which makes it seem more like a pencil-and-paper RPG. I only have a tenuous grasp of the concept and conventions.
