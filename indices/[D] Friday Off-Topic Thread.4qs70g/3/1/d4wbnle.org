I have a personal/fun/everyday identity that I use for everything (this one), which is mostly kept separate from my actual identity. It's not terribly much work to connect the two, especially since I've been using this handle since before Google, but I think it helps put up a barrier between working life and personal life (since obviously I don't want to introduce myself to coworkers or clients using my online handle).

I keep some other identities lying around, but they're usually paper-thin and just for posting things that I don't want directly connected to this online persona. I always keep them collapsible and follow the rules for ethical sockpuppetry though.
