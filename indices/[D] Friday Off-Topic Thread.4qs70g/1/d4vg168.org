I'm 30% functional so recovering fast. Hopefully faster because I got a thesis to finish and a PhD to start preparing for. Luckily I read that Japan's PhD programs start in April so got some time to get ready, currently learning Kanji and Hiragana and planning to study more math for the exam.

Also preparing a paper on automatic ontology generation for chatbots. I've been working on making a chatbot using AIML and modified a bit of the code so that it can learn unknown words but I'm trying to tackle the problem of context understanding and knowledge base creation in artificial intelligent systems and rule based systems aren't enough to satisfy those requirements.

I think ontologies may be an alternative to those problems by enabling the system to generate a knowledge base from which to adapt its responses. Maybe a mix of neural networks and ontologies can do it.

Also upon a recommendation on this sub I started Re:Zero because it was said to be one of the best shows on this season. I enjoyed the themes of time loops in a fantasy world and I'm ashamed to say it took me a bit of time to notice why it felt so familiar, its exactly the same concept tackled in Mother of Learning.

Have to say though that I'm missing Zorian or even Kazuma so much and I want to scream at the screen a lot. The protagonist is so dense that it hurts!

First of all he gets teleported to a magical world and while its new to see a protagonist that doesn't freak out about it, his nonchalant attitude about the whole ordeal breaks the suspension of disbelief. I mean I'm sure anyone that was [[#s][Re:Zero]] would be a little surprised at the very least.

Then he has to [[#s][Re:Zero]] should be a clue.

Then the fact he doesn't seem to try to explore or learn anything about the time loop or the world itself. I liked that about KonoSuba, Kazuma made an attempt to understand the world he lived in and acquire some magic, in this case the protagonist is outmatched by almost everyone and he doesn't seem to try to find out what brought him to the world, whether he may run out of resets and whether he can gain some magic to defend himself so at least he can avoid being killed so much.

Also I don't understand his motivations. He gets teleported to a fantasy world with magic and all he cares about is romancing the princess? I mean, the fact he wanted to save her from dying is understandable and probably the right thing to do but I still found it strange that he pursued that goal with so much zeal given that they barely knew each other and he didn't understand the full extent of what he had to do.

He also rejects the [[#s][Re:Zero]].

Worse yet, in the end the [[#s][Re:Zero]] but it was due to some fluke as the thief girl found him in time. If she hadn't the protagonist would have been stuck on reset mode yet again.

Also the fact the protagonist's goal seems to be to romance the girl but he doesn't seem to realize trying to romance the potentially future ruler of the country will get him lots of enemies, he will require to be able to defend himself and people will be suspicious about this stranger that came out of nowhere wanting to get close to her. For someone that prides himself in his lack of ambition he chose a rather dangerous goal.

Outside of that I've enjoyed the discussions on Reddit and trying to figure what's killing him so often.

The anime is entertaining and I only wish it had a more interesting protagonist, also can't feel interested in the half elf princess, she reminds me a lot of Asuna from SAO and seems a bit bland despite having my favorite VA.

The red haired knight, I think he's named Reinhart is exactly how I picture Zach from Mother of Learning would be, all friendly and full of flashy moves. Him and the maids have been my favorite characters so far.

The story overall feels like Mother of Learning with weaker characters. I can't exactly criticize the plot as it seems to be well crafted overall, the problem is that the protagonist lacks the resources and the interest to delve deeper into it and focuses only on the half elf girl. Plus, it was nice how he got called out on his attitude at the end and I'd be happy if he doesn't end up with the main love interest after all the mess he has caused.
