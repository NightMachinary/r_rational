I agree that Subaru is pretty stupid/exactly the kind of foolish main character this sub would like to collectively pick up and shake in the exact way you mustn't do with babies.

If you are not caught up yet, the most recent episode will be suffering of a very different kind than just being killed over and over. The people who have read the Japanese web novel are saying that the current arc will break down most of Subaru's personality and force him to Grow The Fuck Up. 25 episodes is not short for an anime season, but the author has written a story several times longer than all of Harry Potter, so we are still 'early on'. I like the series, but I do look forward to seeing what happens when Subaru levels up.

If you are still on Hiragana, I found [[https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/][tofugu]] to be great for both Hiragana and Katakana. Also [[http://www.csus.edu/indiv/s/sheaa/projects/genki/hiragana-timer.html][this drag and drop exercise.]]
