The way Reddit is circlejerking over how terrible the 2016 Olympics are going to be is one of the reasons I don't even visit the front page anymore. I'd be willing to bet that the Olympics are going to be a grand success and Reddit is going to collectively say that they didn't see that coming and that they shouldn't be that quick to judge and a few days later the cycle will continue with something else.

Speaking of the Olympics, I have no particular fondness for it, and as with all sports that have turned into multi billion dollar churning juggernauts I feel that they're just a huge waste of time and resources. Note I don't have a problem with any sport being played, just the way in which it is monetized and how the players are glorified.
