It'll be interesting to see how it turns out. On the one hand, there was an enormous amount of hand-wringing before the London games, and those turned out well enough. On the other hand, there's a rather large difference between "traffic is going to be an insane nightmare" and "the water events will be taking place in corpse-clogged poison". On the third hand, media reports about the dangers are likely laughably inaccurate in one way or another.
