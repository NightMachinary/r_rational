It would be a very strange few hours, followed by a few days/weeks trying to figure out where the new poles are (This will take awhile because the shift is not instantly and there will likely be several competing poles for a short period before it settles down. It is not likely to be a true reversal in that the current north pole will become the south pole and vice versa, but it will probably be in the same general area). Oh, and I'm afraid you are going to need a new compass.

But yeah, for humans? Weird lightshow, and a slightly increased risk of cancer, and some confusion for hikers trying to use a compass. We'd be fine. Maybe some sats would be trashed if they aren't properly shielded, but most are for obvious reasons.
