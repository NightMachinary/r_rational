Migratory birds and such which rely on a magnetic sense to guide them over the ocean will be more likely to get lost when they're blown off course by wind. You'll have a greater dispersion of species. Many will still reach their destination using geographical landmarks.

There will be a minor increase in cancer. The atmosphere will protect most from cosmic rays. A magnetic field is hardly that great a protection. It accelerates some cosmic rays. Plus it'll still be there, albeit in a weakened form.

You'll have aurea borealis in all sorts of unusual places as the weakened magnetic field moves from place to place.

During the shift you'd have a fluctuating mixture of fixed and wandering poles that people could use to move around.

Satellites would be pretty fucked, with reduced protection from their local star's cosmic rays and no or little atmosphere to protect them.
