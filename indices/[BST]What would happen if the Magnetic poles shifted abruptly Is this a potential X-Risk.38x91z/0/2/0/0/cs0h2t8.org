What I mean is, unless the magnetic field actually changed while they were flying, I think they'd be ok. It's like "take off at magnetic heading X, use it as reference to keep going in that line"...and they rely on other mechanisms as well.

But you are probably right. If the field was weak or multipolar, there'd be more chance of getting lost in bad flying conditions. I just don't think it's a death sentence.
