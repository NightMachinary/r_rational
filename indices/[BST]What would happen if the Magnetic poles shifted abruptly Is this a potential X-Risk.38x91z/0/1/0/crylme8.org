To clarify, birds have excellent eyesight and primarily rely on their memory of weather conditions and geographical landmarks and stars and polarized light and other birds to find where to go. They do have some trouble during solar storms that disrupt the magnetic field, but only on cloudy nights. Otherwise they can rely on other senses. It's not inherently going to be deadly to migratory birds.
