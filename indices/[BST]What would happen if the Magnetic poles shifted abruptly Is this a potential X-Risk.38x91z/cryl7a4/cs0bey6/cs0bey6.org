  Migratory birds and such which rely on a magnetic sense to guide them over the ocean will be more likely to get lost when they're blown off course by wind.

I actually don't think you'd see this at all. Migratory species use the magnetic field, true, but it's not a blind instinctual "fly toward magnetic north" or whatever. Instead, they use the field to maintain heading, especially when they can't use other clues like the sun or landscape features. And they learn the pattern. Since pole reversals happen over the course of years, they would likely adjust to the changes as they come.
