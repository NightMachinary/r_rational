Yeah. It wouldn't be a death sentence. With that, as I said, I'd mostly expect it to result in a lot of unusual birds and animals in places they probably shouldn't be. That's something that you could show in story that might interest some people, especially if some of those species had fun genetic engineering/ magic.
