Drop on-sight recognition; magicians living in caves (out of a direct line-of-sight) could avoid it. Consider gravity-like ripples upon the fabric of reality: the USE of magic sends out instant notice to any magician in the universe that magic has just been used. Signal strength goes down with distance and the magician's level of power, and averages out across gravitational/magnetic fields. You can't study by listening to other magicians practice, because the details are omitted; you know what TYPE of magic they are using, but not exactly what they did. You can determine the distance and direction (with another mage you can triangulate for location) of other mages, if any try to approach you (even without casting spells) after they have had enough training to pose a serious threat, you can sense the increasing proximity of a potential hostile just from an unfamiliar signature getting stronger. Effective range (for magicians of any caliber) is "within your solar system".

Being aware of magicians all around you may seem overwhelming, especially if there are a lot of them. Think of any group with many overlapping conversations: you can pluck out a few voices close to you (or that are especially distinctive, or especially loud, or you are very familiar with), but the rest blend into a meaningless babble. Same with similar types of magic: you know that the country over that ocean is practicing a lot of healing magic (or how many types of unfamiliar/new magic, and you can recognize that type of magic again when you visit to audit their lab), but not whether there are a handful of very powerful magicians or an army of lesser magicians. (Location grows imprecise over great distances, too - if you move around in one area, you can't use your shifts in location to communicate in real-time with agents in another country.) It's still loud, though. Think of Yoda in the Star Wars books: the Jedi Masters, as their empathic sensitivity grew, had to find isolated PLANETS to live on so they wouldn't be distracted by the feelings of others.

Spies cannot be the "sneaking through your countryside" kind, just the "pretending to work for you" kind, because if you sensed an unauthorized magician in your area, you would start preparing your shields, and then go hunting. (The ruler would probably back you on this. Polite mages always announce their intended visits well in advance.) If you sense the sudden disappearance of a magical signature, it means one of two things: either that magician has died (and a few of these in short order means someone is assassinating them), or they figured out how to conceal their aura (which is a forbidden magic which makes everyone panic and execute the rogue). You mentioned that divination magic has "No scrying", but I think that location-sensing (with no way to remotely view what is actually happening) isn't contradicted.

@alexanderwales: Developing magical skill is like developing muscle: first you suffer a bit, then rest to restore, which builds up your tolerance. (Using magical coercion to force students to train faster basically means that an instructor uses their experience to judge when a student's breaking point is, and halt just before the student would be irrevocably committed to death, rather than the student's cautious method of halting the moment they feel the strain.) No matter how much theory you learn, the amount of energy you can channel is limited. (This is a separate idea from the previous suggestions. It's meant to address the possibility alexanderwales raised that book learning could be used to prepare peasant armies for wizardry.) Actually, reviewing your scattered notes on magic, it looks like I only managed to restate what you said, not add anything new. Tagging this paragraph accordingly.

On further review, you already thought of the magic-detection, with your sea monsters. I could definitely see the invisible-to-mage-senses creatures being designed before all techniques for creating more of them were taken away; resistant (or even invulnerable) to leftover types of magic, as well, when confined to particular geographic areas such as the ocean. Slumbering in the countryside (or hiding deep within the earth), creatures that only hunger for the BANNED types of magic, and were left in place as a contingency measure against prohibited research. Resistant or invulnerable to that magic, of course. The secret to destroying them could be kept in the same place as information on how to destroy the seals.
