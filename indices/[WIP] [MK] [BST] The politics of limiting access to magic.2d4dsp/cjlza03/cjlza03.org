  2) How many magicians a country is allowed to train in a year is not dependent on how many people live in that country, because that would allow large kingdoms to grow larger. Instead, every year the countries negotiate and determine a 'minimum' number of magicians which each country is allowed to train. Any country wishing to train more may do so, but for every extra magician they wish to train they have to pay compensation to all the other countries, and the cost goes up alarmingly quickly for every extra magician they wish to train.

  8) While it's theoretically possible that new countries might form and join the treaty, the magical location is very useful for finding out if those seeking to lead the new country are too close to any of the old countries (Puppet regimes get shot).

This strongly incentivises splintering into states the minimum size necessary to be independent signatories to the treaty. Even if the leadership has to be completely unrelated to each other, a group of countries which used to be one nation a handful of years ago will be natural allies. Either the first adopter wins the arms race, or the largest original signatory does, depending on the length of the political OODA loop relative to how long magicians take to train.

  6) Negotiations take place in a magical location where anyone who utters a lie immediately and unavoidably dies. Though the rulers of every nation do not have to personally attend the negotiations every year, the heads of noble families, sovereigns and other rich and powerful individuals are expected to attend at least every decade or so, and to explicitly state that they have not broken the treaty or suspected anyone else in their kingdom of doing so.

  7) While the magical location can be tricked, it will kill you the second you believe that what you utter is not as certain to be true as you state it to be. You could break the treaty the day after swearing on it, but you couldn't swear on it if you expected that you would then go on to break it. In addition, the laws of nature are layered in my world, and it is not currently possible to use magic to fiddle with people's minds/implant/remove memories. This will change in later books, but by then everything is going to hell for other reasons.

Except disregard all of the above, because you have a perfect coordination engine. Everyone can be trusted by everyone else. This pretty much immediately warps their society into something unrecognizable as human.
