My world currently lacks leaders strong enough to be able to force the nobility of their country to sacrifice their ability to deceive. During the course of the plot such leaders will arise, and the villains in particular have the best PR machine ever.

Consider: In reality we now have the capability to make all our politicians and business leaders wear cameras and microphons at all times, and to make these feeds publicly available forever. The number of countries doing this is zero.
