  My world currently lacks leaders strong enough to be able to force the nobility of their country to sacrifice their ability to deceive.

This is terribly implausible. Sure, it's hard for a ruler of something the size of Germany, France, or the Holy Roman Empire to have that power, but for a smaller country like the Netherlands where you can safely get the entire first tier of nobility into a guarded room, you don't have to be terribly strong.

And with an advantage like perfect coordination, you can grow rapidly, meaning that there will be more power to go around, so having them agree should be pretty easy. And as you conquer new territories, adding any new nobility to the system is fairly easy. At which point you get, within a generation, a large country where it's an established norm that the entire nobility is required to visit the truth space with the king regularly, without any egregiously powerful king.

I don't think you're going to be able to punt this one.
