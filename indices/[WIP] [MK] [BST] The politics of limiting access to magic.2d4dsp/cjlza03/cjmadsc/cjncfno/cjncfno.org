The real world example isn't a stable equilibrium either - The technology to lifelog people is very new, which is why it isn't seeing the kind of use you are thinking of.. Yet. There are currently pilot programs under way to have police forces run them, and those experiments are returning the kind of results would be social reformers do not dare to dream about in their most fanciful flights of imagination - Reductions in the number of complaints about police misconduct to effectively /zero/ kind of thing. That's the kind of thing that is going to catch on. Give it a decade or two, and police without job-logs are going to be a synonym for "Oppressive police state". Beyond that, and.. well, it will probably take longer before it spreads to jobs that doesn't involve the use of direct force, but I figure anyone in a serious position of authority is going to end up running a log.
