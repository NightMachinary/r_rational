All rulers are magicians. Any non-magician who becomes a ruler is going to make sure they learn magic as soon as possible. There is no Illuminati like conspiracy of magicians though. One is not required. Being a magician is not a profession in itself, so it makes more sense to talk of kings and noblemen to describe their relative positions. Nobility is as much a magician's club as congress is a millionaire's club.

There is no spell AI or even fixed spells, like there is no 'fixed' way to use steam power or fire. If you wanted to design a piece of magic that did X after a certain amount of time, you would have to go to a lot of trouble to design a machine that kept the magic fed (magic disipates osmosis style) and which at some point triggered and unleashed the magic. The (magical) technology to do this is strongly associated with the last world war, and is very forbidden. There is also no contingency style magic. The closest you could come (without finding forbidden 300 year old technology) would be to create an object capable of storing magic and of sustaining itself on whoever wore it that can be /manually/ triggered to release its charge.

There will be complex magical machinery in the later books, but because the world was sort of bombed back into the iron age during the last world war, religion and paranoia about evil (destructive/abusable) magic has led to magical research and experimentation being very illegal.
