The process is draw magic into yourself -> shape it -> send it out. You can draw in and carry a charge beforehand, though any magician will realize you are doing it. You can also shape the magic beforehand, at least if it's something simple like "Throw lightning/send out enormous heat". Holding magic is slightly damaging to your body, so you shouldn't do it for hours at a time unless your life is on the line. If you are very exceptionally skilled you could shape magic outside of your body, although you would need to do it by effectively reaching out with your soul to the point where the work is to be done (And no, you couldn't detach your soul entirely from your body, and it would be very vulnerable while reaching out)

No somatic or verbal components. Will power is all that is required.

No hard limit beyond human reaction time (Which can be shortened by holding more magic - the more magic you hold, the sharper all your senses, and the higher your physical abilities. Note that you can't sustain holding magic for too long, and the damage accrues faster the more you hold. There is also no hard limit on how much you can hold, it's just that while the usefulness of the magic increases largely linearly, the damage you take from holding it increases exponentially. (There is no exact math here, skill and experience will allow you to hold more magic for longer).

More complex magic doesn't really require more complex preconditions (Though keeping background magic from fluctuating too much (like it would if magicians were fighting nearby) would probably help). The only real limitation is "How quickly can your brain process everything it needs to process to keep all these disparate elements working together".

Spells manipulating spells aren't automatially banned although, again, there are no fixed 'spells', just effects that you learn to produce by harnessing a force of nature and which can be customized. Creating a fireball in the shape of a dragon would be almost impossible because it's so intricate, but you could easily throw lightning around a corner if you can model in your head the path you want it to take. While enroute, it is a natural phenomen that you or someone else could interact with, though you'd have to be quick about it.

Very complex magic /is/ possible, but the human brain (soul) only has so much processing power, and you would have to overcome this limitation somehow. Either by building many machines that do some very specific thing the same way each time and which you then chain together, or by dividing up the parts of the process in some other way. Later on in the books there will be some lmited hive mind creation, but it's not currently possible because the laws of nature do not allow it, and if the seal in question had not been designed and put together by tenss of thousands of magicians working together the world would long since have been reduced to nuclear fire.
