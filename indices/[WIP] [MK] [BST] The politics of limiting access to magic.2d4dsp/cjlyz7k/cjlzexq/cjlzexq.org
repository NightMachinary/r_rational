True. The ban on science is not as strongly subject to international regulation as magic is, but in my world magic is scienceable and mundane technology is far less advanced than what you can do with magic. The idea of a steam powered engine would never occur to anyone in my world when exploring new uses for magic would lead to so much more visually impressive results. Also because in the horrible past when crazy people researched magic science became associated with /magical/ research, there just isn't a strong notion of technology as seperate from magic. There is nothing stopping it, it's just that my world isn't ging to hit a non-magical industrial revolution anytime soon unless real world people were suddenly teleported in.
