It is not solely destructive, it's just easier to use it to destroy than to create. [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2d4dsp/wip_mk_bst_the_politics_of_limiting_access_to/cjm7vik?context=3][This comment]] answers more fully what magic can do.

Science being dangerous is almost entirely due to my magic being subject to science, and magical research being associated with the world almost being blown up a few hundred years ago. Mundane technology is not very impressive. You could make a steam engine, but nobody would even think of it when magic is so much more straight forward. My world is not close to an industrial revolution. Also, the state religions are extremely anti research of any kind. The treaty only mentions magical research.

Non-magicians couldn't really research magic, because while magic is a particle in my world, nobody currently alive actually knows that. It's just a mysterious force to them.
