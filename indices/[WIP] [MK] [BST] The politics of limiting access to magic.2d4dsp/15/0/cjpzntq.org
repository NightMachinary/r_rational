If you have ever used even the tiniest big of magic, actively delving you will reveal it. It's possible (and verboten) to learn to hide from the automatic, passive sensing. Non magicians can communicate anything to magicians, it's just that speaking about magic is a bit like speaking about riding a bike. Much easier shown than told. Should the first layer of the laws of nature be stripped away (as will happen during the books), you could implant a complete memory into the peasant, and have your colleague read it as though they were experiencing it themselves. In the meantime, the peasant would not glow. When that seal is stripped away munchkinry will happen on all sides, have no fear. During the 300 years that I'm hoping the treaty would keep the world relatively stable, the seal prevents any type of memory manipulation.

Puppet officials are very useful. Only remember, while you can change your mind after having told the truth about your plans, if you are anyone of significance you /will/ be made to visit every few years, and you couldn't say you have nothing planned if you had already thought of how you were going to do it. The obvious exploits are known, and talked about, but it's certainly possible to come up with a new trick /after/ your visit and like it so much that it changes your mind.

By restrictions on magic, I am not quite sure if you mean the legal restrictions or the "several layers of the laws of nature" restrictions. The laws are in place because a very bad person at the end of the last world war decided to manipulate all the emerging nations and religions into mistrusting magic, and though there is no obvious way to remove that influence, cultures and mind sets can be changed with a lot of time and work. If you mean stripping away the physical restrictions on what magic can do, well, all you technically need to do would be to be an extremely competent magician with several powerful followers, go to a known but far out of the way location, and dismantle a man made seal. Not easy, but it could be done. Of course it was put in place because the last world war looked like it would just continue escalating until the world was irrevocably destroyed, but then at the time the world was run by ten sociopaths who all forced their entire populations to learn magic and be either soldiers or scientists. There is no way of making reality more robust, but if magic was still kept much more restricted than "teach everyone", it probably wouldn't escalate as quickly as it did last time. Of course one of the forms of magic that would become possible again would be resurrection, and someone might have the brilliant idea to bring back leaders from that time... Theoretically, if you wanted to keep things stable, I guess you could resurrect them yourself, steal all their knowledge and destroy their souls to prevent any more resurrections, but then, would you get every single one with enough knowledge to pose a significant threat? History is not entirely clear on what happened with some of them - some may have been taken out of comission in some way other than just being killed.
