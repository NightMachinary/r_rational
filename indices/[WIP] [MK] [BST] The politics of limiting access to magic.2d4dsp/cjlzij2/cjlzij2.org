You've actually got an interesting balance going on between small and large countries there. The reason that the United States has a bicameral system is to balance the large states (favored by the House of Representatives because representation is proportional) against the small states (favored by the Senate because representation is based on statehood).

With an agreed-upon number of mages being static per country you're favoring the small countries, but assuming that the "pay-for-more-mages" rate is the same for every country you're favoring the large countries since the /n/th mage past the limit is going to require far less of a percentage of their GDP. A consequence of this is that large counties are going to have more mages unless they're broke, while small countries will probably still have more mages per capita, which seems like it would work out rather fairly. And obviously when it comes time to renegotiate the treaty, the two biggest numbers at the table are going to be the number of mages that each country gets /and/ the exponent used for determining the cost of the /n/th mage.

So with that said, here are some thoughts and questions:

- It's not clear from your rules whether we're allowed to go to war or not. So long as we're not violating the treaty in some way, war is still fair game, right? You would want to avoid it in the hopes that you didn't lose any mages, naturally, but I just want to be clear on that. (In theory, both sides could sign a war treaty that stated that they wouldn't use mages in the war, thereby setting up some game theory.)

- Since the limit is on "number of mages trained per year" and not "total number of mages", you would want to train mages from a very young age, ensure their happiness so they don't defect, and keep them in good health.

- There's also probably some trickery with the language to "trained" so that I could in theory train up a whole bunch of not-quite mages who have a very good grasp on the theory without actually knowing anything practical. That would allow pushing hundreds of people to become mages in a short period of time if someone else broke the treaty.

- How long does it take to train a mage to be battle-ready? That seems hugely important. Months? Years? Decades?

- Death by lies seems very harsh, and like something that you'd be able to abuse if you were clever. To kill someone, you only need to instill enough doubt in them that they don't want to say what they have to, or that the place kills them. It also seems to favor the sort of person who can doublethink or at least change their convictions on a dime.

- Amnesty programs aren't worth running if you need to pay for the mages that defect into your country or have been training illegally. That's probably the point, since otherwise you would have an incentive to encourage illegal training for later amnesty. Really, the limit isn't so much on "trained mages" it's on "newly acquired mages".
