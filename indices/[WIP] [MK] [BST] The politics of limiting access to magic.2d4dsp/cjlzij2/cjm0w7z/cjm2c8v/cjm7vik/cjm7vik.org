Some things are impossible, some are merely impractical. Because the laws of nature are layered in my world and the plot will eventually strip away one of the layers, I'll try to summarize:

Absolutely impossible: Time travel, restoring destroyed souls.

Impossible without first destroying reality: Teleportation, disabling physics, copypasting souls, rearranging the laws of magic, manipulating the winds of Destiny.

Impossible without first destroying five god made, almost indestructible locations which rely on fairytale logic: Destroying souls, breaking space (Portals - these are... extremely energy intensive, delicate and slow to make, so not very abusable anyway), creating new life from scratch, 'looking' through time, most transmutation, the most part of riding the winds of Destiny, scrying.

Impossible without first disabling one very powerful man-made seal: Mind control, most mind reading, raising the dead, creating new life through rape (Affects even non-magicians), bending space, bending time, prophecy, magical genetic engineering, most magical healing, basic transmutation, large scale weather control, the remaining influence of Destiny.

This leaves a force of nature that can be harnessed to do most things, and limits are more often legal or skill related than limitations on the magic itself. You can do basic mind reading, although it's very hard to get deeper than current physical sensations + conscious surface thoughts. You can chuck lightning, melt metal, chuck fire, do very slow and basic healing (no regrowing limbs). You can make illusions, but if the target is a magician as good as you, they'll easily make out that what they are seeing is magical and insubstantial. Still, a very light touch you might get away with - my main character changes his eye colour, and the magical touch is so light that it can't be made out against the background glow of his magical abilities. You can greatly enhance your senses, moderately enhance your physical prowess and stamina, you can disable your nerves (so shut down pain), you can manipulate and falsify physical sensation. You can manipulate temperature. You can create and manipulate local wind. You can delve the earth or other matter and gain some sense of what lies within (Though you couldn't use it to spy on a fellow magician without them sensing it). You can pull and push with great strength at a distance. You can create shields. Attacking is almost always stronger than defense, but then you may be able to just tilt the trajectory of the attack, making it easier for you to dodge it with your somewhat enhanced speed and agility. You can /somewhat/ speed up natural growth and healing, although there is a great taboo against speeding up the growth of even animals, let alone humans. Increasing crop yield is mostly accomplished by murdering insects and parasites and by making sure the plants get as much water and nutrition as they require. If you are desperate, you could also spend long hours creating artificial sunlight for them, but magicians tend to be far too rich and important to condescend to such work.

Anything else? I'm likely to have forgotten some. There aren't 'spells' in my world, simply a force of nature that can be harnessed, although /researching/ magic is what led to the almost omnicide 300 years ago, so that's a good way to get yourself assassinated by your countrymen.
