  Rape by deception can still lead to pregnancy,
#+end_quote

Huh.

My definition of rape is "sex where one party did not consent" (which I think is nearly the same as "one party does not want it to be happening" but also includes elements of "one party is not /able/ to consent, due to underage / mental deficiency / drunk / drugged, etc, as well as elements of "would not have consented if they'd had all the information")

It seems to me that this seal must have some sort of judgement -- it must be able to analyze the mental state of everyone who is having sex, determine if one of them is unwilling and then determine if one of them is too young for good judgement / under the influence / mentally deficient. It would also need to determine if one of the people was being tricked into having sex. If it finds a person like that, it prevents the pregnancy.

That seems to require a consciousness to me -- is the seal self-aware in your world? That would be really cool if it were -- a conversation with something like that would be fascinating. Although it would also meancould a rapist try to talk to the seal and convince it that this wasn't rape. Which is a bit grimdark, but would be an interesting story event.
