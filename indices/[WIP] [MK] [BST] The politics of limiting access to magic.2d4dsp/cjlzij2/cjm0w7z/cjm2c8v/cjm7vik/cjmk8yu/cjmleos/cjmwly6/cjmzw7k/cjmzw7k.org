Nah, no judgement. Because there are souls in my world the creation of a new soul is the result of a momentary fusion of the souls of the parents. An unconscious or unwilling participant does not reach out with their soul to touch the other, while a naive child being tricked by flattery and lies does. Similarly, if I'm a magician and I make myself look like someone's husband, well the wife may be deceived and act as though I was the husband. Thus, the seal does not protect the deceived or the too young, but it does prevent an unwilling soul from being /forced/ to take part in the fusion.

But this aspect of the seal is mainly in place because it seemed to make sense when I decided on the rest of what it did, and while my books get pretty dark eventually, there will be little need for my characters to worry about any of this.
