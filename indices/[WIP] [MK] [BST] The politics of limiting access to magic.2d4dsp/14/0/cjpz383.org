Thank you very much for your time and input. Magicians do have the sea monster like ability to sense magic at a distance, just weaker, since we were not engineered specifically for the purpose of eliminating enemy movement over the sea. While a magician not using magic can be detected within line of sight (and it's possible to hide your ability, at least against /passive/ sensing), any active use can be sensed through obstacles/at greater distance. It's nowhere near as long range as Jedi's can sense things, but a magician going suicide nova could be sensed kilometers away, and there is one location in my world that all magicians can sense at all times, effectively giving them a built in compass always pointing at the spooky place where the world was almost destroyed during the last world war. That spooky place gives name to the whole planned series, The Tower of Souls. While not as long range as Jedi senses, there are magicians in my world (mostly old ones) who seek to escape the background noise of being in the same city as other magicians, and they tend to move out into the countryside to perfect their own specializations (Which might involve a /little/ bit of research, but in a very narrow field, and after decades of loyal service the state and church will leave them alone except for the occasional visit to check that they are still sane and haven't made any progress in the wrong fields).

The hidden monster traps are a great idea, and I'll think about it. There are two related types of monster I had not mentioned because I tried to keep the OP from growing too long. There is a 'magic eater' monster that, while not /invulnerable/, is very resistant to all forms of damage, and which devours magic. They were created to help annihilate a now extinct race of sentient humanoids (And at this points humans are the only humanoids in my world), and their abilitly to suck the magic out of the world around them has left an entire continent dead. Deserts and ruins, with a few little fishing villages on poles along the coast. If you wanted to kill one you would have to amass around a hundred magicians to injure it faster than it could regrow, and of course that much magic being flung about would attract even more of them. The other creature is a black moss which is slowly expanding across the main continent, and which covers about a third of it when the books begin. It mostly keeps to forests, and it tends to cover both the ground and the tree tops, so that the sky cannot be seen. The moss itself is not directly dangerous, but there is some sort of creature living in it which is almost never seen. Anyone who wanders into the lightless area tends not to come back out, and if search parties are both stupid enough to enter and lucky enough to come back out, usually they find either nothing at all or a few pools of blood and maybe a limb that looks cut off rather than torn. For the magic-less villages living close to the moss, it is long work each year to burn some of the moss away so that it cannot expand and cover their home. Only, burning the moss seems to agitate the creature that lives inside the darkness, and it comes out at night to steal away any living creatures it can find and drag them into the darkness. The only thing it avoids is light (And my worls lacks stars other than the sun, so nights get pretty dark), so the days spent burning moss during the day are often spent gathered around a blazing bonfire in the village square at night. Magicians do have the luxury of creating light around them at will, but actually being inside of the moss covered area seems to embolden the creature to attack lone magicians whether they make light or not, and it will happily wait for a few hours for the magician to lower their shields from exhaustion before it strikes. The creature was originally created to hinder safe and easy troop movement, and moss, sea monsters and magic eaters were created by the same scientist queen during the last world war.
