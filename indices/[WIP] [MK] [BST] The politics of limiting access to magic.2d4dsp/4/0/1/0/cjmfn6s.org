It's not just that the nobility doesn't want to lose that freedom, though, it's also that everyone involved feels like it's part of the natural order that they retain the freedom to maneuver. And small countries, even if better organized, would find it really difficult to expand because their neighbours want to retain that land. And while nobles squabble mongst themselves in peace time, in war they are mostly going to stand united against an external threat.
