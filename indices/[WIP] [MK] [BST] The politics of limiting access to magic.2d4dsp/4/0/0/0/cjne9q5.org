True! And I hold a lot of cautious hope for the future. I'm trying to go into politics myself, and if ever succeed I will most certainly be willing to film everything I do at work.

What I can say for my world is that during the last world war the +less insanely evil+ Good Guys had control of the location in question, and used it for all it was worth. But by the time the war ended, anyone within five layers of the top of team good was dead, and one of the big bads who knew she was going to lose took particular care to shape those who might eventually become leaders after the war to mistrust everything to do with the old powers, and destroyed every reference she could find to how the location had once been used. She is also largely responsible for every religion that emerged after the war being so incredibly anti-science, anti-magic and anti-reform. If you have read Asimov's foundation series, she's kind of a negative Hari Seldon.
