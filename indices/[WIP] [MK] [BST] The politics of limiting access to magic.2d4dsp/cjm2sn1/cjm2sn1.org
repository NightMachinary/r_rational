I don't know if you've read this, but if not the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Naval_Treaty][Washington Naval Treaty]] in an interesting real-world example of a similar thing. Major nations agreeing to limit the construction of weapons.

It is a bit more relevent than, say nuclear treaties as it did have a real effect on the fielded weapons. (40,000 vs 5000 nukes is still enough to flatten everything)
