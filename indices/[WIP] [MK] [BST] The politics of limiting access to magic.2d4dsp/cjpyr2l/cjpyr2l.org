First question: how much magical knowledge or ability does someone have to have in order to glow? Or in other words, can I use Muggles to carry information that will later be given to magicians?

For the no-lying location, all you need is some truly stupid puppet official whose beliefs you can shape via ordinary lies or indoctrination.

For long-term goals: how can I make reality and civilization more robust so that the restrictions on magic can be safely reduced or eliminated?
