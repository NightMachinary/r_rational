Hm. Interesting setting, I'll look forward to reading it.

Here are my thoughts:

- Magicians can identify each other /on sight/. How do they detect, at long range, when another country is training extra mages?
- How long does it take to train a mage?
- How do you capture a mage if they are as powerful as you say?
- Is there any reason that you can't hire/acquire enemy mages wholesale -- pay them, blackmail them, enchant them, whatever? Ideally, before the war officially starts -- bring their loyalty to your side, but leave them in place so that no one knows they are now yours. Also, this means they make great intelligence agents, assassins, and sleeper agents.
- What happens if a ruler can't show up at the moot? If he's sick, or too far away, or currently kidnapped, what happens?

Depending on the answers to the above, I suspect that there is a tipping point where, when a particular country gets enough mages, they can quickly conquer their largest neighbor, gobble up THEIR mages, and go on to conquer the next, etc. If the other nations are fast enough they could stop this march, but in practice it could happen within days -- attack every other nation at once, destabilize all of them so they cannot coordinate counterattacks, then go back and gobble them down at your leisure.

Personally, I would not use battlefield tactics for this. There would be no giant army marching up where you could shoot at my mages. I would use blitzkrieg decapitation strikes: [[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?222007-The-Definitive-Guide-to-the-Tippyverse-By-Emperor-Tippy][teleport into their capital]], kill the rulers, poison the wells, use magic to spread disease, kill all the competent military leaders and leave the incompetent ones alive. While you're at it, be sure to kill off any very loyal special shock troops that might be a problem for you. (If this sounds exactly like what I had Albrecht in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9669819/39/The-Two-Year-Emperor][The Two Year Emperor]] threaten to do, it's because it is.)

As to how you train enough mages to get past the tipping point: a loyal and ambitious subminister sets up a training college way off in the woods somewhere without talking to the king about it. The place is probably in the Arctic or on another continent to make it harder for other nations to find; mages can teleport, so distance doesn't matter, only concealment. (If there is no range restriction on teleportation, then a moon colony or orbital platform is also an option.) The ruler never knows anything about it until his loyal consigliere comes to him and says "hey, boss, guess what? We have 100,000 mages over our limit and no one else knows about them." Once that happens, the ruler pretty much HAS to start conquering everything in sight -- he can't pay the fines for that many mages, he can't hide the fact that he has them once the next moot occurs, and the mages are apt to take offence if he starts trying to kill or banish all of them.

Your point #9 (people know that if they break the treaty everything goes to hell) is either sufficient or irrelevant. If everyone believes that, then there will never be a problem. If anyone fails to believe it, then they will seek the advantage. It's a Prisoner's Dilemna situation -- if everyone always cooperates, all is good. If anyone defects, things get nuts.
