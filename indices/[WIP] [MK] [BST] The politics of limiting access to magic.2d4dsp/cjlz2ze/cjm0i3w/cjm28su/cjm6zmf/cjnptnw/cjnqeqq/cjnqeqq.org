I thought about it some more and realized that a large wrench in the wheel of the plan would be that, while nothing is stopping the dying king from setting the scheme up, that ruler could not have assured everyone nothing was up the /last/ time he was there if he had already had the idea to arrange it behind his successor's back.

It's a good plan, but the minute you get a big war going everyone is going to rush to the location to assure each other that they are not involved, and let's cooperate to find out what happened. Unluckily (Luckily?) the location can't be destroyed without completing a long and difficult quest involving breaking an extremely powerful seal and then figuring out exactly what sort of fairytale logic the place is operating on. Merely breaking the seal would permanently upset the balance of power in the world and enable ungodly levels of munchkinry as more powerful magic became available.

This will of course happen in the course of the books, because seals are there to be broken.
