  It would still probably result in the death of anyone related to the ruler when enemy nations go into revenge mode, but it could certainly result in a very destructive war where you have the advantage.

It depends on how well you can lie and dissemble afterwards, and how unsubtle you are about it. Destroying the reputation of the truth chamber -- or hell, destroying the chamber itself -- would be a good start.

I'd probably try to instigate unrest in countries I want to weaken, then insert magicians posing as rebels. Once everything goes to hell, I move in to "impose order". Depending on how much aggressive expansion I want to rack up, I'd either install a puppet government in my wake or seize territory directly. Probably the latter, since they'll get a legitimate bank of magicians that I could then call upon.
