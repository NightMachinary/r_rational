First line is correct. Damage over time can be inflicted, but is more often self inflicted. Duels tend to be fast, but in a large scale battle there is no point at which your body tells you "Boss, if you don't stop using magic now you'll die", but using and holding magic does damage the body, so if you go on fighting until you keel over from exhaustion you won't faint, you'll die. Think of holding magic like being pricked with a needle every few seconds. Slightly painful, but the blood loss is almost harmless. Only, if you keep taking that small damage all the time you'll eventually sustain so much damage that even though you can keep going right now, you have already passed the threshold where you may die from the injury.
