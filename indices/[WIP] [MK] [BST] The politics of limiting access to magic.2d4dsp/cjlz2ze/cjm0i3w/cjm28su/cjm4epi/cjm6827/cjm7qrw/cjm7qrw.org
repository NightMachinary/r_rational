Something to do with attack being more potent than defence I imagine.

Damage over time maybe? Marginally superior / luckier / cleverer one wins, but the loser still deals enough damage that the winner soon succumbs. Like two people in a knife fight with deadly but slow acting poisons on the blades. Unless one is skilled enough to avoid the smallest scratch or has a counter to the poison, the victory is going to be short-lived.
