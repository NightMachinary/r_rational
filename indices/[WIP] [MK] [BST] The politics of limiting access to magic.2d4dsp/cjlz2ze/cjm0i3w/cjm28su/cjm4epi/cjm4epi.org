  Huh. I would expect that one of them would win and kill the other, not that it would be MAD. If two roughly equal mages is a probable double suicide, then why would mages ever be willing to fight?

Both of the combatants estimate their position to be superior prior to battle and engage.

The same logic can be applied to medieval land battles. Why would you engage in a battle if you'd estimated you'll lose? You wouldn't (unless your goal is something other than victory of course). Battles happen when both sides feel confident in victory. Castles, on the other hand, can't run away when you bring a superior force against them, which might explain the ratio of sieges to land battles.
