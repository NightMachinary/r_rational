It should be fairly easy to destroy any country you don't like. Get a large army of indoctrinated mages. Have them emigrate into another country and refuse to leave, likely through heavy bribes to some legal authority. The other country now has to pay an insanely high tax. Since offence is higher than defence it shouldn't be that hard to subvert one official.

You could either do this on a large and fast scale or a small and slow scale. Get other countries to support your loyal mages. The brood parasite form of growth. You could even make them agree- some countries may value your extremely strong super mages rather than their own more loyal young mages.

Alternate plan.

When a king is on their death bed convince them to allow a subordinate to build up a large army. Then kill the king, don't tell their heir what is happening. Smuggle a large number of people underground. Build up a loyal brainwashed army of tens of thousands of mages. Go to the surface, take over everything.
