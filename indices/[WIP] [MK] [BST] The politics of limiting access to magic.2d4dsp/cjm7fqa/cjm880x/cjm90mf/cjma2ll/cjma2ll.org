My final villains use some of these, and my main characters are forced to adapt. Later in the plot some of the limitations on what magic can do are removed, and rather than necromancy (Which, except for resurrection, does not exist) they start using mind controlling cancer to dominate their followers, including captured and resurrected enemy leaders, family members, love interests, etc. The main limitations on resurrectis that A) There does exist a form of magic that can destroy souls, and B) unless you have the body of the deceased you are going to need access to a person with a strong emotional bond or a blood relation to the person.
