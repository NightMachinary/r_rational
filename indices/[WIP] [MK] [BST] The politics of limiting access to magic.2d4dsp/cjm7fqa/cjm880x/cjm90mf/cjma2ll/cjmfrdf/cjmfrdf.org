  The main limitations on resurrectis that A) There does exist a form of magic that can destroy souls, and B) unless you have the body of the deceased you are going to need access to a person with a strong emotional bond or a blood relation to the person.

So resurrection produces an instant army of magicians who aren't in violation of the treaty; all of the children of the noble families will be able to resurrect their ancestors, who don't need to be newly trained. Possibly through steps of indirection where you have to go one generation at a time, but still.
