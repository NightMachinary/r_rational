No scrying exists, no teleporting exists. Ambushes and assassinations do happen, but while it's difficult to defend against a strong magician, it's also very difficult to sneak into a palace guarded by magicians without being discovered. Prophetic visions do exist but are very difficult to nudge into informing you of specific details.

I hadn't considered that you could effectively make zombies with the cancer, but that would work. Mostly it's used in the plot to make spies, assassins and soldiers. It does tend to leave the individual insane in the end.

Magical development can be sped up by basically torturing the student, so it's one of those areas where villains and the desperate have an advantage. It's done simply by mind controlling the student and physically forcing their bodies to keep training regardless of how much it hurts. My villains have done lots of research on how much training in a day is optmal without sustaining injuries severe enough to limit how much you can train tomorrow. In this way, the cancer helps.

Thank you for your help!
