Why aren't the magicians the ones ruling the world?

According to everything I've read here, you can't actually stop a powerful mage without several other powerful mages, and even then it is still likely to end in fire. You have no mind control, so they can't do some kind of Aes Sedai forced loyalty oath, and you recruit primarily from nobility, who are rich, generally arrogant, and likely in most cases power hungry, and then you give them incredible power. At least one of them might wonder why some 'king' is giving them orders.

How is it that all the rulers are not mages?

On the defensive/offensive front, does your world not have ward or shield spells that are always up or on contingency? How does spell 'AI' work? Can I make a spell that does X exactly 5 minutes from now? what about 'if Y happens do X'?
