It's a pretty small step from "the lesser evil" to "these bastards are inhuman monsters just like the rest of 'witches', let's get them".

I wouldn't probably use this as a main line of attack, but as a distraction? Find some ongoing conflict in which a middling country is losing, infiltrate a couple of skilled orators in the camps. Start preaching. Make sure the war drags on. Instigate a rebellion with a newly converted zealots at the head. Promise to end the war and let people go back to their homes and families if only they support you. Fund this rebellion (for added dastardliness use some neighbouring countries to finance it, they will be glad to weaken a rival) and assassinate key nobles of the country. There will be some casualties when rebels try to hunt down remaining nobles, but they can be used to fuel the revolution further. If all goes well you have a country with a new anti-magic regime in place and a virulent new ideology which will fall on a fertile religious soil. Use the lessons of WW1 and the rise of USSR basically. Only optimised for a different culture.

If the ideology was awesome enough one could probably even launch an enlightenment era with this. Economically this world is pretty much ready for it as far as I can see. The problem is strong ideological resistance to progress. If one could somehow decouple technological progress from religious stigma there would be nothing to stop it from starting and what better to do this than a country without magicians at all. After all it was magic that fouled up everything last time. Normal religious people making inventions for the sake of making life better for everyone surely is praiseworthy. While all this is going down you could probably make the mages fleeing the country some interesting offers which they would not refuse. It's just one example, but my brain is kind of stuck on it for now.
