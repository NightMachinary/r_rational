You've got an interesting world there. Here are some more questions and musings to help you iron it out:

Low population density. Are we talking here something like middle ages here in terms of population distribution? Most of population in agriculture? How about cities? Judging by how important you say trade is, I'd say there should be significant portion of population in cities engaged in producing those trade goods. Is there a printing press equivalent (as in relatively cheap, available, scalable copying of printed information)?

Answers to these questions should probably be enough to get a feel for the structure of society and formulate some more effective strategies, but going from what you've revealed thus far I have this one:

It's usually a safe bet that lower and middle class are going to secretly (or openly) hate nobility in that kind of society. Not only you have all the reasons from real world feudal societies, but on top of that they see nobility having magical powers which are pretty much forever out of their grasp. Your religion probably has significant influence as well and no doubt some anti-magic memes seeped into it over time. So my proposal is this: capitalise on hate and mistrust peasantry has for nobility using church as leverage.

Depending on the goals one could probably just convince and manipulate the current rulers into going along, but that's hardly munchkinry.
