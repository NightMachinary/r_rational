What kind of government are we talking here? For me the term "Kingdom" implies hereditary monarchy. The question becomes not how to breed mages, but how to exploit feudal system to your advantage in this case.

Some other pertinent questions in no particular order:

How frequent are military conflicts? How loyal are mages in a given kingdom? How easy is communication between mages (intra- and inter-kingdom), is there a common language? How about magical encryption of communication? How significant is trade between countries? How long do people live? Is culture in the old kingdoms stagnant or is there any kind of social and cultural development? What happens when there is a rebellion in one given kingdom? What about a feudal power struggle? A pretender to the throne?

Basically, I think your kind of system should really be exploited not based on acquiring numerous mages in secret, but either by cultural and social means (establish some kind of virulent international ideology to unite kingdoms) or by political means.

You could always go for a quick and dirty "assassinate top three (or two, if short on manpower) layers of feudal hierarchy in every country" plan. I doubt the political system would return to equilibrium in a hurry after that kind of shake-up. No threat of everyone uniting to curb stomp you if every count is fighting to be the next king.
