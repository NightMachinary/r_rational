You seem to have taken care of any obvious flaws I can see, so it's hard to think of any more without knowing more about the magic. Can you give examples of the more destructive things it can do? Does it have much of a money making ability? Is it solely destructive, or does it have other useful aspects which can be exploited?

Also, you mention science being dangerous too. Is that included in the treaty, or could a country have loads of non magic using scientists researching better spells to make the magicians more dangerous?
