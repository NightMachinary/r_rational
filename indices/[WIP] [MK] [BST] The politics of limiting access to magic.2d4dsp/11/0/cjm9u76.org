This is exactly the sort of comment I was hoping to get.

Hereditary monarchy is the norm. Military conflicts are common, although one kingdom entirely conquering another is very rare, because there comes a point where the enemy leadership just says "Fuck it, I'm going to take my best magicians and just break through your lines and turn your capitol into into slag."

Magicians are mostly the nobility and the very wealthy "Hey, I'll pay enough for you to pay the extra cost to the other countries /and/ enough to bribe you to let me have that extra spot". A few magicians are trained because they are the most gifted and loyal soldiers. Everyone who knows magic has a lot to lose then, and have a vested interest in keeping society relatively stable.

Communication is mostly fairly slow. There are telegraphs, but they run on magic and are require constant upkeep, so they are more rare and shorter range than they were in the real world. Spies do exist in every country, and a lot of trade vessels have a magician onboard to help create artificial winds when necessary.

There is a common language on the main continent. The worst you'll encounter is the difference between the US and Scotland as far as accent goes. Even when talking is difficult you can always communicate in writing, with only minor differences in spelling. Lands further away do have completely different languages, but diplomats are always on hand for the leaders, and magic regulation is thoroughly discussed, with extreme prejudice against any leaders whose accounts differ from spy reports.

No magical encryption of communication, I think. I have no idea how that would work. Mundane codes and encryptions exist and are used.

Trade is very significant, and spies and wind making magicians are common on such vessels.

People live as long as in the real world. High infant mortality rates amongst the poor, a solid 70+ life expectancy amongst the wealthy. Magical healing is not great, but it's around where medicine was 150 years ago.

Culture is relatively stable. There is some regional stagnation and some regional cultural development. Most notably the religions are very static and strongly opposed to magical and technological innovation.

When there is a rebellion surrounding countries make very certain that no extra magicians are trained, or they step in and take the side of whoever did not break the rules. This gives an enormous advantage to the king, who is the one who decides who is allowed to learn magic. Coups and assassinations are much more common than open rebellion.

Powerful noble families do squabble for power, and while assassinations are illegal they do happen. Rulers don't like losing magicians, but then rulers don't always get everything they want.

Pretenders to the throne, and cases where it's not clear who has the 'right' to the throne get interesting. It might be necessary for other countries to intervene and to force a discussion to take place in the magical location. At other times it becomes a 'mandate of heaven' deal where kingship is 'earned' by securing it. Other countries of course love to help someone win these struggles, since then they can secure favours from their new ally. Straight up puppet regimes do get found out in the magical location though, and then you get war.

Cultural and social manipulation does happen, and in fact the 'static, innovation hating' churches are the prime example of one of my ancient, long dead villains poisoning the waters after she realised she was going to lose.

Anarchy is frowned upon, and a kingdom that collapses will either be gobbled up by neighbours or forced to resolve themselves without training new magicians (With rule breaking factions being wiped out be other kingdoms). It's rare and gets pretty ugly, and the plot will include the main character's country turning into a very ugly mess indeed.
