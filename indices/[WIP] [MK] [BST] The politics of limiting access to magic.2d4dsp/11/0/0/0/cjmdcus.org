Thank you. Yes, mostly middle ages type distributions, although with more larger cities, and large areas of land that are not used by anyone at all (Because environmental hazards).

There are printing presses, although you need magicians to run them, so while the rich can print anything they like it's not quite as affordable to those living in the country.

There is some hate for the nobility (of course) and a lot of fear, but the church is pretty much deliberately set up to convince the population that magic is incredibly dangerous, and the lesser evil is to have the nobility around so they can hunt down any 'witches' (anyone who learns magic without permission, on purpose or otherwise).
