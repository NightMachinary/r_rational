Politics: Feudal rule worked because trained fighters in armor on horseback could fight quite a lot of regular farmers and win - This allowed them to rule by might. Magic throws that out the window. You would be replacing the aristocracy of arms with the aristocracy of magic pretty darn fast, and this is going to be blatantly obvious to any noble because they think in terms of force, plot and coup constantly. This means that no limit to numbers that does not allow the entire nobility of a given country to become mages themselves will be acceptable to said aristocracy. Any ruler that signs such a limit gets dead. That in turn means numbers scale with size and fraction of population that are nobles - which can be ridiculously high. One fifth of the population of medieval Poland were technically of noble rank!
