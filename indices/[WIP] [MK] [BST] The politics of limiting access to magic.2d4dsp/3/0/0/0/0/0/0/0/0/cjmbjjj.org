There wll be characters who think outside the box. Unfortunately, by the time the main character goes there to be crowned king (End of book 2) and to make declarations beyond what is necessary, the final villains are in play, and they absolutely destroy his public image by drugging him and technically-true implying that he is at the core of a conspiracy to resurrect the final villains and take over the world. The location will find itself the scene of more complete examinations and oaths, but what I'm really trying to do is set up a realistic system that could have lasted for 300 years of nations not plunging themselves into a new world war. In my world, then, no leader has emerged during these 300 years who was powerful enough to be able to force their hereditary noblemen to make statements in the location beyond "No, I'm not plotting to have you killed/overthrown" and "No, I haven't had the least suspicion of anyone in my jurisdiction trying to train too many magicians/learn forbidden magic. Individuals may make secret alliances that go beyond this, but the nobility as a whole would rather rebel against their king than be forced to admit to all their schemes and secrets. Certainly some kings have taken powerless individuals and given them power in exchange for frequently declaring their loyalty in the location, but the nobility as a group would not stand for it, and they are too powerful for a king to get rid of.
