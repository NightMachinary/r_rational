Reluctance does not matter, because it would become a condition of continued employment/survival in any position of delegated authority nearly instantly. Is anyone at all in a position to give you orders? Then "take your turn in the circle" is going to be one of the orders you get

. Heck, if there are any rulers at the top with an idealistic bent, just standing in the circle and accurately describing their motives, goals and ideals would be a ridiculously potent political weapon. If you don't want to make the story about a realm where feudalism suddenly started working nigh-flawlessly according to it's stated ideals, it needs nerfing. I suggest a limit to number of times a person can use it. Or a limit to the number times it can be used in a year so it must be rationed. That doesn't rule out the second use, of course, but hey, that would be a cool scene in it's own right, and it might take quite a while before anyone with the character to do it is both in a position to, and has thought of it.
