Do not underestimate how reluctant people would be to swear on /too/ much. Everyone in power wants some freedom and the ability to keep some secrets - there have been times when exceptional leaders have forced agents to make more detailed declarations of intention, but at the moment nobody has the power to force all the noble families in their kingdom to give up all their plots and secrets.

The nobility certainly do see themselves as the incorruptible guardians of all that is good in the world, but you'd be amazed at how slow the people can be to forgive and forget when a nobleborn teenager goes mad with power and starts abusing non-magicians.

I do not deny that the truth detection is incredibly powerful, and it will certainly be important to the plot. I am simply hoping to make a sufficiently realistic state of affairs before the plot starts breaking down everything the kingdoms have been relying on to keep the world relatively stable for a few hundred years.
