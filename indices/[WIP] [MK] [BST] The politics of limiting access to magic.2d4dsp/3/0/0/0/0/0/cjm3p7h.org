The oath circle is completely borked, also - Reliable truth detection alters.. the entirety of the socio-political fabric. Because running people through it for a rite of debriefing once a year gets you incorruptible agents. - A nation just only needs so many sheriffs, tax collectors, ect so running them all through the circle is completely doable, stagger it so you aren't emptying watchstations at once, noone could get a conspiracy of the ground to have a coup before the year is up because someone they need is always going to be near the annual rite of "These are the ways I have excelled and failed in my duties this year".

Does this seem minor to you? Further, knowing that the agents of the state /must/ preform their duties honestly would gain them immense trust from the people.
