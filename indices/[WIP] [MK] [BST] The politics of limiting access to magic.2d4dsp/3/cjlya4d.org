Doesn't work. High destructive magic in the hands of few magicians is even /more/ mis-usable than in the hands of all internally in each country, and obeying the treaties isn't a nash equilibrium, because anyone in violation can take on very large coalitions of compliant countries /and win/.

A more reasonable limit if you are going with oath magics, is to only teach magic to people who agree to not use it to kill people... except for mages in violation of that rule. That limiter is in the self-interest of the political forces that be (it prevents rule by magicians on the basis of fear and awe), and the balance of force is tilted against violators, not in favor of them.
