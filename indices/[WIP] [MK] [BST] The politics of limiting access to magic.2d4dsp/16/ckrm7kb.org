Sounds like an interesting setting. I love intricate magic systems - I'll look forward to seeing how this turns out.

Many of my ideas seem to have already been covered, but I have a few things for you to consider that I don't think I've seen (but it's a pretty big thread).

First off, I'd try to think of ways to game the definition of "train" to find other ways of creating spell casters. alexanderwales has already discussed this to some extent, but I think it can potentially be gamed further.

Examples:

- Can you use magic to cause a target's magical "muscles" to automatically begin to develop without any training involved? If so, casting that spell + providing the target with books may not constitute "training".

- Are there spells to transfer magical ability from one target to another? If so, you could potentially transfer some or all magical ability from mages to non-mages without it constituting "training".

- Once the ban on mind-magic is over, can you transfer knowledge of how to cast spells to a non-mage without it constituting training?

- Alternatively, if stealing magical power constitute training, can you transfer a bunch of magic to a few mages to make them more powerful?

- Is it possible for a mage to learn to suppress their magical ability (or any other mage's ability) from being detected?

- Is it possible to create an area where the ability to detect magic is nullified, either through directly removing that ability or making it useless (e.g. by saturating the area with too much ambient energy for individuals to be discernible).

- You mentioned that time travel doesn't exist, but what about time dilation? Could you build a [[http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Hyperbolic_Time_Chamber][hyperbolic time chamber]], or would this constitute "disabling physics" or manipulation of space? If this is plausible, using something like that as a rapid hidden training facility sounds like a potentially useful approach.

- Could you place people in stasis while under the effects of a spell that causes their magical "muscles" to be automatically stimulated into growth?

- Could you dig up dead mages, resurrect them, and recruit them without increasing your "training" count?

- Could you empower non-mage soldiers (or animals, etc.) with permanent magical buffs?

- What's the base number of mages a country can get, and how much does the cost increase per additional mage? What's the expected income of a mage with 1 year of training? How about 10? It seems pretty plausible that people would try to game the economy side.

Gaming the truth chamber could also be productive. I've already seen a lot of good ideas for this. A couple more:

- If "utterances" are what are detected for lies, could you use some sort of sound magic to dub over what you're saying, allowing you to "utter" truth (or just lip sync) and have others hear a false message?

- Puppet rulers have already been mentioned. What about sending a clone or a simulacrum with less knowledge than your own? Or, if those types of magic are impossible, how about a good old mundane twin?

- Does dying in the truth chamber prevent resurrection? This certainly isn't the most gamable approach, but it's worth considering.

- How well known is the exact wording (and intent) of the treaty? As long as you can convince your local nobles that your interpretation of the treaty is true, they can honestly say things in the meeting chamber that may circumvent the actual intentions behind it.

Aside from that, it sounds like there are some other fun things you could probably leverage:

- Your setting sounds like there are some very powerful magical beasts. Learning to control these (through mundane or magical means) sounds like a potential game changer, especially the ones that are highly resistant to magic.

- How does magic resistance work? Can it be trained? Could you train an army of soldiers with a high degree of magic resistance, even if they're not actually mages themselves?

- What are the limitations on magical devices? Could you have a non-mage army that carries tons of enchanted gear?
