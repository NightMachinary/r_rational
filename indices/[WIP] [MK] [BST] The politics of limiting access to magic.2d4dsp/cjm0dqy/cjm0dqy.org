Depending on how magic is learned, a useful strategy could be to train mock-mages who understand the mechanics but haven't actually wielded the power, and thus do not give off the glow. To make an example from HP, people who've been given wands without power cores, and then taught to cast spells. Technically, they haven't used magic, but as soon as they've got a power core, they're off to the races.

Past that, this magical location thing, how hard is it to set up, and is the lie detector's death function separate from its killing function? Because barring extreme difficulty to create, I fail to see how every ruler wouldn't have a ceremonial room for accepting oaths of loyalty, nobles protests be damned (since you'd only need one iteration of the full-loyalty test, and then hey, nobody cares anymore because they're all loyal). Or a courthouse that can determine the truth of every statement. Killing might be going a bit far, but if everyone can tell when you're lying, either you need to doublespeak like a boss, or you wouldn't commit crime (or be disloyal) in the first place.

As far as wild mages go, the limits on divination and training time are the two most pressing concerns. Could I set sail for the middle of the ocean, get out of range, then train mages fast enough to supply food and water to the ship? How accurate are the divinations at finding wild mages? If I dig a mineshaft half a kilometer down, can I still be found?
