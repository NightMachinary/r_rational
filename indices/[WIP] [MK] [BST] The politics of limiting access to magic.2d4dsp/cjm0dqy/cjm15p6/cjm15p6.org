Only one location, and it can't realistically be replicated. The gods died to make it and a few other special locations (that work differently).

The ocean would not work for a training ground because there are sea monsters that are drawn to magic like moths to a flash light, but you could set up camp out in the middle of the wilderness somewhere. Magic wouldn't let you conjure up free food, but it would certainly increase food production significantly. By the time your community was large enough to hold a whole army, though, you'd probably have been found. But hey, maybe not - there /have/ been world wars before where millions of magicians have existed at the same time. They just didn't end so well for anone who helped start them. There's no remote sensing magic other than very unpredictable prophecy, and even that is currently shut down because of man made extra laws of nature that stop some of the more powerful magic.

Training mock mages works to some small extent, but most of the training is really just slowly learning to handle more power without dying in terrible agony.
