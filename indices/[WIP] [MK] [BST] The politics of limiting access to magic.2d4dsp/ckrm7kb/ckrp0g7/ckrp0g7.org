And here I thought I had milked this thread for all it was worth. Thank you very much for your input. It is very useful to me. Let's get to it:

1: No as far as politics is concerned. Indirect bulking would still be treated by other countries as training, and would detect the same as 'real' training. Treaty aside, you could speed up magic-holding training by hijacking your trainee's body and making it hold magic even when the trainee is too much in pain/unconscious to train normally.

2: No, magic cannot be transferred. If the Seal was to be removed, you could sacrifice someone's soul for a heck of a one shot burst, but the only people who have discovered any way of permanently stealing magic potential are a few of the most important villains. Me the author knows how this will work, but it's not low hanging fruit.

3: Once the Seal goes down the treaty is the least of anyone's worries. Yes, you could move knowledge very easily between minds. You could do it against either party's will, or against both parties' if you were a sadistic outsider. Magic-holding tolerance (I should find a name for that) is not transferrable, and needs to be pumped manually.

4: While the Seal stands, no. Once the Seal falls, the villains with the knowledge will return, and they do do this.

5: From the passive, always on sensing of other magicians, yes. This is forbidden, but all the countries have the knowledge, and once in a while a spy is caught doing it and it is very embaressing for the home country. But actively delving a magician will reveal them unless the skill difference between them is very big. A few years of training will make it very easy to actively delve someone with 50 years of experience, so in this case, active sensing just wins.

6: Directly no, by raising noise yes. Would be seen as incredibly suspicious, though.

7: When the Seal falls, time dilation becomes available to all. It's very energy intensive, and you couldn't really speed up local time by more than ~50% without some sort of massive power battery. My good guys do eventually get their hands on such a battery. Again, once the Seal falls the treaty is dust, and timey wimey shenanigans will happen.

8: No.

9: Once the Seal falls, the major players all have access to resurrection magic. And mind reading. And mind control. And soul destruction. The baddies control the timing of the fall of the Seal, and will make the most of this.

10: Temporary buffs yes. Permanent buffs no. Permanent magical weapons and such do exist, but they are slow to make and rare, and usually a lot more useful in the hands of a magician.

11: Not quantified. The cost of extra mages will increase exponentially, so while bigger richer countries can afford more and even smaller countries usually buy at least a few extra because the costs can be recouped, they can't afford /too/ many extra. Magicians often become the very best in their trades (Life is not fair at all), and poor magicians are almost unheard of.

Chamber:

1: This can be done. This has been done. But it is not currently a well known trick. The biggest obstacle to doing it is that magic being /used/ is extremely obvious to all magicians present, and cannot be easily hidden. So you would have to find a way to use magic while speaking without attracting suspicion.

2: No such magic. Mundane twin could work, although identifying yourself is part of the procedure.

3: It does. You turn to stone and your soul is broken.

4: Wiggleroom exists, and interpretation plays a role. But I the author do not intend to write a full text of the treaty, and I'm making it fairly solid.

Miscellaneous:

1: It sure would be. Let's hope the scientist crazy lady who created most of the monsters is not the very first villain to return from the dead and go into hiding.

2: Magic resistance is really not something you could train, any more than you could train your resistance to gamma rays in the real world. Some non-human creatures have resistance because they were made that way (as weapons of war that have since gone wild), and you can use powerful magic to /avoid/ incoming attacks, but resisting it with your body is a no go.

3: Slow to make, requires specialized knowledge to make. While the Seal stands the magical gear that can be made is not super hot by the standards of the pre-Seal weapons, although it'll still be strictly superior to anything mundane. A naked magician would still wipe the floor with a non-magician with high quality magical gear.
