Great answers! I'm glad to be of some help. I love digging into magic systems, and it sounds like you've put a lot of thought into yours. I'll look forward to seeing your work.

I'd suggest the "train a pair of twins to play the role of the same person" idea, but I think it's been done enough in other fiction.

Glad to hear you've already thought of most of this stuff. I'm especially interested to see the crazy scientist with the magic beasts. =D
