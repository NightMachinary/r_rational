Assuming physics works as in the real world, there should be some ways to get around the scrying limitation. In our world we have UAVs. Can you use magic to do something similar? Fly high above the enemy, take photos, take them or send them back to an ally, analyze them for hints of enemy activity and locations.

If you can develop sonar/ radar you can get some idea of the structure of objects within an area. It's more fiddly and mathematical so it would be harder.

If you can make a controllable animal (with some cancer) and some sort of camera you can send animals inside buildings to spy on people.

With these you can use mathematics and artillery mages to bombard kings from a distance.

If you need extra workers in the winter what better than some sort of mind control device that can force them to work past the pain, not rebel, and fight in human shield waves against any enemies? Zombies are a massive boon to leaders. Especially if you can make some way of it being transmissible by touch so less mages are needed.

Yay for cancer powers.

You're welcome.
