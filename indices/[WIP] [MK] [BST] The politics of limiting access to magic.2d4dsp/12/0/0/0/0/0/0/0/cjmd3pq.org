Flying works but is risky - it takes a lot of energy and concentration, leaving you quite visible and with less than your full attention on dodging attacks and striking back.

Magical sonar I've thought of, and it will make appearances.

Cancer controlled animals will also make an appearance, though more to spread magical diseases (and cancer) than to spy, since what few ways the villains have of transmitting information over a distance is amongst their most guarded secrets.

Long range bombardments do work, and will see use later on, although while global politics remain stable nobody wants the massive hate they would get if they were the first to use it.
