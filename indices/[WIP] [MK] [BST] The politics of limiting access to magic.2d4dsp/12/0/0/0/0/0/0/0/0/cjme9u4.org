Many of the best books have massive conflicts between age old conspiracies and centuries old plans so I wholey approve of this conflict.

You could probably make flying a fair bit easier with a simple wingsuit made of whale bone, steel and silk or some variant. Unless they do have some magic to boost eyesight they should be fairly invisible at night at three or four kilometers in some dark outfit.

There are lots of cheap ways to send information a long distance. Make a fire, put it in a box with an opening at one end, flash it morse code style. Some sort of semaphore line can be very useful. If you want to find out closely guarded secrets spying is very helpful.

Yay for instability.
