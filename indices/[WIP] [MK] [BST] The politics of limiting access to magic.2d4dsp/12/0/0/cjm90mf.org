Ah ok. Then I imagine there would just be heavy effort to use your influence to force foreigners to accept your magicians, just as Americans pressure foreign nations to use their technology, as the Chinese pressure Americans to use their people.

I can imagine some ways you could legitimately strongly pressure a leader to accept more mages of yours. Ferment a civil war, make them doubt the loyalty of their own country's mages, convince them to hire your more loyal mercenaries. That's been common through history- when internal divisions are bad and you can't trust your countrymen you hire foreign soldiers who are loyal to your money and who perhaps don't speak your language, have wives at home, are much harder to subvert.

I imagine that political leaders would have existing methods to prevent decapitation strikes- body guards, body doubles, illusion magics to decoy attacks, fast building so they could have multiple castles, flying mages searching for anyone who was glowing- you're already at risk from any non aligned mages or assassins from other nations. With ten thousand mages you can seriously step up these efforts.

Here's how I imagine you set it up.

You have several base camps which indicate some degree of illegal research/ legal research into necromancy and resurrection. They will be legally/ illegally abducting people, and then sending them onwards through more secure efforts to the secret camp/ camps (depending on local geography).

Anyone who tries to track the abductions will come to these decoy bases and it can be stopped, they can then be sent to another country.

In the mean while, a huge number of people (orphans, prostitutes, vulnerable people etc) can be abducted and sent to these indoctrination camps, a small number expended on research.

In a couple years you have a huge army and advanced necromancy/ resurrection magic, along with very advanced earth shaping magic from your many years of making underground tunnels. You use this to protect your leaders and civilians from attacks and revive the dead, fast build new homes for anyone who had theirs destroyed, and build large earth defences against mage attacks. In the meantime you train hundreds of thousands/ millions of one trick mages who can be used for other purposes.
