The unwanted magicians would be hunted down by armies. As long as all the leaders can truthfully say that they do not want these magicians and they are hunting them down they wouldn't have to pay. Foreign diplomats similarly do not count against /your/ limit.

Magicians can of course be subverted, and there are even mercenary magicians who will sell their services.

The dying king scheme my world is not guarded against. That would be extremely problematic. Although in the world war that followed, that kingdom would be decapitated just as surely as everyone else, because even without their own leaders, survivors from other kingdoms would be numerous enough and pissed enough that you'd get a few highly skilled magicians willing to die to murder your whole family. Still, a good plan, and it would certainly wreck havoc.
