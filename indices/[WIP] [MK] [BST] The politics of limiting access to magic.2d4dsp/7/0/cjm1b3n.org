Much, much easier to destroy than to protect or build. This means that if you hide your army in a fortress you are going to lose more men than if they were spread out and able to move about.

You can indeed live out in the wilderness, but while magic can increase crop yields, it can't conjure food out of thin air.

Magic is very good for making money, but the exponential price increase is extremely punishing.

Divination: No scrying, unreliable prophecy, illusions useless against magicians of equal skill. A fully trained magician would very much lament the loss of their eyes. And they couldn't even regrow those, unless they were one of the very best healers in history.
