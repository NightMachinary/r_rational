What can this magic do?

We know that it has powerful large scale attack abilities, and not mind control.

Can magic be used to defend locations effectively? This would remove one of the major downsides of building up a mage army, as those new mages could protect you from attacks.

Can a group of 5-1000 mages live independently in the wilderness in relative comfort while still increasing in power? This would make it very hard to track them down, as a support structure is not needed.

Is magic good for making money? This would lead to semi-exponential growth in the number of mages that a country buys, as they can pay for themselves.

What is the extent of magic's intelligence and counterintelligence capabilities (divination and illusion)? If divination isn't powerful enough, then finding out about the other countries' actions would be very difficult.
