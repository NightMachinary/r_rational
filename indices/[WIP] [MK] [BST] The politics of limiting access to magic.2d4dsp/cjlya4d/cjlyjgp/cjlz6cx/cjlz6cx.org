Quite so - if you start off leading one of the kingdoms, you wouldn't get away with it. A magician takes a few years to train 'properly', though one year could be enough to make a very dangerous few trick pony. A magician with twenty years' experience could easily take on a dozen magicians with only one year's training, though, and if every kingdom around you wants you dead there is nothing you can do other than decide whether you want to take others with you into the grave or not.

I appreciate his trying to poke holes, though, because in explaining why it wouldn't work I have to play it out in my head.
