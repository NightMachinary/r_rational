  Doesn't work. High destructive magic in the hands of few magicians is even more mis-usable than in the hands of all internally in each country, and obeying the treaties isn't a nash equilibrium, because anyone in violation can take on very large coalitions of compliant countries and win.

That depends entirely on how long it takes to train up a mage. If you can just read directly from a spellbook and do great things, then sure. But if training up a mage takes five years or so, you wouldn't be able to fly under the radar for long enough to build your counter-measures for when someone is coming for your head.
