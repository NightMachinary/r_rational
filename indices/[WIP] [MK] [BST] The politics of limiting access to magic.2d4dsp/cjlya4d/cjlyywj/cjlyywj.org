Thank you for your input! Here's the thing, though. No matter how good you are with magic, destruction is /way/ easier than defense, so if a few thousand magicians are prepared to die to get you and your family, your army of illegal magicians won't be able to stop them. Your destructuve capabilities are much greater than theirs, sure, but their destructive power is still greater than your defensive power. There are incentives to cut corners and to abuse your powers within your own country, sure, but even if you are the first to betray and you manage to build a larger army than the rest of the world combined before the next world war starts, that just means that you can destroy more land and people than your enemies can. They will still glass your seat of power, regardless of whether your enormous army is employed razing /their/ seats of power or defending your own. If you wanted destructon you could get it this way, but if your motivation is personal ambition breaking the treaty would not be a good idea, because you would end up having to kill a sizeable chunk of the remaining populations, and you would most certainly end up with all cities in absolute ruin.

As for oaths - the oaths aren't binding per se, you just die if you don't think you'll follow them /when you speak them/. There are a few oaths people swear in the location, but it's mostly restricted to the kings and the most powerful/mistrusted noblemen, as well as a very few trials being held there. The reason they don't all have to declare their good intentions there every year is because the nobility like their power, and fear and awe (Though not too much, they aren't "Evil") is very useful for +keeping the powerless powerless+ maintaining law and order and our blessed religion and tradtions.
