Asshole magicians are a big problem, and spoiled teenagers drunk with power can get extremely shitty. If they go /too/ far they will be dealt with, although it's perfectly conceivable that they'll keep their crimes low profile enough that a few bribes would let them keep terrorizing their region for many years. Magic cannot be kept up all day, though, and raping a few peasants and passing out in a tavern is a really good way to get yourself murdered. Should you be accused of sufficiently outrageous abuse of power, the magical location is very rarely used for trials as well, although you'd have to be accused of pretty horrible crimes for this to happen.

Sociopath magicians are enormously dangerous in my world, and some of my villains qualify.

Teenage magicians throwing tantrums are a menace, but their parents are probably vastly superior to them in magic, enough so that they could capture them alive if needed.

Noble families do squabble amongst themselves, and while assassinations are illegal they do happen.
