My apologies - duels between anything near equals are often mutually lethal because you are not allowed to prepare beforehand, but outside of those a magician with a clear advantage can usually kill an inferior with only moderate danger to themselves. A (young) teenager going up against their parent (Likely with 15+ years more experience) is going to get one of three results:

1) They chicken out, because their parent is so strong that they can't beat them without making it very obvious that they are trying to murder their liege and parent.

2) Their parent destroys their defenses with non-lethal attacks and injures them. When you lose concentration while holding magic in my world, you lose control of the magic, which immediately tears itself free and exits your body with zero regards for your health. Which hurts a /lot/ and can severely injure you if you were holding much magic. A teenager that experiences this is going to have days or a week of lying in bed thinking about how much they want to avoid it happening again. In real combat, an attack that takes your hand off when you are holding as much magic as you can is going to result in your own magic killing you from within, leaving a charred and blistered corpse that died screaming. Those with only a year or three of training have the advantage of not being able to hold enough magic within themselves that they would die if they lost control of it.

3) The teenager draws in much more magic than they can safely hold, which does mean they could probably kill their parent, but which also means that they are doing so much damage to their untrained body that they may die regardless of the outcome of the fight.

If you deliberately suicide bomb, you can take out someone much stronger than you. If you wish to survive, you are either going to settle for attacking someone much weaker than you or attack either when they are not prepared or when you yourself have some other significant advantage. If both parties are somewhere near equal and similarly prepared, yes, they will likely both die, and either would be unlikely to have time to retreat. Magicians avoid fair fights like the plague, therefore.
