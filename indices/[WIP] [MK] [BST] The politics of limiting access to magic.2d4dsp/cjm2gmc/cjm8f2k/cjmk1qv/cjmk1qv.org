  Teenage magicians throwing tantrums are a menace, but their parents are probably vastly superior to them in magic, enough so that they could capture them alive if needed.

I thought offense was so much stronger than defense that a mage fight was always a mutual kill? Even if the parents are fighting non lethal, a kid throwing a tantrum is by definition out of control and would not fight no lethal.
