Hm. It occurs to me that I think we're working on the wrong question. Forget about international regulation, what about intranational?

If one mage goes psychotic (or if one psychotic manages to hide his crazy long enough to become a mage), you have a WMD wandering around. If there are no remote sensing magics, then catching that WMD is going to be very difficult.

Or, suppose you have noble families, most of whom are magicians. What happens when one of their spoiled kids (who started training at 8 or 10 and, after 3 or 5 years, has become quite powerful albeit not fully trained) has a tantrum?

Or if two noble families start "going to the mattresses" with each other?
