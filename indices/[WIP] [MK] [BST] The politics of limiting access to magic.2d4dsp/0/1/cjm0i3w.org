I shall have to read The Two Year Emperor. I should have mentioned however that in my world teleportation does not exist, because if it did the last world war would have ended in a sea of nuclear fire.

Replies to bullet points:

1: Indirectly, by making leaders swear in the magical location that so far as they know, there are no extra magicians being trained. As long as all major leaders know they can't get away with cheating, any upstarts trying to build an army in secret can be dealt with as soon as found. And there are of course spies for all the usual reasons, and some of these are magicians.

2: A few years. You could train a very dangerous few trick pony in one year, but they wouldn't be very dangerous to someone who's been a magician for a few years more. Ten years will see them about as good with magic as they'll get, but that's in large part because all the really cool stuff is buried under three hundred years of paranoid blanket bans and religious prohibitions.

3: You mostly don't. You kill them. In a fight between anything near equals, it's much more likely that both die than that one manages to capture the other alive.

4: You could certainly subvert/bribe/blackmail enemy magicians. The problem would come if they became officially yours and you had to pay for them or if you conquered the enemy state and suddenly had to pay for all the magicians they had at once. Other countries would not let you get away with doubling your number of magicians, nor with installing a puppet regime.

5: Other countries would get really suspicious and start to investigate very thoroughly. Leaders do not have to come every year, but if you were supposed to come and you don't, all your neighbours are going to start trading intelligence with each other.

Blitzkrieg decapitation would indeed be the way to go. Unfortunately, in my world offense is so /very/ much stronger than defense that even if you have the military might to decapitate every country around you simultaneously there are going to be enough individuals and small groups left who are after your head that your seat of power is going to turn into slag. It's not /impossible/ to take over the world, but it's going to take more than a really sneaky, well educated ruler to do it. In the case of my final villains, what it takes is a few bat shit sociopath scientists willing to turn their soldiers into scientists and a /really/ good PR machine.

During the course of the plot some the layers of my laws of nature are peeld back, and we get magical plagues, mind control, resurrections, magical genetic engineering, cults, bending and breaking space, time manipulation (though no travelling backwards in time, good gods that would just break everything into little pieces), prophecies, weather manipulation, the destructon of souls, /actual/ magically binding oaths, etc etc.

Point 9 was mostly just to say that most leaders are sufficiently certain that they would lose in the long run if they chose to betray, though from time time someone tries to cheat and so far they have all been stopped long before they could take on the rest of the continent.

Phew, long reply. Thank you for making me formulate this.
