  Indirectly, by making leaders swear in the magical location that so far as they know, there are no extra magicians being trained.

Hang on though, this doesn't speak to my point. My suggestion was that an official one or two ranks below the king would start training mages /without telling the king/. That way the king can honestly swear at the moot that he is not training any extra mages, that his totals are within expected bounds. Once the nation has built up a decisive advantage, off you go.

  Unfortunately, in my world offense is so very much stronger than defense that even if you have the military might to decapitate every country around you simultaneously there are going to be enough individuals and small groups left who are after your head that your seat of power is going to turn into slag.

Hm, ok, then you need to be a combination of Otto von Bismarck and Cardinal Richelieu -- you form alliances with other nations to keep people off /your/ back, and you trick other nations into going to war with each other. Arrange for the mages of other nations to be assassinated, preferably in ways that look like accidents. Failing the "accidents" route, cast the blame on one of your enemies. Once you've eliminated enough enemy mages, you decapitate /the mages/, not the political rulers.

  You could train a very dangerous few trick pony in one year, but they wouldn't be very dangerous to someone who's been a magician for a few years more.

Would they be good enough that an assassin trained with a couple of tricks could take out a more powerful mage? Transmute his wine into poison (or liquid gold, or whatever), conjure grease under his feet as he's going down a long, steep staircase, arrange for something heavy to fall on him...?

You've said that magical defense is not terribly strong, at least proportionately. Is that just against magical attacks? Vlad Taltos once remarked “No matter how subtle the wizard, a knife between the shoulder blades will seriously cramp his style.” Is that true? If so, poison or an arrow should do just fine and could be done by a mundane, so there's no 'mageglow' to give him away.

  In a fight between anything near equals, it's much more likely that both die than that one manages to capture the other alive.

Huh. I would expect that one of them would win and kill the other, not that it would be MAD. If two roughly equal mages is a probable double suicide, then why would mages ever be willing to fight?
