There are two reasons why duels (which are rare as a result) tend to be mutually deadly. First, if both our shields crumble at the first attack, both our first attacks strike home. You can build up a fairly strong shield if you have time, but if you split your attention between attacking immediately and raising a bare bones defense at the same time and your opponent does the same, well then both of your shields will crumble and you'll both have a lightning bolt/ball of fire hot enough to melt armour thrown at you. Not always deadly, but pretty damn dangerous. Second, there's always the chance that your enemy hates you enough that they would be willing to die to kill you, and full attack will absolutely destroy the sort of defense you could set up while simultaneously attacking. Outside of a duel defense can be actually useful, but if you both go into a one on one with no shield up, the first attack can be deadly. To contrast - a mock duel would involve spending at least 20 seconds building up a shield before the fight starts, and whoever first scratches this (inner) shield wins.
