When two martial artists start fighting, they probably each believe they will win. In general, one of them wins and one loses. Fights where both people end up dead are rare enough in real life that they are used as a dramatic device in movies.

Is there a reason why mages are different -- that a fight between two relatively-equal mages will be a mutual kill, instead of the marginally superior / luckier / cleverer one winning and the other losing?
