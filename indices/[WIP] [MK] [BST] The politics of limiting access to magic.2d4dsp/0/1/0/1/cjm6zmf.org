  My suggestion was that an official one or two ranks below the king would start training mages without telling the king. That way the king can honestly swear at the moot that he is not training any extra mages, that his totals are within expected bounds. Once the nation has built up a decisive advantage, off you go.

That could work. There is the risk of discovery, but with a little luck or a lot of careful planning, this could actually be pulled off. It would still probably result in the death of anyone related to the ruler when enemy nations go into revenge mode, but it could certainly result in a very destructive war where you have the advantage.

  Hm, ok, then you need to be a combination of Otto von Bismarck and Cardinal Richelieu -- you form alliances with other nations to keep people off your back, and you trick other nations into going to war with each other. Arrange for the mages of other nations to be assassinated, preferably in ways that look like accidents. Failing the "accidents" route, cast the blame on one of your enemies.

This happens a lot. Rulers seldom take it as far as trying for world domination, but they certainly seek to indirectly decrease the number of enemy magician, the more so as magicians tend to be the rich, educated and powerful in every nation.

  Would they be good enough that an assassin trained with a couple of tricks could take out a more powerful mage? Transmute his wine into poison (or liquid gold, or whatever), conjure grease under his feet as he's going down a long, steep staircase, arrange for something heavy to fall on him...?
#+end_quote

Yes. Assassination is the favoured way of getting rid of magicians, because although very powerful, they can't keep their defenses and enhanced senses up all day (magic is too draining for that), and when not wielding magic they are as vulnerable as anyone else. Transmutation is much weaker, slower and more limited than in HPMOR, but assassinations happen with frequency.

  You've said that magical defense is not terribly strong, at least proportionately. Is that just against magical attacks? Vlad Taltos once remarked “No matter how subtle the wizard, a knife between the shoulder blades will seriously cramp his style.” Is that true? If so, poison or an arrow should do just fine and could be done by a mundane, so there's no 'mageglow' to give him away.
#+end_quote

Correct. A very good healer may be able to guard against most poisons, but a knife in the back will kill them dead. You better hope you get them in the heart, though, because even if they are mortally wounded, a few seconds is all they would need to lash out at their assassin and murder them with fire.

#+begin_quote
  I would expect that one of them would win and kill the other, not that it would be MAD. If two roughly equal mages is a probable double suicide, then why would mages ever be willing to fight?

Duels are pretty rare. In anything outside of a formal one on one battle, whoever strikes first usually wins. Like soldiers with rocket launchers and machine guns, a duel is going to get very ugly, but in the battlefield whoever first gets a shot in wins. Magicians do have /some/ chance of surviving attacks, but it's going to take several seconds to build up a shield that deflect an attack conjued in only one. On the other hand, it's easier to spend minutes building up a shield than it is to spend minutes building up a magical attack. In the heat of combat dodging is the way to go, but if you have much more experience than the opponent or you /greatly/ outnumber them, shields can work.
