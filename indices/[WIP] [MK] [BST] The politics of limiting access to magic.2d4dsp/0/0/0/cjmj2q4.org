Other rulers: what the hell are you trying to pull?! :)

Alternatively, the under minister (Al) wants to be king, so he sets the current ruler (Bob) up as a patsy -- Al trains the mages and then starts using them against other countries. At first Bob looks like the guilty party and war breaks out. Someone might be rational enough to get Bob to the moot site and lie detector him, but someone won't be. Once fighting breaks out, you are likely to have a feud situation -- everyone would be better off if the fighting stopped, but there's too much bad blood.
