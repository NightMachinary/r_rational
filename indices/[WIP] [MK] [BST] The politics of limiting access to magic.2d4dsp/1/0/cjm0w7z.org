Interesting about the US. I'm from Sweden, so not entirely up on how that worked, but the comparison seems to work. There is indeed that interesting balance going on between the countries.

1: War is allowed. It's just that, if you do capture any significant amount of land all the other countries are going to start forcing you to declare just how many magicians you captured, and how you'll pay for them. In reality most magicians are wealthy nobility, and would much rather help you pay to keep them alive than have you be forced to execute them. Magician-less warfare does indeed happen, because common soldiers are much cheaper to replace.

2: You would indeed. My nobility has it pretty good. It's common to start training around age ten, though it can vary.

3: It's common to select the most intelligent and skilled soldiers to be trained in magical theory to gauge who might be more suited, but the amount of time you could save is not a lot, since growing in magical strength is as much about training your 'magic muscle' (Which is your whole body) as it is about specific knowledge. Still, they'll take 'a little' over 'nothing'.

4: Years. Ten years will get them as far as they'll go, one year is enough to make them clearly superior to any non-magician.

5: :)

6: Yup.
