While the man made seal stands, that is correct. Rape by deception can still lead to pregnancy, but the people who put the seal together went out of their way to prevent the most insanely evil leaders from just kidnapping people and breeding them. I don't think this part of the seal will ever come up in the book, it will just be implied. The protection ceases when the seal falls.

The terms: 'destroying reality' simply means that in order to completely shut down 'normal physics' etc you would have to obliterate the world of humans. Short of that you might fiddle with it temporarily and locally, but it will tend to revert to how it was first set.

The winds of destiny is just... Well, the world itself seems to /want/ certain things. Chance subtly conspires to encourage certain developments. Mostly what destiny seems to want is large empires and larger wars. The gods when they were alive tried to limit this influence as much as possible, and in their death laid down a seal that very much weakened its influence. The human made seal eventually shut down what little influence remained. The more these seals were to weaken, the more fate would become a real concern. 'Riding the winds of Destiny' simply means abusing the hell out of this in order to make sure that the best way for destiny to accomplish what it wants is to help you with your ambitions.

Bending space and time would be speeding up/slowing down local time and stretching space. Both of these are incredibly powerful and not currently possible, although they both become possible and extremely exploitable over the course of the series.

  It sounds like you've got it pretty sewed up though.

Thank you! The first book is abut 90% complete (the first draft at least), and almost all the important plot elements and character development are planned out for the remaining nine books.
