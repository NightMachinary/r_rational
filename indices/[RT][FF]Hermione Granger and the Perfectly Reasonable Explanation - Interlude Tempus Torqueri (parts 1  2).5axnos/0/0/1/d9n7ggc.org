Update: I reread the whole story on my laptop with the Interlude open on my phone so I could read all the relevant passages in their proper place. In retrospect I think this would have been necessary even if I had just read the whole thing for the first time in a single sitting, rather than over the course of months. On the one hand, it was very cool to see the sentence-by-sentence specificity with which the Interlude made sense of the main story and vice versa. On the other hand, I don't think it's feasible to have a book where you are essentially /required/ to go back and reread it from the beginning when you hit chapter 18. Since I am not myself Hermione, and don't automatically memorize everything I read, sentences like

#+begin_quote
  Defence class definitely raised some concern, as Quirrell was obviously distracted in a way that suggested he was thinking about the murder.
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
  Even as Hermione began to panic in earnest, the girl called to Madam Wainscott, and then, quietly, /taunted/ her.
#+end_quote

(2 of many possible examples) lose much of their effectiveness if you aren't reading them directly alongside YH's account of the same events.

I don't have a suggestion here; this Interlude was great and obviously necessary and I don't know how you could possibly avoid this problem, but it is nonetheless a problem.
