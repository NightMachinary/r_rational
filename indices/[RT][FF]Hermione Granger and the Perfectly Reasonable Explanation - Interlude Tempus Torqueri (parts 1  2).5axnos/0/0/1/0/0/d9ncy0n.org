  As it was, I had hoped that the references were general enough that most readers would at least vaguely recognize the context for most events, and even if they didn't it wouldn't matter too much. But it's obviously impossible for me to judge that accurately, since I wrote everything, and I've re-read the entire story many times for purposes of keeping continuity straight.
