I follow what you mean, and I agree in both senses. I tried a bit of it with full details for context - you can see that in the memory of Ollivanders YH picked up from OH in the Library in Chapter 12, it reads sort of like a "director's commentary" track. Fine for a short bit, but recapping the entire story that way I suspect would've been unbearable for me /and/ most readers. If I were doing it over completely, I might've arranged things so OH's periods of lucidity were shorter, less frequent, and more widely spaced, so a direct rehash would've been less onerous?

As it was, I had hoped that the references were general enough that most readers would at least /vaguely/ recognize the context for most events, and even if they didn't it wouldn't matter too much. But it's obviously impossible for me to judge that accurately, since I /wrote/ everything, and I've re-read the entire story many times for purposes of keeping continuity straight.
