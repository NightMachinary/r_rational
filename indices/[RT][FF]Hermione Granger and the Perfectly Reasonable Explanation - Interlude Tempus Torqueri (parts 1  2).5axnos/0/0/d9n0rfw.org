Thanks. :)

OH's justification for not info-dumping on Dumbledore the instant she arrived is actually /better/ than YH's - she was forced in the direction of "protecting capital-H-History" by the specific details of what happened to her, even to the point of acting irrationally. Her excuses about backlashes and Time reasserting itself are /rationalizations/ for a decision made for completely different reasons.

I tried to illustrate that through her thought processes in the Interlude, but it wasn't as steady and explicit a decline as I might have shown had I been formally writing the Interlude in parallel with the rest of the story, as opposed to just jotting down short notes as I went and then connecting the dots afterward, which is what actually happened. Of course, that's probably for the best - if I'd done it the other way, the interlude might have come in closer to 60k than 16k, and I'd still be on chapter 14 right now. :)
