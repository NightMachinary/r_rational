When I speak of ambition here, I'm talking about over-reaching goals that motivate someone to achieve instrumental goals they wouldn't have otherwise. Even in the Gryffindor version, it doesn't have to be about becoming magically powerful (though as you say, that invariably helps), there it's about producing changes to the world that actually /move the needle/. Since she was naturally inclined towards study, becoming academically successful is not an ambitious goal for her - it's readily achievable, and she's doing it for no better reason than she enjoys it, plus it's /school/ and she's /supposed/ to. That's not a bad thing, but it's not ambitious in the way I mean.

Canon Hermione occasionally had limited ambitions beyond that, but they were generally of the "solve the immediate problem" variety, almost uniformly shared by Harry, and invariably temporary. Even Dumbledore's Army can be read as much as working around a failure of her existing goal of academic success - since DADA was rubbish - than of preparing to fight Voldemort. Finding Horcruxes probably qualifies, but it's an open question if she would have taken up that quest on her own. Even after his return was ostensibly public, she never (that we were shown - admittedly we never had access to her internal monologue) committed herself to learning as much as she could /because/ it would help her oppose Voldemort, she was just helpful for the latter /incidentally/.

Even helping others academically was never expressed as part of some elective philosophy (because I have been gifted with natural talents, it is my responsibility to help others), but simply the way she was, instinctively. Again, not bad, entirely commendable and admirable even, but not /ambitious/. Moving the needle in that category would've meant, say, trying to break the curse on the Defence position, lobbying against Snape's damaging teaching methods, trying to get Trelawney replaced with someone who could actually teach at /all/. Even if her ambition was simply to become Headmistress, to fix things - things that might improve Hogwarts and Magical Britain for /decades/, not just while she happened to be in the room with someone as a student - that would've been a compass to follow that would've informed her decision-making.

For me, "Greatness" necessarily includes a splash of /exceeding/ one's potential, and Hermione was gifted with a great deal of potential. I suppose she /met/ it in canon (even if Minister of Magic is never really presented as a particularly effective post). But if her ambition was really to make the world a better place, she went about it in a haphazard way that doesn't really befit her particular gifts. Of course in reality most people are like that, I'm certainly no different, particularly as a child - I squandered my own gifts /hard/. But I, and most people, are not /great/.

But again, it probably would've been difficult to write that for Hermione and still have it be /Harry/'s story. Or indeed a children's story at all, let alone one remotely as popular. :)
