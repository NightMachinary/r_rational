The goals-within-goals definition of ambition seems to me to be a pretty contrived one, but even taking that as a premise, if Hermione's overarching ambition was to improve the well-being of the society's most vulnerable members, and the ways in which she wanted to do it were feasible within the system, then, consider the things she had actually done:

- Read /Hogwarts, a History/ --- and as you say, what happens at Hogwarts drives the rest of the society for decades
- Avoid getting into unnecessary conflicts with others students
- Researched magical law
- Researched systems of oppression in the wizarding world
- Graduated from Hogwarts at the top of her class
- Went to work in the DRCMC, working her way up the ranks
- Even things like overwriting her essays could be viewed as getting in extra practice in research and argumentation.

Going above and beyond in, say, mastery of magic, would not have been a good use of time in pursuit of this goal. Perhaps she could have been more proactive developing her social skills and networking, but I wouldn't be surprised if she'd done more of that off-screen than Harry noticed, since she /was/ able to gather quite a large and diverse group for DADA. What more could she have done?

  Even if her ambition was simply to become Headmistress, to fix things - things that might improve Hogwarts and Magical Britain for decades, not just while she happened to be in the room with someone as a student - that would've been a compass to follow that would've informed her decision-making.

Minister of Magic (if we take /Cursed Child/ as canon), trumps Headmaster of Hogwarts, especially one of lesser caliber than Dumbledore.

  Even in the Gryffindor version, it doesn't have to be about becoming magically powerful (though as you say, that invariably helps),
#+end_quote

I didn't quite say that; I said that sufficient application of magic would help, but less-than-sufficient can hurt. For example, suppose that we make Hermione a Dumbledore-grade prodigy who quickly gets noticed as such. Now, imagine that you are a "silent majority" pureblood who, while he or she generally agrees with Voldemort's goals, finds his methods uncouth and dangerous to everyone around. In fact, you had sat out the last insurrection in your vacation home in France, because you knew that time was on your side: that do-gooder Dumbledore is getting on in years, and once he kicks the bucket, things will go back to the way they used to (and ought to) be. You hear whispers of Voldemort's return, and your reaction is to send your house-elf to check that your French villa is in good repair and ready to receive you and your family, just in case. But then, you hear rumors from Hogwarts: the next Dumbledore has arrived, and she's a Muggleborn. All of a sudden, time is no longer on your side, and the very structure of your society is at stake...

  Canon Hermione occasionally had limited ambitions beyond that, but they were generally of the "solve the immediate problem" variety, almost uniformly shared by Harry, and invariably temporary. Even Dumbledore's Army can be read as much as working around a failure of her existing goal of academic success - since DADA was rubbish - than of preparing to fight Voldemort.
#+end_quote

I think that it would be more accurate to say that she put some of her ambitions on hold in pursuit of the more immediate goals of not dying, not failing her OWLs, etc.. I'd also point out that if she just wanted to make sure she passed her DADA OWLs, she could have just asked to practice with Harry, rather than spending the time and risking the punishment organizing DA.

#+begin_quote
  Finding Horcruxes probably qualifies, but it's an open question if she would have taken up that quest on her own. Even after his return was ostensibly public, she never (that we were shown - admittedly we never had access to her internal monologue) committed herself to learning as much as she could because it would help her oppose Voldemort, she was just helpful for the latter incidentally.
#+end_quote

Yeah, she spent too much time pining for Ron and tracking down the identity of the Half-Blood Prince in that book. That, and making all the preparations in the background, like mastering the False Memory Charm, getting together camping supplies and making an undetectable container, and mastering myriad concealment and defense spells. Researching Horcruxes would have to wait until she actually had access to the books.

#+begin_quote
  For me, "Greatness" necessarily includes a splash of exceeding one's potential, and Hermione was gifted with a great deal of potential. I suppose she met it in canon (even if Minister of Magic is never really presented as a particularly effective post).
#+end_quote

More accurately, Fudge is never really presented as a particularly effective Minister.

#+begin_quote
  But if her ambition was really to make the world a better place, she went about it in a haphazard way that doesn't really befit her particular gifts.
#+end_quote

What do you view as her particular gifts in this respect?

#+begin_quote
  But again, it probably would've been difficult to write that for Hermione and still have it be Harry's story.
#+end_quote

It's hard to write smart characters, period. I've never quite forgiven Rowling for not providing enough information in PS to find a unique solution to the Potions Puzzle.
