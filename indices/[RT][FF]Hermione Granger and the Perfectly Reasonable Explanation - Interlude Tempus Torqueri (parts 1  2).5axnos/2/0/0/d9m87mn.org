There are different kinds of ambition. When we speak of personal ambition and "greatness", we generally speak of what one might term "Slytherin-ambition", the pursuit of recognition, status, power, or just pleasure, stability, and creature comforts for oneself and one's own, while being fairly indifferent to everyone else's well-being. But, one can also speak of "Gryffindor-ambition" to make the world a better place, often whether the world wants it or not. One should not discount its power or dangerousness: we don't know whether Voldemort in his youth was planning to take over the world, but we do know that Dumbledore in his youth was.

Canon Hermione had some Slytherin-ambition --- since she does like to be recognized for her intellect and skills, both by her teachers and by her peers --- but most of hers is Gryffindor-ambition, and she pulls out all the stops to pursue that. However, her pre-DH and challenges, such as they were, were generally not ones where being (even) better at magic would have helped that much in a way that could have been foreseen when decisions how to invest her time were being made. Being better at magic (within reason^{1)} would not have helped solve the Philosopher's Stone or Chamber of Secrets mysteries, exonerate Buckbeak, improve the house-elves' lot, help Harry prepare for the Triwizard, etc.. If becoming a proverbial magical powerhouse were conducive to her goals, she would have probably invested more effort into that, though it's very open to interpretation how far she'd get.^{2}

Now, in this fic, her immediate "challenges" include not being murdered by Pettigrew (if he gets away) or anyone who might come after her if Nott spills his blackmail material, and generally survive what is to come, and if she can make the world a better place in process --- great. "Become a magical powerhouse" is very conducive to those goals.

^{1} /Any/ problem can be solved with sufficient application of magic. A hypothetical uber!Hermione could have used Legilimency to interrogate second-year Draco, defeated Ginnymort+Basilisk, mind-controlled Draco into backing off on the Buckbeak front, and invented a spell that simply snapped the bonds between house-elves and their masters, for example.

^{2} This is rather ironic, considering how much of the fandom pretty much takes it for granted that what Hermione achieved is equal to what she had the potential to achieve (because she always worked so hard), while Harry slacked off, so could be oh-so-much-more-powerful if only he applied himself; when, in actuality, Harry did, in fact, apply himself in the area of Defense because /his/ immediate challenges were often ones that could be addressed by getting better at it (e.g., Quiddich -> general awareness and dexterity, Dementors -> Patronus, Triwizard -> all combat magic), while Hermione spent more time helping others get better at magic than getting better at it herself (which probably did help her master those areas where she helped others, but nothing beyond that).
