She didn't "get stuck" with him. Since we're all super-rational here (as if it were "rational" to ignore the fact that she is, in fact, romantically attracted to him and vice versa), consider the purely political advantages of marrying Ron, in the context of canon!Hermione's goals of social reform via Ministry of Magic:

1. Among the men close to her in age, the politically ambitious ones are either Slytherins (whose ambition is quite questionable in the first place) or Percy; so she doesn't really have anyone with whom to form a proverbial "power couple", so her husband will have to be someone who would work mainly as a prop.
2. Ron is a pureblood, and she takes his name when they marry. That makes her less threatening to the proverbial old guard who, while no Voldemort supporters, likely harbor implicit anti-Muggleborn prejudice. (Think Slughorn.)
3. Ron is a war hero, but not in a way that would overshadow her the way Harry would. No matter how illustrious her Ministry career, her achievements are unlikely to ever be as famous and popular as Voldemort's defeat, and Harry would get 80%+ of the credit for that.
4. Ron is a known quantity, and we know that she finds him physically attractive. He is also a rather talented wizard, given that he does significantly above average^{1} while putting in the least amount of work she lets him get away with; and his whole family is full highly capable and accomplished. I.e., good genes.

So, all things considered, if she wants to be the Minister of Magic in a few decades, Ron is not a bad choice.
