I'm not disputing your analysis of political advantage (although of course it's all external, there's not even a shade of that kind of thinking in the actual books). My point is, personalitywise Ron sucks. I personally would consider having my better judgment about someone being overridden by sexual attraction to be "getting stuck". And there's plenty of the "better judgment", Ron causing Hermione frustration, and other negativity. Obviously, by authorial fiat, it all worked out and they lived happily even after (or at least 19 years).
