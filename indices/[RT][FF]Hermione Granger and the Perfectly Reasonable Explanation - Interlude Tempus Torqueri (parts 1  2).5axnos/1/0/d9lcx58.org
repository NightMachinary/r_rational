I think that we might have reached a turning point, though: as far as I can tell, Pettigrew's Memory Charm ended OH but left YH intact, but not before OH neutered --- and possibly killed --- OTD with a Memory Charm of her own. This means that there are no more long-range time-travelers left in the story, and YH no longer has a passenger taking over when she is asleep or influencing her actions.

If my interpretation is correct, the story so far can be viewed as the exposition, setting up the setting and the characters and their relationships, and the body of the story only begins now or in the next few chapters: the rational!protagonist finally has agency and can reason, plan, and, in fact, win.
