Wow. At the start of the lnterlude, when I first realized what you were up to, I didn't think it seemed a very good idea. But you really surprised me with how well you did these 2 chapters. Very powerfully done.

I don't really buy OH's reasons for not telling Dumbledore everything any more than I did YH's back when she considered the same, but I grudgingly accept that these justifications are necessary for the story you want to tell.

Now I want to read through the whole story again to compare YH and OH's accounts of events! With the amount of time between chapters due to the serialized format---plus all the Obliviations that have taken place in the story---it was hard to remember all the details without a reread.
