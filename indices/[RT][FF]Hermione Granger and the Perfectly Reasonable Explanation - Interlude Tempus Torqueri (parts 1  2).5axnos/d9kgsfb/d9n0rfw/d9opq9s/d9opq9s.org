  she was forced in the direction of "protecting capital-H-History" by the specific details of what happened to her, even to the point of acting irrationally. Her excuses about backlashes and Time reasserting itself are rationalizations for a decision made for completely different reasons.

See, I missed this. I though OH's concern for timeline integrity was legit, but later it got muddled and confused with the book's concern to preserve a record of history. Maybe that's just my problem, but I think a part of the problem (if a problem exist) may be from the fact that all of the time lore is external (we don't have a preexisting notion from canon how the time works), and YH's independent research seems to confirm the "do not mess with time" sentiment. So there's no reason to suspect foul play when OH is very concerned about it, at most there's perception that the original timeline is already lost (maybe even before OH's arrival), so her plan to do nothing and hope for the best seems stupid.
