I put off reading this for a few days because I was very much out of the r!Animorphs headspace. Definitely took me a while to remember what was going on. Also, this chapter was very confusing, particularly the ending.

That said, wooohoooo, my favorite fanfic is back for a while! Looks like the ending is in sight, too.

I love how this story breathes life into many dilemmas of decision theory and ethics: at which scale do we draw the line on allowing utilitarianism vs. deontology guide our actions? How does uncertainty affect this decision? What sort of freedom do you have when there are gods who can predict your actions? Part of what makes it compelling is that these things are genuinely uncertain - the characters don't know the right answers, and I bet TK17 doesn't know the right answer most of the time (or do you? :). Part of the benefit of fiction is that it allows you to have a dialogue with yourself, to examine which parts of you are drawn towards which motivations.

A note about the ending: I still don't understand which ship Visser 3 sent the little drone into. At first I thought it was the bug fighter that the Animorphs hijacked, but then it seemed like it was one of the metal boxes sent up by Earth, which just happened to have one of the Marcos inside of it in fly morph... but then why didn't Marco/Visser 1 bring up the fact that they knew about the launch of the metal boxes sooner?

Also, it seems like Visser 3 can create insta-yeerks inside people with the right trigger... that's very not-good.
