REQUEST: I notice there's a trigger warning that includes sexual assault, can someone please describe for me, in clinical detail, exactly what occurs during that scene? (spoiler tags obv). Equally, let me know if that was just a "decoy warning" and nothing of that nature appears in the chapter.

I personally prefer not being surprised by these sorts of things and appreciate the opportunity NOT to be surprised, so thanks, [[/u/TK17Studios]] !

Example for how I'd describe the scene in the The Sopranos Episode Employee of the Month which I happened to see a couple of days ago.

His psychiatrist is entering her car when a man grabs her from behind. She runs and he ends up catching up to her in a stairwell. He rapes her as she fights back. She is then shown in the hospital having her fingernails swabbed and being comforted by her family.

EDIT: I just read [[/u/Don_Alverzo]] 's comment below, so I guess I just want someone to let me know if the scene is any 'worse' than implied there.
