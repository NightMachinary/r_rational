Several points of confusion:

-Did we previously establish that V1 can communicate between her parts? I had thought she was just four separate mini-yeerks.

-What was Garrett piloting? Can anything with thought-speak pilot it? (The first part could maybe be resolved with Helium seeing it barrel-roll.)

-The thing with the cradle being able to store memories or maybe mind-imprints of Andalites is a continued point of confusion. Maybe not necessary to the plot, I just feel like I'm supposed to understand it better than I do. It seems like it provides the sort of ambient thoughtspeak noise that Andalites need? So as an opportunity for exposition, maybe this could come up in the chapter where Ax has a breakdown, and he could explain what it is and why spending time in the cradle won't work?

In general I have trouble with scenes that start in a new location, with a near-term goal that wasn't fully described before. Eg grabbing the tools from the beach, or when they were running from bug fighters in the cradle. The Arn World chapters and the Visser interludes are not in this category. I think the difference is, in these chapters I didn't have to catch up to what the character knew was happening. Whereas in the confusing sections I'm not sure what the situation is before it changes, but the character does know, and I'm not sure if I need to reread something or wait for the character to give exposition.
