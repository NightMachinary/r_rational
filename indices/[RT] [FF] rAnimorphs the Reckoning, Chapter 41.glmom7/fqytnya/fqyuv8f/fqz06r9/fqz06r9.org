I think the trigger warning was less because of the content and more because of the way in which that content was present. We know yeerks infest people and we know how much of a violation that is, you're right, but this /particular/ infestation was presented with incredibly strong rape imagery. The way that it was multiple men forcing a woman down, the fact that it was from her perspective, the sense of disassociation as she tried to cope with the trauma of it, even the way that the actual physical process of the yeerk entering her was deliberately evocative of the physical process of rape... Yeah, I can understand why you'd put a trigger warning on this specific chapter, even if the story overall has already had some pretty dark content.
