^ This. I noticed the rape imagery after-the-fact (and then leaned into it/intensified it on the second draft), and found myself "trying to convince myself" that a trigger warning wouldn't be necessary, and then was like "uh, that means I should probably have one."

I agree it's not worse than r!Animorphs has gone before, strictly speaking/content-wise, but I just really really didn't want somebody to be derailed in the middle of what they thought was just going to be some more spaceships-and-aliens.

Note that a good trigger warning /often/ has the property of most people being like "huh?" Like, the point is that people with triggers can have those triggers be something like "surprisingly sensitive" to the average person (with the classic PTSD example being, like, a door slams shut or even just a smell from their past wafts by, and this is enough to start a Bad Day).
