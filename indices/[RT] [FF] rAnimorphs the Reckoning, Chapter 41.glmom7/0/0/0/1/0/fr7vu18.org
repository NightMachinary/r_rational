Part of it might be the suddenness and... what, intensity? of the escape pod plot.

It was like, the Animorphs were discovering info, then extrapolating more info, then acting on their extrapolation, all while there's this very in-universe-confusing situation unfolding with Tyagi, and generally slightly IRL-confusing motivations and goals like you mentioned, and meanwhile I personally was still sitting there grappling with the "Wait, the human race just received alien spaceflight tech a few months ago, and suddenly anyone can just throw together an escape pod in their backyard??? Seriously?" of it all. The ark stuff was mentioned once by Ante (casually enough that I forgot it even happened) and then very quickly it exploded onto center stage. The fact that three hundred thousand humans even COULD build spaceships was so surprising it made it hard to process all the rest.

(In fairness, this might be a blind spot specific to me personally. I was also surprised when Th√°n built the Dracon beams, and even MORE surprised when humans started not only understanding but mass-producing Bug Fighters within a few months of getting the plans.)
