I actually thought the "taking the gloves off" moment is the moment that just happened, with Tyagi. Like, my sense was that /this/ chapter was Cassie's prediction coming true.

(Jake even has an on-screen reaction to Helium saying words that /remind/ him of Cassie's prediction, though Helium doesn't have the context to know what they're perceiving since that was a private conversation between Cassie and Jake.)
