A few days later...

After taking some time to digest the chapter, I'd say the theme here is 'making hard choices'. Mind you, they've had to make plenty of hard choices during this war, but whether or not to TLJ the entire planet is certainly next-level. We again see the contrast between Jake's and V3's decision-making processes, where V3 was almost nonchalant in his decision to nuke Ventura, and more recently set off bombs in major cities.

Jake asking Perdao to temporarily infest Tiyagi is another hard choice. Morph-checking has elements of infestation, but the morph-host can be kept asleep during the process, doesn't remember the 'infestation process', and is discarded afterwards. If they handwave it off as 'this is just a Tiyagi clone who cares', well, Jake's a hypocrite.

The connection between these two choices is Jake's decision to be a leader who is always on the front lines. 'We' take the bug fighter. Jake is also willing to be infested by Perdao - I suspect this is why Helium asked as a sort of response to the morph check. I mentioned it already but I do hope Jake gets the chance to do it.
