Well that's my lock screen now, and the world is so much brighter. Thank you.

And ah, I see. I didn't realize a Bug Fighter could do that much damage to the fleet, even at planet-glassin' speeds - I was picturing a Bug Fighter coming out of Z-Space and taking down one other Bug Fighter, or one Pool Ship and that's it, but the explosions and the debris and all the momentum and other energy would- Yeah. I get it.

I guess the only question /that/ leads to is one that already kinda sorta poked its head out when humans started pumping out Zenades like they were Zippo lighters, which is, why aren't Zenades already the overwhelming dominant weapon in the galaxy? There's taboo and MAD keeping the Andalites and Yeerks from using them on each other's home planets, but on ships? Fleets?

I guess the MOST likely thing is that it already happens, so it's already a concern, and anywhere else a fleet WOULDN'T risk that kind of exposure - but the Yeerks don't know the humans have figured out rock-flinging technology and so they're not being as careful popping in on our system. Right?

Also, totally unrelated, but if the Animorphs could figure out where the gate is physically located on a construct and surgically scoop it out without damaging the rest of the body, there's precedent that indicates they could just demorph from there, wake up the construct, and rinse and repeat for a quick and easy clone army. Obviously not a situation that's likely to turn up in this timeline, the way things are going, but could be fun if someone out there does a crackfic of the ratfic like that Rick and Morty one from a while back. :D
