Thanks [[/u/Don_Alverzo]] for PMing me with a more detailed description of the scene in question.

I'm reproducing it below in case anyone else wants to know:

The actual content isn't sexual assault. A woman is physically restrained by multiple male characters so that she can be forcibly infested. The infestation is planned to be brief (as it's only for the purposes of information gathering) with the yeerk actually being slightly apologetic as soon as the infestation occurs, but she is nevertheless rather traumatized by the experience. It's framed in such a way that the parallels between a violent sexual assault and a forcible infestation are obvious, aided by the fact that the events are described from the victim's perspective.

It's very uncomfortable, certainly, but if you're okay watching a tv show wherein a violent rape takes place, I suspect you'll be able to read this section. It's an extended and visceral rape metaphor rather than being a graphic depiction of an actual rape.

In case anyone's wondering, about 8 years ago I went through 2 or 3 incidents where sexual assault in media gave me mild, fleeting dissociative feelings. That's not happened recently and although I don't avoid such content (unless it's the focus of a story because such content doesn't especially interest me), but I still really, really, really don't like being surprised by it.
