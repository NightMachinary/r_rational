I'll take a stab at it.

I appreciated Jake's caution against getting Marco committed to the idea of himself as being insatiably vengeful or cold-hearted. Because even if Marco isn't actively sabotaging whatever peace plan they eventually come to, a part of Edriss will always be imprinted in him, now, and never forgiving her means he'll never really be at peace with himself.

And now, as I type that, I'm thinking about what forgiveness means in a context where identify is so amorphous, and somehow, that's caused be to realize that if Crayak's goal is to create a single will throughout the universe, the Visser's newfound ability to argue with himself and doubt himself makes him unusable for that, per Crayak's definition. And now victory for Team Harmony means spreading the same capacity to the other yeerk coalescions and the andalite hivemind. Is that a plausible reading?

I might vaugely recall come discussion to that effect from the last Visser chapter but this is what made me remember it.
