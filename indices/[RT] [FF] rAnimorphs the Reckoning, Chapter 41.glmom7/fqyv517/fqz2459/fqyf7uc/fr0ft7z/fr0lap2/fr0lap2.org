NOT YET THEY DIDN'T

The plan was to seize one of the ships from the incoming fleet, flash it into Z-space and back, and bring it out of Z-space at near-lightspeed, crashing it into one/many/all of the rest of the fleet. The idea was twofold---one, that V3 probably had /some/ kind of plan for the fleet, and whatever it was it Couldn't Be Good, and two, that if you want V3 to know that you both have, and are willing to use, a relativistic planet-killer, one way to signal that is by glassing the incoming reinforcements without warning.

They had basically written off the idea that they might productively negotiate with the incoming Yeerks.

I too have hopes for Ante and Rachel, but I think Jake is next, since he got called to the principal's office
