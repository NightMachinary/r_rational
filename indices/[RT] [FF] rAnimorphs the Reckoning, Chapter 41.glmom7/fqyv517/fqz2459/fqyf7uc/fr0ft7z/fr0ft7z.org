Always love to see another chapter come up. Thoughts, all presented post-read in no particular order, potentially subject to future editing:

I'm really glad we stepped back - reasonably quickly - from the blow-up-the-earth plan in the last chapter. I mean, I know that that was REALLY never the goal, and from a narrative perspective I'm sure it was never going to happen. But the deepest, most primal human parts of myself cried out in opposition to that possibility at the end of the Jake chapter, and I couldn't keep up with the characters convincing themselves to commit to the idea in case of a Leeran. (I know they weren't /planning/ to destroy the earth, they were planning to be /willing/ to destroy the earth, which is subtly different. Still not different enough for my... heart, maybe.)

I mean, from a coldly mathematical standpoint, I got it. The idea was to sacrifice seven billion lives (shouldn't we really be rounding that up to eight by now? Especially considering the probably-near-future timeline of this series?) to potentially save tens or hundreds of billions. You pull the lever, the trolley squashes /him/ to save /them/. But the thing is, the math breaks down for me when the seven billion are humans, and the others are aliens. I know the Animorphs pivoted to fighting for the galaxy instead of just the world at some point, but I don't think I ever did. It's more emotional than rational, but I kinda didn't care about all the conquering Yeerks and backwards Andalites and billions and billions of faceless Naharans/Hork-Bajir/Helmacrons/Skrit Na/Taxxons/etc. in the Visser's path - not when it was Mommy Earth tied to the other tracks.

Anyway. The genocidal Animorphs (genomorphs?) have backed off a little. I'm breathing easier now.

I didn't run into the same mechanical problems as some people in the thread. The context of the Tyagi section seemed pretty clear to me - we were following /Helium/, so the fact that we were seeing Tyagi's thoughts meant that we'd jumped forward and flashed back. And the conversation with Edriss - the italics were enough that I assumed it was /probably/ a flashback, but also, like... it kinda... didn't... matter? Like, okay, those events happened /around the same time/ as the rest of the chapter, and the nitty gritty order of events just... didn't impact anything enough for me to care too much. I dunno. It didn't bother me. There /were/ a couple of typos, at least on the AO3 version: Ctrl+f "Was this they key" and "long, history", if you're reading this, TK17. :)\\
There was also a weird extra line break after "‹Eleven percent. Roughly nineteen thousand.›" and a giant stack of them at the end of the chapter, but that may have just been my phone browser.

Personally, the only major thing I've been confused about in these past couple of chapters is what - /exactly/ - they were trying to do with the Bug Fighters before they got... distracted. Marco described it (and Jake confirmed it) as "pulling a Last Jedi" or something like that, but I haven't seen The Last Jedi. I figured out in this chapter that that meant they were gonna potentially smash some Yeerk ships into each other (spoiler alert for TLJ, jeez ;) ), so I guess that was just a backup plan in case attempted negotiations with the Yeerks went pear-shaped?

I enjoyed the part where "/spread/" kinda slipped out of Perdão's emotions. I kinda pictured, like, some sort of surreal meme, like an extreme close-up of a deep-fried Yeerk .jpg with explodey glowing red things over where its eyes would be? And "*/s p r e a d/*" across the bottom? I dunno. It was creepy in a delightful way.

Did the reader actually learn what the deal was with Tyagi randomly withholding weird information? Like, why was she only cloned onto the old Bug Fighters? (For that matter, why were the Animorphs only /targeting/ old Bug Fighters? Surely the human-made ones would have had the same backdoor? I can't imagine the human engineers are capable enough to change things that fundamentally yet. Or did they just get an old one by chance, and dodge Tyagi's question as some sort of bluff?)

Eager to get back into what's going on with Rachel.

Kinda hoping to see Ante step up a little more.

This chapter did move a little bit more slowly, but I was on the edge of my seat at the end of it. Dying to read more.
