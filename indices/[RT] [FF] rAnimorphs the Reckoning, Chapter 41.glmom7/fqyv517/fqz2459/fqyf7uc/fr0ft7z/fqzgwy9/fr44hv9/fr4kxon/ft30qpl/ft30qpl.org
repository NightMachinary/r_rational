I AM SORRY THE READING SLOWLY AND LIVEBLOGGING WAS TOO MUCH PRESSURE SO I DECIDED TO JUST READ IT "NORMALLY"

but basically i had the same sort of structural problems following helium as others reported and don't quite understand what happened in this chapter.

I remember that the Crystal Society trilogy guy said, when people asked why he didn't make the AI the viewpoint character in the second and third books like it had been in the first, he said basically that it's hard to write a transhuman AI, and it would be hard to follow first person POV from one if it were written, so I think that is what is happening with Helium on a smaller scale.

My advice to D&D DMs is "make the clues in the story obvious. so obvious you think you're treating your players like children. they will still have a 50/50 chance of getting it". I think something along those lines is there: I need some character repeating everything Helium says in "dumb person speak" and narrating the action very clearly. I don't know how you'd do this, I don't know what sort of person/character would be right for it, but I do know that what would have made this chapter easier for me to follow is if the bug fighter had randomly beamed an 8 year old child on board and Jake for whatever reason explained everything to that child during the course of events. (maybe not quite that bad but you get me...)

Like:

- what is the sleeve or construct or whatever it is? why are people destroying it?

- I know there's a shortcut on earth but why do the anis think that humans are going there?

- so V3... infested all the humans with yeerk pellets? that's what they think? no doubt V3 yeerk clones?

- i completely forgot that in norway or whatever they'd been building escape pods

- i also completely forgot that humanity had built its own bug fighters

- i didn't quite understand the weaposn that humanity has now (the rock yeeting ones)

- probably more but hopefully that gives you an idea about how stupid i am, and i'm not even a stupid person, i'm probably actually a quite intelligent person?

i'm deliberately not going back to read through a second time so you can see the level of confusion i have
