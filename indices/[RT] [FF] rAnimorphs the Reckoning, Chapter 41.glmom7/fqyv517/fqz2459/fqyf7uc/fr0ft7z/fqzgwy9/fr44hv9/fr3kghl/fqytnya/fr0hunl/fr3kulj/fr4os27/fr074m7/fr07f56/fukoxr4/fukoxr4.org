Sorry for the late reply.

The confusion on the cradle was from Ch. 13, when Ax first woke up. He made repeated references to the eib and the dain. I surmised that "eib" is like background chatter for thoughtspeak, and "dain" is like a model of a person. I thought that the dain (and by association, possibly the eib) were things that the cradle was doing for Ax in the absence of other andalites, bc the dain was mentioned much more when he was in the cradle, he thought-speaks with the model Elfangor in it rather than using the standard italics-for-internal-thoughts, and he steps out of both at the same time.

  Releasing the recording, I opened the cradle's eyes, looked out at my brother's stolen face.

  <You see the problem, don't you, Aximili?>

  Elfangor's voice, speaking from the dain.

  I reached into the dain, into the place where Elfangor's voice lived alongside my own. <Help me,> I whispered.

  <I cannot help you, Aximili. I cannot help you see what-I-cannot-see.>

  <But you can see the shape of the problem. What would you do?>

  <Have you not already realized?>

  I hesitated. The dain was never quite real---it was a shadow, an echo, a reflection. But it was also Elfangor---it was a part of my mind that was not truly my own. It could know things that I did not, make connections I wasn't capable of making.

  For a brief moment, I found myself reluctant to leave the cradle. It was small, uncomfortable, defenseless, and cold. But it was Andalite. It had saved my life. It had been a part of my brother's ship.

  I felt myself reaching for the /dain,/ for Elfangor's reassuring voice, and forced myself to stop mid-thought. It seemed wrong, somehow---important, that I do this one part without help.

  Pushing off the cradle with my tail, I stepped out into the emptiness.
