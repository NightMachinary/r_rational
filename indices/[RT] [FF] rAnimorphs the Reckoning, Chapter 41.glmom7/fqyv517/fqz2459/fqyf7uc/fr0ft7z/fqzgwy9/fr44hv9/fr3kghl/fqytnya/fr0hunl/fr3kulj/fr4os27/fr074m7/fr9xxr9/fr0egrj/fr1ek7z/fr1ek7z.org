hypothesis: we're screwed, the visser did the 'grow a yeerk' thing via a virus at the same time he did the kadrona virus thing.

hypothesis: the visser has pretty much figured out morphing technology or at least figured out enough to morph a yeerk out of something.

hypothesis: this is a different visserclone than the one in the last visser viewpoint chapter.

My certainty of these: high enough to suggest them, low enough to expect something else is very likely.
