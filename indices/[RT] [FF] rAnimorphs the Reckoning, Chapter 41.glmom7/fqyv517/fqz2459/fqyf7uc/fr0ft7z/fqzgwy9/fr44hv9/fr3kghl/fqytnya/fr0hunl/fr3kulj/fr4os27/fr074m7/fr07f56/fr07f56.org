We did previously establish that V1 can communicate between her parts; the actual operation granting her that power occurred off-screen but it was the condition that caused her to agree to the deal made on the Arn planet.

Garrett had been left in charge of the cradle, presumably in Andalite morph but possibly just granted-permission by Ax/Helium

The cradle can't store memories or mind-imprints, and it doesn't make any noise in the ambient thought-speak medium that Andalites need. It's just an escape pod. Not sure where that confusion might have come from; if you can point to it that would be nice.

  In general I have trouble with scenes that start in a new location, with a near-term goal that wasn't fully described before. Eg grabbing the tools from the beach, or when they were running from bug fighters in the cradle ... I'm not sure what the situation is before it changes, but the character does know, and I'm not sure if I need to reread something or wait for the character to give exposition.

Thanks.
