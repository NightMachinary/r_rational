Good chapter, as always. Really weakened by the fact that I don't remember a lot of what was going on but still so good despite that.

Really loving the Jake characterization you got going on, that one line with Helium seeing the person that Jake is becoming/has become the more and more he grows from who he was in his old life was amazing.

I really love your descriptions and metaphors as well, that other line when they were talking forgiveness how certain questions can only be asked one was great, reminded me of way back when I first started this fic there was this line about Rachel and how she didn't exactly enjoy being a warrior but there was a part of her that loved putting it all on the line, a part that had been ignored bc it wasn't useful and now was coming to play.

The characterization is the best thing about this fanfic and you've nailed everyone's character's so well that it makes me wonder what you could've done to Cassie if she hadn't died.
