Okay I finally read it and here's my thoughts on That Scene:

I found the imagery very, very blatant. Not, like, "oh the author was going for this hard" blatant but like, "I couldn't think about anything else" blatant (it was definitely on the artistic rather than the gratuitous side, so don't worry, [[/u/tk17studios]]). There were heavy references to the kinds of dissociative feelings that I have got in the past from consuming triggering content.

I don't think that I would have had an adverse reaction if I'd read it "unwarned", but that's mostly because nothing I've read or seen has given me an adverse reaction in more than 5 years (maybe it's because I'm a bit more careful now? who knows). But instead of finding it good/artistic/interesting to read I would have been nervous about how bad it might have gotten (though I'd trust our fine author to not include a literal rape scene).

I think it was written really really well, whether it was based on research, personal experience, or just instinct.
