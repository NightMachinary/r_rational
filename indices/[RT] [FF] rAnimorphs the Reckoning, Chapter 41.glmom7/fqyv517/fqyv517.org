I found this chapter much more confusing than most. I really enjoy Helium's perspective and am sorry we did not get to see his impression of Jake's black box from the inside. But... The chapter felt like it jumped sections in ways which were confusing. I'm not sure what specifically to point at but I liked the flow much less than usual.
