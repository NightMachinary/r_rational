Adding "[time] ago" at the top of the flashback would help.

I actually never parsed that it was a flashback and was confused by the use of italics. But if prior chapters use italics for flashbacks, people who aren't reading in real time won't have as much trouble.

If I were writing this, I would have separate font effects for not-a-real-time-experience and not-the-main-character-but-real-time, so that readers would recognize which was which. Eg, one font size smaller for the first, italics for the second.
