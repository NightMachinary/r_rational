I just read the chapter today (have to say was putting it off because of the trigger warning), and I just interpreted it as you changing to Tyagi's first person POV. Seeing it was the yeerk in retrospect seems weird to me, even though yeerks get all the memories anyway, so there's no reason for it to be, but death of the author means that my headcanon is that wasn't the yeerk going over the memory but a perspective shift in the story.

So yeah, I thought it read absolutely fine. but I knew to expect that particular section because I'd asked about the trigger warning so...?
