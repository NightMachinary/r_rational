I was a bit worried about this, with the biggest concern being the backwards jump to the conversation between Helium and Edriss (which came chronologically first but felt like it shouldn't be the first section of the chapter). Thanks for the feedback; it helps to know not to push any further in that direction.

EDIT: Also, if you or anyone else has specific concrete suggestions, I might make little tweaks here and there. Like, if anyone can say "A sentence like [this] in [this spot] would have really helped," that's probably doable.
