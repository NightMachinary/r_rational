I would just generally say that Helium's perspective is complicated and layered enough that anything that would complicate or confuse matters of perspective is going to have a greatly exaggerated effect, and this chapter had a lot of those things happening anyway.

1) The chapter started from the perspective of a morph!Helium, which was actually pretty cool. However, his initial disorientation is something the reader is going to share, since we're in his head.

2) After we return to prime!Helium, we get a flashback for expository purposes. Paring flashbacks with in medias res works well when the flashback explains how you got to the circumstances the chapter starts in, but in this case the two were disconnected from each other and it hurt more than it helped. Honestly, I think this would have worked better if it wasn't a flashback at all or, failing that, if the flashback somehow led into Jake deciding to morph-check Helium.

3) The Tiyagi bit, which was another perspective change and was also italicized for some reason?

4) In general much of the chapter is spent in people's heads and in conversation, with relatively little attention being paid to where people actually are or what they're actually doing. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but when the perspective frequently changes and we don't get much of an indication on what's actually different it can make you lose your grasp on where and when the different parts are in relation to each other.

The one concrete change I think I'd advise is dropping the italics on Tiyagi's section. In proximity to the flashback it was confusing and made me think that you were intentionally trying to signal that things were out of order or something. Beyond that, I'd say that in the future having more concrete things happening outside Helium's head would probably help. I LIKE being in Helium's head, it's weird and cool, but it's also really easy to get lost, especially when he's getting lost in thought as well.
