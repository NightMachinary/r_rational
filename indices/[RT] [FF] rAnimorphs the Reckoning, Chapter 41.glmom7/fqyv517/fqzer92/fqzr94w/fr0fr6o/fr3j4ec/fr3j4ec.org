It came through for me slightly differently. I thought we were seeing the first-person narrative of a local instantiation of Tyagi's consciousness that's running on Helium's brain(s), that only has the memories Perd√£o chose to copy over. I.e., the person narrating in that section is the "ghost" that's now part of Helium, that makes them decide /never again/.
