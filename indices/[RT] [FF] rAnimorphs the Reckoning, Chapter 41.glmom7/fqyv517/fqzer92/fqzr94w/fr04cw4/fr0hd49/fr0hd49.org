  I was a bit worried about this, with the biggest concern being the backwards jump to the conversation between Helium and Edriss (which came chronologically first but felt like it shouldn't be the first section of the chapter).

Did it have to come chronologically first? It feels like the characters had enough downtime moving through space that these conversations could have taken place in any order.
