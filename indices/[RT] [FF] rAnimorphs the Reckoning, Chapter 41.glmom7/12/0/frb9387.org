So pods started launching, and when the Animorphs found out about it, they sent one of the Marcos scrambling to see if he could find and get into one of the pods that hadn't launched /yet./

He succeeded.

Later, V3 hit most or all of the pods with some kind of tiny device (so like 200,000 copies of the same tiny device) and the pods started turning around, but there was no one in Marco's pod except himself, in fly morph to preserve oxygen, so it didn't activate/do its thing until he demorphed.
