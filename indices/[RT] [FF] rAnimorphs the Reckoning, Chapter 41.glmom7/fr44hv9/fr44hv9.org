OKAY FINALLY SLOWLY READING THIS AND LIVEBLOGGING.

- I don't like helium because I think he's kind of up himself, and quadrium or whatever is having the same s ort of vibes. he think he's so... ugh! he reminds me of the andalites in the books, which is probably why i don't like him

- his thought process is fascinating to go through though

- why did they make him? I don't understand. is it to have a second person to control the ship?

- oh yes i had wondered if it was to check that Helium was trustwrothy or loyal because that makes sense

- i love how similar morphing and Controlling is.

- :( poor Jake
