Ahhhhh. And there, my concern from last week's chapter is addressed. One of the other kids stumbling across a morse code book and pointing out that the owl in said book had morse code around it too, prompting Emma to go and look at the other owls she saw, is much more plausible than how it was initially presented. I am mollified :)
