Here are some definitions of the terms "double agent" and "triple agent". As these are terms I have heard used this way in conversation, could you refer to another source for your definitions?

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_agent]] - In the field of counterintelligence, a double agent (also double secret agent) is an employee of a secret intelligence service, whose primary purpose is to spy on a different target organization, but who, in fact, is a member of the target organization.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_agent#Triple_agent]] - A triple agent pretends to be a double agent for one side, while he or she is truly a double agent for the other side.

By these definitions, Ray is a double agent if he is working with Mama who wants to spy on the Kids, but he is in fact on the side of the Kids. If he then decides to actually be on Mama's side and only pretend to be a double agent for the Kids, he is a triple agent.
