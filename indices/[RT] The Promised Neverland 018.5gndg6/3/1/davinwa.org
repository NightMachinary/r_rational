Mama knows some. She doesn't know Ray is a double-agent, nor that Don and Gilda are in on it. This is very significant, and potentially deprives Ray of his status as a trump card. The kids now rely on Krone not telling Mama that she saw Ray, or they're probably done for.

This is an uncertain outcome. Mama knows some about the kids, Krone now knows all about the kids, the kids know that Mama knows some about the kids but not that Krone knows all about the kids, and Krone knows that Mama knows some about the kids, but not that Mama doesn't know all about the kids.
