Hypothetical situation:

One day you gain a superpower: You can create extra bodies for yourself, up to 5.

Meaning; you can "fork" yourself making new (not identical) bodies with the exact copy of your mind. You can also re-absorb the copies at will. THis causes the copies of your mind to merge seamlessly in one, and the memories to stack in the order of absorbing.

Ageing, injuries and diseases of the original are inherited by the copies, but not vice versa. Only the original can make copies. For the sake of the argument, lets say that the copies have randomly generated but normal bodies of random (adult) age, random biological sex and a phenotype. The copies appear nude. No items can be copied, not even things like piercings, tattoos, filling or implants.

How would you practically utilise this abilty? How would you optimise it? How would you deal with the practical challenges of being extra 5 nude people with no ID?
