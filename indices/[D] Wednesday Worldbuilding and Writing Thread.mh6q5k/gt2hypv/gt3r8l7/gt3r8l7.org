Balance between work and school, favoring school as much as possible. The clones will have to do strictly online classes, while I'd be relegated to strictly in-person work and in-person classes. The best move is probably to start studying things which can be done entirely online, preferably with the possibility of self-employment. For example, get bachelors degrees (or the equivalent level of self-study) in:

- Mathematics

- Physics

- Computer science (focusing on software engineering and game design)

- Digital arts focusing on 3D modeling/animation and web design)

- Music composition

- Game design

That should suffice for six of me to form an indy game studio and start publishing games on Steam relatively quickly. Once we have some decent earnings and fairly stable income, I could hire additional team members to keep up the momentum and put some of the clones back onto studying to enhance the knowledge level of the group, possibly now with an emphasis on data science, machine learning, neural networks, and philosophy. Being able to learn at six times the normal rate would give me an enormous advantage in development of AI for games (initially), then for stock market analysis, and eventually for industrial robots once I have enough money to get an assembly line.

At this point, two things would be highly valuable to produce. One would be industrial robots which can take a building design schematic plus raw materials and establish steps to actually construct the schematic as specified. The other would be an algorithm to analyze the schematics for a finished product and design an assembly line to produce it, factoring in the need for maintenance and providing access to the construction robots to carry out said maintenance. This would allow me to produce a massive range of products at likely unbeatable prices, bringing in even more money, and allowing me to start hiring the staff needed to begin moving towards the development of AI for both domestic and extraplanetary purposes.
