All those are either /changes/ you made in hindsight that were not in the initial prompt and which evidently at least some people interpreted very differently, or subjective opinions I strongly disagree with.

Whatever it is that makes persons moraly worthwhile (subjective experience?) I think i's fairly likely GPT-3 has it. A very alien version of it, but not any less worth consideration for that.

If people who want to cant have a continent or a solar system to themselves, it's crowded. Sometimes you want that guaranteed lighthour-delay to communications with the nearest sentient.

They might be fulfilling human "desires" in some extremely clumsy and naive way, but they are actively sabotaging almost al human /values/ in doing so. Either they are trying to maximize cruel mockery and humiliation of humanity as some kind of ironic punishment, or they're so monstrously incompetent and alien that they might as well be.
