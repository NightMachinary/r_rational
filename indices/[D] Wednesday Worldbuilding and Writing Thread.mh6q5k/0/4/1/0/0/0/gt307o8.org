Yes I do, it's called the internet. It might not be able to theoretically present anything the bowls can, but so far it has never failed at delivering what I actually end up requesting, except things that the bowls would fail worse at.

I don't live in a world where physical harm is technically impossible, but I have never actually been harmed in any of the "physical" ways the system prevents, and it seem very unlikely I'll do so in the foreseeable future. Social and psychological harm, wich the described scenario only amplifies, have hurt me infinitely more.

Immortality only counts as something missing if you actually live in a world where life is worth living. Our future is likely that, but our present and the future presented in the scenario are very much not.
