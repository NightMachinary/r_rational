It's identical to my life now, which is already hell, except with everything natural or beautifull striped away and diluted to zero, no even theoretical possibility for even the slightest wisp meaning or worth being possible, and no hope for change. If I were given the choice between this, and almost any brimstone and demons hell depicted short of rationalist subversion like the UNSONG one, I'd definitely pick being tortured by demons.
