What do you think would happen in a world like the one depicted in [[https://m.fictionpress.com/s/3353977/1/The-End-of-Creative-Scarcity][The End of Creative Scarcity]]? (Spoilers for the setting but not the plot ahead)

It's a good short story so I recommend you read it, but the premise is that one day, the sky turns red, everyone off-planet is teleported back to Earth, no one can leave Earth, every living thing stopped dying or being able to get hurt or hurt another person (random effects intervene like a pillow showing up or a bullet turning into bubbles), no one needs to eat, humans become the only form of life that can reproduce, and land is created as it is needed.

A week later, every human receives a “bowl”, shaped like two normal sized woks stacked on top of each other to make a closed space. If you ask the bowl for something, it will attempt to create something that fulfills your request. It will make anything that can fit in the bowl, isn't living, and isn't any more technologically advanced than present day, including the information within. For example, if you ask how to create a super intelligence, it'll probably give you an entertaining fictional guide to such. You can ask for food and it'll create it, but on a molecular level it's not food, which doesn't have any health consequences because health doesn't exist anymore. The bowls also won't tell you anything about their creators or how to destroy the boxes.

The bowls follow you around, and babies receive one from the sky after being born. They only follow verbal commands. They will always attempt to make something to fulfill a request, even if it's impossible or contradictory, and usually try to stick to the spirit of the request. The boxes are excellent at creating art. You could ask for a live action HPMOR starring the author, or the book you would have written if you finally started it, or sequels to existing media. Basically anything that's fiction, or non-fiction if it's not a large conceptual leap (hard to pin this down, but basically you could get biographies from living and dead people, or Einstein's opinion on string theory, but not a blueprint to a wormhole generator). This does allow for technological leaps by analyzing existing information from many new perspectives, and shortly after the bowls were given, tech to give internet to everyone on the planet regardless of location was created.

The original story doesn't say this explicitly, but I would count restricting the mobility of another person or gagging them to prevent access to their bowl counts as harm and is prevented.

In addition to what would happen to humanity, what would you personally do?
