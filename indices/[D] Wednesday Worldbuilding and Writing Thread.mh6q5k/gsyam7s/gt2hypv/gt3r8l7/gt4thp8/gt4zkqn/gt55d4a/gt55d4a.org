Well, yes, I guess that is /one/ possible use. It's not a use /I/ would put that power to, though, on the basis that I am not a particularly violent person by nature.

There is one flaw in that that I can immediately see - that is, that the disposable clones will have bodies that [[https://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20191018][do /not/ match the bodies they did most of their training in]] which may cause problems in fast-moving melee combat - but all five clones at once are still probably at least the equal of any three randomly selected fighters even despite that. And a couple of days' training to get used to a given body will counter most of the downsides. So, not a fundamental flaw.
