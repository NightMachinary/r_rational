Hmmm. The copies don't pass diseases back to the original, and can be re-absorbed (and then new copies can be made).

This makes the copies /exceptionally/ useful in dealing with dangerous situations. (This goes double if the copies can be re-absorbed without touching them). If, to take an example from fiction, it's necessary for one person to enter a highly radioactive environment in order to pull a few switches to save the lives of an entire star ship; then it's not necessary to compare the needs of the many to the needs of the view. I can simply send in a clone to do it, wait for the clone to signal that it is done, and then re-absorb the clone again (ideally without letting the clone out of the sealed-off area first).

In a less fictional sense, the clones will be able to pull off incredibly risky rescue operations with little risk. A clone dying would be unfortunate, and something that my clones would make every effort to avoid; but /less/ unfortunate than the death of a person who doesn't have a backup from fifteen minutes ago. And no-one cares whether or not the person rescuing them has ID. (The original might need to spend the time sitting in the back of a truck with a wide variety of equipment ready for the clones to grab before heading out).

In a more immediate sense, the clones can deal with coronavirus lockdowns much better then the original body can - a clone with the virus can simply be re-absorbed and re-generated to lose it.
