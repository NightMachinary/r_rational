I've already gone to college and gotten a job which pays decently, but I still live like a monk, relatively speaking. I spend very little on food/clothing/toiletries etc., probably around 2-3K per year. I usually eat food which costs < $3 per pound.

I never eat out, never order pizza or delivery, never go to movie theaters, never 'go shopping', never go to bars, never buy coffee, never buy alcohol or cigarettes, never gamble or buy lottery tickets, never buy movies or music, rarely drive more than 15 minutes from my home, and spend less than $100 on buying games per year. I have an electric car (which I bought for about $12,000 thanks to both a manufacturer rebate and a tax credit), so I never buy gas either, and electricity is drastically cheaper on a per-mile basis. I've paid off all of my debts. If I needed to supply five more of myself, it would only cost at most 15K per year, which I could easily afford.

My biggest concern would be healthcare, but since I can just reabsorb injured/sick clones and then respawn them, that's no problem. There might be some significant up-front costs like getting them clothes, desks, chairs, and building computers for them, but I could easily afford that.
