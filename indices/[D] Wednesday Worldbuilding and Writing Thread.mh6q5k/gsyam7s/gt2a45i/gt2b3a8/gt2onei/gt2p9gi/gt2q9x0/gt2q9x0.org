The scenario described STRONGLY implies that if we tried to make something like that the system would prevent it. And you'd still need some way to destroy the suffering original. And if it's not a completely separated upload you'd still be trapped having a /brain/ made of meat. And the limited volume you're trapped in means sharp limitations on computing capacity and memory. And it definitely won't let us create proper superintelligence, which is strictly needed to solve all the million more abstract and sinister problems of social coordination and the like. I would go on with this but I am physically ill trying to imagine this in detail and probably having a panic attack.
