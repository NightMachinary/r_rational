I don't want to egg on your worrying, so let me know if I'm just making it worse but:

The planet is already made not tiny or crowded. I didn't explain it much but in-story it was described as archipelagos appearing overnight.

I don't understand the medication concern, besides injections? Assuming problems requiring medication aren't also magically removed I think a hotfix to allow for injections and general human bodily self modification would make sense. I think “hurt” as a blanket statement is too wide - maybe “harm” is better?

Minds are not necessarily being simulated for the purpose of generation. The bowls are an intentional (by the author) parallel to modern day text generation AI like GPT-2 and GPT-3. We're probably less than 10 years from being able to tell an AI to write fanfiction and getting something good, and that's just from statistical inference between words with nothing approaching consciousness. It stands to reason that the in-universe explanation is likely similar, and I think there's at least a few other possible ethical explanations.

It's fair to say that the creators are probably very alien, but given that for many people this is a form of utopia it would appear they are attempting to fulfill human values to a large degree.
