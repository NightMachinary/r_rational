  Yes I do, it's called the internet. It might not be able to theoretically present anything the bowls can, but so far it has never failed at delivering what I actually end up requesting, except things that the bowls would fail worse at.

No, I very much doubt the Internet is comparable to the bowls unless you're somehow constantly finding 10/10 artworks, books, or TV shows which satisfy you. The bowls are capable of working with your personalized tastes after you ask it, meanwhile you have to search on the Internet for works which may end up dissatisfying you.

  Social and psychological harm, wich the described scenario only amplifies, have hurt me infinitely more.
#+end_quote

Honestly, the bowls could probably fix that too. You could ask it for self-help books or videos which are actually effective at treating the social or psychological harm inflicted on you. I don't see why this scenario would amplify them either, but I won't ask if it's personal.

  Immortality only counts as something missing if you actually live in a world where life is worth living. Our future is likely that, but our present and the future presented in the scenario are very much not.

There doesn't seem to be any reason why the lives in the above scenario wouldn't be worth living unless you have some objective measure of the value of a life.

You've stated discomfort with meat bodies, and I certainly agree that we should focus on transhumanist efforts to create better bodies, but the "meat" bodies in the scenario are much better than the meat bodies we have now. Characters with arthritis and cancer have their conditions cured, and no further disease is possible. There's no more aging, in fact the grandmother of one of the characters is even capable of having children. There's no hunger or thirst either, and they can even eat objects like string or plastic without any issues.
