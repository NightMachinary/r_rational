Hm, I guess the limitation of not being hurt means invasive brain surgery isn't feasible, but given humanity has forever to develop the tech I think it's reasonable to assume you'd be able to escape your body with non-invasive measures eventually, or at least emulate having a different body (through some sort of VR rig).

Unless you mean spiritually in which case I guess there's no counterargument.
