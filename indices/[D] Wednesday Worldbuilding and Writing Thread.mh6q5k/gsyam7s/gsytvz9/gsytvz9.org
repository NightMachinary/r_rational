I think the first thing I would do is eat chocolate mousse cake.

I'd probably spend a lot of time snuggling my wife on an atoll somewhere. I mean, I can sail, the bowl provides everything we need presumably including a perfect sunscreen and internet access, and the toddler can't drown, so why not?

Long-term I expect I would spend at least a few decades just relaxing. See what kind of human my daughter grows up to become, play video games, read, learn how to cook perfect food even though I could get it out of the bowl. I'd like to be able to cook at least one dish to perfection in every ethnic culture in the world, and without having to worry about pancreatic health issues or weight gain, I could eat carbs again. (Do you know how much I miss rice? My family cuisine of origin is Arab by way of India. We have rice in /literally everything/, including the things we serve with bread.) And probably I could just turn off things being too spicy, and I'd never have to worry about mercury in fish...

I really like videogames. I really like books and web serials. I've often said that I could live a hundred years and not be tired of reading, and judging by the thirty and change years I've been reading that's extremely likely to be true, but hey I'd like to give it a proper test.

In short, "Unbounded time, access to unlimited creative works, and my partner is there to enjoy it with" sounds like /literally/ heaven.
