First thing I'd ask the bowl is an easy method to permanently eliminate boredom. Hopefully it would respond with some pill that would alter my brain structure to never be able to feel boredom again.

Or if that doesn't count as current tech, at least I could use it to accelerate neuroscience so we can produce the anti-boredom drug or treatment on our own.

Otherwise immortality would eventually end up being well . . . a bore.
