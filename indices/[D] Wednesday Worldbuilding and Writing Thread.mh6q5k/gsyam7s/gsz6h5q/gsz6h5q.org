Despite the limitations on what it can create, I would expect the Bowls to help technology advance by leaps and bounds.

Of course, just immortality, invulnerability, and lack of scarcity are a big help on their own. People could spend lifetimes learning if they wished, they would never have to worry about any experiment hurting anyone or the environment, and funding and grants would be a thing of the past.

But the Bowls are also /incredibly/ useful for, well, basically any scientific or engineering prospect in existence:

- Want a pure substance? Any pure substance, or any mix or compound? You can have it in bowl-sized chunks. Solid gold? Done. Heavy water? Done. Two gallons of the DNA from lab rat #5? Well, DNA alone isn't alive, so done.
- Equipment? If it fits in the bowl, done. If it's made of parts that individually fit in the bowl, also done. And you might be able to ask for a redesigned version that does fit in the bowl, if it's near-current-tech.
- For that matter, parts? Done. You want a atomically precise linear rod made of titanium? Or a perfectly pure YAG crystal with exact dopants? Or a known superconducting material which is hideously difficult to synthesize? Well, that'd be hideously expensive with current-tech, but not impossible. Done.
- You want to follow in the footsteps of the great scientists of old and DIYers and garage scientists of new, and do all this at home instead of going to a proper lab or something? Done. You could ask for every component of a clean-room with easy-to-follow assembly instructions included, if you so wanted.
- Ever make a mistake, or make /one/ thing but want more, or need exact duplicates? With a little negotiation, you might be able to ask for "what I was holding 5 minutes ago". Imagine how much easier countless studies would be if you could get the *same* object, exact same object, for multiple trials.
- If the Bowls are generous with their definition of 'current' technology, anything we invent after their introduction is also up for grabs.

Certainly, the focus on media and entertainment and lack of motivation from scarcity would slow things down, but all things considered I would expect technological progress to skyrocket... everywhere except the space industry, at least.

(On a unrelated note, current-tech is, by some estimates, pretty close to being able to run a brain-scan. Has anyone considered, say, "give me a connectome map of my dead relative" or "give me a exact inorganic duplicate of my dead relative's brain" or "give me a USB drive with a FMRI file of my dead relative's brain", etc, and repeat until you find a information format and density it's willing to give you and repeat until you have enough for reconstruction? It's willing to make simulations recorded by a video camera, that is probably enough to eventually reverse information-theoretic death all by itself.)

Edit: sorry, i just remembered that this is a question of what you would /personally/ do. As you might expect from the above response, I would probably join the ranks of "DIYers, but immortal and with access to lasers and plutonium."
