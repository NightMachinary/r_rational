Interesting insight into Zorian's family. Seems the mum is so protective of - and against Kirian being a mage - because she herself was ostricized by townsfolk in her youth for being the daughter of a Witch, and thus surely, surely a witch herself.

I can understand why she wouldn't want Kiri undergoing the same thing, in that light. Not sure if this scenario can be resolved without Kiri being older, though, at least the same age as Zorian was when he began learning magic.
