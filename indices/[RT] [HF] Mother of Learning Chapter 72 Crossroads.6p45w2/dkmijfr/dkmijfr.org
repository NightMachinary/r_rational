I think Zorian should just go speak with his grandmother and see if there is some kind of legacy to claim. Kael's mother-in-law saw nothing wrong in teaching a male as a successor, so it's not like there is some kind of law that prevents it. Being an old witch, she is likely to be useful to Zorian; at the very least, she can prepare him for a future contact with Silverlake. Not to mention that it would likely to be an important step in repairing his family and improving post-loop relationships, which is something he probably would not object to.

Also, while his mother has every reason to be freaked out for Kiri being perceived as a witch, it's only a matter in Cirin, a pretty backwards town. Should she move to Cyoria, a homebase of the /House Aope/ among other things, and people wouldn't care. So it's not a good enough reason to ruin her dreams.
