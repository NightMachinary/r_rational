Did Zorian just send a simulacrum of himself on a date with Taiven?

About the part with Kirille, she does need to stay in the same village as her parents, she could move to Cyoria where nobody knows about her grandmother being a witch, so the argument that she will be hated is a moot point, although Zorians mother might disagree.

Some remarks about earlier discussions and Red Robe: Red Robe probably left as soon as possible after the confrontation with Zorian, which explains why he cannot be tracked using the marker method Zorian uses, since by that time, RR has already left the time loop.

On an afterthought, Orissa does not really sound like a nice person to me, quite a lot as Zorians parents, but that might be exactly the reason why Damien likes her so much.

edit: I got the idea that the Zorian who went on adate was a simulacrum since the break introduces the new Zorian as Simulacrum number two, which looks like the part before was simulacrum number 1.
