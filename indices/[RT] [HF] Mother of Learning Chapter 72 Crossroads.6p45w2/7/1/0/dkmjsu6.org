I object to his mother's line of reasoning in principle, unrelated to Kiri's current age. The reason why she objects to Kirielle's education is, well, geographical, and is solved simply by moving to a big city. Perhaps it was a wise decision to withdraw from the conversation for now, but most likely? It's just delaying the issue.
