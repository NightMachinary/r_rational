Because if Silverlake has a soft spot for people who have a witch lineage, he may be able to skip the gray hunter egg bullshit and at least get her to understand the situation through Kirielle, assuming she doesn't already know she's a copy of the real Silverlake trapped in a pocket dimension.

Not saying Kirielle should be a witch at all, but that it may be a way to get in her good graces while in the loop. Maybe.
