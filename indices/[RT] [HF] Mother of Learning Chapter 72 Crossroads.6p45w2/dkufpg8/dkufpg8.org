So, I started reading MoL a week or two ago from a recommendation post in this thread.

I saw, oh, it has tons of chapters, was started a while ago, and the way the guy is talking it up, it must be complete, right?

...nope, as I discovered yesterday.

Argh, I'm gonna have binge withdrawal soon. Great story.
