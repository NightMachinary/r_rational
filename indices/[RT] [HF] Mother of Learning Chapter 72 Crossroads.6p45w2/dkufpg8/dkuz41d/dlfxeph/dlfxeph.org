Arc 1: 26 chapters Arc 2: 28 chapters (54 total) Arc 3: ~27 chapters? (81 total)

That means 9 more chapters, which indeed would put us in 2018 March. I don't see a thorough wrap up in nine chapters (and I do hope this arc goes on quite a bit longer. I'd like ~35 chapters in Arc 3, which would put the end in 2018 August. However, if only one key is needed for root access to the Sovereign Gate, I don't think that will be necessary.

I'd also like to see a bunch of chapters after they exit the gate just to show where things are going with everyone.
