It's a way to send information, technically, I suppose. But it's not exactly a broad information channel. So I'm not sure what kind of solution you're trying to implement here. Like, spending small amounts of mana in a pattern like Morse code, to be read through the sensation of losing mana? Because I'm not sure if it's possible for people to monitor their mana pool with that degree of precision.
