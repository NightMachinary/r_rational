A simulacrum comes up with the idea of 'using his soul as a conduit' in chapter 63:

#+begin_quote
  He briefly wondered if it was possible to use their soul as a telepathic conduit in lieu of their artificial relays, since they shared one and all. However, he knew too little about soul magic to judge how difficult such an idea would be, so he put the thought aside.

I imagine he'll figure that out shortly, now that he has extra motivation to do so.
