I suppose that, now he can get there by Bakora gate, he could send two simulacra on either end to converge in the middle, thereby halving the time it takes to spread relays. Might be a bit redundant but it's probably more convenient if he can still gate between continents from any position, and it wouldn't cost him any extra time.
