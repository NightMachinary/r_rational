It's one of the 5? known ways that the loop can reset, probably falls under a broader category of "massive dimensional damage", since the mages doing the summoning are basically punching a hole in the world to the pocket dimension that it's trapped in. The other 4 ways are:

1. month ends,
2. Manual reset using the Marker,
3. The Controller dies (Only in Zach's case with his complete version of the Marker)
4. The Controller experiences soul or mind tampering beyond a certain threshold (again, Zach only)

Edit: Forgot the last condition Edit 2: embellished the "controller dies"
