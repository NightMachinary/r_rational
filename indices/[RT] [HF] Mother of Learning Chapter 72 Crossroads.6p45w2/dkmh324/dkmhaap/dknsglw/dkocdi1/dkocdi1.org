If I'm understanding your first question, you're wondering if Zach dying somehow kills the other controllers instead of resetting the loop? It doesn't, it just resets the loop.

The primordial isn't the usual trigger for ending the loop, despite the attempt to summon it. The loop ends around 2 or 3 AM (can't remember the exact time), and this chapter is an example of how it doesn't matter if it's even being summoned, the loop ends at the time regardless of that.

If Zorian is paying attention to his marker, he can actually tell that the reset switch is activating automatically as it happens. It was noted in the chapter in which the primordial was summoned.

For your 2nd question, chapter 55 sums it up pretty well, the energy expenditure is per iteration, it's not dependent on the length of the restart, there had been 967 iterations, and 52 remained. Since they weren't used fully (Controller died early), Zach has only been in there for 30 years instead 80ish. This also links with your 1st question, as to how we know the loop doesn't continue on without the Controller (Zach only, possibly RR, but unlikely).
