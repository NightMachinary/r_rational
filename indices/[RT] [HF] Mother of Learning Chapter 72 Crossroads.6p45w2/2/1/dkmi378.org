Should have been the real Zorian, they went to an expensive restaurant, simulacra can't eat, and it would have been in bad taste to pass that duty off to a simulacra.

It's funny, the mother is worried about the witch grandma affecting Kirielle's reputation, but once Zorian becomes known as "World's greatest mind mage", that will probably be a lot worse when it comes to making people suspect that they might be manipulated by members of the Kazinski family.
