Another nice chapter that is reminiscent in style to the earlier arcs. However the way simulacrums self-identify by numbers is a bit weird. But hey, I'm not a copy of a person (that I know of) so what say I have in these matters.

Could this new empty space be some super-special pocket dimension which could be used to cheat-escape the loop?
