I suspect that the ability to reopen the Gate using the Key was not intended for use by a Controller stuck inside the loop after the Gate was barred. Because that's meant to be impossible.

I think it's meant to be used by the Key-holder setting up the Gate for the next loop.

The Guardian of the Threshold, being the mostly-mindless construct that it is, simply gave an honest answer when they asked how they could reopen the Gate. Because it wasn't programmed to recognise that there was anything wrong or unusual about a Controller trying to get access to that function.
