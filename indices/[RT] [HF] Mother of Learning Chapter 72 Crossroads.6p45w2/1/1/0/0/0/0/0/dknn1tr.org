Not unless you get multiple groups to them at the same time, as fast as possible. You need to have long discussions to get people even beieve you are a time looper...

When the lich just crumbles, someone is totally gonna take the crown and sell it or something.

You don't even know where the items are at the restart. If you kill the guys on second last restart, you still gotta find the items. The guards move and you probably kill them somewhere else. Maybe you could ask nicely? "where were you two weeks ago at this time?"

We don't even know if all of them are guarded like that. Could be a lot of other challenges.
