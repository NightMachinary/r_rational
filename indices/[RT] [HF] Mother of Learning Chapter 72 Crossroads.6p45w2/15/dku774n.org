By the way, an earlier chapter mentioned that Zorian can't fully integrate his simulacra because it would take too long, so he just gets summaries. Maybe that's part of the reason they can't easily pass on language learning.

But he does have spare time each restart with not much to do and no simulacra currently running, in the three Black Rooms. Might be a good time to digest comprehensive memory packets.
