I wonder just how much that Bakora Gate key is worth to the Silent Doorway Adepts?

It will definitely get their attention inside the loop, and probably be enough for them to let ZZ use their gate, but afterward, when they really need it for long-term gains, what will they be willing to trade for it? Maybe full access to study the gates?

Between that and the Ibasan gate, Zorian seems to be preparing for dimensionalism on a grand scale.
