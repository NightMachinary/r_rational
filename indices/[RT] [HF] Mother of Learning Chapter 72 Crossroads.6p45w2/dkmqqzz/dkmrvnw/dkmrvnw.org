the biggest issues are just discipline and temperament. even if Zorian can give her things that she finds interesting to do, she'll still have to do the more boring stuff at some pt (and the boring stuff are also pre-req to the more adv and interesting things anyways). even then, no matter how interesting something can get, if you're still incompetent or even if you did find it interesting, doing something repetitively for 2 hours straight (especially everyday) can get old real fast.

the reason Zorian could improve so much is a couple of factors that Kirielle doesn't really have. as mentioned, discipline. he was already naturally a more studious and serious person. he knows what he wants to do and needs to do and follows through with it. Kirielle's a lot more random and free-spirited and whimsical, especially as a nine year old. second, Zorian had other motivations keeping him going, both intrinsic and extrinsic. intrinsic, he finds a lot of the exercises fun by default as long as he doesn't have to go ham with them. he also had a bunch of goals that he /had/ to achieve and shaping exercises were somewhat necessary for that to happen

so unless Kirielle turns out /very/ serious about learning magic and sticks with it and/or turns out to be very naturally gifted, 5 years reaching Zorian's /current/ lvl is quite frankly insane (remember, Zorian's been in there what 10 years in loop now was it? or was that Zach's timeframe)
