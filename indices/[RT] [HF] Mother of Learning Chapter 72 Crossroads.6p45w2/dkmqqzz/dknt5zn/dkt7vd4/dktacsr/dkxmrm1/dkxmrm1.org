Sorry---maybe I misunderstood your point.

My understanding was you felt that if there was a better method of teaching students, the average student would be better trained as those superior methods would be widely adopted. However, I believe that tradition and the established edifice of education can hinder the implementation of superior pedagogy techniques, which is what we see in the real world---research into the learning and teaching process does not propagate quickly into schools (at least in the US).
