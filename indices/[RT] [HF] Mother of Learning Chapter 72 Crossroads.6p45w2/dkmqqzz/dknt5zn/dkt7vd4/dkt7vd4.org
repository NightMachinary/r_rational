I disagree with this. Drill-based arithmetic and algebra training is not the most efficient way of creating children with a talent and thirst for Math, but it is very good at destroying most children's love for math, as well as teaching many skills that are not terribly important---being slow adding numbers or not being terribly good at my 7--12 multiplication tables, as far as I can tell, does not hinder me my Calculus, Physics, or Chemistry classes.

And yet, this drill-based method is the de facto method of training in our world, which is a world where the internet makes the sharing of pedagogy methods very easy. In our world, especially in the US, teaching methodology is hardly optimized. If that can be true of one of the richest countries in the world, then it can certainly be true of Zorian's world.
