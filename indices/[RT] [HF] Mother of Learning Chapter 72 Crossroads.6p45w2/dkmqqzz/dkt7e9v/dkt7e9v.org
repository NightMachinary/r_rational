I'm really with you on this one. Zorian has spent time teaching Kirielle in the past and has taken notes on what methods she responds well to.

If he begins with mana control, mana sensing, and using unstructured mana to create art of some kind, I bet you her control would be astounding by age twelve, thus opening up things like early mastery of high efficiency combat spells, divination, work with dimensional barriers, and so on. He really could help her a lot.
