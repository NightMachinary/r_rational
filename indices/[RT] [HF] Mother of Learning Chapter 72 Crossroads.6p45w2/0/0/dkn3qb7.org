I think 5 years is a stretch due to maturity/diligence, but I do agree with Zorian's guidance, Kirielle is set on the path of greatness. Zorian already knows to a certain extent the best teaching method for Kirielle, due to having insight into her own magic breakthroughs.

If magic utilization follows like most mental skills, picking it up earlier in life will also be easier and set a better foundation, e.g. language.
