This is perhaps a bit outside the scope of the story (which presumably will not extend long past the time loop), but I've put a bit of thought into Zorian's education of Kirielle -- and education in MoL's magical system in general -- and this seems as good a time as any to discuss it.

Essentially, I think that with the right strategy Kirielle would have a good chance of being well on her way to becoming an archmage before ever entering the academy. There's obviously a great deal of uncertainty in that claim, but I don't think it's as far-fetched as it might initially appear.

Let's talk about shaping skills. We see Kirithishli say this in chapter 15:

  Mages of old didn't have the sort of shaping skills modern mages have, so they compensated by making their spells long and hyperspecialized
#+end_quote

I don't think I need to convince anyone that shaping skills are important, but based on this I'm thinking that shaping skills are the foremost distinguishing feature of the Ikosian magical tradition. They're what have allowed it to assimilate techniques from other traditions, and give its mages the flexibility to adapt general-purpose invocations to their needs rather than having a multitude of special-purpose spells. Furthermore, while shaping skills take a long time to hone, once mastered in a variety of areas it's relatively trivial to learn even extremely advanced invocations, so long as you can find someone to teach them. It's also a reasonable assumption that mana control is a fundamental skill that translates between exercises, meaning that all shaping exercises are useful and make it easier to learn others, even in completely different fields of magic.

However, most mages don't seem to attach all that much importance to them: seeing them as useful and a necessary prerequisite for high-level invocations, but not of fundamental importance and a goal to be pursued in and of itself. Ilsa, for example, is a master of her fields but her unstructured telekinesis was outstripped by Zorian in a relatively short amount of time and with less-than-optimal training techniques. Zorian's dedication to honing his shaping skills is seen as something of an eccentricity by others. For example, consider Tinami's reaction in chapter 41:

#+begin_quote
  "Is he as bad as they say?" she asked.

  "He had me do shaping exercises for two hours straight today."

  "Ouch. Okay, I guess that justifies being a few minutes late," she admitted. "We should probably reschedule our future meetings, just in case this keeps happening."

Also, in chapter 10:

#+begin_quote
  How many people could afford to focus all their energies on shaping exercises? There were so many things vying for the typical student's attention that shaping exercises no doubt ended up near the bottom of their priorities.
#+end_quote

If shaping exercises were considered a core competency, doing two hours of practice a day should not be seen as extreme. Since most shaping exercises take little mana, all mages should be practicing their shaping skills whenever they have a free moment, just like Zorian ends up doing.

In light of this Xvim seems much more reasonable. His "secret test of character" is still a stupid idea, but when he says:

#+begin_quote
  "Yes, it is criminal how badly the classes are failing our students," Xvim said. "Such a simple variation of a levitation exercise should not be beyond the grasp of a certified mage. No matter, we shall correct this deficiency before we move on to other matters."
#+end_quote

In chapter 5, I don't think he's being melodramatic or unreasonable. Instead, he is one of the few mages to assign shaping exercises their proper importance in developing a mage to their fullest potential.

So, back to Kirielle. I'm not proposing Zorian goes full-Xvim on her (though by now he can do a pretty impressive Xvim impression); that wouldn't work too well. She is nine, after all. But he should focus on fundamentals: shaping; mana perception; and that technique for assimilating ambient mana. In particular, he should focus on shaping exercises she would find fun. Remember how much she enjoyed the glowing orbs. Unrestricted telekineses is pretty cool as well. If he does it right, she'll be doing shaping exercieses pretty much all the time because she wants to. Since Kirielle is an unregistered mage he can't teach her first-level invocations or higher, but that's okay because I don't think he should teach her any invocations at all. If anything, he should give her the impression that unstructured magic is the normal way of doing things and invocations are more difficult and advanced. Once her skills are good enough he can teach her enough alteration and illusion to get her painting, sculpting, and other artistic things with unstructured magic. At that point, the sky's the limit, especially as shaping exercises don't seem to be very restricted (if at all) and generally don't require much in the way of mana reserves.

Zorian seemed to develop good mana perception in the space of a couple of months with the help of enhancement potions from the grey hunter. Since Zorian's mana perception was so rudimentary, I don't see why Kirielle couldn't learn it in much the same space of time. Zorian should be able to ward against ambient mana. Also he could make puzzles that require mana perception to solve, and give them to her as "toys".

It also might be a good idea to use blood magic to activate her as a mind mage (I suspect this should be somewhat easier in someone with it as a dormant bloodline) and train her. As an "inborn" ability, that also shouldn't be restricted (though it would be ill-advised to tell anyone about the blood magic).

Zorian's had a lot of motivation to improve his abilities, but by following this path, especially with developing mana perception early, I think Kirielle could reach close to his current level in five years or so. In particular, I suspect that developing the fine control to do art with unstructured magic would do wonders for raw mana control. There also may be a underlying link between artistic ability and shaping skill.

Even if their parents keep Kirielle away from Zorian in Cirin, once she has the fundamentals she can keep practicing them herself. She's already pretty adept at keeping her drawing secret. If possible, it would also be useful to get her some training from their grandmother (in secret, obviously).

I'm not quite sure why I put so much thought into this, but I find the image of her mother trying to keep her out of the Academy a few years down the road once she's demonstrated her abilities to Xvim. She would be a vindication of all his arguments with the faculty about the "poor state of magical education".
