Hindsight is 20/20, sure, but he didn't do too badly. Xvim's laser focus on shaping exercises led to his discovery that shaping skills make everything better, and he also used impressive shaping to brand himself as precocious and get extra mentoring from Ilsa.

Granted, he eventually found out that the very best foundation would have been focusing on mana sensing from day one. But his "all shaping, all the time" approach was still quite effective, miles ahead of standard academy material.
