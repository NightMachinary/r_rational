In Chapter 62 Zach mentions Zorian has been in the loop for roughly five years. There's also about five years left in the loop.

You're right, Kirielle doesn't have the work ethic or motivation of Zorian, and she's starting from scratch. However, she pursues her drawing with a great deal of dedication and one of my main points is that Zorian could leverage that with shaping exercises that appeal to her artistic inclinations. If she got to the point where she was capable of that, I could easily see her spending many hours every day essentially doing shaping exercises without thinking of them as tedious practice. This alone wouldn't give her the same variety as Zorian, but it would give her excellent raw mana control.

The main reason I think this might be plausible is mana perception. It's clear that the grey hunter potion can speed up the acquisition of the ability greatly, which makes me think that with the appropriate training techniques (e.g magical training toys) it might be possible for her to acquire it, even as a neophyte mage. Mana perception makes it much easier to learn and refine shaping exercises, but it's not clear just how large an effect this is. I'm guessing it would make practice somewhere between two and ten times more efficient. Also, with instant feedback -- by being able to see the mana -- it would likely be rather less tedious.

If the advantages of mana perception and Zorian's guidance roughly balance out her lack of Zorian's single-minded dedication, I think the timeframe could roughly match up.
