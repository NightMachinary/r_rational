Fair enough about the possibility of someone carrying off the crown, but this seems like a problem that would be solvable by just adding a few more restarts - purple-beam the Lich, rush to Ibasa at the beginning of the next restart to see what happens to it (he seems their main combat asset, and they probably don't have much of a contingency to deal with what amounts to him simply collapsing without warning all of a sudden) and purple-beam everybody you encounter. If you do it right, by the third restart, the island will suddenly and inexplicably turn into a wasteland of corpses so conspicuously that they will have greater worries than looting the Lich's body or organising any sort of defense.

(To me, this more generally makes the choice of "present these five items that exist inside the simulation " as the Gate's access control system appear a little odd - the Controller is already given nearly divine powers with respect to everything in it, which would only be exacerbated if they did in fact have the full 100 years' worth of looping available; in the worst case, a sufficiently ruthless Controller could just wipe every living thing but themselves from it, leaving spatial separation and any inanimate security systems as the only thing standing between them and the access token.)

(Does purple beam deletion work on Primordials? Or, more generally, what's the most serious obstacle that would not be susceptible to it?)
