I think the easiest solution would be to simply purple-beam the lich (and everyone else possibly hogging key pieces) out of the loop just before deciding to exit it (or even earlier, after the protagonists are sure they have found out everything they need to know to defeat him irl), so the final repeat just has to involve going around and collecting them.
