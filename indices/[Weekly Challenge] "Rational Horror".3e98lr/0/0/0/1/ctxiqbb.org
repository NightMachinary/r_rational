Hah, I didn't realise that the new David was Celeste. Just thought it was a rational horror story about uploading not really being a continuation of you, no matter how you do it (i.e. that the new David was a copy of David, not himself - yes I know that's equivalent but the slow destruction that one copy experiences is still chilling).
