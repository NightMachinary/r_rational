Couple of fixes:

#+begin_quote
  Saturned loomed > Saturn loomed

  I was broken from my revere > reverie

  I chuckled, climbing out of my chair and stretching my legs in the temporary absence of weightlessness.
#+end_quote

Mixing your tenses here, I think? Try: "I chuckled, as I climbed out of my chair and stretched..."

#+begin_quote
  “Do it then.” I said. > “Do it then,” I said.
#+end_quote

This one's a common mistake, which I still catch myself doing. No full stop. This error appears in a couple of spots.

#+begin_quote
  Marine privates' Matterson, ...
#+end_quote

No inverted comma necessary here.

#+begin_quote
  “How is this possible?” I asked to now one in particular > to no one
#+end_quote

Could be good with a bit of work, I agree with DataPacRat though, and perhaps you could increase the tension by allowing the realisation to unfurl a little more slowly?
