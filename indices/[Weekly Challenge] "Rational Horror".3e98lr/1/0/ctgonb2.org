Niiiiice.

My only science nitpicks - because the more accurate, the more horrifying:

1. Saturn-orbits have [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#Terminology_graph][apokrone]], not apoapsis (that's Earth-only). Also lovely mythological overtones...

2. LIDAR and microwave RADAR can show a lot of things, but not everything. At 10km altitude LIDAR is basically only good for landscape features; you could tell that part of the ship is missing but little else. 2km gets you to ~1m resolution though. On the other hand, the microwave backscatter is highly revealing about the surface type - this could be seriously creepy and it fits well. The SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography) works from earth orbit @~100km, and from 10km the backscatter can tell which part of a flat paddock has been grazed most recently.
