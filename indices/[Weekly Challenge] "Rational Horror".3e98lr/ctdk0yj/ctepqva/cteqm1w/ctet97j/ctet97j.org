  ... the horror of not being able to trust a copy of yourself enough to keep it outside of a cell ...

Hmm. Personally, I had just written that one of as "Angiers is bonkers." I think you need to sell that one a bit more if you want it to be the horror conceit -- in particular, you need to sell it /hard/ when, just down the hall, you've got a man being tortured and killed over and over. In particular, it needs to /feel/ like the central concept, when in fact it's almost entirely offstage -- there's a brief mention at the start that he has cells for his double, and then we don't hear about it again until the end.

Maybe add some scenes of him thinking about / talking with his doubles? Them suggesting he let them out, that they can help? Something like that. Also, you need a plausible way for them to have escaped -- right now it feels like a plot hole.
