Fixed. Thanks.

Part of the "glossing" was laziness, the rest was as you described: hurrying on to the more exciting bit. In my mind, the more exciting bit was the horror of not being able to trust a copy of yourself enough to keep it outside of a cell, then being faced with many of them escaping with your precious source of power.

The copies (or rather their shared root copy) have had 48 hours to sit around and do nothing but think (although some of that time would necessarily be spent resting). They cleared their head from thoughts of revenge and instead moved onto more interesting ways to use the machine. My reasoning for their being grouped together would be their need for help avoiding Angier the original.

Thanks for the typo fixes and the feedback.
