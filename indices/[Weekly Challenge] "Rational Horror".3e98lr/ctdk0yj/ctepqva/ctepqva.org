You probably want "Nicola" there. Also, later on you have "He's hardly been sleeping"; should be "he'd" to match tense.

I've seen the movie, loved it, and this is a great extension of the concept. It didn't work for me as horror because the scenes of torture were not evocative enough for me -- they felt glossed over, as though the story were hurrying on to some more interesting bit. The ending also left me puzzled -- if the copies are identical to him, why are they so antithetical to his own motivations? (No interest in revenge, willingness to work with copies.)
