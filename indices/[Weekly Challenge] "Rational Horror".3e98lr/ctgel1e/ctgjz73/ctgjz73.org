By about the second page, I was suspecting that some combination of the FTL ship's relatively unusual inertial frame combined with the FTL jumps would lead to a time-travel thingummy, which had caused the generation ship to have gone dark in some horrific version of the Causality Protection Conjecture...

... I'm afraid that the actual story didn't seem as fascinating as what I was hoping to see at that point. Maybe I was supposed to start feeling more unease with the unexplained phenomena, such as the exploring marines' local space getting twisted, but I didn't get much of any emotional punch from that before the explosion.

By the end, I was expecting to find a final gotcha of some kind, such as our FTL ship having drawn the attention of the spatial phenomena and dragged it to the Solar system behind them - or, given FTL-signalling/Time-travel phenomena, maybe have had it already be there when it arrived - but that didn't pan out, either.
