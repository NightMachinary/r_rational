Your in-document reviewer seems to have been a tad upset, but it made perfect sense to me. The fact that the AI was in the box was clearly stated in the beginning, and the minute his voice got faked, I knew what was going on -- she was scamming them all for reasons of her own. My initial guess was that now she has a "trust-worthy" sock puppet who can tell the world that no, Celeste is safe, really.

Also, the horror worked for me.
