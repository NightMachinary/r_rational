Regarding people reporting how bored they are by it: I think the OP presents this in a misleading light. Had I started reading it under the premise of Harry being vaguely rational/ish/, I would have been disappointed / bored as well.

For me this is one of the feel-good, think-little variety of fanfiction. There are interesting ideas in the story, and there is a lot of humor, but neither is /great/ or really captivating.

I most enjoyed reading this in the the following mood: Lazy, perhaps a bit sleepy, but still alert enough to enjoy thinking a bit. It's a bit of a break for me. Read like this, it's been enjoyable enough that over the years I've already read it three times.
