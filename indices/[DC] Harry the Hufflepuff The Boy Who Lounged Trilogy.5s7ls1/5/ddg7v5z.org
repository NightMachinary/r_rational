I think this is very relatable and did "rationality" in a more simple/straightforward way than HPMOR. The authority figures (e.g. Snape) value hard-work so much that they make up work where there is no need to (such as forbidding the use of elfs in a specific house) and look down on optimizations or alternative ways to solve a problem as "laziness", all of which I consider anti-rational.
