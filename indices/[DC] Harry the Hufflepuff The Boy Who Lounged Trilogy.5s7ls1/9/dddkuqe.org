For this to be a rational fanfic, harry needs ro be using his laziness for the good of all hufflepuff instead of being a loner. I.e. find people who can help him optimise daily life in a more wide ranging level. I.e. washing all school clothes at once, castle wide. Rational!hufflepuff!Harry would not be so self centred.
