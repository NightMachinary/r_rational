But he's not a rational Hufflepuff. His main terminal value is to be lazy. Not a well respected value in the community, I know, but in principle values are independent from rationality.

The Sorting Hat doesn't respect Harry's values either, so it puts him into Hufflepuff to "fix" him, like Neville in the canon (only in canon it eventually worked).
