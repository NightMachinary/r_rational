Read ~3.5 chapters before getting terribly bored. It seems like the author noted down three lines of characterisation and declared those to be Harry's new personality, then quickly went to all the canon moments he thought could show of that cardboard personality and wrote a few sentences for each.

Dare I say that the author's writing is /lazy/?
