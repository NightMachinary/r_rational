Well, Goku himself admits it, it was a risk.

There was also a slightly more convoluted reasoning behind that, that I left out to avoid slowing down the pace of the very tense scene. I could imagine a sustained magic version of the enchantment as well as a one-time version. However the one-time version would mean transforming Bulma into a perfectly "normal" carrot. And since I can't see how that could hold a human soul, that should mean killing her. Transforming it back should only mean getting a dead body, and she'd be in the afterlife. Instead her soul is still somewhat bound to the carrot, which means it's sort of magical, which made me lean towards the "sustained magic" explanation.

As an additional thought, Majin Bu displays similar abilities by turning people into candy, much later on. And the same seems to hold. In fact, when he turns Vegito into candy, the latter is /so strong/, he manages to overcome some effects of the magic and still fight. Which suggests the transformation does indeed leave the soul still bound to the object.
