Chapter 3 is up! This time it took a bit longer. To make it clear, my workflow is as follows - I tend to post one chapter when I finish writing the next one. So I've just finished Chapter 4, and now will polish it while I write Chapter 5, etc. This time I've been slowed down partly because of my work, but also because Chapter 4 was growing longer and longer, and I ended up just splitting it into two. Anyway, hope that you will like it! Here begin the real divergences from the original DB, and they're only going to get bigger from now on.
