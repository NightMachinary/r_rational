Yeah it seemed a bit strange for me too. Though for me it was also that it seemed really risky to send civilians on a potential shapeshifter only based on the fact that he hadn't visibly hurt anything or anyone yet. If people complied with his demands with only the visual shapeshifting there wasn't any reason for him to have hurt anyone even if he was able to do so. So the fact that he hadn't hurt anyone yet wasn't really much evidence either way. And it seems like Goku knows/suspects that he can do true shapeshifting during moons, so it seems weird for him to not expect that Oolong's power is similar. And in that case it seems crazy for him to agree to send untrained civilians on Oolong if there's some risk that Oolong's powerlevel is similar to that of Goku in his monkey form.
