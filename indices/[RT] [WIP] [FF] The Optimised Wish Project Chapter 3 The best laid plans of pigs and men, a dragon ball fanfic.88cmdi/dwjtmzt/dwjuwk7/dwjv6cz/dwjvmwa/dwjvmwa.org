Oh, sorry :D. I didn't get it. I would need to check, how to deal with countable and uncountable nouns in all circumstances might indeed have gone over my non-native speaker head :/.

Well, not all magic has to work exactly the same. Plus Bulma didn't weigh the stick, but even then, it's made clear even in the original DB that Oolong is /bad/ at magic. Puar is better at doing the same things (though he/she has limits too). I really don't think I can make it completely consistent while adhering close enough to the original Dragon Ball lore, it's really totally over the place. The Nyoibo is also effectively a unique relic of special potency (it comes from Kami's Lookout after all), while Oolong just learned some stuff at magic school.
