I'm eagerly awaiting updates.

I'm curious. Does time travel exist in your fiction? If so, Id have two guesses as an end game plot. One, is that the dragon granted Bulma's wish ahead of time, causing the injury to Goku's head to cause him to be this way, premptively causing him to be as he is now. Then caused them to cross each other's paths. Now Bulma won't have to have an existential crisis about having accidentally created a person to be her perfect boyfriend. Unless she considers the implications that the dragon altered space time to war the world around her desire and therefore anything and everything that has occured to everyone is a direct result of her wish. Ah poop, Ive gone and distracted myself and forgotten my other point.
