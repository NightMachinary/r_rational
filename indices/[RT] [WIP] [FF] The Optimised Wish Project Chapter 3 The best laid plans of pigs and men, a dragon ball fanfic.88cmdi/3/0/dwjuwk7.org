The periods are intentional, it's just to mean that the sentence is pronounced in awe, with the words well separated :). I've seen it used various times in that way.

As for Oolong... yeah, may have been a bit rushed in a way. I guess that's what happens when you want to get something done with because the bits after that are what you really care about... Though if you consider it Bulma doesn't /exclude/ he might be using holograms either - she just takes precautions for the case in which he can actually transform. Also what the people describe seems a bit too much for holograms. She /does/ somewhat believe already in magic, at this point, necessarily, she's seen Goku's stick. This just seals the deal.
