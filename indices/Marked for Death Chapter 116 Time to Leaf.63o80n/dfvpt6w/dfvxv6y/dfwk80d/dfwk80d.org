Even if Leaf wins the war, there would still be a lot of exploding stuff to do as well.

The canon had, I gather, a rather ridiculous succession of bad guys and existential threats, which goes approximately like that: Orochimaru → Akatsuki → ~6 different S-classes one-upping each other → an eldritch abomination → an agent of an ancient chakra god on the quest to resurrect her → an ancient chakra god / sufficiently advanced alien → a moon-nin who gathered power for thousands of years → a more powerful ancient chakra god from a parallel universe. (The existential threats start after Akatsuki.)

I doubt the QMs would go through the whole list, but Akatsuki at least should exist, and possibly the ancient chakra god too. Or something non-canon they came up with+, like the Lupchanzen Conspiracy.+

Even aside from antagonists, there would be a lot of problems. Restructuration of the society implied by the uplift would probably turn violent quite a few times. Conservatists in ninja villages won't like it. Internal extremists akin to canon Danzō won't like it. Civilians, long oppressed by ninja and now given power to fight back, would /love/ it.

When /that/ is dealt with, there's the matter of summon realm/the Seventh Path. Many players were distressed by the pangolins' casual talk about genocide and enslavement, and marked their world for eventual (and forceful, if the need arises) uplift as well.

Even Leaf's takeover of the world won't solve all of its problems, not even remotely.

  I don't see how Leaf might not win at this rate

As you've said, superior spying ability of one of Leaf's opponents, or alternatively, superior secret technology. Since it's a rational quest, the protagonists are not unique in their clevernes, and the enemies are allowed to develop secret warfare-revolutionizing inventions as well. Orochimaru the mad bioscientist is suspected to be allied with Mist; he may have created something on par with Skywalkers.
