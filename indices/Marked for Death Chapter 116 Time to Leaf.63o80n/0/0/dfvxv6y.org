Enjoy it while it lasts. If Leaf wins the war here there will still be lots of non exploding stuff to do. Assuming we don't just fast forward to the epilogue from there. Then again it might not be that easy, but I don't see how Leaf might not win at this rate. I mean maybe a spy from that one spirit clan that's good at sneaking around might inform the condors of some of team uplift's innovations. Idk
