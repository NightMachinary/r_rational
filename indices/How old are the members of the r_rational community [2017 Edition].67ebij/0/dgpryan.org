So some of you may remember this survey from just over two years ago (It was posted on Jan 9, 2015). About 500/2050 members submitted at that time. Since then, we've grown from about 2,050 members to a little over 6,500. Plus we've all aged two years! So i decided to redo the survey for the lulz!

I've made it a little bit more complex than last time. Before, the survey took like 5 seconds. Now it may take 15-60, depending on how hard you wanna think about it. It's all completely as anonymous as you want it to be; feel free to comment and, as I did last time, I'll post the link to the results spreadsheet if this idea gains traction! The old data is there too, for anyone curious.
