I don't think this is good and there's not nearly enough of anything to tell if it /could/ be good. It's also not "rational", mostly by virtue of not being anything at all; it is attempting the appearance of "rational" by using the words but does not achieve any of their meaning.

If you're the author, what were you trying to accomplish? If you're not, why do you think this sub would like this content?

Edit: The conclusion that "martial artist" is more important to the DB world than "scholar" is decent
