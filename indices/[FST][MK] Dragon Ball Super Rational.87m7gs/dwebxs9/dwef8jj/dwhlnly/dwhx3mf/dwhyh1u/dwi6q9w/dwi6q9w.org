Hmm. After looking up what that meant, I got,

#+begin_quote
  For instance, you'll have a moonlit night if you write that on the mill dam a piece of glass from a broken bottle glittered like a bright little star, and that the black shadow of a dog or a wolf rolled past like a ball.
#+end_quote

It may turn out I don't like writing anymore. Not that I ever could (without it seeming somewhat nonsensical). That seems lame. I like logic (it may not seem so) but... it's now time to depart from writing forever. I may be uncapable of (or don't want to) making my fancy magi-logic fics now that I know this much about writing.

Good bye, world.
