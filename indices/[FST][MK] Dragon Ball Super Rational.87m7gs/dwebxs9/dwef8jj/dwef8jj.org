Well, the idea is that Gohan, in DBS, is a secondary character. The idea of most ratiofics, like I read, is that he learns about rationality, then sets to use the rules of the world to his advantage, instead of not using them. So Gohan (chosen because he's the one scholar in db) sets out to do this and find the optimal path to take in the world of db. Zamasu is the "strawman rationalist" (see tvtropes term) of db. He sort of does this but he's evil, Gohan then finds a better path. It even teaches about Sagan in the beginning too
