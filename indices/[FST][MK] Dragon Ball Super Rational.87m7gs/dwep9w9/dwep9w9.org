Harsh criticism incoming from seasoned veteran of internet serial fiction.

This reads like a lazy parody. All telling, no showing, 1,500 words to a single unremarkable chapter, poor opening paragraph.

I'm sure you mean well, but you need loads more practice before your writing will be worth reading. It's difficult to justify giving your story a read when /The Optimized Wish Project/ already does dragon ball, and incredibly well at that.

If you want to write, and write well, you have to put in the work. You already probably have good taste and have likely read lots of great material, but that is not equitable to writing skill. Give your chapter a read and ask yourself this: if you hadn't already come up with all of these neat ideas, would this exposition really be enough to put it into the mind of a reader?

To get where I am today, I have written something like a million words, and most of those are bitrotting on hard drives, never to be published. What I have published, some 400k words in a few different fanfics, have been met with praise from a small but not insignificant readership.

Great popular stories have always been written by seasoned veterans of the written word. Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote HPMOR in his mid-thirties, after writing a prodigious amount of publishing-worthy blog-post philosophy and several academic papers. John C. McCrae wrote Worm after about 20 false starts.

So my advice is: lurk more; subscribe to authorial subreddits/feeds/blogs; take a /real/ interest in analyzing the work of the great masters of the craft, understanding word-for-word what they do and how they do it; write at least 5k words per week, and keep up the habit for a year. /Then/ begin researching for your rational fanfic, and once you have a first chapter, we will shower you in upvotes.
