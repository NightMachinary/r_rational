With respect, this is an incredibly unhelpful and, in fact, negative-value review. Yes, you're right that the piece is too much tell-don't-show and lacks a hook at the beginning. That's useful advice that would help [[/u/blak11]] (or whomever the author was), so had you stopped there you would have been golden. That said, I've seen /far/ worse stories -- if nothing else, the spag here is good and it seems like it's at least making an effort to be funny.

Telling an author "you're not good enough to write, so don't publish anything" is rude, condescending, and counterproductive. Book learning is great and all, but "putting in the work" has to involve actually writing and getting feedback; the best way to get feedback is to publish.

It's also not helpful to make your review all about yourself. "I've written a million words, most of which I've never published and the stuff I've published has been praised by not-insignificant audiences" is just not-so-humble-bragging. Personally, I have /published/ over 2,000,000 words (as well as having a boatton more bit-rotting on various hard drives, as you put it), and my work has been both praised and paid for. I would never say that in a review of someone else's story and mention it here only so that you don't try to dismiss me based on your "veteran" status.
