Well... it may have been an excuse hastily made to get the ratiofic plot going, so there you go. Gohan reads a book and learns about rationality (premise of story). Maybe it's a really good book on the matter.

Though one may wonder how one learns rationality, if not by reading a book about it (or by already being rational, or a combination of both). The ones I read had (1) harry browses the internet, now he knows everything (2) harry has better upbringing, he self-taughts with books, (3) they already rational at the point the fic starts. (4) singularity already happens in the start. ???

What I'm really proud of, though, is how I managed to insert egp memes into fic.
