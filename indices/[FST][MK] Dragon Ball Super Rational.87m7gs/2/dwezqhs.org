There's too little done with this story to make it a good read, at least in my opinion. The descriptions are brief and rather uninformative; the "rationality" aspect seems to just be Gohan using the words and pinning it on his forms and the incorporation of typical rational tropes like him trying to create a utopia felt lazily introduced; may be a side effect of the low word count however.
