Love Octavia Butler's books. The Xenogenesis trilogy is also excellent and has a complex, well-written alien species with logical motivations for wanting to take over the human species based on their own biological drives, and the main characters, especially the protagonist of the first book, may not be totally rationalist but they at least seem to try hard to make sensible, pragmatic decisions when trapped in frightening, unfamiliar situations.
