Cat's greatest strength in the upcoming conflict is the fact Callow hasn't pissed in anyone's cereal, which she wants to leverage in a diplomatic solution. This is quite smart as she's at least cordial with the major actors but I don't really see it happening as it is.

There needs to be some sort of inciting incident or a greater threat for peace talks to occur. The Dead King, the gnomes or the Everdark - a combination of all of them, maybe.
