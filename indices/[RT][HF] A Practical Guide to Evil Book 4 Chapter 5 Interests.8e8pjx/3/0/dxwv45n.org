Yeah, what's UP with the gnomes? That early stuff with the Red Letter and Black talking about how Calernia is basically the backwaters of the world sort of seems to have gone nowhere. I'd suspect that EE laid that groundwork without having a payoff in mind,but everything else in the story says he knows exactly what kind of story he's telling here.
