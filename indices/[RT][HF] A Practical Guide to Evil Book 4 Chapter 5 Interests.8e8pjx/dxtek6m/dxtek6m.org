God, I just feel /bad/ for Catherine. I know, and she knows, that she threw away any chance of a personal happy ending from the moment she accepted apprenticeship to Black, but does the whole world have to burn down around her, too?

I mean, this story seemed to start out with a pretty clean divide between good and evil, with one young girl trying to have her cake and eat it too - crossing over to the side of evil because it seemed like the only way to help end the suffering of her people.

Now that she's finally got her crown, it turns out there is no Good in the world as far as I can see - the spectrum seems to run from Dark Grey to Blacker-than-Black. Every hero we've encountered so far has been so naive and narrow minded it's hard to see them as real people. The rulers of every nation, including the "Good" ones are some combination of corrupt, appallingly selfish, and just actually Evil.

Where's the anti-Cat? Where the smart, capable person who can see and deal with power struggles but still believes in good, moral behavior and methods? Cat says she can't rule, but aside from just not having the support, it's not super clear to me that Anne wouldn't be at best just a competent manager of the bureaucracy, let alone an actual counter-weight the Malicia.

Where in the world is there any hope for a clean, stable exit for Cat?
