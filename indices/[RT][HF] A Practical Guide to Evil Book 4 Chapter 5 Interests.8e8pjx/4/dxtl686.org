Quick question: we know that in the past the Empire had to invade Callow on multiple occasions to compensate for food shortages. So how is it that, if the kingdom was invaded every now and then, they still kept a long-lasting dynasty of Callowan Kings until Amadeus showed up?

Were the previous invasions never successful enough or long-lasting enough to truly suppress the Fairfaxes beyond their ability to recover?
