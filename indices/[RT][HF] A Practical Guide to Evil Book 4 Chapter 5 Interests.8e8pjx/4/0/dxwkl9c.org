The Fairfaxes are the second ruling dynasty of Callow, the original founders were the Albans (the most famous of these being the Queen of Blades). As for how they survived in the face of constant invasion, it's a combination of branch families and the very strong story of 'every royal dies except for that underage one, which then proceeds to kick out the hated invader'.
