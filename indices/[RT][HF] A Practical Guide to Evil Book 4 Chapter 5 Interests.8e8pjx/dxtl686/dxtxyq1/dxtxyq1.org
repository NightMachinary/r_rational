Basically, you don't need to actually be in the direct family of a royal, to be able to claim you are part of said dynasty.

Third cousin twice removed? No one better around, no one seems to care, There ya go, You are now a Fairfax.

So i imagine quite a few of the Praes rulers will have attempted to stamp out the name, but then out of nowhere, some bastard from a orphanage pops up, drags a sword from a stone, and suddenly all of Callow is up in arms chanting "Fairfax!"

At some point the Tyrants probably stopped bothering with trying.
