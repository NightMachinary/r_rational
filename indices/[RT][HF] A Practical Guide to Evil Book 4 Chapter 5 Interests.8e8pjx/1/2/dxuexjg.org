The exit would be in rivers of blood until Callow can reach some recovery time, while at the same time using bastardized Praes-ian bureaucracy to make Callow stable without *anyone* on the throne. Once Cat doesn't need to rule with an iron fist, Thief can Steal the kingdom from her, and Cat can try and transition her story from "literal royalty" to "power behind the throne" or "figurehead and occasional massacre specialist". The rest of the world cooperating to let Cat ACTUALLY use her talents instead of scrambling is...doubtful, however.
