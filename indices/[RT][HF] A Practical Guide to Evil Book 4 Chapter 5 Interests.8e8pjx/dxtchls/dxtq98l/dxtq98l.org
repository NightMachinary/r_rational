  How expendable are the princes is debatable, since while First Prince sent them in the first wave to die, their popularity with the remainder of the Principate is debatable.

My thinking is that Prince Milenan is the number one contender for deadifying. Princess Malanza is dangerous, but politically she's weaker than Milenan because her brother is buttering up the leaders and poised to take rulership of his realm. So if Milenan dies but Malanza lives, Cordelia loses her main political rival, keeps a great general, and faces no real risk from the outcome. If Malanza takes over the reigns of Milenan's faction, I doubt the other rulers will be too upset and demand retribution. That will make her much more willing to work with Cat on negotiating a cease-fire.

I'm actually curious why Malicia wants them both to live. Perhaps she sees treating with Milenan as easier than Cordelia? But she has to know that Milenan succeeding Cordelia means he'll want a chunk of Callow in return for calling off the Crusade. That means a long-term threat closer than Procer currently is, losing part of Praes's bread basket, and obviously severing ties to the Woe forever (well, as long as Cat's around). It seems like a lousy long-term plan, even if it's the "easiest" way to end the Crusade.
