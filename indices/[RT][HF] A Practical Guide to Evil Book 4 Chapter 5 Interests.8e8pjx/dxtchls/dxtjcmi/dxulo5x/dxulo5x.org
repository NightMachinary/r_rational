As has been said about Kairos, the "always keep a first step going" thing isn't a plan, it's a juggler's philosophy. No matter how good at juggling you are, if you try to juggle forever your arms will get tired. In particular, the more wacky plans you stack up and then leave behind you, the more catastrophic it will be when you lose momentum and they all come crashing down on you, Evil Classicâ„¢ style. Fate gets sick of that kind of gimmick quickly, I imagine.
