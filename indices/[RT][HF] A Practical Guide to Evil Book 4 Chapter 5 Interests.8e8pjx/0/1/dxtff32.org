I don't believe becoming human would help her rule better. Lets be honest, she is crap at it. She is much better on the battlefield. Which is also why I don't think that war is going to come to any peaceful resolution. Nothing in this story has been done so far without rivers of blood and mountains of bodies.

I also quite like that inhuman aspect she is fighting with. It brings something new and refreshing. And when she will eventually cut loose, it will be glorious.

At this stage I really don't have slightest idea, how she will win (or if she will). None of my predictions in past came to be and author does great job in coming with unexpected turns. I quite enjoy that.
