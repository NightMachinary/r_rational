While you are right about rivers of blood and mountains of bodies, she cannot afford not to try. After all, no matter where a conflict on Calernia starts, if she protracts it chances rise of it spilling into Callow. Add to that the fact that she already will have to antagonize eight mortal rulers to deliver on her bargain with Larat, and she needs to start minimizing the fallout /now/.

Letting Winter loose will come at a great cost, which nearly guarantees it to be lethal, with savvy heroes and a Bard on the other side. Remember, giving in to it turns her into the kind of villain that they've been exterminating for /decades/.
