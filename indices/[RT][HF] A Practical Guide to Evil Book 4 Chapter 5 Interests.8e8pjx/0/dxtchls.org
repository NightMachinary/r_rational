So, unlike in the previous conflicts, this time Catherine wars with another countries, ones she can't feasibly conquer and control. She also will either have to resign sooner or later, or to become a human again, either of which means that breaking the crusading armies badly enough that the enemies flee will only delay their return until the threat is gone. That means she'll have to treat with them, in some form.

To do that she'd have to:

- leave the Grey Pilgrim alive and relatively well, or the Levantines will rush her. Saint of Swords may be more expendable, since heroes aren't as popular in Procer, but she also has been hinted to have gripes with Proceran royalty, so it might be wiser to leave her alive, if leveraging that would be possible.

- spare the majority of the invading host, since otherwise Cordelia will /have/ to retaliate. How expendable are the princes is debatable, since while First Prince sent them in the first wave to die, their popularity with the remainder of the Principate is debatable.

- come up with treaties that would assure the leaders of crusaders that the threat that served as the pretext for the war (the superweapons from the Tower that can be replicated at a later date) is dealt with. The wording ("Now I just had to make sure everyone else in this mess was ready to sign [the Liesse Accords], and that was a different beast. Malicia, I knew, never would agree."), while implying that the Empress will have to be deposed, doesn't seem to /include/ her resignation in those treaties. The only way that superweapons can be credibly disposed of, and one Malicia would see as an unacceptable, is bringing down the Tower. EDIT: On a second thought, even that may not help. If the recent story about the poisoning of a former Russian spy in London is any indication, there is /no/ good way to convince people you aren't hiding the poison-producing facilities elsewhere.

Did I forget any other diplomatic constraints? how would you untangle his political knot while actively waging a war in your lands?
