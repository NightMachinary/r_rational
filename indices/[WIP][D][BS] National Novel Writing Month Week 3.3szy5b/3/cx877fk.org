I had this brilliant plan: finish "The Change Storms: Induction" in October, then write a new novel, "Autumn's Acceptance" for NaNoWriMo.

Wow, talk about about the planning fallacy.

I'm most of the way through NaNoWriMo and I'm not done with TCS:I yet. Furthermore, I've only written 16,240 words on it as of 10:46am 2015-11-21. There are two reasons for this: first, I do a lot of research. I spent hours poring over Google Maps trying to figure out what my characters will see when they go into the town of Vermillion, Ohio. (Which is a real place, obviously.) Second, I'm publishing it a chapter at a time over on my Patreon, so I spend a lot of time editing, which is time I'm not spending writing.

I haven't been entering my word counts because I was thinking "no, I can't because I'm not working on the novel I was intending to work on." Feh. Okay, forget that. I'm going to list my wordcounts for TCS:I, not counting the 63,480 words that were already written before November. I can, in theory, still win NaNoWriMo if I can produce 3,370 words per day. It seems unlikely, but I've been telling myself I need to step up my game and get more efficient. So. No more researching -- I'm past the part where I need to do that anyway, so that's good. Editing still needs to happen, but I'll try to be more efficient about that as well; I'm going to publish this thing after it's complete, so there will be another editing pass then.

Onwards!
