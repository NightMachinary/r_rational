It works more or less how it seemed to work in the real world; remembering a thing is like doing a read-write on a the file instead of making a duplicate file with all the same information. If you remember going to the beach, you're actually altering that memory going of the beach in the course of remembering.

Mentalists /do/ have memories of what they do in their mindscape, but any time spent within a memory just stays as part of that original memory instead of creating a memory of a memory.

Without training, you can unintentionally alter memories by going into them, similar to how in the real world you alter memories by remembering them (one of the reasons that eyewitness testimony is crap). Most mentalists train themselves to crystallize their memories to be strictly accurate and unchanging, then take care not to change anything when they're stepping through a memory.

This is actually touched on some in the most recent section; a character understands his memory of an event as likely inaccurate because he spent a lot of time remembering it before he became a mentalist.
