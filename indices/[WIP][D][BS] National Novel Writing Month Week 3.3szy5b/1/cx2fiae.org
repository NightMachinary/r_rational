Approaching 200 pages now, three more chapters to go before Act 1 and Act 2 are more or less complete. Getting a little concerned about length, as this is only about 1/3rd of the story. I'm caught between thinking "I have to write this scene so the rest of the story is meaningful, can't rush it" and "I just want to get this done so I can get to the awesome parts". Not sure if there's a solution other than just keep writing and edit later.
