I've recently read through your story and I wanted to know if you have thought of how mentalists relate to recursion? Mentalists can access nearly any of their own memories through their mind palace, but they also have memories of their experience in their mindscape examining their memories. Can they interact or do anything to those meta-memories? I'll also point out the possibilities of meta-meta-memories and so on.
