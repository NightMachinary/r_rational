That's definitely a part of it. The person in question is not aware of his own existence. Everything he does now is by reaction or habit. He won't even respond when addressed, because he doesn't recognize that he is being addressed. I would say that he can't even think the term "I", but he might be able to by habit of thought. He just won't /hear/ himself think that, because he no longer hears his own thoughts.

Beyond that, though, he has no instinct for self-preservation, either. If the building he is in bursts into flames, he'll just sit there, because he doesn't recognize he is in danger, because he doesn't recognize any "he".

...I feel like the more I try to explain it, the less clear my explanation becomes.
