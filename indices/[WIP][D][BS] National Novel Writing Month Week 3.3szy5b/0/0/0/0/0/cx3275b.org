That's basically what I was planning on doing, yeah. They're a side character, but I'm going to be writing an interlude from their perspective, where they go through the event that results in them losing that sense of existence.

In addition to this character, there is one who completely loses his sense of touch, one who loses all emotional input with regards to decision-making, and one who lost the ability to separate or ignore things inside his own mind (compartmentalize). The phenomenon responsible for these occurrences is seen as a fate-worse-than-death, though some people are lucky and only lose something like their hearing, or sense of smell.
