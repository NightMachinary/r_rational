I guess I would associate "sense of existence" with some level of self-awareness, though I'm not sure that's what you mean by it. Like, maybe you'd get someone who's incapable of introspection and continues on with a sort of mechanical inertia, unable to think about their own internal processes anymore. I wouldn't think that a loss of a sense of existence would come with a loss of senses, which is part of what makes it difficult. So ... someone who can't say, "I think therefore I am" because the first part of that is now unintelligible to them.
