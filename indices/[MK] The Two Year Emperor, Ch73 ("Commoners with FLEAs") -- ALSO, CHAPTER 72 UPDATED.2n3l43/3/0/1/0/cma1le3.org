No, it's just bags of holding.

Bag of holding rule: "If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: Bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the portable hole and bag of holding in the process. "

Portable Hole wording: "f a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in that place. Both the bag and the cloth are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, the portable hole and bag of holding being destroyed in the process. "

There's nothing in there that says "a bag of holding /or anything that works like it/" They call it out by name, and it's only that exact combination that has a problem.

And because I've had this argument before: this is how I read the rules, this is how it is in 2YE. If you disagree with this reading, fine. It doesn't change how it works in 2YE.
