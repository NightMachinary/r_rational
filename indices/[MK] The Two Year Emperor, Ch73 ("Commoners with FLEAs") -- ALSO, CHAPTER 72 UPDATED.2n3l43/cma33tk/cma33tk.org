Ring of Heal Every round cost: 6 (Spell level) * 11 (caster level) * 2000 gp (for use activated magic item) = 132,000 gp.

Belt of +6 to all stats: 6^{2} (ability bonus squared) * 1000 gp (cost for ability bonus) * ( 1 + 0.75 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5) (six different abilities to boost) = 135,000 gp.

They're already nearing the 200k gp limit for non-epic magic items. If they want more power they'll have to make more restrictions, such as making them only work for Good characters (30% cheaper) or something else.
