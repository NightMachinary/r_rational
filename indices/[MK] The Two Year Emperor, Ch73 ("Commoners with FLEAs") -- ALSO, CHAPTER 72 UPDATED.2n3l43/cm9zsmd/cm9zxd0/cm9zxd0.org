Bag of Holding / Portable Hole: Yep. Actually, I think they're just recalling all Bags of Holding, destroying them, and replacing them with as many Handy Haversacks as the owner wants for them. You can put a PH in a HH, and you can nest HH's in each other -- they are strictly better than a BoH.

I'm glad you like the vignettes / extended epilogue structure. I'm pretty sure that's how it's going to play out.
