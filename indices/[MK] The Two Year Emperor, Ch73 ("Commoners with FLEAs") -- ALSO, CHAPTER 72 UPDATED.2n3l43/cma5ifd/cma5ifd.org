I really, really hope they're doing an alignment check prior to putting people through FLEA and POPE - it would just suck if they accidentally created a whole horde of evil folk with the standard set of magic items.

They've made a whole host of things that make it very very difficult for people to die, and it would thus be at least moderately difficult to stop/kill an evil person who got upgraded.

Then again, a Helm of Opposite Alignment Engine stationed near the Detect Evil Engine would work - you can always choose to fail a save.
