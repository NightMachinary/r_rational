I think we are seing the intresting question between torture and dispensing cruel and unusual punishment as a duty. Part of Suzie's portfolio is to send people to hell, and like most "gods" to judge mortals. She's more enthusiastic torturing the poor rapist, but I doubt it's an evil act until she realizes that it's torture, but that's just my 2cp.
