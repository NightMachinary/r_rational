Hmm. Judging by her past actions, Suze was probably good or neutral. Capturing and torturing someone is an objectively evil act, by RAW. (So is creating and commanding undead.) She's risking her alignment here, but maybe that's /what usually happens/ to gods of death.

Calvin does deserve a comeuppance. To be tortured by a god seems a bit /excessive/, and unworthy of her. Which, in the end, is why we don't torture people - they might or might not deserve it, but the consequences /to us/ are not worth it.
