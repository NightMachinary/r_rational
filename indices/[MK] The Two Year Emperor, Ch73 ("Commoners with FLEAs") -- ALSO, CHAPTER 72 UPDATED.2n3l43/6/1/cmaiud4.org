RAW is actually pretty unclear on undead being strictly evil or not. Some parts of the rules treat it as such while others say it is completely neutral. Not all undead spells have the [evil] tag and there are good undead. Some of the rules treat negative energy as inherently evil while others treat it as just another form of energy. etc, it is not super consistent since it was written by people who held different views and assumptions on the default morality of stuff. It ends up in DM territory to decide.

Torture on the other hand....
