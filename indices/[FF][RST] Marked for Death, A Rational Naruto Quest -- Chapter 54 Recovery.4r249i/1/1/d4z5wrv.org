How to make a Marked for Death:

Take 6 ninja wizards, mix them with a death world, and have their leadership betray them. Add a dash of intrigue and a splash of threateningly powerful non-humans. Season with diplomacy, tense combat, a paranoid explosives expert, and a team mom who is a lethal assassin / mistress of illusion. Shake well and serve twice per week alongside a very active community.

Makes about 150,000 canon words and a dozen or so omakes.
