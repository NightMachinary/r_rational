*Some background*: It's a quest, where people (largely from the rational fiction community) vote on the actions the characters take between each update. It's also written by some of the luminaries of this community, who seem to have put a lot of effort into the worldbuilding and making the non-player characters act rationally. (The original work is a shonen that shines as an example of profoundly irrational writing, making this even more impressive.)

*Selling it*: So, as a reader, the story is pretty enjoyable. Due to the player and randomness driven nature of the quest, there's no plot immunity and the tension is therefore pretty high. The world building is well done, creating good reasons for why the world is how it is. There are many smart participants in the quest, so the main characters generally act intelligent. The writing is good, with good characterization and imagery.

Issue is, the story is still pretty early and we've not gotten to the serious munchking yet. We're also still pretty low on the world's power hierarchy and there's no coherent theme or strong hints of a long term plot arc. This is probably pretty par for the course for a rational quest, since starting out as a weakling in an internally consistent world means you don't have narritivitium to help push things along. However, it also means that there's no easy hook I can point to to convince you that the story itself is interesting.

Of course that's all looking at the story as a reader. If you're a player (contributing to the discussions/planning/voting) there's an entire extra layer of fun. The community is amazing, a pile of really smart people having stimulating discussions. There's a surprising level of decency, kindness, and a strong assumption of goodwill, much more than many other forums I've seen. It's one of the best practical examples of people working together rationally that I've seen.

You also don't have to read the whole thread to join, just the updates and the posts after the last update. We recently had someone new propose a plan and win a vote before their first dozen posts in the thread.
