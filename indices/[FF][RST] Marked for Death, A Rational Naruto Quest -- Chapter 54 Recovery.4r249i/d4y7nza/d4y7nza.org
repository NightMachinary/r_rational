Kagome is possibly my favorite character for these reasons. On some level he might be the only sane missing-nin we encounter. He knew it was only a matter of time before those stinkers sicced tapirs on them and was prepared. He made everyone make camp an extra hour out. His terrifying explosive beach buoys of instant seemingly unnecessary death saved them from the chakra jellyfish. They'd be lost without him.
