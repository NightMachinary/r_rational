Doesn't matter. You could potentially arm all the adults, but all that would mean is that they would die with their boots on. Pre-industrial societies just do not produce the surplus needed to train a large percentage of the population to a sensible standard of soldiering. Revolutionary era France raised armies of unprecedented size, but that still meant "1 or 2 in a hundred frenchmen under arms". Not one in ten! Using dragons for military, as opposed to economic, purposes would make that problem very much worse. When an army a tenth the size of your entire population shows up in this context, you can surrender, run or die. Fight just isn't on the table. Of course, this means that said army is a major expense for the empire to keep in the field. So, potentially, you could just fly away, wait for the empire to get bored marching troops around your island utterly unopposed, send their troops somewhere where there is actual fighting to be done, and just take it back after they leave.
