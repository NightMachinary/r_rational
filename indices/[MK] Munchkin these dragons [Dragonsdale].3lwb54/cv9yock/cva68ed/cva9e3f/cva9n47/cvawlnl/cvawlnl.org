you've got an entire army arriving on wooden boats held together with tar and flying creatures that shoot flames (you can also drop normal incendiaries from much higher for safety). you're the only ones who can see past the ground level horizon, allowing early detection of enemy forces.

you will not win at fighting. you may win at logistics. the enemy is going to need to ship a truly colossal amount of food and supplies in to support their army, and they're going to need to do it on more wooden ships held together by tar. continue harassing enemy shipping while burning anything you have to retreat from.

if you have time to build such things, make dragon carriers. get a barge, put dragons and related supplies on it, fly combat air patrols, never let a conventionally-armed enemy ship get within visual range of you. make cannon-armed galleons obsolete exactly the same way aircraft carriers made battleships obsolete.

meanwhile, send envoys to the king's rivals, both in his court and his neighbors. explain how useful dragons are.

hell, sneak some dragons to the mainland, fly to the king's castle, and eat/firebomb him. castles are meaningless if you can fly.
