So, we are talking about 500 dragon riders vs 5000 pro-soldiers with rifles. Both have additional (civilian) help for logistics. The empire has no airborne troops.

Against a larger army, you always resort to guerilla tactics. Use mobility and air superiority for tactical strikes against support, stocks, ships. Sabotage as much as possible before the ships even leave the harbor.

Can dragons land and start on water? That would help with sinking ships. Maybe you can train them accordingly.

Once the ships approach your island, drop stuff on them. Rocks are ok. Napalm or Molotov cocktails are better. Civilians should evacuate to some mountains, where bottlenecks for the larger army can be defended and dragon can provide support.

If it comes to a siege. Dragons should provide food support and intercept enemy support. If the empire troops starve the will leave at some point.
