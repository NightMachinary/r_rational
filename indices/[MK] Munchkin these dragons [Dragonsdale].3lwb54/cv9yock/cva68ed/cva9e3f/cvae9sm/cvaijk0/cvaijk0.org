/The dragons eat/. A lot. Their caloric requirements make them utterly useless for guerrilla warfare tactics. You march in, seize the town - and by extension, the granaries. Then you wait for the riders to surrender before their mounts all starve to death. For maximum efficiency of this tactic, run the invasion during the winter. There is nothing you can do to stop this, because stopping it would require you to give battle, and then you die. Seriously, this is not a military problem that can be solved unless the imperial commander is secretly a traitor working for you, and even then, that most likely ends with said commander getting executed and replaced. There are diplomatic angles that can be played - A single dragon can provide absurdly valuable military assistance to a conventional army in the form of mapping and recon, a cadre allows extremely rapid and hard-to-intercept communication. You can probably parley this into protection from /someone/. But no, they will not let a micro-nation take on an empire.
