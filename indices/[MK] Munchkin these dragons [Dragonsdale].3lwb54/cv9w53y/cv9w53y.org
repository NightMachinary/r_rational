Oh man, I have a fun dragon book recommendation, but it was something I loved as a kid, so take my kid-self's recommendation with a grain of salt: Jane Yolen's Pit Dragon trilogy starting with Dragon's Blood.

But I guess dragon riding is pretty tangential. It's more like being a pokemon trainer, in a world where there are only charizards.

Anyhow, as for fighting off redcoats, the best part about having dragons is probably the excellent information about troop movements. For direct offensive application, maybe try dropping molotov cocktails on ships, supply stores, etc - though to overwhelm even basic firefighting, this would have to be pretty coordinated.
