"Mail delivery". They are quite expensive riding animals, but the travel speed, and the fact they do not care about roads means they are a good choice to carry letters and small packages. So you run a mail service, and specialize your economy around that.

.. fight a war? You don't attack the mail. That's just not on. If they insist.. well, most everyone is employed in the mail, which implies a lot of dragons... so "We fly away, relocate headquarters in a state which can see off an army that size." Because there is no way to mobilize enough troops to fight an army of 5000 professional soldiers out of a population of only 50000.
