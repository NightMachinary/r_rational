Say that again once you're read up to chapter 28. Then I think you'll agree with me more.

As an aside, they got to the top of the ranking before he started with the sabotage, and the sabotage only kept JNPR down. It didn't really seem necessary given that Jaune was still essentially mediocre with his blade and unlikely to change that at any great speed. The downsides of his strategy are... considerable.

Note, I don't think that proactive steps taken in a death world are a bad idea, and I do agree that his team's viewpoint is pretty naieve. I also, however, think that the particular steps that he took were sub-optimal. Knocking down the competition for example. Yes it gives resources, but it also reduces the quality of your sparring partners and thus weakens you. It also destroys team cohesion and trust, which are vital. Aside from that, it destroyed what could have been a powerful alliance with JNPR, which might have allowed them to learn from the best of the best.
