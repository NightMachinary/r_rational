  He has some really,really heavy PTSD. He acts like a child soldier in real life would act. When he explains his childhood to the rest of the group, that's exactly what it sounds like. Due to his history in Remnant, that's what the him who grew up there effectively is - he had to try to protect his family from age 12 onwards, and was considering it from even earlier.

Yes, but he isn't a child soldier. He's a fully grown adult surrounded by teenagers inserted into another body. It's not that I'm opposed to a character who will do anything to survive. I actually like that trope. It's that what he's doing is not in the slightest bit effective, and the SI should be able to realize that. He has plenty of strengths he should be playing to and focusing on instead.

I'm pretty sure this is intentional, other characters all react to the SI appropriately, and the author is doing it as a way of creating drama and showing the SI's flaws. I just don't like reading about a character that acts in a way that is actively detrimental to their stated goals. It's not engaging for me, just frustrating.

  The thing is, he's not wrong. He actions do work. They've kept his team on top of the rankings, earned them notoriety and preferential treatment, and from a rational long-term perspective, his team is short sighted and overly idealistic while living in what is basically a death world. They haven't internalized that, not really. Blake is the closest because of her history, but even then she still has that hint of idealism and she's only fought human(oid) opponents.

Outside of the unrelated programming stuff, none of the scheming has been remotely effective. In fact they've done the opposite of helping. His team is at the top of the rankings because they have a strong tactical leader (Ruby), an extra member, and much greater teamwork than any of the other groups. Alienating them actively works against those strengths. The only thing the Enten has done that has actually helped has been defeating Pyrhha, which also was not the result of any schemes - instead they almost resulted in his death.

Enten even states very early on that he learns the best when he has good competition; this is why he spars with Yang. He's doing his best to ensure that this sort of competition will never exist for his team. Furthermore, these aren't "potential enemies" that he's turning against him. They're fellow hunters who could save his life some time in the future.

He doesn't even have a /goal/ with his backstabbing. What resources is he trying to get that Weiss doesn't already have available to her because of her family? What political allies has he made that he couldn't have had by just being a reasonable person? Cardin?

RWBY is a death world, but it's a different kind of death world from something like Naruto; and even then the SI is acting like Sasuke, who isn't exactly popular in the fanbase.
