This is the one with the app developer, right?

It's excellent compared to other RWBY SIs, and a top tier RWBY fic, but that doesn't really mean much. The protagonist gets waaaay too stupid/amoral by the end and it's just frustrating to watch. He doesn't even achieve anything by doing edgy stuff, the writer just put it there to get random drama.

I think it's still worth reading because it's pretty good until that happens, though.
