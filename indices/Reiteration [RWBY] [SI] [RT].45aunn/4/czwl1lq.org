This is way too short, and way too generic, for me to form much of an opinion on the story.

Seriously. Chapter one is supposed to be your /hook/!

This was more like, Chapter 1, Scene 1 - 3 of 10.

I may revisit this if I see additional material posted, given that the writing was technically decent (some odd word choices. For example, "Indecently move".), but the story content with just this chapter is blah.

Edit: I somehow missed chapters 2 through 32. I'm stupid, ignore me.
