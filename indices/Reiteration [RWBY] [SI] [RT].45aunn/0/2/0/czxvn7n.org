He has some really,*really* heavy PTSD.

He acts like a child soldier in /real life/ would act. When he explains his childhood to the rest of the group, that's exactly what it sounds like. Due to his history in Remnant, that's what the him who grew up there effectively is - he had to try to protect his family from age 12 onwards, and was considering it from even earlier.

The rampant paranoia, and effective espionage skills seem to sensibly lead to the actions he takes. The fact that he's clearly unable to see the social consequences to his actions also makes sense - I'm on chapter 19, and he mellows out a lot after he reveals all of his secrets and realizes what an ass he's being.

The thing is, he's /not wrong./ He actions *do work*. They've kept his team on top of the rankings, earned them notoriety and preferential treatment, and from a rational long-term perspective, his team /is/ short sighted and overly idealistic while living in what is basically a *death world*. They haven't internalized that, not really. Blake is the closest because of her history, but even then she still has that hint of idealism and she's only fought human(oid) opponents.

Remember the history of Remnant - the reason the kingdoms are the only important places is because /intelligent omnicidal megafauna/ kill every living thing that isn't protected by magical warriors with gunswords.

I mean, if this was Naruto, nobody would even be batting an eye.

The SI is orders of magnitude less brutal than most Naruto SIs, and the world of Remnant is only slightly less of a death world than Naruto, and that's mainly because the power levels haven't ramped that high yet. If a team in naruto could choose their own missions by being top of the rankings - judging by the difference and danger between the main teams missions in that universe - you'd have to be insane not to see the need to do whatever it took to get that ability because of how much it could increase your survival chances.
