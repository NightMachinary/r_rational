Having read the rest of it - I can say that alienating Pyrrha was a /bad move/ for sure, and what he did to Jaunne was not effective for the reasons you mention, but his general distrust and paranoia seems effective as a general survival strategy when nobody else on his team seems to get it.

That whole hierachy thing is starting to strain my SoD though. Homicidal racism to the point of attempted kidnapping, a physical attack (taunt provoked perhaps, but that doesn't let you get away with assault in the real world either) leading to the elder team effectively /evicting/ them?

From a place they are technically paying for and which that team doesn't even really own?

And the only response of the administration is to put them back in what are supposed to be temporary accommodations?

I can't really blame Enten for acting like mid-late Worm Skitter. Ozpin definitely has an agenda, things are rapidly escalating out of control, and he's similarly willing to do anything to protect his friends.

He's also pretty bad at analyzing and judging the benefits of social relationships that aren't in physical or direct benefits. Like he seems to understand friendship on a basic level, but doesn't get the benefits that can come from unquestioning loyalty to friends or networking.

His overall proactive strategy is sound but his actions to JNPR were just short-sighted and dumb. He starts to realize this in the recent chapters too.
