Enjoyable to read, good prose, and hardly any munchkinry like most SIs have, so that's always a plus. I will say that if I wasn't already a fan of RWBY (and the Games We Play) I probably wouldn't be giving it this much of a chance.

About a third of the way through- I'm not going to stop reading it but honestly there hasn't been anything too attention-grabbing yet. I think the best part of it so far is the increased attention on older teams, there are intriguing characters at the least. [[#s][And Ozpin]]
