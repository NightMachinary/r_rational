Exactly. The /quality/ +quantity+ of night (harvested from other drow or . . . .) is the sin ne qua non measure of drow power; gender, either is just plumbing, or something night makes mutable enough to be irrelevant (i'm working through the altered carbon audiobooks ATM so I'm thinking gender, to billionaires who re-sleeve with impunity and can buy sleeves and psychosurgery for pocket change). Big picture night is such a overwhelming factor in Drow politics that sitting or standing to urinate is not a factor. This raises interesting/squicky questions about their sexual politics, and intimidating one's for Cat's plans to conquer/negotiate with them.

Edit: quality not quanity
