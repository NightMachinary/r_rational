To each their own. To not only be trusted with a.name like Traitorous, but to, presumably assassinate and then, impersonate his own Chancellor with nothing but a wig and a pair of cantaloupes well enough to fool the High Lords is damn impressive. Especially with the awkward question of why the Chancellor and the Emperor were suddenly no longer seen together.
