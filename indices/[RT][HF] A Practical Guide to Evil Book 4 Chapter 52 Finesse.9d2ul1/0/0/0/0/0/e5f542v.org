Nah, that was Malicia's predecessor Nefarious. Considering that the only other thing he was famous for was becoming a hikkikomori and collecting an extensive harem from all corners of the Empire, I don't think the flesh puppets were initially created for a political purpose. At least if Malicia's remark about how he had discovered early in his "research" that to build the construct with a sensitivity close to natural would be overwhelming for the senses is any indication.
