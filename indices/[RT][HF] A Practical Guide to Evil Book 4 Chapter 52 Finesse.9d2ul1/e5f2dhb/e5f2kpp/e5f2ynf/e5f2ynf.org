OK, I see what you're saying--I mistook "cattle" to be synonymous with "meat," when it actually refers to non-drow. So when they said "cattle has no gender," they meant "humans/etc have no gender, so it doesn't make sense to ask me what gender I'd be if I were human." That clears up that line, but still leaves me with questions:

1. If Mighty have no gender, isn't "I am no longer Mighty" a non sequitur response to "what's your gender"?

2. Why are gendered terms "cattle-terms?" They acknowledge that humans use gendered terms but not that they have genders?

3. If drow never have gender, why say "cattle has no gender" as if that sets non-drow apart? If anything, shouldn't humans being gendered be part of what others them/makes them "non-people" from the drows' perspective?

Also, Ivah implies there is another tier of drow between "meat" and "Mighty." I wonder what that tier's deal is, genderwise.
