I'd differ with this. They are native to this plane; +elves are not+, and hence are extra-+dimensional+ /continental/ horrors. Considering what we just learned of drow this implies *a lot* about the elves.

Edit: I was wrong. Well I guess now the question is are they related somehow? Though I will not be surprised if elves are extradimensiuonal in the almost fae sense.
