I'm confused about the gender thing. Ivah denies having a gender because they're no longer Mighty, and they subsequently elaborate that "cattle has no gender." But later on they say that "priestess" is a "cattle-term," and this is supposedly because it's gendered and Mighty aren't gendered. I can't seem to resolve the apparent contradiction between lines that imply "only Mighty are gendered," "cattle are not gendered," "only cattle are gendered," and "Mighty are not gendered." Did I misunderstand something?
