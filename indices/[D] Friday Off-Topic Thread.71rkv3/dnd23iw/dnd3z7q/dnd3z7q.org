You might want to try something that's roleplay-adjacent, like taking an improv class (if they're available where you live). Trying to jump feet-first into roleplaying and learn all the creative stuff on the fly seems like it would make the roleplaying less fun and the learning stuff much harder.

In my experience, it also helps to have some rapport with the people you're playing with, which means either playing with people who are already friends, or playing with people who aren't friends for long enough that they become friends. I find roleplaying (and DMing) a lot more difficult if I'm having any trouble feeding off of the other players.

(If you have a really great DM, then you don't need to think in narratives, because they'll weave all the narrative stuff for you. Just make a consistent character and the rest will be done for you. There are a lot of crap DMs out there though, and a lot of people run adventure paths or modules, which aren't conducive to that.)
