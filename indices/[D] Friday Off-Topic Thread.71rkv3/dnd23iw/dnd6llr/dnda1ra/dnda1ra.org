I liked Shadowrun Returns so I know I'd enjoy playing in the setting, but I'm not a fan of the tabletop game's mechanics. I'd rather just use FATE so I'd have fewer numbers to keep track of and less likelihood of survival being based purely on luck. I'm just not the kind of person who enjoys that style of play.
