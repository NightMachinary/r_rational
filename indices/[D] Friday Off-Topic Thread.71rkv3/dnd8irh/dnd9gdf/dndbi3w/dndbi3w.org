I don't necessarily think it is always bait. I think a lot of people honestly and unintentionally are just bad at arguing/debating, and don't realize when they strawman the opposition or put words in their mouth, and it takes way too much time and effort getting them to see that once people start yelling insults (at which point leaving is probably the right decision)
