What do you hope to accomplish? This is great if you want a low-effort/high-gain throw-shit-into-the-fan kind of thing, as it is mildly patronizing and insulting as is, more so once you've used it for some time and your opponents realize you don't even bother to type it out, and just copy/paste canned responses. I suggest making it into a picture with text '[[https://www.google.ru/search?q=meme+animals][meme animal]]'-style for greater damage.

If you actually want to diffuse the situation, just quietly leaving is probably the best option.
