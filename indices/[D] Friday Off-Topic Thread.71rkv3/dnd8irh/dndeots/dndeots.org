If you've ever had, ah, "discussions" with people /in person/ that aren't interested in having an actual conversation (you know, the kind where both parties try to learn something from the other person)...

You know, like the crazy uncle who insists on repeating all the talking points he's heard on NPR or FOX or whatever he listens to; and thinks if he repeats them often enough and loud enough he'll eventually win?

... you'll know that sometimes it just isn't possible to course correct a conversation. On the other hand, if you have someone who is willing to learn and admit when they're wrong... well, you also know that the internet isn't very conducive to that sort of conversation.

I would suspect that a canned response is a poor approach, but that having such a strategy in mind is a plus, as it can be tailored to the particular conversation. And while asking someone to summarize your views certainly seems reasonable, I would suggest that simultaneous to doing so, you summarize the other person's views as well, as honestly as you can. If you can't or won't, it would seem rather one sided and unfair of you to make the demand.

I've been thinking lately about how to manage time-lapse conversations online. Threaded, like reddit? Or linear, like other forums? The problem is that conversations kind of form a partial-ordering instead of a total ordering. This one piece of a conversation goes between two others, but isn't really related to this third, although that one also fits in with the surrounding structure... It's kind of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order][lattice structure]]). But how in the world do you represent something like that on a webpage? I suppose this is really a problem for UX design, which is not my specialty.
