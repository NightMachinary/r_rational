... Don't talk with assholes?

I don't know; I'm guessing this is about the 10-pages debate on the Monday political thread; I don't have any advice, since I stay away from those (and, well, any thread about politics started by eaturbrainz or trekie140).

Really, it's contextual. Sometimes people are open to good faithed discussion; sometimes people are closed, but you can get them to a healthier place; sometimes /you're/ the one who's in an unhealthy place, and you can't discuss a subject without distorting things. Sometimes people just want to pick a fight.
