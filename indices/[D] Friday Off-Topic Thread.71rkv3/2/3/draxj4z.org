I would second the "try some improv stuff". It won't necessarily get you there (AFAIK, most of improv is about absurdity and escalation, which doesn't pair well with solid drama).

I'd also say: keep in mind that "play" is "non-goaled exploration of an activity space", and RPGs are in a narrative activity space. Does that feeling of pressure come from time, or a need to produce good stuff?

Can you tell me more about the kinds of problems you see yourself having as a roleplayer?

Can you tell me more about the people you're tried playing D&D with? (AKA, you may not be the problem)

PS - Check out "Actual Plays" on RPG net, and look for the high-star rating stuff, /particularly/ anything by "DaveB".
