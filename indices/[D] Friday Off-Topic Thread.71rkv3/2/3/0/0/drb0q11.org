Nah.

Realize that "play" is "non-goal'ed exploration". Try shit, see what happens; just keep that meta-level of observation going, so you can "take notes", as it were. Your problem, sounds to me, is that you are trying to succeed. Don't - try to explore, instead. Does that make sense?

I did an improv activity at (of all places) RubyConf: The exercise was that we were two old friends reminiscing (of course, we were not old friends, and we were making shit up). I noticed that what worked really well was to take whatever the other people handed me ("...in Seattle"), add a /single/ new detail "...on the Space Needle"), and then hand back the proverbial mic. Plus one detail, hand back; plus one detail, hand back.

Maybe the more general "rule" could be: Add a /single/ thing, and then look for a way to invite another character to take the reigns.
