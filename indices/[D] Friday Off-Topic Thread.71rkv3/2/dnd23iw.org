It has occurred to me that I'm a crappy roleplayer and I'm not sure how to get better. I don't like D&D and it's hard to find people who want to play something else. I was happy to finally play Lasers & Feelings on Discord yesterday, but my character wasn't very good and I'm not sure if I can do better.

I think I have the same problem as I do with writing, I don't know how to think in narratives and my imagination doesn't work under pressure. That makes me think I shouldn't play narrativist games, except I don't find simulationist games fun.

I know you're supposed to learn creativity from experience, but if I don't already find the game /fun/ then why would I play it? I don't want to have the same "admire from a distance" relationship with tabletop games as I do with video games.
