  If anyone has any insight as to how to maintain two separate branches, letting them merge into one another while keeping at least one branch-2-only commit on that branch and only on that branch, I'd much appreciate your wisdom. At the moment I'm manually merging things and I just know there's got to be a more painless way to do it.

Have a =common= branch that contains all version-agnostic commits, and branches =v6= and =v7=, with commits specific to corresponding versions. Whenever making a version-specific change, commit to corresponding version branch. Whenever making version-agnostic change, commit to =common=, then merge it into each version-specific branch. If you are careful, no conflicts should be introduced (beyond the initial setup), thus allowing automatic merge.
