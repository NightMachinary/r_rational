Replying here to [[/u/gbear605]] 's comment, since it doesn't seem to be showing up (hope you're not shadowbanned, bro, but the mods apparently can't see anything either).

#+begin_quote
  How do you actually resolve circular references like "A loads before B loads before C loads before A?" It seems to me that the only acceptable solution would be to not load.
#+end_quote

That's what it does by default, yes. I've included a debug setting that will attempt to load it anyway in the order that was generated by DFS (which tends to be the same as the acyclical version so long as the "last" and "first" nodes are the ones causing the loop), but other than that, yeah, it's a failure state. I just mostly wanted to be able to detect and meaningfully report on it more than just generating a list with giants holes in it like Kahn's did (Kahn's would ignore all mods in a loop, and /all mods that depended on those mods/, which artificially inflated the potential problem space).
