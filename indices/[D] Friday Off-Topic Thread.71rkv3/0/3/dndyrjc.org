  Curious what you guys think. The first one I've come up with so far is this:

I don't think that's going to work.

Look, the thing about an online discussion is, it's like a real discussion, everyone makes up the rules. And like in real discussion, sometimes people "bend the rules" or impose their own bended rules, and others accept it (google "Justify-Argue-Defend-Explain")

The trick to finding satisfaction in a discussion with people that are sometimes unreasonable, is to draw your rules/boundaries, and stand by them. Don't try to win at others people's games; if you want to compromise with other people, find rules that you feel you can both accept; if you can't find common rules, then you can't communicate; move on and hope the next gal you talk with will be more reasonable.

I'm using very abstract terms because social rules usually take the form of unspoken social-fu; everyone has different rules, and usually you try to enforce your rules "softly"; it's pretty rude to stop a conversation and go "Alright, I don't like what you're saying, so from now on I want you to only make arguments based on X, otherwise I'm out"; but sometimes people go "Could you please not use this type of argument? I think it's offensive", etc.

Anyway, as an introverted nerd, the trick that made me less socially awkward was to realize that social rules are subjective and informal. You don't strictly have to respect them, but it's rude to completely disregard someone else's preferences. At the same time, you absolutely don't have to argue the way other people /want/ you to argue. If you feel you're not being taken seriously, you're absolutely allowed to say "I feel you're not taking me seriously, that's pretty rude". If you think someone missed the point of your argument, you're absolutely allowed to say "Okay, this is interesting, but my initial argument was X, and I don't think you're addressing it".

Keeping in mind, again, that you can never impose social rules on people who don't accept them. You can try to argue better, you can try to understand someone's perspective, but sometimes it's just not worth the effort. If someone is being rude on purpose and you're arguing harder to compensate, you're enabling them.
