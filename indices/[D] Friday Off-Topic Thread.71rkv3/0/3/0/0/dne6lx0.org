Oh boy. Um.

Alright, keeping in mind that I'm not exactly Doctor House, and this just my observations as someone who had to climb out of Nerd Social Awkwardness:

#+begin_quote
  Your example of enforcing rules softly seems like a tonal difference more than anything, no?
#+end_quote

Yes and no. There, your problems are solved!

But yes, I think your stock response could be put less formally; something like "I'm sorry, I don't think you understood my point. Just for the sake of the debate, what did you think I meant when I said X?"

Otherwise, from what you said, it sounds like your "target audience" is people who are not actively trolling you, but are still arguing in bad faith out of habit / irrationality / whatever.

When arguing with people who fit that profile, my go-to "tricks" are:

- Signaling that you're not an enemy

- Explicitly challenging implicit assumptions

I strongly remember people shaking me out of arguing in bad faith using the second one (like, there are people who argued like that and made me be less of an asshole forever).

--------------

Signaling plays a strong part in avoiding straw-manning. It's the "I'm not a racist but -" trick; if you don't want people to assume that you have position X, you start off by showing, explicitly or implicitly, that you don't have position X. If you want to argue for stricter immigration laws, you start off with something like "I want to insist that immigrant as individuals are not bad people; it's perfectly reasonable for them to want to travel to richer countries to feed their families and stuff; but, it's still something we need to oppose as a country because -".

If you want to appeal to Republicans, you say that "They are people who feel that the government has let them down, nobody worries about their futures" except you fuck up and because of the way you phrase it everyone just remembers the "basket of undesirables" part because fuck quoting what politicians say in context, and you know what, fuck politics.

Personally speaking, I know I have a tendency to do the opposite; like, I make subtle / ambiguous points when I could be perfectly clear; and in retrospect I realize I've been baiting people into misunderstanding what I was saying. It's a bad habit.

--------------

Challenging assumptions is... I don't know how to describe it. In my head, it's The Ultimate Technique of Perfect Epistemology. It's when you analyze what someone says, and instead of answering their point, you say something like "I assume when you said X, you meant Y? I disagree with Y", where Y is a steel-manned version of what you think the other person means.

Basically, steel-manning people challenges them, because it forces them to not perceive you as an ignorant that must be convinced, and instead perceive you as someone who understands what they think, and still disagrees.

So yeah, steel-manning is good, but it's not just that; it's one of the things I think of when I say "don't play by someone else's rules". Basically, it's debating on your own terms; realizing that the "rules" don't have to be determined by arcane unspoken word jousting, and you can just say "I think X isn't important, Y is important, let's talk about Y instead".

It's a double bonus, because [1] it makes you sound persuasive [2] it means the conversation actually shifts from stuff you don't care about to stuff you care about.

--------------

Then again, I'm not so sure. The thing with implicit social norms is that you're never sure what you're seeing. Maybe I'm wrong and everything I just said doesn't work and you'll end up looking like an asshole if you try to apply it; disclaimer aside, I've empirically seen people be convinced like that, and I feel pretty confident that none of this is "take yourself too seriously and sound like a pick up artist" bad advice.

Also, talking on the internet cool because you have time to think about what you say, edit your posts, do research, and not let yourself be baited into discussion you'll regret.
