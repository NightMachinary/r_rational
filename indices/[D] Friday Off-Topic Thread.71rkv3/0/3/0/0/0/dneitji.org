I agree with all your points, but I don't know that they particularly apply to a conversation that enters the failure mode the above stock response is trying to address. If I could put a label on the problem I think I'm trying to solve with this stock response, it's something like:

"Some people have bad reading comprehension (either in general or in particular moments) and I shouldn't ignore that when I see it and hope I can just overcome it by being more eloquent: I should try to make sure they demonstrate good faith/capability, and if they can't, give up so I don't get more and more frustrated."

So signalling that I'm not the enemy, while a good general strategy, does not work if they continue to twist my arguments or ignore vital parts of them, and me explicitly challenging their implicit assumptions, while also great, still only channels the conversation toward a particular point that, ultimately, needs to be discussed, which may then have the same failure mode occur.

Does that make sense?
