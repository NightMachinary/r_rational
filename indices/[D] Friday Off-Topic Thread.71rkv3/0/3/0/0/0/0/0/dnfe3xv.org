Well that thread wasn't so bad actually, I don't feel like I really got drawn into any craziness at least.

But yes, sometimes the context or person are just not open to anything, and sometimes my own behavior is at least partially at fault. This is just an attempt to set up a stop-gap so I can better recognize the situation without contributing negatively or wasting time.
