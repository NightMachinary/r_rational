  If someone is being rude on purpose and you're arguing harder to compensate, you're enabling them.

Yes, that's what I mean by "I get upset with myself for taking the bait." It's not about imposing rules on others who don't accept them, it's about setting a hard standard that's easy to understand (in this case, attack my argument, not a strawman or misrepresentation of it) and if that at the very least is not respected, then I know it's not a conversation that can be salvaged.

Your example of enforcing rules softly seems like a tonal difference more than anything, no? So if I reworded the response to be softer in that respect do you think it would be more effective, or are you mostly just objecting to the idea behind it?
