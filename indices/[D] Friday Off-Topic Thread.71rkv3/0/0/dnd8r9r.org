My strategy is to just leave those comment threads and let the other person have the last word. This is a little bit impolite, but a great sanity saver so I'm not tempted to dive back in after I try to post a message meant to take me out of the conversation. Odds are if you leave a message trying to bow out the other person will get the last word anyway.
