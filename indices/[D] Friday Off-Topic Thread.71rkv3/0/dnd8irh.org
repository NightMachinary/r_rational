So I've committed myself to writing a series of stock responses as part of a Trigger Action Plan to use in any online discussion that I feel is getting out of hand and entering a "death spiral" from which constructive, reasonable debate is unlikely. This is as much in an effort to restrain my own temptation into that death spiral as anything, since I've often been upset with myself for "taking the bait" or letting conversations go astray when I should have nipped such problems in the bud as soon as I saw them.

Curious what you guys think. The first one I've come up with so far is this:

"Hey, so it looks from my perspective as though you just tried to summarize my arguments or assert what I believe in a way that doesn't match what I've said. In my experience this is unproductive to useful discourse, and one of the situations that tends to upset me, leading to a downward spiral from which productive conversation becomes nearly impossible. Please attempt to re-read what I've said so far and accurately repeat back what you believe my main argument/assertion/belief is before we continue the discussion.

Thank you!"

Edit:

Suggestions to just stop talking with the person, while appreciated, is not really the aim here: if I stopped talking with everyone who I thought was bad at arguing, I wouldn't argue with practically anyone online, which might be a net benefit for myself (I do feel I learn a lot from such arguments, even ones that go bad) but I don't think is a net benefit in general.

The usual response I see when someone's argument is being misrepresented is them trying to correct the other person then continuing the discussion, and the other person ignoring the correction and just addressing the new discussion, which leads to further conflict. The idea here is to stop myself from attempting to correct them and continue the discussion, since it so rarely works, and trying something else to course correct before things get to a really toxic point.
