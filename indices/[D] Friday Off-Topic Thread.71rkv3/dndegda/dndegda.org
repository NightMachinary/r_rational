So, got in a discussion with [[/u/summerspeaker]] that eventually included the words:

#+begin_quote
  As much as baselines do have souls filled with utterly disgusting amounts of entropy-wear, they're what we all came from, so they've got rights too.
#+end_quote

The thing being, this roughly expresses how I felt about the Rosh haShanah sermon/speech I had to endure yesterday. It was about Resilience, and making ourselves Stronger in the face of Loss. Problem was, it played up /fucking/ Sheryl Sandberg (yeah, the Facebook one) as its example.

Like, it came after 2016-2017, and it played Sheryl Sandberg for a theme of /resilience/?

Besides which, as we'd say here, if resilience is so great, how come we never get out some nice truncheons and go beat everyone over the head until they become more resilient? Maybe murder every second toddler so the families learn Resilience?

It seems absurd when you try to treat Resilience as a terminally valuable thing, and worse, it's practically an insult to those of us who've lost things or suffered and /never yet/ fully overcome it. I've got a friend in a wheelchair basically for life, and another who walks with a cane, has a pain disorder in her nerves, /and/ suffers psychologically -- she's too poor for the /good/ doctors.

What is Resilience supposed to say to that?

It occurred to me: [[http://anthro.palomar.edu/religion/rel_1.htm][oh, the social function of religion is to explain suffering]]. The older these (mostly older) people in this audience get, the more they want to hear religious narratives about Resilience because /their souls are disgustingly worn-down by Entropy/. Like, they're talking this stuff up because the Lone Power's got Its hooks in them, and they don't want to confront that, let alone actually struggle actively against It.

This kinda explains to me why I tend to have trouble /feeling/ anything about religious or spiritual things. The rare occasions when I /do/ feel something, it's not from a comfortable feeling that I've had the actually-existing world neatly explained as a product of God's plan. It's from [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Awesome/YoungWizards][stuff more like this]]: I actually cannot read [[#s][/So You Want to be a Wizard/]] or [[#s][/Book of Night with Moon/]] without tearing up a little.

Seems kinda relevant to other people here, since the whole lot of us are the basic sort who did or would have immediately taken the Wizard's Oath as a child, and who, introduced to the concept, think of the Lone Power as someone to be combated and driven out, Its "gifts" rejected out-of-hand.
