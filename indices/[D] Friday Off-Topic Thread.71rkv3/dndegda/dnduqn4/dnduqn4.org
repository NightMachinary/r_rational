I also tear up and get a spiritual high from reading Young Wizards, but it's because it resonates with that narrative I have of building up resilience from suffering. They are stories about confronting despair and darkness with the full knowledge that you will eventually succumb to it, then choosing to keep fighting anyway to prevent the suffering of others.

My favorite tv series of all time is Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood for the same reason, "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger" is an appealing theme that helps put me in a mindset to overcome the suffering I endure. I don't think admiring or focusing on people who have become stronger from suffering is /necessarily/ disrespectful of those who haven't.

When I'm having a anxiety attack or depressive episode, I don't want to hear about the people who've faced similar obstacles and failed to overcome them because that makes me afraid that I will fail as well. I need to hear about the success stories so I can hold out hope. There are times where I felt I couldn't live up to the example and despaired more, but those have become much rarer as a I get better.

The case in point for me is Bojack Horseman. The series is a fantastic portrayal of living with self-loathing, the mindset that traps people in it, and how futile escaping it can be. However, seeing Bojack make one bad decision after another just made me feel more disheartened about my own self-loathing. Bojack seemed like the person I could become and I didn't know how to stop it from happening.

It's the same reason Rick & Morty's nihilism can make it hard to watch at times and why I couldn't bring myself to finish Worm, I need to remind myself that looking at the world in that way will turn me into an emotionally dead husk. Bojack didn't get me through the worst depressive episodes of my life, /K-On!/ and /Yuri on Ice!!/ did. They made me feel like I could live through it all.

It was when The Mixed Six did a bit about identity as a performance, "I am only what I pretend to be so I must be careful what I pretend to be", that it all clicked and I figured out how to keep trying even when I felt like giving up. I'm not sure if it's a solution that would work for everyone, or even one I'm capable of teaching to others, but it's what has kept me going even when the depression is still there in the back of my mind.

I don't think that's disrespectful towards those who have turned out worse that I have. If anything, I'm starting to question whether telling stories about people who ultimately failed ends up turning their suffering into a spectacle for others. Stories like Jessica Jones and the Night Angel Trilogy turned surviving trauma into an act of heroism, and ultimately made me care for those who've suffered worse that I more than I already did.
