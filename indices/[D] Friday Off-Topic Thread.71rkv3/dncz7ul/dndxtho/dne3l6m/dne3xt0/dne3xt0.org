Short answer: that kind of reasoning isn't good practice for gamedev. Game development is first and foremost a logistic exercise, where you have an objective (make a video game), a limited amount of resources (ex: your free time), and a million possible failure points.

"It could be useful" is true for any potential feature; what I'm asking is "Is it likely to be worth the effort, given other games and package managers as examples?"
