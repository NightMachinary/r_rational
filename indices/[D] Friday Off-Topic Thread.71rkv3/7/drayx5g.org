I'm addicted to listening to actual plays, I just don't know how to replicate that creativity. The pressure comes from wanting to create something good, but having to go with the first thing that pops into my head that usually isn't very good.

All the characters I've played have either been robotic with very little dialogue and agency, or Morty. Literally anytime my character is thrown into a situation where I don't know how they react, they just turn into Morty and grind the story to a halt.

I don't like Rick and Morty all that much, cynicism is just where my mind goes when I can't think of anything and I stop paying attention to what personality they have. It's unpleasant for me and other people because of how I suddenly become The Load.

The best experience I ever had role playing was as a parody of Alex Luis Armstrong, who managed to have useful skills while letting me ham it up. I couldn't always think of a funny line, but they weren't annoying and had a consistent personality for others to bounce off of.

It makes me think I should stick to characters that are supposed to have either little personality or low intelligence so I can just be a rock that other people respond to. I'm still worried about whether I can keep that up, though, since they'll still turn into Morty if I can't think of anything to do.
