I worry a lot about "mansplaining".

Like, my son has a lot of trouble with the final consonant in any consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) syllable, which means that "book" and "boot" both come out as "boo" (or, sometimes, "boo", then a long pause, and then "kuh"). His pronunciation is a lot like you would expect of a Japanese speaker learning English, because Japanese (almost) exclusively uses a CV structure for their syllables (e.g. "su-shi" or "o-ri-ga-mi" or "ki-mo-no"). His first multisyllable word was "blueberry", and I'm pretty sure that's because he could pronounce it with all open syllables (i.e. "blu-beh-ri").

And anyway, this is something that I've been geeking out on, because I find it super interesting, and if I talk to someone (especially someone with kids, as often happens at the park) it seems like a thing that I might bring up, because again, I find it to be super interesting. And even if it wasn't that specific thing, a lot of what I want to talk about with other people is based on sharing things /like/ this.

But since a lot of my random social interactions are with parents (I'm a stay-at-home dad these days), that means a lot of my social interactions are with women, and I get nervous and worried that if I talk about the things that I want to talk about, it's going to come off as this gendered condescension or like I have some intent beyond just trying to have a conversation.

And I don't know how much the other person knows about whatever I'm interested in that day, which means there's more indecision, because I don't want to spell things out if it's obvious to them, and I don't want to go shorthand if that's going to make it seem like I'm talking over them, and I don't know what to do about that either.

So I mostly try to just keep my head down and not talk to people that much.
