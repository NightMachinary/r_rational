Um... it sounds like you worry too much? (man, I did not expect to ever say that to you)

Did people/women ever react negatively when you were having one of these conversations? How often?

  and I don't want to go shorthand if that's going to make it seem like I'm talking over them, and I don't know what to do about that either.
#+end_quote

I'm sorry if that's too obvious, but have you tried "Do you know what [shorthand] means? Cool, so then... / Okay, so [shorthand] is when..."

I do it all the time and it's usually pretty smooth.
