I wouldn't actually call it a speech problem /yet/, because he's 19 months old and more or less on track developmentally; it's likely that this difficulty will disappear on its own in a few months time. (I'm trying my best not to be one of those parents that analyzes everything their child does to compare it against developmental milestones, because I think that can create some unnecessary anxiety.)

This only other peculiarity of his speech thus far is that his first consonant was [k], which was all he had for a long time, and his first two words were both [k]-onset words. Usually kids will correctly articulate [b], [d], [m], [w], and [h] first. I'm not really sure /why/ he had a (somewhat) offbeat first consonant, but it probably has to do with how his brain was wiring itself up, or maybe how his experiments with mouth shapes hit on a solution space.
