That's really interesting, especially as my speech issues are in the exact opposite direction. I have no problem with closed syllables, but vowels annihilate me. When I speak Japanese, I truncate all my words so I don't have to add those dreaded vowel endings ("watash wa ien kotob g' ar" is a good approximation of a typical sentence for me) . Does your son have any other speech problems? I've never heard of something so specific.
