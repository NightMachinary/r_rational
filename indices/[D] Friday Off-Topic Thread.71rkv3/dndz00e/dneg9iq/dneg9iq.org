Well, if you're /very/ concerned, I would say to save your enthusiasm for people that you've already constructed some sort of basic relationship with. Like enough of one that you can reasonably expect them to know you're not trying to "mansplain" anything.

Truly, however, I think mansplaining is all about the way you explain things. It's about the somewhat implicit condescension that can come across when a man tries to explain something to a woman. Sort of like saying "I know you're just a girl, so you probably won't get this but..." before your actual sentence. Though it's obviously more subtle than that usually.

But I highly doubt you have anything to be concerned about. You're going to be discussing your kid's progress and learning with other parents. That's basically talking shop. You'll be fine.
