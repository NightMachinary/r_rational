  I worry a lot about "mansplaining".... And I don't know how much the other person knows about whatever I'm interested in that day
#+end_quote

I too, feel this - I'm excited and knowledgable about something, and I just want to /share/... So, I started trying to ask more questions of the form "how much do you know about X?". A backup question is something of the form "I would like to commiserate about X".

Other tricks for avoiding mansplaining: - Try to not condescend. Easy way: If you feel superior to the other person, stop talking - Look for opportunities to stop talking, so the other person can start.

Basically, mansplaining occurs IFF also sexism, which requires both feelings of superiority, and functional inequality. So, directly address both: remove yourself from situations where you're feeling that superiority, and, provide plenty of opportunities for the other person to act with equality.

PS1 - If you don't want to spell out something that's obvious to them, ask what they know about X.

PS2 - At some point it's their feelings and their responsibility. Kudos to you for caring, but realize you probably can't do anything about it anyway.

PS3 - That's super interesting about syllable structure! Can you tell me more? Do you have any ideas about /why/ your son has this behavior?
