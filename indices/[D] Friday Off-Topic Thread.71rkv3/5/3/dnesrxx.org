I think the fact that you /are/ concerned is a good sign that you won't do this. Just be sure you're giving the other person room to talk and you should be fine!

EG., "My kid does this funny thing. What about yours?"

That said, I hope you're taking this opportunity (of having a small child) to do more linguistics experiments with him! The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Berko_Gleason#Children.27s_learning_of_English_morphology.E2.80.8D.E2.80.94.E2.80.8Cthe_Wug_Test][Wug Test]] is a really neat one.
