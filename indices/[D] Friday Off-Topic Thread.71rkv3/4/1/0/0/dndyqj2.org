I'd read it. Sounds a bit like Night Angel and...I think Sword Art Online: Abridged. I mean, the former was about people holding on to their humanity despite going through hell and constantly staring into the abyss of despair, but the latter features characters who are insecure assholes going through arcs where they learn to care about others and manage to achieve self actualization. Huh.
