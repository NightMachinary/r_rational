Oh damn. My life is packed. Things are OK with The Woman, but distant, but closing? She's explicitly stating that she wants to spend more time with me and we had a really, really amazing platonic date somewhere in there, but December got super packed super fast so we really haven't been able to, and I think she's bummed about that.

October and November were crazy sauce. So much happened in my life, and I gather /a lot/ happened in hers, but we're not talking enough for me to really find out. Partly that's time, partly that's what she doesn't want to talk about (so I'm not prying) and what I don't want to talk about (so I'm not pushing). I'm pretty sure she's a fan of me holding those boundaries (for her, and for me).

(You know that thing where people are all "dude when I was twenty a year laster forever and now that I'm thirty they go by so fast"? I do not have that. In spades. Hyperbolically, I've lived more in the past month than any year of my teens.)

I've also had piles of emotional realizations (a lot of it triggered by Finally Getting It(tm) from reading metoo accounts and related), and I think she was going through some shit (possible a break-up with a long term relationship? btw, this whole situation is poly). She's definitely happier recently than she was back in October, but I don't know enough to speculate as to why.

This was a bit rambly. We're doing some group activities in the next few days, and she's invited over to explicitly share Horizon Zero Dawn with me, but scheduling in the holidays means that can't happen till Jan :/

Sooo check in again mid Jan?
