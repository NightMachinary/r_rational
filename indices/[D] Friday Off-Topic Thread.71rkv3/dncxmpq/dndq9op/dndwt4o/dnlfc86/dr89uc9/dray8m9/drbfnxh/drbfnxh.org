  October and November were crazy sauce. So much happened in my life, and I gather a lot happened in hers, but we're not talking enough for me to really find out. Partly that's time, partly that's what she doesn't want to talk about (so I'm not prying) and what I don't want to talk about (so I'm not pushing). I'm pretty sure she's a fan of me holding those boundaries (for her, and for me).
