I concur with [[/u/alexanderwales]], but I also think you can't really separate out love from the commitment expectancies. Where's that damn quote?

  Love at first sight doesn't exist. Love takes time, and love takes work.

Yeah, /that/ Garnet. The wife has me watching /Steven Universe/. I can feel the Tumblr-ness leaking out of the screen.

But she's got a point. Relationships really are about commitment. They're about being able to expect that someone's /got you/ and you've /got them/, even when stuff's about as hard as life ever gets. You can't separate that from the "love word".

Psychological and emotional states /about relationships/ need to have intentional content about the causal processes that constitute the relationship, or you're Garnet's lovesick fool.
