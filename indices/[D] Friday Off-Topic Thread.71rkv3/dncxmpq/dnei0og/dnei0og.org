Okay. Maybe I'm just going crazy. But I read a [[https://nikvetr.wordpress.com/2016/02/23/what-is-love/][blog post written by nikvetr on his wordpress]] about defining love just now.

That's not the crazy part.

The crazy part is I could've sworn that I got the link to that specific post from a comment in this thread like...half an hour ago, at most. Yet I come back after reading it to upvote and leave a comment and I can't find the comment anywhere. I've been up and down this page three times.

Anyone got any idea where I got this from? I'm hoping this is just a symptom of my usual lack of attention to detail. T_T
