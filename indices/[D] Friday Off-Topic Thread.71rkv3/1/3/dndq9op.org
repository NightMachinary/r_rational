I'm currently completely in love with someone. It doesn't feel like anything I've ever felt before (maybe 70% overlap with some other special cases). It is amazing and occasionally terrifying.

One of the things that is occurring is immediate happiness when looking at her (or picture of her). Usually there's some intermediate emotion, or I can feel the reprogramming happening; not this time. There's no intermediate emotion; there's barely even the "recognition that it's this person" step. I bring up visual memories, and it's not "and this was a good experience". It's just her face, and I'm happy.

A thing I've identified but never felt this way before is the degree to which I appreciate her nth-meta level. There's the person before you, there's the person they're becoming. There's the person guiding that change; repeat this pattern to the nth derivative. I feel like we're having a conversation as far up that nth-derivation as I can glimpse

I've been asking a lot of people what the conceptual relationship is between "emotionally intimate", "sexually intimate" and "romantically intimate" is. Seems like "romance" is a supercategory containing the other two, and additional, unidentified elements. One friend answers that "romance" is the synergy effect between however many categories/attributes you're paying attention too.

I haven't been in a loving-friends-with-benefits situation, so I can't really compare. I imagine it's the difference between not being bothered by the little things and finding all the little things /amazing/.
