Yes, that. /That/. I would not, however, call that commitment; "I cannot promise what is already true.". In reading "More Than Two", I'm also thinking of the phrase "I want my life to be disrupted by you."

An image popped into my head:

Model me as a filled circle in existential state space. There's an overlap I have with this other human. As I grow, so does my existential "circle"; modeled with time as the third dimension, forms a cone.

The cones continue to overlap. At some time T, everything I was at some prior time T-t is contained in the other human; but now there's more of me, that has yet to be overlapped.
