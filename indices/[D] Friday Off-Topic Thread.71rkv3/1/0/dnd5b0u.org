For me, the biggest difference is the /internal feeling/ of commitment, even if that commitment isn't public, implied, monogamous, or reciprocated.

There's kind of a temporary quality to a friends-with-benefits thing, even if it's a long-time friend. I've done the friends-with-benefits thing a few times, and it was always with a sort of "yes, that was fun, let's do it again" quality to it, like it's a hobby that I enjoy but which isn't integral to my being.

Whereas romantic love is more the feeling of integrating (or wanting to integrate) someone into my life. I've been married for about six years now, and we were dating for another three years before that, and before /that/ we were close friends with benefits. I think for me it slowly changed from "I like spending time with you, talking about things, and having sex" to "I want the essence of my being to be muddled with yours".

(This is at least how it feels to me. Conversations with other people have revealed that, to them, there is no internal feeling of what I would call love, romance is /just/ a combination of sex, friendship, and some essentially-social-contract stuff.)
