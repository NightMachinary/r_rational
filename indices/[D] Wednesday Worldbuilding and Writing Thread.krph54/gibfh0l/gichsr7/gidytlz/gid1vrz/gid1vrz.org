So, last November, I wrote a thing for NaNo. It's 53kish words, and it's maybe 2/3 of the way to a first-draft-done state (entire plot-loadbearing scenes are just "TODO, this thing happens".)

Finishing it would be a big investment of time. So I'm looking for alpha readers to let me know if there's enough /there/ there to be worth finishing. Ideally what I'd like is people who love the idea and maybe also the voice (which owes some fealty to Graydon Saunders, I hate to admit) but are critical about the execution (especially on a big-picture/structural level).

Elevator pitch: it's an urban fantasy novel set in November of 2020, but what it's about is what it means to have power and not be allowed to use it, what it's like to relearn how much there is to learn in the world, and how awesome people can be to get to know and learn to love, in all the ways people love each other.

The MC is a married dude in his thirties. He, his wife, and their 1-year-old daughter are moving to San Francisco because they've had enough of Washington DC, and wind up staying in a group house with a bunch of wizards, a couple paladins, and a young woman who's actually an eldritch abomination.
