Hmm, given cyberpunk is basically gritty techno dystopia, it'd be interesting to write a world where long-distance communication and transit was significantly harder, so even if things went down the path of dystopic societies across the globe (something something humans suck? Or maybe just turn the 'common and accessible fuel source causes irreparable negative externalities that aren't addressed' up to 11), the individual dystopias are all significantly culturally distinct between places. So you'd have your cyberpunk hellscape as its own country-thing, a steampunk one, a biopunk one, etc.
