Literally use a random word generator and put "-punk" after it, and you'll have one.

Doing this now using 5 from [[https://randomwordgenerator.com/]] , I got:

- Acceptablepunk: A very gray generic suburbian experience of eternal failed potential, a feeling of being left behind and stagnation.

- Partypunk: Like cyberpunk, but going REALLY heavy on the drugs and neon, as well as taking the decadence flaws that normally are only applied to the rich in cyberpunk instead applied to the whole population via post scarcity automation. Also explores toxic positivity.

- Hikepunk: A nomadic and outdoorsy but non the less technologically advanced civilization, extrapolating MallNinjaShit and prepper bunker to an entire society. Highly focused on survival and post apocalyptic; in fact, just take any generic post apocalyptic setting and give everyone the high tech new and clean gear via some macguffin fabricator technology and you're close.

- Debtpunk: This is just normal cyberpunk isn't it? maybe a bit less neon and a bit more grey, with a prison aesthetic?

- Thronepunk: The 40k imperium, but with more complex interplay betwen multiple royalties, and heavy prince-ness-proliferation like in saudi arabia
