Debtpunk brings to mind a grimdark version of the late 17th-early 18th century England. The social conditions of the post-South Sea Bubble, except much more severe and permanent.

For the random word generator, I got:

- Moodpunk: Aesthetic and technology of the 1970s, a society focused on a hegemonic neo-religious cult whose followers are distinguished by wearing mood rings and having an emphasis on regulating their emotions, not becoming agitated.

- Depthpunk: A variation on atompunk, instead of the Cold War spurring the Space Race, it triggers the Depth Race. Technological milestones, militarization, and colonization of the underwater. Advances in submarines, underwater cities, etc.

- Churchpunk: A hyper-denominational society based on the early 19th century USA's Second Great Awakening. Various restorationist and revivalist movements compete for domination of society, each often only having enough followers to fill a single church.
