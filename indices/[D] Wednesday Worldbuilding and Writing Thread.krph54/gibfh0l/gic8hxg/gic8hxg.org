Hopepunk (often also called solarpunk for some reason): a derivative that explores what happens when the punks of cyberpunk finally win, defeat the System (or at least, escape it), and build a positive, free, techno-anarchist society.

Examples would be the end of the Daemon/Freedom series by Suarez, and most of Cory Doctorow's works.
