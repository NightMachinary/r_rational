For a complete layman, I always found the basic sanitation advise (and the reasons behind it) to be the most realistic.

If you are an expert in any field however, I think that can be quite useful: an engineer would have basic knowlage on mathematics, alloys, construction methods and materials like concrete and design principals and most important of all: electricity. All these by themselves won't be super useful unless you remember exact formulas, but can be very valuable to a local expect in the field.

The easiest to introduce of the above is electricity IMO. If you have wires and a magnet you can generate it, and once you can show a spark you can get research to continue on other things like light bulbs etc, which as long as you know its a vacuum inside you can think up solutions for how to make them. Lights is the easiest low-hanging fruit of electricity but motors and early phones are not too complex either.

I think the most difficult part would be not getting lynched as a heretic (simply because you start challenging the local churches power).

Edit: Don't forget the steam engine! (but that would be after some infrastructure in smelting already)
