Ordinary in-house uses of magic (like the climate control orbs that do temperature control and air quality) aren't any more dangerous to a toddler than a mundane house's power cords and electrical outlets. The deadly kinds of balls of fire have no business being anywhere near the nice furniture or the people playing board games in the living room.

(That's not to say that the house isn't dangerous to a baby. All houses are dangerous to a baby. Babies can practically light themselves on fire through their righteous indignation that you didn't pick them up immediately, while you were on the toilet.)
