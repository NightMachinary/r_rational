Leaving aside practicalities:

  Hydrothermal vents are recognized as rich sources of thermal energy. The hot water flowing from some vents contains thermal power of up to 60 MW. The thermal energy contained in hydrothermal vents make them potential sources for the generation of electric energy.

  Some of them have a thermal power of up to 60 MWt. [...] With conservative calculation, it can give result of 15 MWe by exploiting a middle range diameter of hydrothermal vent in deep of 2000 meters below sea level.  [[[https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/42/1/012019][x]]]

So assume perhaps 15-60 MW energy input to the system per vent.

How much energy is needed per person? [[https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/22012/power-to-grow-food-per-person][This StackExchange question]] has answers producing varying estimates in the kilowatt range:

#+begin_quote
  The 3kw/person figure in the [NASA] report may just be for general life support - it's caveated as "in the habitat" and the report goes on to explicitly say that the manufacturing unit will have extra power. The farm is shown as a third module. [...] This means you need enough energy input for about four and a bit pounds of growth per person per day, or 450 kwh. Assuming 24-hour farming, you're then looking at ~20kw

  Perhaps a worst-case could be calculated based on an optimistic .25 hectares of land to support 1 person and approx. 1 kW/sq m solar flux for about 2500kW per person. Factor in daylight hours, solar incidence angle in most farming regions and it maybe drops to 500kW or so. 

  The result is cE/d∼100cE/d∼100 kW of electrical power to support one human being with indoor farming. Given all the very rough order-of-magnitude assumptions involved, this seems to be roughly in line with Anthony X's estimate in a comment of 500 kW. No matter what, this is a fantastic amount of energy, dwarfing the approximately 2 kW per person used at Antarctic bases, which ship in their food.

This would imply a single vent can support somewhere between 30 and 3,000 people.
