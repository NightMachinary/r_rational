  The chromium that separates us from this supposed universe is too thick and too hard for us to drill through
#+end_quote

If they know that it is thick, they must have been able to scrape it at least a little (say via excessive force applied with pickaxes), and so I present this process which would drive compressors at quadratic returns on investment: Invest half your ressources into building a ladder upwards along the outer wall, and the other half into scraping off as much chromium as possible from the top of the ladder. Use the descent of clumps of that chromium to ground level as a power source.

With centuries of pressure left, that quadratic ought to outstrip the abysmal initial returns.
