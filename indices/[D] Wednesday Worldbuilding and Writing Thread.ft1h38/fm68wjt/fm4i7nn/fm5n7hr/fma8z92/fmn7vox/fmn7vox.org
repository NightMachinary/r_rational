I'm not sure if this is what you're getting at, but i really like "the astral plane/collective (un)consciousness/platonic idea-realm is a real place that you can access or even go to". This lets you get right down to the nature of what magic actually is while still having it work like an occult practice rather than just fictional physics. The implication is usually that magic amounts to control over perception. It meshes particularly well with a kind of panpsychist cosmology because then matter is downstream from consciousness and perception is reality. Although, it plays reasonably nice with materialism too, but usually there's some kind of multiverse thing going on. I can think of a few examples:

- Control (2019 video game): A shady government organization researches and interacts directly with entities from the astral plane. These beings are essentially manifested jungian archetypes. One consequence of this is that objects with dense symbolic connotations will take on qualities of the concept they signify. Myths and urban legends become mass summoning rituals. You can find a notice at a security checkpoint in the first level that bans "Any objects considered iconic representations of an archetypal concept (e.g. rubber ducks or ketchup bottles)."
- Neil Stephenson - Anathem: A lot of the story takes place in what is basically a secular monastery which is undergoing a schism centered around platonism vs. a kind of phenomenological empiricism (idk exactly what to call it). I don't want to go into this one too much because figuring out what's actually going on with the "paranormal" stuff is part of the fun.
- Charles Stross - Accelerando and Singularity Sky: These ones are more straight up sci fi where the tech in question is "smart matter" (which facilitates mind uploads, seamless neural interfaces, and the ability to imbue pretty much anything with consciousness). It's probably the most credible treatment I've seen of this idea, and really sells the various absurdities that it would entail. There's a gestalt consciousness cult, a refugee AI made from uploading a lobster's neural lattice and then letting it get out of its box, a soda can-sized spaceship crewed by the uploaded neural vectors of long-dead humans living in a simulated reality, a cellular-automata-like nanobot cluster, a sentient 419 scam virus... and a lot more I don't want to spoil.
