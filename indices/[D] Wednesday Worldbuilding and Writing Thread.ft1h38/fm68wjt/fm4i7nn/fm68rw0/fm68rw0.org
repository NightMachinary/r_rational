There are quite a few that follow the original "The Gamer" manhwa. Common tropes pull from whatever videogame the author likes best or has seen in other gamer fics, but include:

- Attribute stats that can be increased on level up
- Health in the form of HP, which only matters if you lose the last point
- Text boxes that hang in mid-air
- Skills that increase in level with use
- Skills that evolve, fork, or change with use
- Explicit character classes
- Magical power as MP, with explicit casting costs
- Player inventory that can store lots and lots of things to be pulled out later
- Analysis or something similar that gives vital stats of monsters and "players"

But it varies a lot, and they rarely work off a stock system, at least that I've seen (though I haven't read an endless number of them).
