You know the "x, but with y instead of z" game?

What do you think of feudalism, but with bureaucrats and managers instead of knights and men-at-arms?

Or Christianity, but with actual cannibalism instead of ritualized pseudo-cannibalism?

Or litrpg, but people get xp only from roleplaying instead of only from killing shit.
