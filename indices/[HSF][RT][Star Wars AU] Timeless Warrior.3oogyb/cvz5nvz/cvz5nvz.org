It has the common above-average fanfic disease of furiously jerking it to its own detailed altered world and world history instead of telling a good, clear story in the here and now.

I don't really care enough to dig through that much "tell" to get to the good parts. There are those, I assume. But they didn't exactly make me care enough about any characters in the critical first chapter for me to want to continue.

Then right into more world-building through encyclopedia entries? Blah. Hell, I care more about the Master we see for two paragraphs, and why he hands out drinks to the failed students, than I care about this born loser of a protagonist or the AU changes the writer has painstakingly worked out and is now typing up from their notes.
