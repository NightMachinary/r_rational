Not bad as far as rationality in MC goes. Would be better if the emotion descriptions were cut back a little bit, maybe a quarter of what they are now.

Sensible goal behavior by Jedi, and what I assume is a Sith Lord (no confirmation on that). Culture seems a little outdated for people who can live a long time, why no mind drugs and VR? Great use of future sensing by everyone so far.

The lore bits would be better as a in story clue than what they are now, but I like the rationale behind the scientific lack of progress, as well as scientifically accurate methods(or at least the ones I know are accurate)

Would benefit from more character descriptions, so far only the boss and Twielk man get some semblance of appearance (I could be wrong on this, i can sometimes forget or misread the details)

Bonus point: aliens that come from vastly different eco systems need vastly different arrangements for living.
