Wow, this is really interesting. I enjoyed everything about the story.

My only issue is that I just wish it wasn't posted on space battles. That place can be so shit to navigate and follow stories.I understand its appeal, but it's not a format that's suited to what is being used for.

Edit: space battles-> forum format site
