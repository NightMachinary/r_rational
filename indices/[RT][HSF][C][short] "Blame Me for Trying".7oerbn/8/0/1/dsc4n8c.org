Having "she had never considered the matter again" be one of the story's last sentences makes it sound like it's intended to be dramatic irony, like Afforess said.

If you want to signal non-shortsightedness, something like "Ever since she'd computed that strategy, the numbers had proven her right over and over again" would work better.
