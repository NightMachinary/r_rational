I agree the paragraph does all those things, but the statement emphasized at the end was not necessary to accomplish those goals. It could have been removed without harming your intent for the paragraph.

Since the last statement is not necessary, the extra detail implies something else entirely. The final implication is that Eliza herself, having calculated a strategy that appears to be stable, implemented it, and therefore has no plans to re-evaluate it for changing circumstances. This is amusing because Eliza herself is taking an active role in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen_hypothesis][red-queen's race]] and is complicit in the death of unfit Spambots - which is necessitating change. Her current approach almost guarantees that circumstances /must/ change, eventually, and Eliza will not see it coming.
