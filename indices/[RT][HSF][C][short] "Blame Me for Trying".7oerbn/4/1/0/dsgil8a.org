Good question!

Thought 1. Maybe 'once all the money is gone' actually refers to the bankrupting state.

Thought 1b. Maybe (coincidentally?) the person in question lost his/her job (or otherwise became effectively bankrupt), leading to the effective-bankruptcy. However, this in itself doesn't suggest a reason to pronounce cured, rather than leaving the door open for if the person starts earning again.

Thought 3 (skipping ahead of thought 2, yet to be written): Perhaps the earning potential is too meagre to satisfying the moneyflow desired, making the preferred target {a high-earner who can keep a lot of money constantly rolling in} or {a low-earner who can sustain the desired moneyflow once only by burning through all their long-accumulated savings (with the reasoning that mental health is the most important foundation for all the rest of their existence, alongside bodily health) and then never again until decades later at soonest, in which case easier to just go for new targets instead}?

Thought 2. If dropping someone /anyway/, trying to leave them (or at least a few of them) feeling that it was worth it, or getting at least a little time of positive word-of-mouth to share with other targets? (Say, trying to get a few extra recommendations from the glow of thinking the person has cured you, sharing with surrounding others that transient glow rather than the bleak negativity of cutoff without being told the same thing.)

(Again, wholly speculation on my part.)
