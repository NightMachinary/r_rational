Interesting! Not having been or interacted memorably with either, my (/prior) knowledge of the boundary between therapists and psychiatrists is negligible to nil. I'm still unclear on the difference in (/ideal) session content, other than the surrounding organisational structure; the interaction in the story matched my stereotypical impression of what a psychiatrist does, namely talking with a subject to accomplish mental manipulations (ideally beneficial ones).

I am in favour of checks and balances! (An effective feedback loop, that is.)

'dark arts': I'm mainly thinking about how addiction works in general. You pay money for something (alcohol, a lottery ticket, a conversation which makes you feel as though you end it with more self-esteem) that gives you a rush of endorphins. Later, in your normal circumstances you come down from your happy place, and the contrast makes the normal situation more starkly stressful, making you want to do the thing that you've felt gets rid of that stress. Do it a few times and it becomes a neural-circuitry rut, a Pavlovian(?) reflex action to reach for the bottle/cigarette/wallet/phone (ah, there's the smartphone dependency example) once there's a bit of mental discomfort. Further on, and attempts to stop completely result in incredible anxiety, discomfort, mental evasive behaviour (relapse justification), the 'I need this' feeling where you require the behaviour to even function meaningfully, despite the chronic drain on your limited resources. (It gets worse, and can easily end very very badly, if it's something for which a tolerance is steadily built up--though that can also be limited by the effective bandwidth available. People can be drunk (nearly?) 24 hours per day, and can increase the level of alcohol in their system up to death and/or liver failure, but I imagine there's little way to increase the 'intensity' of psychiatry/therapy sessions other than by switching to a better provider, with decreasing returns as one searches higher (unlike compounds that can be semi-easily multiplied).)
