Maybe I just don't understand the kinds of dark arts necessary, but I don't see how someone could "build up a dependency" in a client. Most clients are happy with sessions that help them and quickly stop going to sessions that don't... particularly if they are paying for their own sessions rather than having insurance pay for them, which itself is often limited by how many sessions you can have.

Clients that keep going to the same therapist despite not being helped by the sessions seems like something particular to their circumstances (being forced to by legal systems or social services) or problems (crippling agoraphobia or feelings of isolation), not something that can be induced. Additionally, if the therapist works for an organization there should be checks and balances in place to find out if your clients are being held for too long and not seeing any positive gains or are giving negative feedback.

That's all for therapists, though, not psychiatrists: their practice can often work differently. I just assumed you meant one word to apply to both, since the bot in the story is (by necessity) a "therapist," but if you specifically meant psychiatrists then feel free to disregard :)
