Very well written; it was an enjoyable read.

If you don't mind me asking, in this theoretical world, why isn't it legally mandated that bots involved in healthcare be programmed with strong, utilitarian-oriented ethics? Eliza is acting how I'd expect her to act if she had been programmed with profit maximization as a goal - was that the case?
