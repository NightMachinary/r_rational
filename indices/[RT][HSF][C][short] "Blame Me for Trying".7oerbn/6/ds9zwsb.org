I love the concept of an Eliza program as a therapist.

Simply restating what you have said as a question can definitely be a good way to get people to self-reflect.

Obviously, this (evil) therapist is more aware than any current Eliza...and it suggests to me that the AI problem may be self-correcting, when AI turns upon itself.
