Um, how so? [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor][Not that it necessarily matters]], but the intent of the quoted passage was to forestall [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/kz/fake_optimization_criteria/][rationalization of good outcomes]]: without that paragraph, I imagined some readers objecting, "Hey, isn't that kind of short-sighted? After all, a dead client can't pay you."

By declaring, in effect, "Nope, already thought of that; doesn't work in this setting," we force the story into the [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/2k/the_least_convenient_possible_world/][least convenient possible world]]. (That is, least convenient with respect to mercy for the salesbot character, which is the most convenient world with respect to storytelling drama.)
