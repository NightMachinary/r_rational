  knowledge of the boundary between therapists and psychiatrists is negligible to nil. I'm still unclear on the difference in (/ideal) session content, other than the surrounding organisational structure; the interaction in the story matched my stereotypical impression of what a psychiatrist does, namely talking with a subject to accomplish mental manipulations (ideally beneficial ones).

Generally speaking, the distinction of a psychiatrist is that they've gone to medical school and so can prescribe medication in addition to doing therapy. In practice, the monitoring of medication levels and symptom and side effect outcomes can often be the full extent of a psychiatrist's sessions, particularly if a client is also seeing a therapist who is dedicated wholly to therapy.

"Mental manipulations" is a fraught phrase that I don't endorse unless we're including all social interaction as mental manipulation, in which case, sure :) If by that you mean "interaction specifically aimed at changing one's thought patterns and behaviors with their consent," that sounds more accurate, whereas "manipulation" sounds non-consensual.

  You pay money for something (alcohol, a lottery ticket, a conversation which makes you feel as though you end it with more self-esteem) that gives you a rush of endorphins. Later, in your normal circumstances you come down from your happy place, and the contrast makes the normal situation more starkly stressful, making you want to do the thing that you've felt gets rid of that stress.

Ah. Yeah, this really depends on the therapy itself... ideally therapy should not just be a place of feeling good and relaxed and affirmed and happy. For clients that hope to see change in themselves, therapy is work: emotional and mental work, often involving anger, frustration, and tears along with some relief and joy. It differs from client to client, therapist to therapist, and session to session, of course, but if someone is going to therapy just to feel good about themselves and their life, this sounds to me more like what's pejoratively referred to as a "rent-a-friend," meaning some mental health expert who's being hired specifically so the client has someone friendly and sympathetic to talk to, and generally frowned on by most organizations employing therapists (not to mention discouraged by insurance companies that pay for therapy).
