I enjoyed it. I remember another snippet with a similar chain of events but a different outcome. In response to the challenge on the sig figs of his percent, Spock quoted a huge variety of relevant statistics he had memorized to come up with the most accurate estimate possible. Does anyone remember the link to that snippet?
