Most of these characters are either young immortals, cut off from society or completely otherworldly though. Judging from how OP phrased it and the examples he gave it seems that he is looking specifically for stories where an immortal human born long in the past is shown dealing with the world that has moved on all around him.

Then again, I haven't actually read any stories that focus on Vandal Savage or Ra's al Ghul and the more mundane parts of their lives.
