If I kept my morals I would start by not eating people (at least in the movie that was definitely possible, I don't know about the book). The other problem of the protagonist was that he was lonely, so why not raise an orphan like Claudia only this time don't turn her. Of course that only works if you have the willpower not to hurt her.

I guess the crucial question is how well one can resist the smell of blood. If you can do it well then you could do all the things Bella did in Alicorn's Luminosity and Radiance (i.e. take over the world).

If it's hard to resist you could become a hermit and only communicate with other people through the internet. Maybe do some math research...
