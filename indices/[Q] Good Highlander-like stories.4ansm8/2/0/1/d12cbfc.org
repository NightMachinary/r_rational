Anne Rice's vampires are also prone to emotional outbursts, they 'feel more deeply' than normal humans. Having a healthy relationship with an aging human child would be incredibly difficult for someone that also is tempted to eat them, as I have been tempted to chew the face off my own children and I'm not into that sort of thing. I can't read their minds to hear all the awful things they think about me. So not sure how well a relationship with a non-vampire would go.

So being in control in general would be difficult, for sure. Also, being burned by sunlight makes it a bit difficult, but that goes away mostly as you get older.

But anyway, yeah it would be interesting to hear about an Ann Rice style vampire with better emotional control and dedicated towards improving the world or dominating it. Probably hunting down some of the worst vampires that prey on humans would be worthwhile since it both prevents many deaths and makes you potentially stronger.
