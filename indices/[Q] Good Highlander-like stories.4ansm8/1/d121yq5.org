The trouble with this is that most immortality-positive shows aren't "about" immortality.

Doctor Who, X-Men (because Wolverine), even frigging /Sabrina the Teenage Witch/ all feature immortal main characters who seem pretty darn pleased with their immortality. But they're generally not /about/ immortality. (Doctor Who does have some episodes "about" immortality; mostly good, some awful.)

Comics in general are very good about this, actually. The Guardians, Vandal Savage, Ras Al Ghul and the Amazons all seem pretty happy in DC. Weirdly, for a series where Death is a major and positive character, Sandman is also pretty good at this. Marvel has various immortal mutants, the Eternals (an entire team of awesome immortal people), and Franklin Richards - actually, /everyone/ sufficiently powerful in Marvel seems to become immortal; all the Infinity Gem guys are.

This carries over to the movies, too; Wolverine and film!Deadpool pretty much fit the bill, and I suspect Wonder Woman and Apocalypse won't be angsting about it when they show up either
