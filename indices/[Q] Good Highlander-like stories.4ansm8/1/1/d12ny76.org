In Fables characters are immortal and they like it. Some are content, others steadily pursue their goals and Jack munchins hell out of it. Especially ending has "and than they have countless adventures and gigantic family reunion every hundred years" attitude.

Funny enough, The Last Witch Hunter was supposed to have deathist message, but than they wanted room for sequel. So at the, last moment, main character realises that immortality is actually pretty useful. It also has twist on "immortality as the curse". Unfortunately it's not very good movie.
