I know what you mean about Forever - remarkably well adapted to modern society, with only enough anachronism to be "quirky" rather than "weird" (or indeed "cantankerous old bigot in the body of a 30yr old", which would seem more likely given the change in /all the norms/ since the 1700s). Plus the whole "trying to end his immortality" aspect rubbed me the wrong way for what I expect are much the same reasons.

Haven't seen the whole season yet. Maybe by the end he figured out it really was a gift rather than the "Seems like a gift, actually it's a curse" it was initially presented as.
