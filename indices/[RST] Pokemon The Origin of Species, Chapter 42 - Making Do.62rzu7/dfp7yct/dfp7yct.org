Not that this was poorly done, but it does get a little tiring to see the same set of applause lights in every rational fic.

If I had a dollar for every time a rational fic reminded me that cryonics is totally a thing everyone should be doing or that artificial intelligence is the ultimate end solution to all of society's problems I bet I could have saved like 3.897x10^{14} lives by effectively donating it to a high impact charity.

If you're intending to reach an audience of people that have never heard of these concepts, fine, but in that case this feels pretty rushed for Red to go from a kid born and raised in a world with a strong taboo around the idea of storing people in pokeballs to a sudden and fully accepting understanding of the idea and its implications.

The way this is written it feels like you expect the audience to be at least passingly familiar with the idea of cryonics, mind uploads, or other methods of suspending death, and if that's the audience you're writing for, I'd like to have seen your take on either how best to move the needle on public opinion or a character with a stong and well reasoned argument against death suspension.

As it stands, this mostly feels like a self-congratulatory parable where-in one of the rationalist communities sacred cows is reaffirmed by having our "smart kid" protagonist see the obvious righteousness of it.

I feel like this has come off more mean-spirited than I intended, but also less contemptuous than I would be if I were reading a story where the token smart character had a sudden insight into the obvious righteousness of keeping your kids unvaccinated or that no one needs to die because Jesus saves all who ask for it.
