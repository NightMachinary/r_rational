I can totally understand the frustration of seeing the same ideas mentioned over and over, but let me try and explain the intention without defending the writing itself (which no doubt can be improved to better explain/convey things, and hopefully will upon future edits):

First, Red grew up in a society that taboos it, but he's never been on board with that taboo. As mentioned early on (probably too early on for most people to remember, considering the glacial pace of the story) Red has thought of tons of advantages to human storage before, and always wondered what would happen if society moved past its taboo.

As for understanding the implications, I don't think it's that hard a leap to make for someone who's very pro-science: you could even call it a /naive/ belief that medicine and technology will just keep advancing to the point of utopia, and many people do call it that, but for someone who thinks that, the idea that this utopia might also include undoing the damage of human storage and even near-death should be easy to believe, once pointed out explicitly.

Also, he's still young, however smart he is. I don't know how much time you spend around children, but I've found them very receptive to new-amazing-technology ideas. I recently talked to one about CRISPR and they were already thinking of all the things that someone who optimistically studies the future of the field would hope for, just off the mix of imagination and optimism :)

Finally, as for it being a sacred cow, I can only say that I personally am not signed up for cryonics, and have no plan to unless the price drops significantly or the probability of success goes up considerably. I do, however, think that if you could do it for practically free, as someone in the pokemon world can, there aren't many arguments that make sense against it besides the spiritual/death-positive ones that are pretty unapplicable to someone like Red.

If you have some better counter arguments though, I'm always happy to be exposed to new things or ideas I haven't thought of for the story!
