Those a good points - I do recall the early segments with Red discussing or thinking about human storage in pokeballs, so points for laying the groundwork there.

And, also fair point regarding youthful optimism. You don't really start digging into how ideas become implemented and why it takes decades for things to go from conception to reality until you're becoming a professional.

I will still call it a missed opportunity that Bill somewhat handwaves the process as requiring only a public awareness campaign and some social shifts, but you've also done a good job of his characterization that makes me understand why he's not the person for that. Giovanni or even Oak maybe, but it would feel weird for Bill to go from tech nerd living on the cutting edge to socio-political operative seeking to influence society on a grand scale, a la Harry/Hermoine in Significant Digits.

It also surprises me that Bill's live preservation program is tied to his house AI rather than an intelligent pokemon, like Alakazam, a trained Chansey nurse, or just another person who could travel with him to enable him to leave the house more regularly. If he's willing to travel to conferences, etc. I expect he's got an emergency teleport protocol, but I'm wondering what exactly his protocol with Eva is.
