  Assuming you've read the FAQ, fair enough! ;P

Well of course I have! Actually I've been meaning to make an askhistorians post concerning it; The only cultures I know of that have anything close to that level of initiation (there's an African tribe that makes you kill a lion, and I guess the bullet ant stuff in the Amazon compares) but I'm pretty sure even those examples aren't until the kid is like 15. But I'm sure there are some I'm missing, do you have better examples? Particularly in less primitive societies?

And I don't think having all three kids be exceptionally smart explains why they act exceptionally mature. Which then begs the question; these are three of the smartest kids you can find and they almost died like 6 times before they got to the second gym, and we constantly see full grown trainers and even Rangers get killed rather often by the insanely harsh environment. How the hell are the /other/ twelve year olds surviving at all? From the rest of the context, I just don't see how we could expect normal groups of 12 year olds to make it back from such a dangerous trip.
