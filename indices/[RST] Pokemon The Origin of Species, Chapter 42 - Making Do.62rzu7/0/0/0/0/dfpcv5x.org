  Actually I've been meaning to make an askhistorians post concerning it

I would be very interested in this!

  But I'm sure there are some I'm missing, do you have better examples? Particularly in less primitive societies?

Sparta began training of its soldiers [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartan_army][at the age of 7]], which is a bit extreme, but the Ottoman Empire also began force-drafting child soldiers into their Janissary corps who were [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janissaries#Characteristics][an average age of 13.]]

Also, let's not forget about modern times, where there are still warlords going around enslaving and using child soldiers [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_use_of_children#Uganda_2][in wartorn countries.]]

  How the hell are the other twelve year olds surviving at all?

Well, a lot of them don't XD But it should be noted that not everyone goes out on their journey at such a young age. Most don't go until they're older, and while I'm trying to rationalize the main characters of the Pokemon games being sent out so young, I definitely am ignoring the idea that most trainers start so young, let alone even younger.
