  the Ottoman Empire also began force-drafting child soldiers into their Janissary corps who were an average age of 13.

It should be noted that the Janissary corps were slaves iirc. So it wouldn't really be that similar, they honestly had more relation to the Pokemon (battle slaves) in your story than the trainers. This also applies to your warlord example; having your child fight early is a LOT different from having your slave fight early.

There's also the point where more advanced societies tend to have later "coming of age" rituals most likely due to longer life expectancy. I highly doubt there are going to be any examples of this in a civilized country.

And the Spartan thing seems more rigorous but a lot less deadly. Unless they are making these 7 year olds fight wolves on a daily basis, I'm not sure it really compares. It would compare closer to the thing where they kill the deformed babies.
