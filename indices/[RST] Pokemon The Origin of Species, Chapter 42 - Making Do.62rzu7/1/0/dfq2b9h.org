I read the first chapter of Guardian.

I really like it. Has some great set ups and gives a taste of a potentially rich world. Found no writing mistakes, so there's probably no obvious ones, if any at all. When do you expect that we can buy it? I have no problem paying for it on e-book or for access to it on a website like that. Although E-book would be prefered.
