As much as it freaked Red out, I think Bill's reaction to being probed was just right. He highlighted the danger of such activity when it might be detected, made clear that he was upset about the invasion of privacy, and left Red to stew on it. I expect Bill will forgive him - Red's just starting to learn about his power, after all, and it would be highly surprising if he /never/ made that kind of mistake - but he did an effective job of teaching him an ethical lesson about it. And took the opportunity to conclude the original topic of discussion, unpleasant though it must have been.
