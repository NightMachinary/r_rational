Hey everyone, welcome back! Three things of note: first off, I published the first chapter of my new original fiction story, [[http://daystareld.com/guardian-1/][Guardian!]] You can find it on my website under Stories. It's an original fiction with an urban fantasy setting that I'm hoping to eventually publish as a YA novel, and I'm looking forward to any feedback!

Second, we've got a new sponsor on my podcast, Rationally Writing, with a special offer! If you're behind on listening or haven't checked the podcast out before, now might be a good time to check out the latest episodes and potentially get a discount on an neat service before the promotion ends!

Finally, I've re-included into this chapter the section from Bill's previous one that I took out after feedback. I'm much happier with its inclusion in the story now, and look forward to feedback on whether others agree.

Enjoy the chapter, and thanks for reading!
