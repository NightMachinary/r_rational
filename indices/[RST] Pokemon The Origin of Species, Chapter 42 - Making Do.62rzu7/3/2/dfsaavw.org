Fanfiction is usually copyright violation unless you can successfully argue that it qualifies for fair use. In this case, the parody defense would probably be on the most solid footing, but I think it would fail in court, and in any case, the legal battle wouldn't be worth it except on general principle.

That said, there are two arguments against advertisement. The first is that one of the four factors for fair use is whether or not the work is commercial in nature, which means that in the event of a lawsuit it's better for the work to be free. The second argument is that you're more likely to get sued if there's monetization; there are thousands of fanfics of Pokemon, almost none of which have had lawsuits (or cease and desists) filed against them, but the ones that /have/ had legal action are much more likely to be the ones that are more of a threat in one way or another.
