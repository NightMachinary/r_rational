So, something I've been thinking about for a while: why don't pokemon store matter the same way pokeballs do? Apparently there are berries and nuts that can do something like that in this universe already, so it'd be weird if in this universe this 'turn matter into magical energy' evolved thing /and/ also all the weirdness of pokemon evolved with no relation between the two at all.

Here are all the things it could explain:

1. Why pokemon can do such energy intensive things. Their cells have been built from the ground up to use this phenomenon in various ways. They can store much more ATP, water, glocose, etc, and not pay a penalty in size and complexity. This enables them from the get-go to be much hardier and stronger.

2. Water Pokemon. We assume that storing is easy, but retrieving things while preserving structure is hard. Thus it's possible to have cell-level machinery to store limited amounts of molecular substances without caring about orientation or internal structure beyond the molecular. It's not then hard to imagine why the easiest specialized machinery for storing very large quantities of matter would be most successful with one of the simplest molecules, H2O.

3. Ditto. Most of the raw materials of its cells are kept in a stored state, leaving very little crucial material in its physical form, mostly specialized towards spooling out stored materials into various physical forms, then returning it as needed. If you further reflect that Mew is the most recent ancestor of all pokemon, and it had the move transform, it's pretty clear Ditto is just a result of neoteny.

4. Most other Pokemon. Trivial. Left as an exercise for the reader.

5. Why pokeballs only work on pokemon, not humans. The fact that their cells already have a bunch of machinery for pushing most of their raw materials in and out of that state makes things a lot easier.

6. Those nuts. Symbiosis with Beedrill colonies, defending against wild Caterpie. The cell machinery that allows that kind of storage was first introduced by the alien pokerus retrovirus, explaining why they share it in common.

7. Why people don't eat pokemon. Trivial. Left as an exercise to the reader.
