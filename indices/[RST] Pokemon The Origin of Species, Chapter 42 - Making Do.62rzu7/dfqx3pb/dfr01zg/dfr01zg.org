Not quite: they're used to make the /casing/ for pokeballs, they don't actually have the properties. I definitely agree that if it were a natural phenomenon it would explain a lot about the world, but they never had the foresight to think of that when designing the world, unfortunately: and humans definitely do eat pokemon, in both the anime and the games, even though they don't make a big deal out of it.
