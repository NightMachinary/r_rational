Just read the author's notes in the story. I'm not a lawyer, but I'm kind of worried about the legalities of putting an ad in your fanfiction. It might be blurring the lines between "fanfiction" and "copyright violation" if you seem to be making money directly off the fanfiction and not from donations/things tangentially relating to it like the podcast.

Can someone more knowledgeable than me confirm/deny this?
