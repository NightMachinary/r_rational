Speaking about the implications of pokeball-style storage, one thing I've been wondering about is the historical transition to pokeball use in your interpretation of the pokemon world. As dangerous as the modern pokemon world is, it must have been much more so in the pre-pokeball era. The invention of pokeballs and the associated matter storage tech must have been a hugely important moment that transformed human society and the natural pokemon world! Have you given any thought to the long-view history of the pokemon world?
