I was imagining something very much like that. I was also thinking that it might also have been difficult to train certain pokemon - bugs, for example. Sort of mirroring our world, where animals have a spectrum of trainability, with animals like dogs being the most trainable and caterpillars completely untrainable. I also figured that psychics would be the most powerful trainers (and good candidates to become warlords), and that they in turn probably would have feared dark people. A Psychic upper class would also probably have institutionally persecuted Darks.
