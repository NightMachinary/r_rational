Of course! I was thinking of including a section of a history book or novelization of the past at some point in the story that shows how trainers used to have bonds with pokemon that they raise from birth, and how it was very rare for any trainer to have more than one or two pokemon following them around at a time. Those that bonded with particularly strong pokemon, or were able to command multiple at a time, tended to become the leaders of villages or warlords.

Pokeball technology didn't just make it safer to train multiple pokemon, it also added the automatic training/programming of them that have democratized pokemon training to the extent visible in the modern world.
