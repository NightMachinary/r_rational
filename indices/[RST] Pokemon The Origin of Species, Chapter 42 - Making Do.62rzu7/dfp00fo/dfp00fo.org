Great chapter! You've been doing the gym battles very well. The psychic stuff is really cool too, it takes a lot of work to rationalize that stuff but you've been nailing it so far. If I may make a suggestion, is there a way to include more scientific examinations of the pokemon? Like the ones the pokedex did in the first couple of chapters. I feel like it adds to the world building and gives you an idea of how this pokemon actually functions in a rational environment. However I'm not a writer, so perhaps there's a good reason for not having it that I'm missing.

I still think you're wrong on the age front though :P These mofos were CLEARLY written as 16 year-olds and you can't tell me otherwise!
