True, other than the Spartans it is generally something reserved for kids deemed as "disposable" by their respective societies. I guess I'm thinking of it more as "acts of a desperate society that needs lots of competent trainers to survive" lowering their inhibitions of what age children should be exposed to danger, which sort of just carried through into the "modern times" of the pokemon world.
