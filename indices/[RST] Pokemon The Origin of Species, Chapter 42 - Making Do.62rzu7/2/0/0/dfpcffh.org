  Finally, as for it being a sacred cow, I can only say that I personally am not signed up for cryonics, and have no plan to unless the price drops significantly or the probability of success goes up considerably. I do, however, think that if you could do it for practically free, as someone in the pokemon world can, there aren't many arguments that make sense against it besides the spiritual/death-positive ones that are pretty unapplicable to someone like Red.

Interesting you should say that, because I was going to say that if I were to complain about anything it's that you present a fantastic metaphor creping up on Space Whale Aesop to present cryonics as obviously a no-brainer while in reality it's more of a Pascal's Wager, considering the effort involved for dubious benefit, especially outside of America. I guess I'm not the target audience, because if it /was/ that simple, I /would/ have signed up already, I have no conceptual objection, so I perceive a misrepresentation of the debate because you removed from the picture the only significant issue I have with cryonics: practical (un)feasibility.
