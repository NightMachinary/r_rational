  It also surprises me that Bill's live preservation program is tied to his house AI rather than an intelligent pokemon, like Alakazam, a trained Chansey nurse, or just another person who could travel with him to enable him to leave the house more regularly.

Chansey nurses are only a thing in the anime, where they'er as intelligent as people. /Maybe/ he could train an alakazam to, upon being released while his life is at risk, take a container ball, release its box, put Bill's body in the box, return the box to the ball, then teleport back to Bill's lab... then take the container box out again, maybe, and Eva takes over from there? Meanwhile there's now a loose alakazam in his lab. Also he has to hope that no one else is around while all that happened to see and stop his alakzam from doing all that.

I'll think it over, but probably easier to just make sure he stays home, and if he does leave, just teleports back as needed :)
