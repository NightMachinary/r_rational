hmmmm am I wrong about the last one?

In my mind the last two queens should come as a set, the 2nd the last should consume the safety all but one square if its going to be valid, I don't think you can swap rows in any of the solutions all valid transformations are more complicated then that, i.e. you'll never see a case where the any two queens can share 4 safe potions between themselves suggesting 2 branching cases, right?

I'm quite sure that the first is freebie tho.
