Everything the other guy said is correct. However there's some additional points. They are hilarious. Basically they take everything that is normal or reasonable and stand it on its head. Things that are easy the witch claims are difficult and with ease she does things that don't appear possible. For example Haskell is statically typed and compilied but she uses it as if there were barely any types. The entire point of Haskell is a ton of type checking but she gets around that. And nearly everything she does is super elegant even though it would be awful to think through or come up with.
