They fit nicely into the ancient tradition of mysticism in programming (ancient in the field, anyway), updated with modern superstitions about functional languages and cultural references to the valley workplace. The prose is well-written, and the characters interesting - there's a lovely ring of authenticity to the internal dialogue, reflecting both Norse poetry and the experience of working through a hard problem. Finally, the presence and quality of the program snippets is better than anything else I can remember; not surprising given the author's background.

TLDR they're technically excellent in every sense.
