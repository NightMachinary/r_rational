It's not really functional programming.

[[http://www.cse.chalmers.se/%7Ehallgren/Papers/hallgren.pdf][It's logic programming, using Haskell's type system as a weird dialect of prolog.]]

It's fairly well known that C++'s templates are actually a turing-complete functional programming language in disguise. Somewhat similarly, Haskell's typeclass instance resolution, when paired with a few language extensions, is actually a logic programming language in disguise.
