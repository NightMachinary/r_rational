I think you can apply some rational ideas. A rational character is just one who behaves with common sense, after all. So make sure your characters act the way real people would act in their shoes, and that they don't just do what the story needs them to.

The next step, I think, is to make sure that the rest of the world works the same way. A lot of authors use "magic is random" or "magic has a will of its own" or even "magic has a sense of drama" as code for "magic does what the author wants". If you're to be rational, make sure you don't do that. Magic /can/ be random, or have a will of its own, but like any other character it must be free to do things which are inconvenient to the author.

Remember, rational writers must be constantly trying to outwit their own characters. You must always be looking for the sensible thing to do that would instantly resolve the entire story, and then arrange the universe so that it doesn't work.

Rationalist ideas, of course, are right out. There will be no munchkinry, no transhumanism, and no attempt at educating the reader. And that's fine.
