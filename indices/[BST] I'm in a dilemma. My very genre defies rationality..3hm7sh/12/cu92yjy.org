Not all fiction needs to be rational. Look, I enjoy the fiction I get from this subreddit as much as the next guy, but it doesn't represent the only way to write.

Many authors are revered precisely because their fiction shows us a world that is irrational, nonsensical, yet still recognizable. Pynchon, Kafka, Marquez come to mind among many others.
