Of course you can! Rationalist doesn't necessarily have to be "reductionist", or even particularly clear headed in tone. It just has to attempt to improve the reader's rational decision making process (which many stories do t some extent, but in rationalist works we're explicitly /trying/ to do that). Even many of Yudkowsky's stories don't always clearly define what's going on - the Sword of Good, for example, is merely deconstructionist - we don't bother with world building at all. Same with the [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/sy/sorting_pebbles_into_correct_heaps/][Pebble Sorting]] story - it's an allegory, like Plato's Cave: we're not meant to ask questions about how this ridiculousness scenario came to be.

Aesop's Fables come to mind. "The goose that lays the golden eggs", is about hyperbolic discounting - no one cares about the mechanism of the thing. In "Sour Grapes" we don't need to question that the fox can talk, we don't ask why a sentient fox can't just get a crate to stand upon to better jump at the grapes...none of that actually matters for understanding the lesson about rationalizing failure that Aesop was trying to convey.

In fact, the story Sour Grapes itself is kinda dull isn't it? I bet the only reason it got popular was that the common population presumably found it very valuable to condense "the act of deciding something is bad because that view prevents one from feeling the pain of not getting it, and rather than out of any reasoned judgement concerning its worth." into the idiom "sour grapes". This implies the story /successfully/ improved people's thinking about thinking. Lesswrong does this condensation of complex ideas into short "jargon" phrases which make it easier to think about pretty often.

Religious texts are great sources for non-reductionist tales aimed at conveying a lesson of some sort: mahabharata, elder edda, bible. You also see it in classics like The Little Prince, and it's actually really common in movies: the recent Inside Out for example. More obscurely, I thought the Devil's Carnival did it particularly well. (It doesn't matter if the story sometimes teaches a bad lesson - the point is that the medium can communicate lessons)

I think it would be fairly easy to depict rationality-improving concepts like loss aversion, gambler's fallacy, etc in any genre or style. Flawed characters in fairy tales teaching by negative example is a proud old tradition. Deeper philosophical lessons are possible too, but it's more work, of course.

I'd advise thinking "When I started writing this story, what is it that I wanted to tell?" and then going forward from there. If you were drawn to the "fabulist" genre (I googled it but I'm still not sure quite what it is?) to communicate this, then I don't think reductionism need necessarily play a part in what you were trying to tell.

(Or do you specifically /want/ advice on logically-consistent/reductionist stories which can be solved in a puzzle-like fashion that retain a dreamlike style? That's harder but I bet it could be done...)
