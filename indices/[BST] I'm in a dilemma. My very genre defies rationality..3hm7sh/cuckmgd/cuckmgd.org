I think Neil Gaiman achieves this balance, to some extent. For one short example, read "The Problem of Susan". It combines rational analysis with that which is unknowable. Some of Roald Dahl's stories strike this balance as well, although they tend to err towards one side or the other, and involve too much humor generally. GK Chesterton also achieves this, when he's not being overly sanctimonious.

I don't agree with the people who think it is impossible. I think it's a rare and difficult combination, but not an impossible one.
