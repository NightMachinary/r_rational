She wants her brother back, she...well, has a sort-of immunity to malicious things, and she's going up against one of the oldest and most powerful people around (who kidnapped said brother) hoping that her immunity won't fail her (and is also desperate and doesn't really have a choice).

(Don't worry. She fails. Epically. But then she gets better.)
