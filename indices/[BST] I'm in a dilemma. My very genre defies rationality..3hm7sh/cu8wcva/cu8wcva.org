  Irrational things are /supposed/ to happen.
#+end_quote

Rationality is not an attribute of things that happen. It is an attribute of people. Do people just accept that magic works in mysterious ways, or do they try to predict it? Whenever it stops feeling like quantum randomness and starts feeling mysterious, that just means that it started looking predictable. You just know it's going to dodge this next piece of furniture just like it dodged all the previous ones. Perhaps the world is supernatural and things happen on a mental level rather than a reductionist one, but that just means that you need a person to predict it rather than a computer model.

Rational doesn't mean reductionist. It means being smart enough to accomplish your goals.
