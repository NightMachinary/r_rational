I don't know, I think I can run with this. A rule is a rule even if it's just "this all-powerful character acts at random" (that's basically God, come to think of it). It's consistent as long as that character keeps acting on a whim (perhaps manifested as dice or something of the sort) and demonstrably doesn't get into the politics of situations. If they're shown to be as likely to shoot themselves in the foot as to give themselves an advantage, then that's consistent and arguably rational on some level. If on the other hand they end up cheating and working towards an agenda, then /that's/ an inconsistency.

Kind of like Harvey Dent in The Dark Knight, I think? Willing to gamble even his own life on his coin tosses.
