One: the godlike entity need not be omnipotent. If they are shown to have powers, ensure that they stick to those powers. No introducing new powers as you go along. Characters can try to evade the powers based off limitations of power.

Two: The characters should, in some way, interact with the godlike entity, and preferably find a way to use its power for themselves. If you can't interact with god, by Occam's Razor it doesn't exist.
