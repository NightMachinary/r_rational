Wildblow's "Pact" actually does this fairly well. There aren't "rules" in the classic science sense, but there is a logic, and you can learn how to work in that world.

So yeah, I tots think you can. Think about chaotic social situations. Plenty of irrational things happening! But you can still act rationalist. You can still try, and, arguably, full-on bayesian rationality is the only form that'll really work, since it's the one that inherently recognizes probabilities - in other words, that a set of causes are some degree of likely / unlikely to result in the same effects.
