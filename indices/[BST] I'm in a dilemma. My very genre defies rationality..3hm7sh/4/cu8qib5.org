From a rationalist perspective, the only difference between magical realism and regular fantasy is how far away the explanation is. The story I've written that I'm proudest of (which I'm not putting on Reddit or any connected accounts) blurs the line between the two, by having events initially appear unexplained, but gradually make more and more sense over the course of the novel - as though Hagrid's "yer a wizard, Harry" reveal occurred during the third act of Harry Potter rather than the first. Therefore, it shouldn't be that hard to do rationalist magical realism - the explanation for the events just needs to be beyond anything a rationalist could uncover during the course of your story.
