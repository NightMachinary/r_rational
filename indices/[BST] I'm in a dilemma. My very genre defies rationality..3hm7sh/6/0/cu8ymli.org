The thing about magical realism is that /it's not magic/. It's a natural occurrence that just so happens to defy what rational minds gatekeep as the laws of nature, which is why there is no mystery to be solved on the part of the characters. It's only predictable so far as you can say "strange things are going to happen".

(Jose Arcadio's blood didn't dodge every piece of furniture it comes across. It dodged a particular character's rug because it didn't want to stain it. And here, blood having sentience is not a supernatural phenomenon, or even a phenomenon one expects to be replicated - it's just a thing that happens because a man is dead and his grandmother needs to know.)
