It's a bit of a cheat, but you can have rational characters in an inconsistent magical world. I mean, you have an entire community of rationalists here, but not all of us are trying to learn the laws behind physics and quantum mechanics (I know, I know, magic is more /useful/ than an understanding of physics, but I need an example). Apply the same thing to magic, the rules are too complex to learn in a short period of time or no one knows the rules in the first place.

You can even have your main character experiment a bit to show how hard or impossible it is to understand how to use magic. Of course this reduces magic to a plot device or source of conflict and the protagonist can't use it to win (else Deus Ex Machina).

TL;DR - Make the magic a source of conflict/plot device, and the protagonist has to save the day through other means.
