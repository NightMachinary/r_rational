  It's supposed to be insane. It's supposed to be inconsistent.

See, that's the crux of the problem. If you give rules, and make those rules discoverable to the reader, then you're moving out of the realm of traditional magical realism and towards just fantasy. If your rules aren't discoverable by the reader, then there's not really a point to having rules.

(As somewhat of a tangent, I would actually argue that vampires and werewolves can exist within magical realism so long as they're treated as mundane by the characters and text. Yeah, Bill is a werewolf, but no one makes a big deal about it. There's an argument to be made that "mundane fantastic" and "magical realism" are distinct things instead of overlapping, but I don't buy it.)

So yeah. Short answer, no, the genres are pretty much the antithesis of each other.
