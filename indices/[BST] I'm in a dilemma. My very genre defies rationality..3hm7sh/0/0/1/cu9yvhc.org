  It's supposed to be insane. It's supposed to be inconsistent. I'm just trying to find some rules, however loose, to restrain the damn thing and give me some peace of mind.

Let's say it runs on dream-logic or story-logic. What's the logic of a dream, or a story? Well, there's psychology to this: for one thing, the logic of a dream is often a lot like the way we /really/ model the world, but with our ability to use priors turned-off (Yvain once posted an article on that). So things that have absurdly low genuine probabilities but high likelihoods when priors are set to uniform 1 could happen in dreams.
