A project I was working on a while ago but put on hold centered around an omnipotent teenage boy who had been omnipotent his entire life, and therefore, in my opinion, couldn't be considered rational by definition, for several reasons:

1) Omnipotence from birth influences someone's mental development so much that they're essentially psychologically alien. It's only really a courtesy to the reader that everyone's speaking in English - it's just as likely that everyone would be speaking inexplicably comprehensible baby talk. I guess the character, as a baby, chose to make himself communicate like everyone else rather than the other way around.

2) Rationality is about optimizing victory. Omnipotence makes victory trivial, and seeing as the character had always been omnipotent, he wouldn't really have a concept of optimizing victory being a challenge.

3) The character completely lacks empathy, because they never had a reason to learn it.

The story as a whole wasn't even about defeating him - he's at least rational enough to keep himself invulnerable. The entire world was really just his internal struggle, and the story was a kind of dystopian thing about what it's like being stuck in his internal struggle as someone non-omnipotent.
