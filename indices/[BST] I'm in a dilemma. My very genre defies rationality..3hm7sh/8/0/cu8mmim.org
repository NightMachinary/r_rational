The magic itself is largely unpredictable, yes. Though there are some things I've been able to wrestle in, like only life paying for life.

What I'm trying to do is get the plot itself to stick to at least some amount of rationality. I'm trying to justify things without justifying them. I need a reason why, for instance, my main character's bucket of paint hurled at the climax of the story would give her the painting she needs instead of more chaos. I know most readers can suspend their disbelief and accept the fact that it's the climax and that's what happens at a climax, but I need it to make sense to myself at the least.
