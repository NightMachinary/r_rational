Maybe. It depends really. Does cause follow effect in your story, or do unspecified things just happen regardless of whatever? If cause follows effect and results can be extrapolated from actions with any degree of certainty, then you can have rational actors. If doing x mostly leads to y, then rational actors still have an advantage over others.

If however the rules of magic, aren't. If there is no structure to the effects. If throwing spells is the same as hurling a bucket of multicoloured paint where you could get a painting or chaos then not so much.
