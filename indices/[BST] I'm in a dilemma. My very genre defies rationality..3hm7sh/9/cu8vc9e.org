It's not impossible. From wikiing it the style is very much about magic being not explained. Not magic being irrational or such, but making the real seem supernatural and the supernatural seem mundane.

It would be very easy to investigate this magic. It run on narrative. It's a semi sentient force that does what is appropriate, and you could investigate how to effectively use it- what sort of curses worked on what sort of people, how much blood was needed for certain effects, where the best place to go to relax was.

After a bad day should you go to a field to dream with a flower? If you are cursed should you run away or try to shed your own blood to oppose the effect?

Those sort of questions are things you could ask. But you shouldn't, because that doesn't fit the style.

Instead, focus very hard on the human element.

Why is the villain attacking me? Why do they hate me? Who are they sending against me? How are they monitoring me? What's the best plan to stop this? How can I gather more resources? Who can I ally with?

As a background, in this world magic happens. It's unpredictable often enough, it's strange, people don't question it much. People have some normal ways of handling it. What do you do when you're pulled into a dream world? What do you do when a magical threat approaches?

All that is in the background, people have their normal responses, that's mundane and normal.

What's unusual is why whoever is angry at your protagonists is attacking and what flaws in herself and her allies enable that. Focus heavily on that social side and investigating that in a rational manner. How is she solving the problems that are happening in her life?

The magic shouldn't be random and meaningless. The yellow butterflies? Not that random. Yellow is repeatedly used as a colour of death. Jose Arcadio dies in a pool of yellow champagne, the suitor of Remedios with his yellow flower, Mauricio Babilonia had his yellow butterflies, when the founder of the town Jose Arcadio Buendia dies a rain of yellow flowers falls over the town, the yellow train brings the yellow banana company down which brings great death.

The magic should mirror the actions and futures of the characters, not be some alien force that opposes them. Magic should worsen the deaths of people who are flawed, intensify emotions, symbolize future events to the reader. It should mostly be fairly subtle, the sort of thing a poorly educated person might see as normal, with rare hints of something greater.
