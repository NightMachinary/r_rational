  It would be very easy to investigate this magic. It run on narrative. It's a semi sentient force that does what is appropriate, and you could investigate how to effectively use it- what sort of curses worked on what sort of people, how much blood was needed for certain effects, where the best place to go to relax was.

It doesn't run on narrative so much as it is a narrative device. Where in a non-genre book the story of Jose Arcadio's death might have been borne by mail or word of mouth, in that one his blood itself bears witness to his grandmother that he is dead. It's not something that any other grandmother and grandson combo can expect to replicate, since it's tied so strongly to their personal history, the manner of his death and the social circumstances surrounding his death. So in understanding it you learn that it's not something you can expect to use. I actually want to incorporate something like that into the story, where a character tries to replicate a particularly powerful supernatural event but eventually gives up the project after coming to understand that it's not possible (along with the associated character development, of course). I'm struggling to keep in style though, since if he starts acknowledging and questioning the mechanics of the supernatural it breaks the mood.

I definitely don't think that the magic in One Hundred Years is meaningless, and I don't expect mine to be. It is however /random/, in that although it's linked to the characters and their lives it's also completely beyond their control. They can observe it, but they rarely can touch it and almost never can call upon it. It's...something the /universe/ performs, not the characters. Like rain at a funeral, but more stylized, the yellow flowers that fall when Jose Arcadio dies might be symbolic, a lament...or they might just be rain.

My point is, it's difficult for me to get into the mindset of a fictional world where there /is/ powerful magic, where magic is an omen and an aide and a stumbling block, but the people involved are pretty much powerless to weaponize it. For some reason I keep imagining my characters with a wand in hand :/

  Why is the villain attacking me? Why do they hate me? Who are they sending against me? How are they monitoring me? What's the best plan to stop this? How can I gather more resources? Who can I ally with?

This is great! It's very much a coming-of-age story as well, and her quest to retrieve her brother (who's been kidnapped by a tyrant) is also her transition into adulthood. She picks up serious political clout along the way, though the fact that she never really asks /why/ the villain is attacking them comes back to bite her in the ass. Majorly.
