Well, that's a tough one then. Pratchett used to make the world run explicitly on narrativium to justify such things, but he's a hard act to follow. Any chance you could have her figure out how to throw the bucket just the right way earlier on in the story? It's a little contrived I suppose, though.

You could still have the characters be rational actors even if the world itself is chaotic. Choosing when and why to fight based on what will give them the best odds even if the worst could still beat the best by a stroke of chaotic luck.
