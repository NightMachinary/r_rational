If your blood is flowing across the street and dodging furniture, find out what it considers to be a street and what it considers to be furniture by doing various tests, and perhaps why it feels compelled to do so, and how. There is no such thing as an irrational thing that is supposed to happen, only a rule you haven't understood yet. Even if some sentient malevolent force is watching you try to determine its whim and actively dicking around with your results from behind the veil, /that's the rule/, and signaling will eventualy give /that/ away too, and then you're talking to the god of magic on its own terms.
