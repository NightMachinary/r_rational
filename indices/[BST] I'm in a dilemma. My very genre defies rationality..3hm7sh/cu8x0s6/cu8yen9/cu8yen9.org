Magical realist stories aren't fairy tales, and they can hardly be said to run on tropes or genre since they're by and large literary fiction.

Have you read Kafka's Metamorphosis? Or anything by Gabriel Garcia Marquez? Or by Haruki Murakami? It would be absurd to claim that the supernatural in any of those runs on standard tropes.
