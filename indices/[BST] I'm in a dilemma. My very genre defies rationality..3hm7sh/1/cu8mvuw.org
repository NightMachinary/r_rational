From my perspective, my favorite part of rational fiction is that characters show good habits of thought (all definitions on the sidebar are, after all, just one guy's opinion). This can absolutely be done in magical realism - things can still be magical and unexplained, it's just a matter of being sensible about them.

If peoples', say, cats are disappearing mysteriously, the typical rationalist story focuses on finding an explanation. But suppose that you have characters who are very sensibly trying to find an explanation, but no explanation is to be had, and so that part of their story must end with defeat and ambiguity. Can that still be magical realism? (I'm reminded of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3hm7sh/bst_im_in_a_dilemma_my_very_genre_defies/cu8mvuw][House]] of Leaves.)

Or suppose a person wants to achieve a thing, like escaping from small-town Quebec to move to the city where their older sister is, and mysterious and metaphorical events happen along the way. And further suppose that as a condition of the story, the character cannot be appropriately shocked or sidetracked by all this magic. Then still, your character can show good habits of thought, e.g. can ask "what do I want, what do I have, and how can I use the latter to get the former?", so long as they do it in mundane contexts.
