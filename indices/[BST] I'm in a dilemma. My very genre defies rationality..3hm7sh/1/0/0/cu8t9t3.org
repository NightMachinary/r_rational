Oh, I thought of one more way. When using magic-as-metaphor, you can also have rationaity-in-metaphor. If the blood flows across the street and pools at Grandmother's feet because her granddaughter cut herself, this can be a metaphor for children running to their family with injuries, and the family supporting the children. And so Grandma can be acting rational-in-metaphor if she soothes /the blood/, and promises it that everything will be alright, and coaxes it into a bowl to take back to the child, even though if blood actually pooled at your feet in real life, this behavior would be real weird.
