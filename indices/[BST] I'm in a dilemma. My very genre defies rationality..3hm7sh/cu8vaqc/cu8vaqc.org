On the other hand, you could potentially use a story like this a /deconstruct/ the rationalist ethos: you could argue that the universe inherently defies human comprehension, and that even if humans were capable of comprehending the workings of reality it would be better for us not to. That's somewhat like the Lovecraftian outlook, but I don't think a story like that has to be depressing.

I may or may not be working on a project along those lines.
