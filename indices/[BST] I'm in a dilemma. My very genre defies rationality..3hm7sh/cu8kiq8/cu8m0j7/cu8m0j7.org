Yes, I specifically mean traditional magical realism (for lack of a better phrase). The genre of One Hundred Years of Solitude, like I alluded to in my post. It's supposed to be insane. It's supposed to be inconsistent. I'm just trying to find some rules, however loose, to restrain the damn thing and give me some peace of mind.

It's hard because I know the moment I start explaining things the story is out of the genre and on its way to plain fantasy. Like the example you gave /would/ be cheating - in a traditional magical realist book vampires and /werewolves/ in particular would not exist. A character who eats raw bloody meat and growls and howls and can pick out the stranger in town by scent, yes, but once they're described as a being other than plain human that forms special pack dynamics then you've broken the mundanity.
