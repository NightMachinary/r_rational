If the story just runs on story logic, then you haven't really done anything rational with it; it's just a story. Stories that run on story logic are the default.

If you go meta and remark within the story that the story runs on story logic, then you're not doing magical realism, you're doing postmodernism. And if the story points out that it's running on story logic without actually doing anything with that fact aside from telling a story-logic story, it's doing postmodernism /badly/.
