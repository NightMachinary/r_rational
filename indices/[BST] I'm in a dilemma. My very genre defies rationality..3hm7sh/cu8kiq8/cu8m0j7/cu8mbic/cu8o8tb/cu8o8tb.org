I don't know, simply having rules to guide your planning can make a whole lot of difference in how believable your world is. I've come up with at least one basic rule: that all magic has a price. It's the mechanics of that price that I'm stuck on...

(Along that tangent, what I meant was that werewolf pack dynamics, with the associated seclusion, can't really exist in a magical realist world. Being in a pack is something that quickly becomes a central, primary part of a character's identity, which in turn hammers in the fact that /there's magic/ to the reader if not the other characters. Vampires are easier to do, since "drinks blood occasionally, doesn't eat in public, comes out at night" is much more whimsical.)
