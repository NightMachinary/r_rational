  Basically, do you think it's possible to inject rationality into a fairy tale world /that's explicitly written in a fabulist style?/

In short? No.

Okay, let me back up a little. "Magical realism" has a lot of definitions, some of which contradict each other. But if you specifically mean magical realism in the sense that there are unexplained things going on which aren't given due examination, then I think that's a genre directly opposed to rational fiction. It's the opposite of "sane and consistent". (This is totally fine for that kind of fiction, it's just not rational.)

Now, some other definitions of magical realism I think you can do as "rational". If you mean "magical realism" as "the supernatural contextualized as mundane" that's totally doable; you can write a story with werewolves and vampires as just part of everyday life, following distinct rules but not surprising to anyone or remarked on as strange. But I've always thought of that as "weak" magical realism.

I would welcome some counterexamples of "rational" magical realism though, if anyone has them.
