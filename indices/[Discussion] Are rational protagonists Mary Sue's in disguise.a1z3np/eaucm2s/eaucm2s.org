I'm not a writer, and maybe this is just me having terrible taste or something, but I honestly think that people in fandoms nowadays have an out of proportion aversion to Mary Sues as overcompensation. Yes, there's definitely a point where Mary-Sue traits become noticeable and annoying. But that point is pretty high. Unless you're writing slice-of-life or something, your character is the hero of their story, they're going to be doing incredible things. They should be more talented than the average dude, they should have fewer flaws, it's okay if they get the occasional crushing victory. This goes double if you're writing original fiction- the main issue with Mary Sues imo is that they're OCs who warp the story to be around them but because they're OCs they don't fit with it, have as much of a stake as our canon protagonists, etc.

Remember that Harry Potter, Superman, Ender Wiggin, etc. none of these are Mary Sues, or if they are they're Mary Sues millions of people like just fine.

My preferred Mary Sues test: 1) Is your character Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way? If yes- your character is a Mary Sue! If no- you're probably fine.
