These qualities are very uniquely common is rational writing, they're just more common than you'd normally see in other online writing. These are all qualities that are vastly more common among actual published writing than internet writing (especially less polished stuff), and the more "serious" the writing the more common these qualities seem to be.

There's a reason there's been several different posts on this subreddit that were basically "Are the qualities of rational writing just qualities of good writing generally?" (to which the answer is always /sort of/). If these qualities seem especially endemic to rational writing to you, then it's because the non-rational stuff you consume isn't trying particularly hard to be "serious" or "realistic", because in say literary fiction for instance these qualities sort of seem like the default.
