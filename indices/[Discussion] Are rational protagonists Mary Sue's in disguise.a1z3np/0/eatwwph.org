Here's my two cents, as someone who's a fellow lurker and a reader and writer of a lot of fiction in general.

To be rational, your character doesn't have to be hyper-intelligent, or fit into certain personality types. They just have to make the best choice possible for themselves with the best information they have. Other traits /can/ be added to this, like giving them curiosity to find out more information in order to make more informed choices, but nearly any personality could fit under that umbrella.

Too often rationalist fic writers go for the "I'm smarter than everyone else and always make the best choices and always succeed, except for that one time I failed to prove I'm not perfect" protagonist, and I'd argue that yes, that's a Mary Sue. However, that problem isn't fixed by giving them more flaws. An unattractive stuck up hyper intelligent person is still just as annoying to the audience. The problem is solved by giving them more personality, so readers have more to like about them than them just being brains on a stick.

As for the rest, I think you're experiencing what a lot of people go through when you first start dissecting a creative field. You learn about shot composition, and suddenly you can't stop looking at how things are framed in movies. You learn about the three act structure, and suddenly you see it everywhere. You struggle with introducing characters to a scene, and suddenly you take note of every character introduction. It breaks the magic for a bit, yeah. But eventually you can get to a point where you can both analyze a piece of media /and/ appreciate it in the moment.
