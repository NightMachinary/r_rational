I think you need to understand the common definition of Mary Sue and rexamine these points. Mary Sue's are generally defined by a lack of real challenge. This means that they don't significantly struggle with external or internal problems. Rational characters aren't inherently like this, but also aren't immune to this by definition.

Mary Sue rational characters use their rationality to easily solve all problems encountered while never having to significantly change or examine themselves.

Non-Mary Sue rational characters use their thinking as a tool to solve the problems facing them, and adapt themselves to new challenges in an attempt to meet them.

"Hitting a character with the rationality stick" would tend to make Mary Sue's just like giving main characters power ups without similarly powerful challenges to use them against. The best rationality stories avoid this with powerful challenges, HPMOR generally makes everyone more rational so they are better challenges for example. Other stories have non-rational villians be more experienced and entrenched in the setting than the protagonist for example

Using your knowledge of how stories tend to flow to predict them can lessen your enjoyment of some works for sure, but the best works hide or avoid common paths making them more interesting or are done so well you don't mind their predictability. (The movie Avatar springs to mind as very easy to predict, but still very worthwhile to watch for example)
