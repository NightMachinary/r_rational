(Brief luck contemplation: In reality, with impartiality guaranteed, luck is accepted. In fiction, I feel the hand of the narrator in every big-or-small exertion of luck, more so when it drives a plot forward in some way. Even if contrarily lacking realism as a result, it becomes more viscerally satisfying when every step climbed is like in Chess, a will-imposed-on-the-world consequence of the character's own thought processes and choices, rather than closer to reality where chance can be the pebble that alters the flow of events.)

​

Edit:

​

Power vs Price: Noted by others, but this is indeed frustrating, and nice when subverted. For instance, hidden magic or secrets, and knowing that narratively nothing will ever be allowed to get to the point where it threatens the status quo of the overall world/Masquerade; wonderfully refreshing when things actually do barrel ahead unstopped, overturning the chessboard and throwing the context-world into chaos. Hmm, note that it can also be fun sometimes to have stories where one person has an unconquerable cheat, and while 'winning' with it isn't always fast, there's no (need for) suspense about the ultimate outcome. For instance, if you can always go back to an earlier time with no fear of death, an example of possible interest interest instead being the use of that to tease out murder culprits' evidence or other mysteries while no one else has any idea of one's game-changing power. There can be limitations to make it more life-risking, but there don't have to be in order to enjoy the psychological interplay of different motivations and behaviours.

​

Appearance & Mentality: Maybe something digressing from the original line of thought, but when it comes to personalities thinking in terms of 'perfect'/'personality problem'/'good personality' may be limiting oneself to a rather one-dimensional perspective, in which you start with a 'perfect personality' and then treat any possible changes as detracting from perfection and thus making it worse. There are lots of different personalities/minds/outlooks that you can have, without having to cast differences as flaws. For instance, a deontological outlook (prevent wrong actions) compared with with a utilitarian outlook (lessen wrong outcomes). Fleshing out personalities, you can have a compassionate person A who views person B as unscrupulous and nihilistic, and practical person B who views person A as naïve and narrow-minded. (Perhaps a 'hero and antihero' comparison.) They can clash, and both their courses of behaviour can go wrong in ways that they're not happy with--the person A showed mercy to took revenge for humiliation; B thoroughly eliminating a potential future enemy earned the condemnation and alienation of society and a friend--but you don't have to write one personality type as a a paragon who can do no wrong, and you don't have to write the other as the protagonist-but-wearing-blinkers, and you don't have to write both as some third person, wearing different blinkers for A and B, who without them would have made the 'best' choice in every situation. Each person makes different choices according to their own value systems and desired outcomes, and it's arguably best (for me?) if a reader can fully sympathise with all sides.

​

A&M addendum: I'm put in mind by contrast of a certain idiotic-and-belligerent type of cannon fodder seen in a certain type of story. I smile in disapproval when something painful happens to a character and that character immediately starts smashing lots of their own expensive belongings--something by this point seen in many different stories, though of that same type--with the thought "Ah, this author is doing this too, just in case the readers were in danger of almost relating to that character for a moment.". (Now, smashing the hard-to-replace valued belongings of the person who /caused/ the painful thing, that would make a little sense, even if still foolish...)
