I don't think of negative traits as something annoying to tack on I'm saying how do I avoid these traits looking like something negative that I've tacked on my examples where exaggerated to emphasize my point yours are much better but from a perspective of analyzing my own work could you see how even the examples you've provided could appear to me as playing whack a mole attribute addition?

this may be an invented problem by myself to find fault in my own work.
