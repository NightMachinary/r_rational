Thanks for the reply I'm a big Worth the Candle fan. I think it was a mistake using Mary Sue the way I did, I meant it as hyperbole for a very capable character with no surface level flaws when it's become obvious it means something very different.

I guess I'm mainly interested in how you create a character who presents to the reader as highly capable without making it seem like any negative attributes I assign to the character looking like a piss-poor attempt at obfuscating the characters capability instead of the intended creation of nuance.
