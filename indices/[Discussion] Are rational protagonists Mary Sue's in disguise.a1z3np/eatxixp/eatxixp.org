1. No.

2. A Mary Sue is a narrative black hole, from which no light escapes. Everyone's narrative arcs, characterization, and thinking is warped in the presence of the Mary Sue, bending in service of making the Mary Sue as awesomely awesome as possible. Smart people get dumb around the Mary Sue. Confident people quake in their boots. Seasoned veterans tremble in awe at the combat prowess of the Mary Sue.

   It's pretty easy not to do this, if you're paying attention to what your characters would /actually/ do, especially those who aren't the protagonist, so long as you have good models for those characters in your head. So long as the protagonist isn't warping things around them in detectable, unnatural ways, it's not a Mary Sue.

3. Adjacent to that is the concept of a character who's 'too perfect'. They /don't/ warp people around them, but they're still far above average in almost every respect. They're smart, funny, educated, dedicated, wealthy, and attractive. Leaving aside the statistically correlated stuff there, there are a few reasons that this is problem within the narrative. First, it usually doesn't serve a purpose within the narrative, and is boring to read. Someone who is all 10s in every category is difficult to characterize, and because characterization /should/ be tied to plot, that's a major problem for the narrative. The second issue is that it can read as wish fulfillment. While there's nothing wrong with wish fulfillment per se, it tends to be boring because it's lacking in tension, and writing wish fulfillment that doesn't come off as brainless popcorn is tough, largely because you don't have as much texture to work with.

4. Specially with regards to rational fiction, my own opinion is that all you really need to do is show someone thinking things through in a realistic, intelligent way. You don't need them to be wicked smart, you don't need them to get it right every time, and you certainly don't need them to be some uber-mensch wunderkind.
