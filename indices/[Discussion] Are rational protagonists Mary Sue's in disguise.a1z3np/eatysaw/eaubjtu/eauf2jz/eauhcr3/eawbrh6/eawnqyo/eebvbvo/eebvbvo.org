Oh, yes. In a serious story, admitting a flaw doesn't make it not a flaw, it just communicates "Yes, the author of the story is aware that this is a flaw" so that the author isn't blamed for not noticing.

In the skull example humour is the primary aim for all things in the fiction, but in the pigeon example one could imagine an intended-to-be-serious story, but which the author /really wants/ there to be a T-Rex in, even though the author can't think of any convincingly plausible reason for there to be, and knows that readers will identify that it doesn't make sense no matter what. Self-deprecatingly laughing about it, rather than just having the experiencing character/s be ignorant, avoids the worst criticism by admitting to the flaw before being called out on it by others.
