Your description of qualities as being Sue-ish here is kind of infuriating, because the qualities you describe are either not any more common in Sue-ish stories than any others, or are actively the opposite of being Mary Sue.

Having characters which are neither perfect or completely unreadable has nothing to do with that character being a Mary Sue. Firstly this is just a property of writing in general, that if you can make a perfect or irredeemable character interesting as a protagonist it's so hard it's rarely attempted by good authors. Plus not having any flaws actually relevant to the plot (ie one's that actually hinder them) is a pretty quintessentially Sue-ish quality.

As for the character's actions having negative consequences; again this is the exact opposite of what you would expect in a Mary Sue story. This is also another quality which while not /necessary/ for a story to be great is still much more indicative of good stories than bad ones.

Not having deus ex machina's is also another example of something that is the opposite of what you'd expect from Sue-ish stories. It's just usually indicative of good writing in general, because deus ex machina's almost always feel cheap and are often/usually the result of author laziness.
