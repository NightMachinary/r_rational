Really if you just wanted to talk about these particular qualities of rational writing there would be much better ways to frame them. For instance as I alluded to pretty much all these qualities are really just things that are generally perceived as being good writing and genuinely are correlated with better writing quality.

So you could have framed this as "How much should we adhere to what common wisdom considers good writing?" which is equally likely to get clicks I would imagine and isn't just false clickbait.
