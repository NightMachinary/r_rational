That's certainly a different theme from having unexpected things happen and then having clever adaptation to the new circumstances determine the outcome. If it really is down to unforeseen variables, then the general theme and feel of the story becomes "planning and cleverness are overrated", which is fine if you want to tell a story about how capricious life is or how control is an illusion. It's just a different kind of story.
