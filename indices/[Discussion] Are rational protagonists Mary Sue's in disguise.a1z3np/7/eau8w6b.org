Mary-Sue... I don't think that term means what you think it means.

/First,/ a MS is not perfect or flawless. One of their major flaws is an utter unawareness of their flaws. If the author is unaware of the flaws it's only because of the self-insert nature of the protagonist and a certain level of pride that only teenagers and very sheltered young adults arr capable of. Everyone else recognizes the flaws on some level, including older versions of the author.

MS characters in mainstream fiction avoid the label by being full of self-doubt. Look at works popular with teenage girls for some examples (and considering women drive 30% more purchasing decisions, and fathers of girls are total weaklings when it comes to saying no, that's a great demographic to try to appeal to).

/Second,/ MS characters are defined by a plot that bends over backwards to fulfill their wishes and fantasies. For example a MS might have an irredeemably abrasive personality as well as a harem that includes Cpt. Picard, Megan Fox, and the Pope. If the plot doesn't bend for them, they're not a MS.

Some examples of this near miss can be found in day time tv comic relief characters. They ignore their flaws and it bites them in the ass. Lassie in the first season of Psych comes to mind, though he eventually gains some self awareness and starts to try to work out his issues.

The combination of arrogance and undeserved privilege are what come together to make a very unpleasant character, and it is so potent that it got its own name (hold on there's an irony or pun in there, ah well it's too hidden for me to find).

As long as you keep clear of that cliff, you have miles of room for how powerful or lucky your characters can be. Consider the Loopers in MoL, adult Son Goku, and Comics Golden Age Super Man. None of them fit the MS trope despite being Gods among men, simply because the plot only does what they want when they make it do so.

As for deus ex machina. Would it take an act of a god who has thus far been absent from the story to make the event happen? Bad. Could an astute reader have figured it out had they been aware of some events that happened offscreen, and were within the realm of previously introduced character capabilities and likely types of actions? Good. The miles of space between? Also probably good.
