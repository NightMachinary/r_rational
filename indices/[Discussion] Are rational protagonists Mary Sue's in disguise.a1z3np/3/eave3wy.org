A rule I used in HPMOR is that at least one character is better than Harry at any particular thing that Harry does, or has more of any positive trait. Not that Harry is necessarily bad at it, the other character is just better. Even when it comes to an attribute like startling weirdness, Dumbledore still has him beat. This doesn't shadow Harry since no other character strictly dominates his combination, but it gives him something to learn everywhere. The sole exception is that Harry has read more explicit science (though Hermione is catching up) and that is not actually most of what the story is about, even if it appears in many chapter titles.

Of course, this trick relies on telling a large enough and deep enough story that your character can be defined by many interesting positive qualities, instead of one or two big “character-defining” traits; and to do that you need to understand multiple virtues deeply enough to write them in ways that seem fresh, which is a large ask and one that can't be filled by writing artifice alone.

A problem you might be having is that you have no idea how to show somebody being very good at something without being perfect, and therefore think in terms of giving them artificial “flaws”. Can you remember a time when you were very good at something but still had a lot more to learn?
