In a world where only one person is capable of intelligent planning, that's a heck of an over-powered ability. As you pointed out, works like Worm (and pretty much everything else Wildbow has written) do an excellent job of making sure characters other than the protagonist can think too. That is a good safeguard against ending up with a rational Mary Sue.
