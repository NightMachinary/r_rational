A character is only overpowered if they're overpowered relative to the rest of the cast. If you give Frodo a lightsaber, you must give Sauron a deathstar. As a characters' capabilities increase, so should the challenges they face.

Also, I suspect rational fiction is influenced by a founder effect on the kinds of protagonists that its readers empathize with most. If Lesswrong had been targeted at an audience of business people and self-improvement health nuts instead of STEM-specialists and Harry Potter fans, we'd likely be seeing a very different breed of rationalist. And that would probably be reflected in the kinds of protagonists we typically see in rationalist fiction.
