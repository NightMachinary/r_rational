  But eventually you can get to a point where you can both analyze a piece of media /and/ appreciate it in the moment.

You're dead right that this is a problem I have I've thought about it before but I don't know if it's an eventuality with me. Personally I find that I know when something is truly enjoyable and good because I'm so immersed in the media that I don't analyze it. It's usually when I start picking something apart and criticizing something that leads to me to consciously acknowledge that I'm not enjoying it.
