  To be rational, your character doesn't have to be hyper-intelligent, or fit into certain personality types. They just have to make the best choice possible for themselves with the best information they have.

This could be literally everyone all the time, if you interpret it broadly enough.

Rationality has to do with making optimal decisions by overcoming natural biases - that is picking the best choice *despite* other influences.

So the character has to do more than just pick based on their motivations and values and information at any given moment - they have to be self aware enough to decide rationally, to overcome bias and irrational self deception.

This requires some base-level of intelligence, otherwise they wouldn't be capable of identifying and counteracting their biases.
