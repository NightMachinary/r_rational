I want to add on to the above's suggestion of having more personality.

Humans are contradictory, and that is not irrational. Even Bayes thinking is being able to hold possibly mutually exclusive world views while adding evidence to figure out which is less wrong. But, every plausible reality is treated as true.

In humans, we have loads of different motivations and situational views, and whether or not there is an underlining theory of every view, each one exist for a reason. (Rational self reflection would be to examine them and see if any should be removed, or if there is the unifying view.)

In this way, when a character has multiple rational directions that lead to mutually exclusive actions, there is drama.

A character cannot always choose the "best" option, because what that looks like is different for everyone and for the different internal motivations. In Mary Sue stories, other worthwhile options are not presented, the Mary Sue has only one view, making that the ideal, and thus the only option, and flat.

Likewise, in your post, you mentioned something about commensurate negative outcomes to balance positive ones. That feels like if the universe were 'fair' and/or there were a deity keeping the scales balanced. But the real world seems to not be that. Innocent people die, immoral people get masses of power and are never punished. Now in stories, authors tend to go that route (escapism?), especially to prevent the Disney "always a happy ending" or the George Martin "never invest in a character, for their pages are limited".

However, with that said, a satisfying rational fiction can exist without anyone dying (it has been years since any of my coworkers died on the job).

Final note, one of the reasons I love the show Leverage, is that almost everyone acts in a way that makes sense for their own motivations. Unlike some of the questionable Rational Fiction where there is only one rational actor. When only one person makes sense, then of course they are going to end up powerful and always right.
