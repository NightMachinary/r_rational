Maybe you could find some joy in "picking apart" things you enjoy as well as things you don't like? I find that I appreciate good works a lot more when I can see all the clever things they're doing and let myself get hyped up for them.

For example, I recently finished playing God of War and there was a moment near the end that built up the power of the villain in a cool way. As soon as the scene started I realized what was the function of the scene was ("this is a scene to show how powerful the bad guy is"), but it was executed so well I was loving it and taking notes in case I need something similar in my own projects.
