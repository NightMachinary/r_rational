I don't necessarily think rationalist protagonists are often Mary Sues, so much as I think the process of "thinking rationally" is often treated as an unrealistic power fantasy.

In the worse examples of this, we see the main protagonist as basically the only person who is able to think and reason at a high level. The story becomes more or less a series of obstacles which only the smart protagonist can overcome with their superior intellect and the rest of the characters are relegated to bit players whose actions ultimately don't matter outside of the way the protagonist chooses to utilize them. (I'd say this is a trap that stories like HPMoR /almost/ fall into. The saving grace being that there are other major players who the hero is initially dismissive of who are playing at or above his level the whole time.)

But, IMO, the better constructed stories have main characters whose rationality isn't necessarily their defining feature. They're not just fountains of knowledge and wisdom whose sole purpose is to solve all the problems that the other characters are too stupid to solve. Instead they're just relatively intelligent people who make the best decisions they can with sometimes flawed information that sometimes turns out well for them and sometimes turns out poorly. They make decisions that you the reader might even disagree with, but you can always follow their logic and understand why they made those decisions. And the supporting cast of characters sometimes will even outshine the main charcters with their planning and contributions to solving issues. (I would say a story like Worm, or Worth the Candle falls more into this category)

Even in most stories that fall into the first category, the majority of authors will still give their characters some non-superficial flaws that take them out of the realm of a Mary Sue. A common flaw seeming to be that the characters are good at solving logic problems, but bad at reading people and dealing with interpersonal issues.

So personally I'd define the issue with a lot of rational fiction to be more of an issue with unrealistic power fantasies, than one of pure characterization. Not that power fantasies are inherently bad, but when they go too far, they kind of ruin the enjoyment for me.
