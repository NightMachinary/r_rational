Make more characters "rational" than the protagonist, perhaps in different ways, or as different realizations of the same ideals, etc. (This where most people say "Especially the antagonist", but I'm a fan of the Martian, and I think that maybe a story with more than two characters should be about more than two characters.)

*Luck*

1. One can use (a few) strategies which are unlikely to succeed, but possess high expected utility.

2. Not all plans have to succeed, so not all plans have to be designed to succeed. ("If making a perpetual machine doesn't work, maybe you can learn something new about physics from how it doesn't.")
