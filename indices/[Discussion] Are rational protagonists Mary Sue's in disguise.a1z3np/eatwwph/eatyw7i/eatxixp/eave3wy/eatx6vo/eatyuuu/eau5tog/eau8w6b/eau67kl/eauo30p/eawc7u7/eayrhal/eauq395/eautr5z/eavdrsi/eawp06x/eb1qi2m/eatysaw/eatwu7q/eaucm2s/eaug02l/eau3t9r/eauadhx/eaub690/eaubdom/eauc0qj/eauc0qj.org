Oh yeah, there are definitely better ways to frame them for sure I did say this was my first post here and it is a post ostensibly about dispelling some of my own ignorance around the subject's I brought up. Yes these are qualities generally perceived as being good writing but the specific ones I brought up seem to be endemic specifically to rational writing or at least they have a lot more importance put upon them and are less forgiven when not adhered to I'm sorry if I didn't get that across as well as I thought I did.

Also, the false clickbait was just a bit of a shit joke and if this low level of harmless clickbait affects you then the rest of the internet must send you into violent fits.
