Rationalist protagonists can easily have undertones of Mary Sue to them because of the inherent traits of the rationalist... subgenre.... thing. They have tones of being didactic, and are written under the assumption that a certain way of viewing the world, rationality, is true. So if you choose to have your story star a rationalist protagonist, who is a rationalist from the outset, you may be writing a protagonist who coming out of the gate is correctly aligned with the works ideological reality. Mary Sue characters are the same way, the way that they see the world and act in it is the correct way. So what else can they do in a story but be right and win all the time?

Now, this doesn't mean that writing a character who agrees with the story's ideological universe is invalid. Most superhero fiction operates on the base assumption is that fighting crime is good, and people with superpowers should do so. But the big difference is that most superhero fiction doesn't ruminate on it the way rational fiction. They say "punching baddies is good" and don't belabour the point. So it's easier to ignore.

How you can avoid this? Well, one thing is to ask whether even if your story is rational does your protagonist need to be, can he not just develop to be so over the course of a story? A second is to just not worry so much about the story being rational, because actively trying to be a thing makes it more likely for you to hit the pitfalls of that thing.
