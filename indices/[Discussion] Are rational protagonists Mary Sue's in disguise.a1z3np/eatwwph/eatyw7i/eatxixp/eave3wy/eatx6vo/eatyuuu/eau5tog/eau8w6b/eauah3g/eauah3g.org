I was going to upvote you, then you mentioned psych and I was angry I couldn't upvote you twice. thanks for that you're right I definitely did not use Mary Sue correctly I guess I used it because to me it was the closest phrase I could use to mean conventionally perfect/flawless character. although in my defense from my last few hours of googling there does seem to a lack of a definite definition so i feel a bit more comfortable in my ignorance. It is interesting though, on this subreddit at least that the most important part of the Mary Sue definition is the warping of the narrative to suit the character.
