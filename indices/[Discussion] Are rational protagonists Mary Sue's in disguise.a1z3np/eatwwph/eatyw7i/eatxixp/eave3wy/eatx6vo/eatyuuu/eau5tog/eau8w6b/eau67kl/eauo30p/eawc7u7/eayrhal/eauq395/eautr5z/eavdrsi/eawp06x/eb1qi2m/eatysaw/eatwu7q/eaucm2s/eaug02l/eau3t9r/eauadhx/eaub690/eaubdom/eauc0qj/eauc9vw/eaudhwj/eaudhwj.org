Sure literary fiction is more adherent to the qualities I bring up overall but the thing I like about what we're terming 'rational fiction' is that to me it kinda comes off as genre fiction through the lens of literary fiction. Which to me at least is rather unique especially for online writing, with this post I was only attempting to learn and dispel some of my ignorance around the subject. I'm sorry if I'm reading the tone of your replies wrong it does happen with text conversations, but it comes off too me like you're annoyed at me for trying to learn? in which case I can only apologize...
