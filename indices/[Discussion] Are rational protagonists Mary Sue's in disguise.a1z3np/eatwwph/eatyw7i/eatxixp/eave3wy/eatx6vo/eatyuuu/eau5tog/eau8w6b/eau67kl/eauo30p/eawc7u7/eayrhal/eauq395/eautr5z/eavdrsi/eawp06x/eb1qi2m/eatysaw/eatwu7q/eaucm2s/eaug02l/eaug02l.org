What's wrong with being a Mary Sue? I suspect that Mary Sue only falls flat when readers dislike them personally.

One of the most popular fanfictions of all time, Paradise Lost, is about an angsty rebellious protagonist with unique magical powers who becomes a king of a whole realm due to rebelling against literal God and not immediately dying.

Main character of Harry Potter, a fairly popular book, is a flat nothing as far as character goes, but is revealed to have a Unique Power or Special Talent in practically every book in a sequence which defies all probability, and finishes with him surviving a /direct killing curse/ just because he is so awesome.

Honorary mention goes to Waves Arisen, which has an absolutely awesome portrayal of a protagonist that doesn't fall into one of those super stupid "we have to have a fight between teammates because we can't use basic English to talk about it instead" moments, and I will fight anyone who says it's not amazing.

Personally, I'd gladly read a ratfic about a character who was just competence personified, even if they had absolutely no "oh so necessary" character flaws, just to see if that writing advice is actually true or if it is just one of those things accepted as true.
