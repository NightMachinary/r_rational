I was more trying to understand whether its enjoyable to you as a reader of rational fiction if let's say there was a conflict between a protagonist and antagonist with established variables and the protagonist attempts to outwit the antagonist using those variables only to fail but still achieve victory due to some interaction of those variables that neither foresaw. I guess it's difficult to picture this without a more coherent example I guess its very close to being a deus ex machina but one that the reader is able to predict and the author is able to foreshadow but is not an outcome of the protagonist's decisions, would that be a gratifying outcome to a conflict for the reader?
