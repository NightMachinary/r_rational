Personally, I think you could solve a lot of your problems with writing, by thinking of it like this:

Rational stories aren't fun because the main character is a bit of a Mary Sue. Rational stories are fun, because there are a lot of "Mary Sue" style characters, all exceptional in different ways, all competing and clashing and arguing. To overcome your writing problem, maybe make a few main 'rational' characters who could have, theoretically, been the main character. Make them all different. And then pick the one you want to actually write the story about only after you've fleshed out all three, for example.

Like in HPMOR. It's not just fun because Harry is rational. It's fun because Dumbledore is rational, and Quirrel is rational, and Hermione and Draco are both, in their own ways, rational. All of the above characters theoretically could have been the main character, and it could have still been a rational story. It would have been a different story, with a much different tone, if Hermione or Draco had been the lead, but it could have done, and with the way the characters are written it still would have been fairly rational.

To me, that is the crux of good rational writing. Rational protagonists often seem like Mary Sues when compared to normal characters. And the best way, I think, to fight that is to just keep on adding rational agents to the story. The best rational stories have very few dedicated 'side' characters. Worm has such a large cast, precisely because the author keeps introducing new, smart people, all working on their own agendas. The best parts of HPMOR are when Draco, Hermione, and Harry are all scheming against each other, all with varying degrees of cunning, intelligence, and rationality. A well-developed cast is what makes or breaks a story; if you're character is the only rational person in the work, then of course they're going to seem like a Mary Sue. But if their Big Bad is rational, and their rival is rational, and their friend is rational, then nobody is going to notice, because it's hard to accuses a character of being a Mary Sue when they get countered and beaten by equally gifted peers. Like how in HPMOR, Harry doesn't always win, because everybody else is also allowed to be smart.

Essentially, what I'm trying to say is this; if your aim is to write a truly good rational fic, then I personally believe that the main feature that sets your protagonist apart from the rest, should not be their intelligence. I love rational stories because they allow the world and setting to be rational, not just the main character. Your main character should not be the Chosen One because they're really clever; that's a bit too on the nose. Instead come up with something else that makes your protagonist special, so that everyone can be clever. Let their rival come up with cunning plans that trap them. Let the Big Bad actually try to hide information from them, so that their plans can be truly surprising. Let the evil enemy spy actually be scarily competent, so that logical thinking isn't enough to uncover their identity. Don't write a rational Mary Sue in a dumb world. Write a rational agent, in a rational world, and let things play out organically.

The best example I can think of this being done in mainstream fiction is A Song of Ice and Fire, where the main characters routinely get killed precisely because they forget about this. People lose wars because they forget their bannermen aren't robots that have to be loyal, but living, breathing people who are going to look out for their own skin. People get betrayed by their own soldiers, because they forget to properly communicate and inspire them, and instead treat them like machines. The kings who choose to not bother with the scheming get murdered by the ones who do, because just assuming loyalty in this series is deadly. And while all the in-fighting and scheming is going on in Westeros, a girl across the sea is raising dragons and a guy in the north is raising a zombie army, because the best thing about a rational story is when the main characters get ganked by an enemy that was working out of their point of view the entire time. The books could actually, in a way, just be titled "Everybody Else is Allowed to be Clever too, the series", and it would work.
