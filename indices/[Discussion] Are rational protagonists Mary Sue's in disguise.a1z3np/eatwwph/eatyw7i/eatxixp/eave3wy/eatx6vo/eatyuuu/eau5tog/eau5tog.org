Luck is fine, cure the annoyingness of deus ex by either the narrative or the character acknowledgong that it happened.

If you're narrative arc doesn't naturally create drama post resolution your go getter protagonist can maintain drama after winning by /voluntarily/ taking on a new bigger project via there augmented powers. The plot doesn't necessarily have to be forced upon them to punish them for success (To give one example of how to deal with this).

Don't play whack a mole with personality traits to create flaws. If you're straying into Mary Sue territory I suggest making /every/ character a perfect Mary Sue... according to someone's view of perfection. Unless you're intentionally writing a very impaired individual that everyone in the story recognizes as such, you should not start with perfection then ko a personality trait... You should be working at full throttle to simulate various flavors of people trying their best to be perfect interacting. If you're doing this right i think you should be running flush up against the limits of your /own/ conceptions of perfection (genuinely wondering what the right action would be in the character's shoes, and having different characters choose different good answers among the ones you come up with) , and your character's flaws and conflicts almost reflect your own internal uncertainties (or modeled off of the visions of perfection of people that you know very well). After that you can add normal wobbles like losing temper and so on, nothing as heavy handed as hacking off an entire personality trait.
