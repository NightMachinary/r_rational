This is something that I've been thinking about too while writing my own fic. I'll admit happily that I don't think of course it's entirely /realistic/ for things to go as well as they do to my protagonist - after all, real life has no "protagonists" at all, anyone can die at a moment's notice or lose because of a simple stroke of bad luck. "And after conquering most of the enemy's country, the general died of a stroke before the capital city fell to his siege" would make for a terribly anticlimactic story, but it can certainly happen.

My solution to it is, to pretend that fiction, especially fiction that's trying to be entertaining, can ever be /fully/ realistic is nonsense; there's always going to be something, if only the fact that a story makes sense on a grand thematic level while real life doesn't. A story is like life would be if there was a God actually holding the wires. And a lot of rational protagonists certainly are designed to illustrate the qualities that characterise them and thus are pitted against challenges and opponents that suit them. If Harry Potter-Evans was faced with an angry Hulk with no prep time or warning and no wand he'd simply be dead, no matter how much he thought. But that doesn't mean they have to be Mary Sues or Gary Stus. They still can have flaws, make mistakes, interact in the world in ways more interesting than just "always wins". It's a bit like, say, superhero stories. Most superhero stories end with the good guys winning, but that doesn't mean that all superheroes are equally Mary Sue-ish.
