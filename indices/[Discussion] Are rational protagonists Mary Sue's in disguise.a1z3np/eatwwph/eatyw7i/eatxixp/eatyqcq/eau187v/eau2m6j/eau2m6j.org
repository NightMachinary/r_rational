  I guess I'm mainly interested in how you create a character who presents to the reader as highly capable without making it seem like any negative attributes I assign to the character looking like a piss-poor attempt at obfuscating the characters capability instead of the intended creation of nuance.

Easiest way is to make it relevant to the plot, or to their interactions with other characters. If the highlighted trait is 'capable', then we want a 'but' in there, with the particular flaw being something that ideally works at a tension with whatever trait we're highlighting.

'capable but insecure' = double and triple checks their work, has difficulty accepting assurances of others, has a hard time making friends

'capable but jealous' = makes rash decisions against rivals, rushes to publication, cruel and vindictive about the flaws of people seen as equals

'capable but rebellious' = self-sabotaging in situations with authorities, difficulty getting establishment trust/respect, prone to saying the wrong thing for the sake of individuality

Note that these characters would only barely be two dimensional, but that's better than nothing. Ideally you think up reasons for their foibles and ways that they can either overcome them or come to terms with them, which then ties in with your plot somehow. If someone is capable but insecure, then it's pleasing for that insecurity to be rooted somewhere that gets revealed to the reader, and to have some way for that insecurity to be overcome. If you say "this character is extremely capable but insecure" and then never actually show that insecurity or have it come up, that's what looks problematic.

(I'd also not that you don't have to undercut capability if you don't want to, so long as you can find some axis on which you think either direction is perfectly sound, or where preference for some approach doesn't actually make them worse, so long as that preference can still have impact and drive tension/conflict.)
