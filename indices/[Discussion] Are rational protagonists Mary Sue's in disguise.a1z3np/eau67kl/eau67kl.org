Obviously this is all my opinion...

Appearance & Mentality

It shouldnt really be a give & take kind of balance. It should be an interesting balance that makes aspects of the story interesting. Take a real life example, I have a friend on the high side of intelligence and she rarely comes across a problem that she cannot solve. She knows 3 styles of martial arts and is a fairly accurate shot with a .357. She is also physically attractive enough that guys will sometimes stop in shock when she walks by and start obsessively stalking her, dic pics and all. She is fun and interesting to talk to as well.

That isnt interesting and based off of that information alone, she would make an extremely boring Mary-Sue as a literary character. Giving her a few warts or a propensity to be cruel wouldn't solve the inherent story issues of such a character...

However, if you add-in that she am legally blind in her right eye (which isn't due to a visible defect), has an extreme phobia of dogs, and a minor terror of water that she cannot see the bottom of, things get more interesting. Not because she has a few negative traits, but because they arent immediately apparent and could be brought out in relevant areas of the story. Most importantly in a "real" character, these flaws mostly have little to do with her strengths. Because real people are not balanced so carefully.

Effectively, the answer is yes. Starting off with a stereotypical Mary-Sue can work great and is arguably more interesting in subverting expectations. Especially when you drop her in a lake and she starts screaming that the lake monster is going to eat her. Suddenly readers want to know what on earth is going on. (for her it's the rare shark that can swim in fresh water, she had some older cousins scare her about it when she was very little and it still bothers her as an adult).

Or what if a villain tosses mud in her face, covering her left eye and suddenly she is completely blind in a key fight?

Power Vs Price...

My biggest question is "why would it be bad for the story to change?" You can keep your themes and throughline the same while changing the stakes or focus.

Consider a protagonist battles for a powerup and wins. They get a short time to play with their new strength, but quickly realize it is changing them too much. Like Dr Manhatten of Watchmen, they discover personality issues and unlike that character decide to give up the power to preserve their identity.

You could run an arc of them realizing this and quickly using their power to take out a rival or remove some obstacle they always disliked, then the process of giving up the power. Suddenly you have rational character growth (would you want to be a god if it meant you died and a twisted copy of you was the result?) and the readers can see an important aspect of the character in stark relief.

Luck...

Luck is great and important, just dont make it common or forget villains have luck as well. For my own story, I might decide any particular event has a lucky occurance. So I roll dice 50/50 to see which side gets the luck. If a character has a streak of luck, then it will be commented on by witnesses. Also, I wouldn't generally let luck determine who wins, only the degree of victory.

So a lucky villain might take a headshot in the neck (returning with the results of a broken collarbone) or a lucky hero might get to a hiding spot because a villain was distracted at a key moment.

I hope this helps. I'm at work in my phone, so probably a few typos that I missed. Best of luck with your stories ðŸ’•
