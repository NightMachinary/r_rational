I wrote a pretty big post on this a while back, but it was off topic at the time. The main thesis was that the "Mary Sue" is a collection of symptoms that are all indicative of a bad work, grouped together for convenience. Because they're grouped together, a work can be sort-of-bad, or even just unconventional, and still have a protagonist that is Sue-ish. You can have protagonists that exhibit all of the symptoms of a Mary Sue, but aren't one simply because those symptoms are all expressions of the central theme of the story. A good example would be someone like MacGyver, who is attractive and competent, but is still interesting because he solves problems in interesting ways. Assuming Harry from HPMOR is flawless in the story, he still falls under this category because he does fun things in order to solve the problems that he faces. However, because the Mary Sue is a Bad Trope that only Bad Stories fall for, and Harry is symptomatic of one, Harry must be a Mary Sue and HPMOR must be a Bad Story.

This is bad - it shifts the territorial dispute from "whether or not the story is good" to "whether or not the main character is a mary sue". It's like the blegg-versus-rube debate: the qualities intrinsic to Sueness aren't necessarily indicative of whether you'll like the story or not. Arguing about whether a story is good might result in useful writing heuristics, but most of the Mary Sue characteristics (luck, attractiveness, success) are just staples of storytelling to begin with, so you can debate endlessly about them without it going anywhere.

If you're worried about having a character come across as a Mary Sue, don't bother writing rational fiction - you could make the main character a down-on-their-luck sack of garbage, and they would still be a Mary Sue in the eyes of this sub's critics, just because they occasionally make a decision that happens to work out. I've seen people call the protagonist from /Worm/ a Mary Sue and she loses her identity, friends, family, and arm in the end, all in the pursuit of a nebulous goal, before being summarily executed, like what the fuck. Instead, you should focus on the basic quality of your writing. Make sure the rest of the characters have interesting personalities that play off of each other, make sure your plot is paced in such a way that the resolution is thematically appropriate. Make sure you can write, in the sense that you have all of the technical skills of a good author. The rest is just noise.

P.S.

Lampshade hanging is your friend. It's lazy, people know that it's lazy, but it's not /quite/ as lazy as not playing with your tropes at all. And genre-savviness is a cheap way to make a protagonist sympathetic. /Wrong/ genre-savviness is a good way to make a sympathetic protagonist make a pretty big mistake, in an understandable way, and HPMOR uses it pretty much all the time.
