A fondly-remembered example from Red vs Blue: "...and then she beat him to death with his own skull!" "That's not physically possible!" "That's exactly what he said!" [flashback to person being repeatedly hit with a skull while saying "This isn't physically possible!"]

​

An imagined other example-- Mad scientist: "I stuck this pigeon inside a pyramid to reverse its evolution and get... A T. REX!" Person suddenly being chased by a T. Rex: "Ahh! Pigeons aren't directly descended from T. Rexes! This makes no evolutionary sense!"

(Or just go look at some [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging][TVTropes]] examples.)
