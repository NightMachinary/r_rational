it can get more complex but at its most basic its characters in the narrative acknowledging when something is convenient plot-wise to the characters in an effort to save the readers suspension of disbelief. A shit example would be characters finding a secret exit from a collapsing building just in time to save them and for a character to literally say "well it was a good job that was there or we'd all be dead".
