It's certainly possible to make a Sue out of a rationalist character, but it's not inevitable. If the character goes into the setting and instantly solves all the presented problems through the Power of Rationalism^{TM}, that's a Mary Sue. If the character goes into the setting and solves /some/ of the problems, and makes a bit of headway on others, but actually does worse on some of them than they might if they used a different approach, or screws up or makes mistakes despite (or even /because/ of) their rationalist mindset, then that makes for a more interesting story; rationalism isn't being portrayed as the Sword of Infinity+1, but just another tool. And it indicates a deeper understanding of rationalism if it's shown to /not/ be the best tool in certain circumstances.

Sometimes it can be fun to see rationalism applied to a problem and the result being... not failure, per se, but a less complete or less comprehensive result than might be obtained otherwise. (In a fanfic, a weaker result than the canon solution.) And a good story will have non-rationalist characters who aren't just there to be filler; perhaps they're likely to jump in first and solve something without rationalism, or contribute useful non-rational aspects to a solution, or just provide a form of balance.

It was one of the reasons I liked Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality; Harry the Rationalist achieved a lot, but often he'd make assumptions and have them be completely wrong because he hadn't bothered to do his research; non-rationalist characters who were more knowledgeable about the wizarding world could trump him, and a lot of the time he only came out on top due to his thinking and actions being different and thus unpredictable, not necessarily because they were actually /better/ for the situation. He actually misses out on making several canon allies/friends/companions, including Ron, Hagrid, and Sirius, never meets Dobby, and never buys Hedwig. There are also running issues with Harry realizing he isn't like other children his age, and being concerned that there might be something /wrong/ with him.

Of course, it can be fun to write parodies where /everyone/ is super-rationalist, just to see how this twists the plot, character arcs, and approaches to challenges.
