You'll always be your own harshest critic!

What about your characters' good traits? No trait is ever completely good or bad. Try and think of good traits you've given them and think of ways in which those same traits can put them at a disadvantage or get them in trouble.

Brave - maybe they rush into unnecessary danger, or don't admit it when they get hurt and their injuries and stress compound.

Loyal - maybe they stick with a friend even when that friend is going down the wrong path, or they're torn between two friends where neither choice is right.

Generous - Maybe they're giving away money and enabling someone to mooch off them and can't afford their own rent, or maybe their generosity is masking self-depreciation where they don't believe they're worthy of having nice things.
