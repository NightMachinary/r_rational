I think your problem lies in thinking of negative traits as something annoying to tack on. If done right, your character flaws should be the most interesting part of your character, tied to their virtues, and a huge part of their personality. Maybe they're tough and independent - and so they push people away who are trying to help. Maybe they're academically smart and dedicated - so they neglect their own health in pursuit of study and are helpless in the real world with street smarts. Maybe they're charismatic and popular - and get frustrated and make bad choices when people treat them as just pretty face. Flaws /are/ your characters.
