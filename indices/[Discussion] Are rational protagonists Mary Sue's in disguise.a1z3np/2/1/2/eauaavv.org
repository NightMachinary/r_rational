I have not built characters for the sake of effective narrative, but here are my two cents. Create events in the backstory of the character's life that gave them both a skill and a defect. When both can be traced to the same origin, it feels less tacked on and more like character depth.

Another way to do this is for the character to have a maladaptive schema: Their attitudes are useful for some situations but harmful in others (eg. reacting to sudden movement). This can make the character capable in some scenarios but show weakness in others.
