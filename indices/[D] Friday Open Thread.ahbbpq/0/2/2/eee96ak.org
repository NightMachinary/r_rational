Um, are is the user of this comment and the original post user friends or something? Cause it seems kinda, well, mean to say you're appalled by someone liking something and then say that the thing they like is irredeemable in so many words.

I wish that the response had been more like, "I'm glad you liked it, because I had a hard time finding the Wraiths interesting due to the lack of explanation on their energy draining power, really took me out of the show."

I don't know if I am supposed to read sarcasm into it or some kind of playfullness, but if the original poster didn't read those things in, well, this does seem kinda mean, and it would be cool if we were all careful about that, because tone isn't present in text unless you really go out of your way to be explicit about what you are conveying.

Hopefully I am just misunderstanding.
