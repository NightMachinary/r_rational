I have to disagree with you.

The process of Wraith feeding was described as a complex physiological process that /resembled/ physical aging. More details would have been welcome, sure. But from the scientist characters' perspective: it is at first something that they've never seen before, getting samples of Wraith to analyze is dangerous, and for the few body parts and corpses that were recovered over the course of 5 seasons, those analyses would take time.

McKay may have suffered in the consistency of his character development, depending on the writer, but I doubt he was ever that bad. His most catastrophic failure in the series, in "Trinity", only endangered himself and Shepherd (before the Daedalus intervened).

As for the ZPMs... first, I give them a pass under Clarke's Third Law. Second, they were never described as unlimited, just huge. And while every second episode in the first season might have revolved around looking for them, I cannot remember a single episode post-season 1 that revolved around a ZPM running out. Feel free to remind me, if there's one you specifically have in mind. Also, I question calling the ZPM a McGuffin; the characters need one in order to supply (huge) power to Atlantis, and once the have finally have one they are able to access more of Atlantis' capabilities, like the shield. They story doesn't have them search for one purely for the sake of searching for it.
