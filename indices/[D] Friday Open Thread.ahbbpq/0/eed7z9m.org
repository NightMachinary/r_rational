I recently started rewatching Stargate: Atlantis on amazon prime, a show that I haven't seen since childhood. Almost done with season 1, and so far it holds up /extremely well/. In fact, it's even better than I remember it, especially when episodes are watched back-to-back so the season-long arc becomes crystal clear.

The show does so many things well:

- Great cast playing lovable characters
- Great chemistry between the characters
- Great soundtrack, as per usual for a Stargate show
- Extensive subtle references to classic sci-fi, including Star Trek, Apollo 13, and Alien
- Usage of good-old-fashioned hand-painted vistas as backdrops
- Great balance between season arc and episode arcs
- Interesting moral dilemmas
- Pretty good technobabble
- Half the episodes barely even have a conflict because they are just about the thrill of discovery
- Characters learn from past episodes and tend not to make the same mistakes twice
- Characters generally cover the obvious possibilities when making their plans

Sure, the characters are no rationalists, and they do sometimes hold the idiot ball or conveniently forget some amazing technology they encountered in a previous episode, but no more than any other serial television show, and probably much less. (Without idiot balls, most TV shows wouldn't exist at all). The main villains, the Wraith, are quite campy in design, but I actually like this, because it fits the tone of the show quite well. There is the convenient fact that literally everyone, human or alien, on every planet, somehow magically speaks perfect idiomatic modern English, but I'm fine with this suspension of disbelief, because it allows plots to move forward without the same annoying translation problems every episode.

When I think of the constraints placed on the show by budget and tone, I actually think the worldbuilding is rather genius. The Wraith are a clear nod to Alien, while their campiness takes the edge off the horror to preserve the mostly lighthearted tone. And the fundamental premise, that ancient humans spread colonies around the galaxy which are now mostly in a primitive fallen state co-existing with mysterious ancient technology, not only allows the showrunners to save lots of money on set pieces and character designs, but it also makes for very interesting plot dynamics.

I was also impressed by the number of times I was thinking, "why don't they just solve their problem with this?", only for one of the characters to raise that point in the very next scene and either incorporate it into the plan or explain why it won't work. ("Why is a storm threatening this powerful ancient city?" "Oh, it's because they relied too much on their shield, but now we don't have enough power for it."; "Why don't we go back to that one planet and get that one thingy" "Oh yeah, good idea, let's puts that on the table"; "Why don't the wraith dial into stargates to prevent people from escaping?" "Oh wait, they actually do use that tactic when they need to")

I'm sure there are plenty of other flaws in the show, but so far I'm loving it enough that those don't matter.
