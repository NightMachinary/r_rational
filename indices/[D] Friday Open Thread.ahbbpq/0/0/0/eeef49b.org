PS If you want r!Steven Universe and don't mind that it's a dead fic, you can download [[http://www.mediafire.com/folder/cjw4h6hez7gpv/The_World_is_Your_Oyster%2C_The_Universe_is_Your_Namesake][The World is Your Oyster, The Universe is Your Namesake]].

The story doesn't exist anymore on the Internet, but I kept an offline copy for my own personal use and don't mind sharing.
