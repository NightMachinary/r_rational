Stargate is probably my *nÂ°1* franchise that needs more rational fic, more than Animorphs, Steven Universe, Mass Effect, She Ra (the reboot), Totally Spies, and Legend of Korra all put together.

(ok, maybe not Totally Spies, but I /really really/ want a good rational fic for any of the others)

(yes, there are already three r!fics for Animorphs; it's never enough)
