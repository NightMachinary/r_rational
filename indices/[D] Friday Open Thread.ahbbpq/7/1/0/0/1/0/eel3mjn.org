I mean, it /is/ somewhat of a meme, and there /are/ people who go along with it for reasons like what you've listed, but I've been "aware of" Pewds since 2012. I found him annoying back then, and Markiplier was similar but not annoying. There seemed to basically be individuals who played games by themselves with their face in the corner of the screen talking at the audience, and groups who played together without webcams talking to each other, and I mostly stuck with Markiplier and Achievement Hunter, one from each category.

I don't know what sparked it, but I started occasionally consuming Pewds's content in 2016 when he started vlogging on a more regular basis. At some point, he expressed some pretty strong disdain for Trump and I started watching him even more frequently. By early 2017 I was pretty much watching all of his daily uploads.

Then September came, and with it the incident on the bridge in PUBG. I was shocked that it happened, but it never made me think "oh man Pewds is really a secret racist nazi oh man how could he do this oh noes."

I really think it's a generational divide. It /is/ distasteful to use that word in anger while gaming, but people who came up during the beginnings of online multiplayer /should/ "get it". People get mad at you and they have nothing else to throw at you so they reach for the worst words they can think of. I was never all that big into the online multiplayer scene myself (I really find it pointless, it's like a sport except you don't even get the benefit of physical exercise, I had a friend who was big into those types of games and I've watched him sit through match after 15-minute-long match for multiple hours at a go, and I just don't see the appeal) but I came up during that several-years-long transitional period of gaming's development from niche thing that nerds did with LAN parties to mainstream thing that literally everyone does, and that's just how it is.

People will call you a "sum-guzzling digger-maggot" and threaten to "tape and girder" your relatives without a second thought, trash-talk is part of gaming and it's meant to be implicitly understood as hyperbolic and not taken literally. Or rather, that /used to/ be the case. I haven't played a non-singleplayer game in years. That probably isn't how it is nowadays. Gen Z seems to be too exceptionally prudish for trash talking to still be the way it was a decade ago.

Anyway, if people are confused as to why Pewds didn't lose a ton of fans after the incident it's because most of the people in the demographic his content is targeted at are aware of this stuff. I thought it was childish of him to allow a videogame to push his temper to the point where he would reach for the big lexical weapons, but English isn't even his native language. You can hear him over the last 6 years go from "Swede with a bit more fluency with English than average" to "Swede with noticeably more fluency with English than average, who strategically exaggerates his accent because it's become part of his brand" to "practically indistinguishable from an American." He didn't learn the n-word in Sweden. He learned it from the online multiplayer gaming community. I can't see it having the same associations for him as it would for someone in the American South who learned the word from the local community.

He went a long time without making gaming videos because people were getting tired of his shtick (and he's revealed in the last couple of years that he was getting tired of it too) so he did a bunch of vlogging for most of a year. Then PUBG came out, and it was a fun game to play, and it was interesting to watch, and he was decent at it and not playing it like "2013 Pewds" with the annoying commentary (and purposefully being bad at the game, because I think that's part of why people used to watch him), so his PUBG videos got decent views (I know they were probably the first gaming videos from him that /I/ had seriously watched because I legitimately found them entertaining), and he had just set up his streaming thing because youtubers all started streaming for some reason in 2017, and then he dropped the n-bomb and it was live and he couldn't edit it out and there it was.

But he learned the word in the "online multiplayer first person shooter" context, and he was trying to be more serious about gaming than he used to be, so he was taking it seriously and he let himself get mad and it came out. Childish, incredibly immature, but not indicative of racism.

Of course, I'm sure people disagree with my analysis of the reasons why he used the word, or with my rationale behind how someone could use the n-word without it being racist, but I don't really care. I don't for a moment believe (based on his past attitudes and behaviors and actions) that Pewdiepie is a racist and I /surely/ will not be convinced that he /is/ by someone who hasn't even consumed his content, and even if someone were to occasionally have checked out some of the videos he's posted over the last year or two, I wouldn't be convinced by them either because I wouldn't believe they were "seeing past the meme". Like, Pewds seems very much like he was getting tired of being a youtuber but he's reinvigorated himself by turning himself into a living meme, if you don't have several years and hundreds of hours of context I really feel like he's too impenetrable for a new viewer to "get it". There's probably a window between ages, like, 25 to 35 where /some/ of the people in that demographic "understand." I feel like most people older than that lack the cultural context and most people younger than that are too conservatively hypersensitive and prudish.

Anyhow, that's my rationale for believing that people who believe Pewdiepie is "problematic" don't know what they're talking about.

The other stuff you said is relevant as well. I feel like the internet was a bigger place from roughly 2006 to 2009, and I feel like it's incredibly small at the present, like, all there is is Youtube (and netflix and video streaming in general) and Reddit and social media, like, pretty much all I use the internet for on a daily basis nowadays is Google News and Youtube and Reddit, and sometimes Fanfiction Dot Net and the webcomics I follow (whittled down to just two of them over the years) and then of course random articles and Wiki entries for random things I decide to start researching. It's like the six corporations who own the planet seem to have strangled the internet down to a few choke points, and it's like they're trying to turn it all into television again and restrict access to information to what they want to dole out. That's part of it. Eff the corporations. This is OUR internet.

If all that just utterly flies over your head, then you lack the context necessary for others to accept that your opinion on the subject is an informed opinion (and you probably definitely might not enjoy Pewds's content).
