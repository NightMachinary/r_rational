That's just the point I was making. If you had all the hours of context from the dozens videos over whatever period of weeks leading up to that one video, you'd see that it was meant as a "look at what you can get away with paying people to do on Fiverr, they should probably ought to moderate their platform a little bit."

All you've seen of any of these issues has been completely devoid of context. I can't for the life of me find it, but I saw a quote (I think it was brought up in relation to the Elon Musk 60 Minutes interview) that went something to the effect of "careful editing is indistinguishable from outright fabrication." I assume "the little [you've] seen" comes entirely from reading articles about him. That means you're basing your opinion on misinformation.

People are allowed to compare people to Hitler, and doing so kinda implies that you think being compared to Hitler is a negative thing and kinda makes it actively NOT seem like you're promoting Hitler.

People are allowed to draw parallels between YouTube's policies and certain Nazi policies, and doing so kinda implies that you think being compared to Nazis is a negative thing and kinda makes it actively NOT seem like you're promoting Nazism.

Look at me, saying the words "Hitler" and "Nazi" over and over again, gosh I surely must hate Jewish people, huh?

This whole thing is confuffled by the fact that it's virtually impossible for the "Not Anti-Pewds" side to prove their point because doing so would require trawling through hours and hours of years-old videos and compiling evidence and then expecting people to devote the time to watch it and be disproved. People don't open themselves to being refuted. The media has already analyzed the situation and told them what to think about it, and that's the end of the story as far as they're concerned. I'm telling you as someone who watched all of his content from the periods in question that the media's portrayal of it has been exceptionally biased. That's as close to the truth as you're going to get without binge-watching hundreds of his old videos on your own. Until then, you haven't in any way convinced me that I should accept your assessment of the issue as an informed opinion and in turn alter my own assessment.
