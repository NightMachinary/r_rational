It's a meme in the original sense of the word. There are a few explanations for why it spread so far, but it mostly boils down to "don't do it because pewdie pie is good, do it because you dislike Youtube/T-Series/Big Corporations more than you dislike pewdiepie". Maybe it's to send a message and show Youtube that they can't just get rid of creators they don't like? Idk.
