The fake news trend has nothing to do with technology and everything to do with the fact that a single major tabloid holding company owns most of the nation's news companies. Information services are in a uniquely powerful position to shape the behaviors of groups of humans and that's exactly what Newscorp did . They grew so powerful that they were able to get a permanent exception from certain FCC rules that nobody else got. As a result they control close to half of periodical information publications (also including things like tv and radio).

So they publish fake news with some branches and the kind of stuff that will make you more likely to get caught up in fake news stories through other branches.

They're so powerful that other companies are copying the same business models and making the problem that much worse.
