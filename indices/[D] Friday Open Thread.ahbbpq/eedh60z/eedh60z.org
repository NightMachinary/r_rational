It's probably been like 25ish years since the last time I watched Mary Poppins. There's a lot more to it than I expected there to be, in stark contrast with the books, which (in spite of their esoteric/mystical/occult/Theosophical symbolism) can scarcely be said to have a plot at all (they're basically nothing more than a series of disconnected vignettes). It's actually pretty good as a movie, not just within the subcategory of "movies made for children."
