I've just finished Chapter 31 of Pokemon: The Origin of Species. Unmarked non-specific spoilers for up to that point below.

I'm getting a little exhausted from the constant near-death experiences (said the guy who likes wildbow stories). If what Red, Blue, and Leaf are going through is in any way typical for new trainers, how on earth does anyone make it out of their first year? I don't think mortality rates have been explicitly stated, but yeesh they must be terrible. And this is with a trio that seems like they're probably in the top percentage of +rattata+ 12 year olds in terms of experience, preparedness, and intelligence.

...oh hey I was double checking on the age and found my way to the FAQ. Let me check that out...

(wait does the Temeraire series eventually address how dragons are treated seriously? I only read the first trilogy and after the one person who brought that up turned out to be the villain I didn't think it would be relevant anymore).

Alright then. I don't really have a problem with the justification for smarter than average kids or kids doing something this dangerous- especially since these kids in particular have good reason to be that way, and the world is definitely dangerous enough to justify it. In general I'm liking that- I love the idea of the legendary birds being an endbringer-ish sort of threat.

It's not the suspension of disbelief over plot armor that's getting to me so much that the constant "almost dying" on the road is a bit oppressive. I'd like to see the cast deal with problems that aren't just life or death battles. I liked the Pewter city chapters because we finally got a chance to /breathe/, and to see the characters actually in their element.

Sorry if I'm rehashing old ground here, I haven't looked at any other reviews or discussion but I'm sure there's a reason the FAQ lead with those questions. I am definitely enjoying the story.
