Yeah, it's not a work or art or aspires to be the greatest cartoon every, but it does what it does nicely.

I'm still undecided on the traveling format too. The last few episodes haven't been as plot centric, though on the other hand they have contributed a little to the world building.

I'm hoping they come back to the Varian plot soon and the moon stone has a satisfying conclusion .
