  I'm getting a little exhausted from the constant near-death experiences (said the guy who likes wildbow stories). If what Red, Blue, and Leaf are going through is in any way typical for new trainers, how on earth does anyone make it out of their first year?

I don't think RBG are typical new trainers. The mortality rate is probably pretty bad, but RBG intentionally dive into any crisis situation they possibly can. Though also, I'd expect higher fertility rates too.

  (wait does the Temeraire series eventually address how dragons are treated seriously?

Yes. Napoleon takes up the mantle of dragon rights, and allies/tries to ally with polities (imperial china, the aztecs) that have very non-western perceptions of dragons, so Britain has to change how they treat dragons to avoid defections.
