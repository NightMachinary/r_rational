#+begin_quote
  what do you mean by "phase-shifted being"?
#+end_quote

Invisible ghost that can walk through walls selectively, but is affected by gravity. Presumably able to see, but does not leave a shadow. How being phase shifted works in most scifi series.

#+begin_quote
  Secondly, what do you mean by "detect using a double-slit experiment"?
#+end_quote

Put its eye in front of one of the slits, see if the interference pattern changes.
