  Assume that it is effectively weightless while intangible.
#+end_quote

It makes more sense (to me) to assume that the intangible person also has some means of flight - a personal jetpack or similar. But very well - either way, the spiky floor doesn't help.

We could try running a few thousand volts through the wall and seeing if that's enough to stop a phased person coming through, though I see no reason why it should be.

However, if they can see, then they're vulnerable to (at the very least) being blinded by very bright lights, and possibly even eye damage from */very/* bright lights.

#+begin_quote
  Assume that you can reproduce the light perfectly, or at least as close to what is allowed by the no-cloning theorem with no time lost.
#+end_quote

Reproducing the light /perfectly/ isn't possible. Reproducing the light well enough to be indistinguishable to the human eye... /is/ most likely possible. So the phased person can't be picked up by sight. (But might be able to be picked up by very carefully watching super-high-speed-camera outputs for discrepancies - though you wouldn't do that unless you already had reason to suspect something).
