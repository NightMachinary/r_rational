I'm pretty sure that that statement doesn't make sense. First, what does "phase shifted" mean? Does that have something to do with intangibility? If so, that kind of axiomatically prevents it from interacting with physical phenomena like the double slit experiment. If it did, it would have to do something really weird, like muck up probability on a quantum scale.

I'm not sure the wave function refers to an actual wave, and if it did, then I'm not sure what it would mean for something to be "shifted" relative to it.
