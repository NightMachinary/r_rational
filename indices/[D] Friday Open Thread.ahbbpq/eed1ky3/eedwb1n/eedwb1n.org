You have to narrow it down more. What features do a phase-shifted object have that would interact with the two-slit experiment that /wouldn't/ interact with eyes?

Remember [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LaM5aTcXvXzwQSC2Q/universal-fire][Universal Fire]]: Just because something isn't /the archetypal example/ of something (two slit experiment for QM, matches for fire) doesn't mean that it isn't /an/ example of it (eyes, cellular respiration). In the same way that "stopping fire" means both stopping matches and respiration, "interacting with quantum mechanics" means interacting with both double-slit experiments and people's eyes.
