Looking forward to getting [[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1847276608][started]]on [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15916.The_True_Believer][*The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements*]]by [[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9843.Eric_Hoffer][Eric Hoffer]]. Once you start looking for it you end up seeing the tribalism phenomenon /everywhere/. I'm also thinking of giving Joshua Greene's Moral Tribes a go. It's troubling to think how easily people get sucked into us vs them, like all the time.

Edit: Any of you guys on Goodreads? I figured we could have a group, make bookshelves.. There's already [[https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/100705.Rational_Fiction][this]]. The rational-adjacent groups I came across doesn't really seem to be active.
