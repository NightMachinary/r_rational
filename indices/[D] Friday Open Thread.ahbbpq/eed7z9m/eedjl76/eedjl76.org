This might be a little weird but I really enjoyed [[https://youtu.be/f-K6b6mPnkM][Tangled: the series]] and been following the second season now. For someone that spends lots of time working, an idealist and relaxing adventure show is great. I can see where the SoL appeal in anime is.

I also loved the twist of a supporting cast character becoming the big bad, and seeing all the hints there makes all the previous interactions take on a new light. The fact he becomes evil because of all the abuse and faults the "heroes" inflicted on him makes more sense than other series villains and feels slightly rational, making me instantly side with him.

Plus I'm a sucker for scientists and one man industrial revolutionaries in fantasy worlds.

The world feels so lively and the writers made good dialogue and chemistry between the characters without making them overly childish, which surprised me and made me feel less guilty about watching a cartoon usually pushed to the "little girl" demographic lol.

The romance keeps progressing and is refreshing to see the main character change and develop a wider emotional range across the episodes, and have intimate interaction and support between the two lovers unlike other series that try to stall any romantic development until the end.

They even got the original movie cast to voice the characters and the art style and color palette is relaxing and makes sense if you read the reason they used it. IMO one can feel the passion behind the project and I wish it had more fans, especially people I could discuss it with.
