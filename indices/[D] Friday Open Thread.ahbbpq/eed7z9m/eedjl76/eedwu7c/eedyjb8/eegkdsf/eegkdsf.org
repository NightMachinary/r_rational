I think the early wild Pokemon attacks are kind of a point the author is trying to make. How many times did you get attacked by wild Pokemon when just trying to travel from place to place in the games? The early areas are especially bad for that because they don't even have a path from point A to B that isn't overgrown with weeds that Pokemon like to nest in.

The random brushes with death let up later on and are replaced with brushes with death that result from the group doing something stupid like ignoring warnings from the rangers and rushing into a situation they are unprepared for. Not sure if that's much better but at least you know to expect it or that you don't need to worry as much. Even the +endbringers+ legendary birds follow somewhat predictable patterns because of the weather.
