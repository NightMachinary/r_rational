Oh pish posh, Mary Poppins Returns isn't nearly as bad as all that.

Now, the Disney movies /are/ sanitized, in the sense that all of the non-Christian symbolism has been either stripped out or hidden. But they both have surprisingly prominent anti-capitalist themes, possibly stronger in MPR than in the OG MP, and I really think it's uncharitable to characterize MPR as "vacuous and empty." It might seem like they copied the plot of the original movie, but Mary Poppins Opens the Door had a plot that copied Mary Poppins Comes Back, and Mary Poppins Comes Back had a plot that copied Mary Poppins.

Incidentally, MPE is going to be quite a bit more involved than I initially thought. I've decided that Mary Poppins exists across the possibility space, that all the infinite versions of her are connected, less like Rick from Rick & Morty and more like the Lutece twins or Elizabeth from BioShock Infinite. The books show one version. The movies show two versions that are near each other in the possibility space. The one who I see... Well, look at the title. She's basically Kalki.
