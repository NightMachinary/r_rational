I very much like the internet like it is right now.

I can watch any TV series or cartoon I want, for free, right now, by going to a few different hosting websites. If any of these websites shut down, there's about 30 others providing the same. I can go on Github and download millions of projects in every programming language imaginable until I find the ones that match my needs. If I'm bored, I can spend hundreds of hours watching Tom Scott videos or reading Wikipedia articles and keep learning new things.

Honestly, from what you're saying, PewDiePie sounds like the very definition of "Play stupid games, win stupid prizes", plus lots of internet tribalism that I really don't want to get into.
