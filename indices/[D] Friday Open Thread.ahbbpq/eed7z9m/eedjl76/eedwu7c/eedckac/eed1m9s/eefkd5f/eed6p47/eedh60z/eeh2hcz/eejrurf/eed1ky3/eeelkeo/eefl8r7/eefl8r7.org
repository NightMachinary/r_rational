I understand they've just been through a third rewrite, but the opening 25 chapters or so are really poor, even by the standards of web serials which I always find tend to start badly.

Once you get through that it's a solid alternate world fantasy story. I'd say the best thing about it is just that it's different in a lot of ways. The locations, and the author's style and preferences , contribute to a more unique take on a fairly normal plot.

I've commented before that it's strange to see it so.highly rated, but it's still enjoyable.
