It's a bot. The "username" is in reference to a stupid meme where somebody is about to say /that/ word and, like, I think the penguins from Madagascar are involved? It's one of the dumber memes, one of the ones that never makes it to Instagram or wherever else normal people get exposed to memes.

I reported it for being a bot but the report hasn't been noticed by a mod yet.
