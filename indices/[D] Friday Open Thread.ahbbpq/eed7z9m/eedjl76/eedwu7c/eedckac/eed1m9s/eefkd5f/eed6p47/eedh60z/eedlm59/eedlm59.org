I'm very pleasantly surprised to see this opinion from you; I recently rewatched Mary Poppins myself, was also very impressed by it, and was somewhat disappointed to see you refer to "the sanitized Disney movies" in a comment on MPE. (Incidentally, the new movie actually /is/ utter shit; it succeeds well enough in replicating the /stylistic/ content of the original, I suppose, but has zero understand of the /thematic/ content of the original, to the point that only a modern Hollywood studio could possibly have made a followup so vacuous and empty.) I think that this is a fairly common narrative about Mary Poppins - many people are vaguely familiar with the Disney movie, but haven't really given it a deep watch, just associating it with vague memories and exaggerated cultural tropes, sometimes so strongly that they could actually watch the movie but pay no real attention to it and not notice what they're doing. Then some of them also read the original books, note the differences between the books and the movie, and decide that the movie is a broken or watered-down version of the books. (I think that similar processes must have been at play in the development of the new movie.) In actuality, the movie is its own thing, and I personally think it's an /extremely thematically coherent/ piece of /great art/. So, assuming that I'm correct that you rewatched it sometime after posting that comment, I'm very glad that you've come around. :)
