Area denial is possible, then. Imagine a floor covered in spikes made of the same material as the floor; if it phases through the spikes then it falls through the floor and if it doesn't then it hurts its feet.

But let's consider detection of such a being at all. Now, there is clearly /some/ interaction between this being and normal matter - if there is not, then it cannot see us and is merely in the universe next door. Specifically, if it can see, then there is some interaction with light - at least in the vicinity of the creature's eyes. It must absorb - at the very minimum - a percentage of the photons that pass through where its eyes are, so that it can see what's going on.

This implies the existence of a couple of eye-shaped 'dark patches' that move as it does. Perhaps nothing that you'd notice if you weren't deliberately looking for it, but there.

Now, it's possible that the alien technology or whatever is phase-shifting this person attempts to compensate for that by releasing new photons in the same place, removing the dark patch. However, this runs into another problem - processing delays. However fast the system is at replacing the light it took to see with, it cannot be /instantaneous/, and light travels as fast as it is possible to travel (without starting to mess with the equivalent of time travel). So, in this case, there would not be a shadow but there would be a time delay - if you were looking directly through a phase-shifted person's eyes, you might see a distant fast-moving object appear to jump a bit (or even be in two places at once for a moment).
