I am appalled by you liking Atlantis! It holds no candle at all to to original Stargate. No part of the setting makes any sense at all. Wraith suck "life energy" which ages the victim? They are not even trying for any kind of pseudoexplanation. Welcome to fantasy land, vampires were just in at the time of writing.

The McKay character is so very socially incompetent and clichee that its offensive to nerds anywhere - his very mode of operation is to ignore common decency, chain of command, endanger his team. If one were to tally up the the numbers on how often he safed the team vs how often he fucked up, I am sure it'd come up as a deficit.

The Magical McGuffin that are ZPMs annoy me to noend. "Basically unlimited" energy, except that they run out every second episode.

About the only good pieces of Atlantis is this predeployment rat!fic [[http://synecdochic.dreamwidth.org/122553.html]] and some of the old character episodes.
