There were, strictly speaking, three times the ZPMs ran out or needed replacement past season one.

When experimenting with universe bridges, sending alternate!McKay back to his universe drained the ZPM, which later allowed the (thus shield-less) city to be taken over by replicators. The replicators installed their own ZPMs, a full set of three even, which the expedition kept when the replicators were defeated. Of these, one was taken to power Earth's drone chair, one was installed on the Odyssey, and the third remained in Atlantis to power the shield.

When Atlantis fled the planet to avoid the Replicators' satellite beam weapon, taking a glancing, unshielded hit to the main tower in the process, the resulting energy leakage drained the ZPM over the course of about a day. Unable to land on a planet without one, the Replicator homeworld was raided to acquire another ZPM, at the expense of their main trump card - the ARG - which they had to abuse enough that the Replicators ended up adapting to it.

Finally, since the city can't normally fly without a full complement of three ZPMs, they had to be given another two by Todd in the series finale. (Don't get me started on /everything else/ about that finale, though.)

Of course, these were rare, exceptional events, and the assessment that they "run out every second episode" is blatantly exaggerated.
