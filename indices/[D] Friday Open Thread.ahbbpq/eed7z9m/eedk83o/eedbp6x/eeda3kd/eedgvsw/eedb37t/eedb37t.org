Haven't seen the original Stargate in a very long time, so I don't have a comparison, but...

- Literally all TV shows do things similar to what you describe. Like, literally all. If I rewatched SG1 I'm sure I could come up with similar criticisms. If I held TV to rationalist standards I wouldn't be watching any TV at all (maybe that would be for the best)
- I am therefore willing to suspend disbelief regarding characters who would have been fired in the real world
- Stargate Atlantis is just loads of light fun for me, and a callback to when I was a kid

Edit:

Also, regarding Wraiths, the lifesucking is a perfect plot device for television, because it provides a villain without being too graphic in violence on screen. And speaking of magical McGuffins... this is a universe based on magical stargates that make no physical sense... you just sort of go with it. The physics is not the point.
