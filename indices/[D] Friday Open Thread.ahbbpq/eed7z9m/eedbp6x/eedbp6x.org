I also loved that show growing up!

I haven't done much rewatching of it, but I remember two things that struck me back then, when I'd compare the first season to the 4 following seasons.

1) The costuming. An in-depth analysis of fine technical details is beyond me, but I definitely felt like the costuming improved after season 1: somewhat in the outfits worn by the main cast, but mainly in the diversity of Wraith characters that later appeared.

2) Later season arcs. I remember and really enjoyed how the first season gradually developed into the 3-part finale (the third part being the premier of season 2). But later seasons didn't feel as established to me; as interesting as later season finales were, the development didn't seem as strong.

But then again, my impressions may also benefit from a solid rewatch of the series. Just two things I thought I'd share.
