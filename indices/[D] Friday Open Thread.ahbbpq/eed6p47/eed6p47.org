I'm interviewing at Harvard Law next week! HLS was my biggest reach and it's extremely gratifying to receive an interview invite after being rejected by HBS and waitlisted after interview by MIT.

I've realized that I have no idea what goes on in the admission process. I thought I was a shoo-in at HBS/MIT and a long shot at HLS.

It's surprising because my background is in business and my GPA is sooo far below HLS's 25th percentile GPA of 3.8. Who the hell maintains a 3.8 over four years? That's ridiculous.

HLS interviewees have a 60-80% admittance rate. Fingers crossed!
