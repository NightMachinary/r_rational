Thanks!

Yup. I've never had a strong ambition or passion for anything and I've been lucky enough to achieve success doing my own thing. But I'm tired of that, so the most important thing for me is to be doing /something/ (anything) else and to be around other smart people.

Self-funded, probably. Harvard doesn't give scholarships and I doubt I'll get money from MIT as I'm on the waitlist.
