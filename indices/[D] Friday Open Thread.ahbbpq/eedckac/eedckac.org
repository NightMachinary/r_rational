I just read two opinion articles discussing how the current climate of fake news is likely to intensify via an impending deluge of homemade fake video and audio, courtesy of new editing software.

The latter article suggests that this could re-establish the importance of major news networks, given the resources required for large-scale factchecking. But that might be a bit too optimistic. Any ideas on adaptation and mitigation, at the personal and or institutional scales?
