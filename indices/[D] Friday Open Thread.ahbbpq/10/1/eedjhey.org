I think the issue here is that your premise needs more context. Primarily, what do you mean by "phase-shifted being"? Secondly, what do you mean by "detect using a double-slit experiment"? The double-slit experiment is a demonstration of an interesting physical phenomenon that helps to validate a prediction of quantum mechanics; is your suggestion to have a double-slit experiment set up and then for your phase-shifted being (this is where we really really need more context/clarification!!) to somehow interact with that?
