  Wouldn't you stop being yourself if you had free will? People's minds are deterministic because there's a pattern of cause and effect. Would a mind with true free will think in truly random patterns that don't follow any logic?

Such randomness might solve the problem of whether the "free will" is truly "free", but I'm not sure that would still qualify as "will".
