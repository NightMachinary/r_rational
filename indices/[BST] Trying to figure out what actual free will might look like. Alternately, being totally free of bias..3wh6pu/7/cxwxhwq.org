I think free will is kind of like blue red or some other nonsensical concept.

You know what makes free will and determinism different, rewinding time and playing it forward to be a different result without any change.

I think free will would be somewhat satisfied by dualism but still, we have the illusion of free will so there would be no difference in function to the universe.

However what you describe isn't very much like free will, and just replacing your personality with another.
