I think the most sensible way to think of "free will" is not "nondeterministic" but rather "a quality a general intelligence can possess relative to the general intelligence that created it". A mind has free will if it is capable of developing values more compatible or less compatible with the values of the mind that created it. It therefore doesn't really make sense to talk about humans' free will without some form of God; it's nonsensical, like trying to talk about parallel lines in a one-dimensional world.
