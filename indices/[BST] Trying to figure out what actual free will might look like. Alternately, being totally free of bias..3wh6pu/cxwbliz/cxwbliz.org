  you become a perfectly rational actor, so that you are only limited by intelligence and lack of information.

Hmm, this is a tricky one. The reason evolution gave us so many biases even though perfect rationality "wins", is that perfect rationality is /ridiculously/ computationally expensive. Like, "simulate all possible universes" expensive. A lot of our irrationalities are actually heuristics (i.e. ways to make half-decent decisions very fast). What the rationalist community does is try to intelligently design superior heuristics, but they're still very much heuristics.

So:

- If the drug makes people /literally/ perfectly rational, /and/ boosts their processing power to keep up with it, then they can deduce all that was and ever will be [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/qk/that_alien_message/][from the path of a falling leaf]], awaken their inner Contessa, and bulldoze through your plot in a very unsatisfying way.
- If the drug makes people literally perfectly rational, and /doesn't/ boost their processing power to keep up with it, then it makes them drooling vegetables, dutifully working out the first few calculations of the 3^^^3 they need to make any actual decision.
- If the drug just gives people some better heuristics, then we're out of the realm of formal definitions. So it's entirely up to you which specific less-wrong-than-usual thought process they get.
