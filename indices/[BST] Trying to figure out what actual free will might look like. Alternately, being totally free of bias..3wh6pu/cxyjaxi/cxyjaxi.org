What happens to a heuristic that I have previously consciously chosen to use?

For example, let us say that I have a heuristic that says "wear a white shirt on weekdays", consciously and deliberately chosen to make choosing clothes quicker so I can concentrate on other stuff. Do I have to re-rubberstamp this heuristic every time I take the pill?

About biases - let us say that someone with a /very strong/ bias against X race takes the pill. His every interaction with members of X race so far has been coloured and tinged by racism - what happens when he thinks back on those interactions? What happens to him when it wears off?
