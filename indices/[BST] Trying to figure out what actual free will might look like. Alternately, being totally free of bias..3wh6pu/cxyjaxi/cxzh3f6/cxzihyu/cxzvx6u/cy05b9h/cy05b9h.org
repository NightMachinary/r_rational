Yeah, that's what I was thinking too. So, when he takes the drug, he temporarily becomes a different person, with potentially very different goals, and then when it wears off, he remembers the thoughts and plans of this possibly very different person.

And if they do not, then he will remember what goal these plans serve and he may quite possibly not care for it.
