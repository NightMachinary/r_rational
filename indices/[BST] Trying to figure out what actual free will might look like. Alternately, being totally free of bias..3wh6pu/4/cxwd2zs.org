This seems to me still like determinism.

Your mind or consciousness is still a box whereby certain inputs produce certain outputs.

The only way for it not be deterministic is if there is some randomness to thought processes...but this still isn't free will, quite the opposite. If your thoughts arbitrarily differ then you can in no way be said to have control of them.

The obvious solution to the seeming paradox is that there is no self, of course, and that your mind is subject to the same physical laws of whatever medium it is composed.
