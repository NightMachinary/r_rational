You're welcome.

It's worth reading how people actually discuss free will when they're not in a philosophy debate and they have to deal with actual issues like "can we cut this person open."

You lack free will about a situation in these examples.

Someone with such an impairment is thought to be unable to make a decision if they cannot: If you can't- understand information about the decision remember that information use that information to make a decision communicate their decision by talking, using sign language or by any other means

So greater free will would mean a much greater memory, so you could remember key decision making stuff and things that could influence your decision, would mean the ability to coordinate that well into a decision, to sort through stuff well to understand it.
