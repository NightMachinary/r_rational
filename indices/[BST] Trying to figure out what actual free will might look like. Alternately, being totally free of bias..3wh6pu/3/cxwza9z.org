This article is useful. The general concepts people have of free will are often nonsensical. We can observe the situation that causes it- we in our heads can think about things and make decisions about how to behave. We try to come up with some free will thing that makes sense of that, disconnecting it from our brain, but that doesn't make sense. An explanation should explain how something happens, down to the level of bouncing atoms and electrons moving. An explanation that posits some mysterious substance that does stuff is no more useful than Phlogiston material.

If you want greater free will, I suggest doing it in a way that ties it into our experience of free will and how it can be curtailed.

Have a brain where there's much faster impulses and a much greater degree of connection. In representing a decision they'd have access to all of the emotional memories and decision making software that does stuff.

So, suppose you were deciding whether to rob a bank. You'd be able to remember what it felt like to be shot at, what it felt like to have lots of cash, see your brain calculate how well this would boost your social status among local criminals, be able to consider how you found violence easier due to your violent parents. Weigh up all the factors and make a decision.
