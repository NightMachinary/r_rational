What you could do is have a drug that allows self-hypnosis to actually work reliably allowing people to directly modify their own mental functions with repeated use, gradually making them more and more ideal. You would have people rewiring themselves to be constantly happy, to be completely dedicated to work, religion or a personal philosophy. It would make people free to seek their goals without suffering akrasia or cognitive dissonance. People would also become mechanical and single minded as people sacrifice things like their appreciation of art and entertainment.
