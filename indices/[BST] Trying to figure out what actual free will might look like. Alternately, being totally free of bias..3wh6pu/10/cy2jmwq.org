I have a more reasonable conceit you should feel free to steal.

"Off-label uses, or perfecting the body to perfect the mind":

Therma-3 is a designer drug, intended to aid in weightloss. It's mechanism of effect is that it drastically increases the propensity of the body to metabolize fat reserves in response to drops in bloodsugar, by knocking out several mechanisms that evolved to stop the body from doing exactly this at the drop of a pin.

It works fine. It's a prescription drug in order to stop anorexics from killing themselves with it, but as long as you are not actively selfdestructive, it's safe. If you want to take it and maintain weight, you end up eating a fair bit, but not to "Working in the arctic" levels of absurdity. a 50% increase in caloric intake will do it. It also results in users having nearly perfectly level bloodsugar for most of the day. Which drastically increases your average, effective, intelligence, because you spend a whole lot more of your day in peak operating form. The long term effects of use turn out to be quite drastic, because crystalized intelligence is mostly a measure of how much mental work you have put in over the years, and someone who has spent years studying without sugar crashes or food comas has just gotten a lot more learning done. At no point is there an "NZT moment" - it doesn't make you smarter, it just means you spend less time being stupid because you are low on fuel. But the accumulative effects on someone who has used it from childhood on is major.
