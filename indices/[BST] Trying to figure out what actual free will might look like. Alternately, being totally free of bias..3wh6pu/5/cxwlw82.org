Both of those things would kill me.

There is no perfect platonic "me" hidden in my brain that you can bring out, that is otherwise limited by some set of rules separate from me. I am the algorithm that restricts my actions. Removing my restrictions is removing me. The chemistry and the quirks of my hardware are the physical implementations of that algorithm. I'm not "held back" by those "imperfections". My software has been built on top of them for billions of years. That's my kernel you're throwing out! Removing that doesn't get you a more rational me, it gets you a vegetable, or a low functioning autistic, or a schizophrenic, or someone with late-stage dementia.

I am already me. If you want a better me, you'll have to actually change me, and you'll have to do with with a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer.
