  Ishmael by Daniel Quinn: if you can get over the telepathic gorilla, there's nothing magical or supernatural here--just a razor-sharp inquiry into the nature of human civilization & the root causes behind why it looks the way it does.

I wouldn't call /Ishmael/ rationalist fiction. Or fiction at all, really. Remove the framing, and /Ishmael/ is just a pamphlet about a specific ideology (which while I do agree on some premises with, in the end boils down to some sort of primitivism that doesn't really feel very realistic or thought out. Like many critics of society, Quinn is better at pointing out its flaws than at suggesting believable solutions).

/Ishmael/ falls squarely within the tradition of philosophical dialogues, like Plato's /Symposium/ and Galileo's /Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems/. So basically just a series of philosophical ideas, presented by means of a fictional dialogue between two or more characters, such as a teacher and a pupil or two people debating. I wouldn't really consider it fiction, the fiction bit is just a framing device.
