If you read it as a case against civilization, I'd encourage you to give it another try. The purpose of the book is to make (presumably human) readers look critically at their status quo as if from the outside, something which requires a didactic approach. Your perception of smugness likely comes from the fact that Ishmael is always leading the narrator towards the conclusions he wants him to make. It's extremely effective at reframing a lot of issues that most people otherwise wouldn't think twice about.
