Yeah I mean it's not a scientific text. As I said above, its virtue is in reframing human civilization as something new & malleable rather than an inevitable/permanent condition of human life on Earth. I'm sure that many people on this sub are aware that human history comprises a tiny fraction of the history of life and that our current arrangement is the equivalent of a particularly fancy anthill, but I'm also sure that the folks here are at least one sigma more educated/introspective than your average person.

As to your last point, I have to disagree. No other species has self-regulated so poorly as to cause a mass extinction since algae started releasing oxygen into the atmosphere. "Second-wost self-regulation ever" isn't exactly stellar praise.
