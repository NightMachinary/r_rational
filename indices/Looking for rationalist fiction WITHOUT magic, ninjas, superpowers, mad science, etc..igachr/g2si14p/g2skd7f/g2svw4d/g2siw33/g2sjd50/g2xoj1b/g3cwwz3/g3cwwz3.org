I'd say it's more a case against large scale social organisation. It suggests that humans are naturally evolved to best interact on a tribal scale, and thus should find a way to organise themselves on that level if they want a healthy society. Where a "tribe" doesn't need to be literal people wearing skins and hunting with spears; a commune of a hundred or so hippies living together would also be a "tribe". The key element is size and egalitarian, horizontal organization.

Which is a wonderful idea if then you can explain to me how to design a society in which from the interactions of these minimal units emerges all the complex, large scale behavior that's necessary for our continued survival, all while also being avoiding overexploitation of natural resources AND the appearance of overarching power structures such as kingdoms, countries, empires and the like.
