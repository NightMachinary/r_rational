I think there are two types of comedy being conflated:

1) laughing at someone because what they did was stupid, e.g. slapstick humor. I'm generally not a huge fan of this type of humor, especially when it veers into the mean-spirited, but if someone else enjoys it, fine. Humor is subjective.

2) laughing at situations that would not arise if the characters acted perfectly rationally. Or, more broadly, enjoying a situation that could have been avoided through perfectly rational decisions (calling the cops instead of following the creepy figure). Since people in real life often make irrational decisions, this strikes me as realistic and satisfying.
