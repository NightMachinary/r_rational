At this point we're basically talking about "good writing." If there are no magic systems or superpowers to make consistent, rational writing is just a book where the characters act according to their motivations & capabilities.

With that said, here are a few of my favorite realistic-fiction novels I've read over the past few years.

- /Angle of Repose/ by Wallace Stegner: a severely disabled man moves into his grandparents' final home decades after their death and dedicates himself to researching their life on the American frontier. Extremely emotionally compelling, the character of the grandmother is lovingly crafted and relatable.

- /The Martian/ by Andy Weir. Hypercompetence porn & hard sci-fi at their best. A better title might be "The Engineer."

- /Ishmael/ by Daniel Quinn: if you can get over the telepathic gorilla, there's nothing magical or supernatural here--just a razor-sharp inquiry into the nature of human civilization & the root causes behind why it looks the way it does.

If you're interested in nonfiction, I highly recommend /Collapse/ by Jared Diamond. It features several case studies of civilizations that have either failed or survived to the present day, and discusses the reasons for their fates. Meticulously researched and fascinating. Hint: it's all about adaptability.
