It's been about a decade since I read it, but as I remember it the entire argument is based around group selectionism, which is thoroughly debunked pseudoscience. The idea was that all animals live in a balance with each other and their environment, except humans who are dysfunctional and need to rediscover that balance. This is completely untrue, there is no natural balance and humanity's (pretty meager) ability to self-regulate is already much better than other species'.
