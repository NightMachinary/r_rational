No, "rationalist writing" is a very different concept to "good writing"!

Rationalist writing aims to educate the reader, and to model real-world cognitive and emotional techniques.

Good writing is often not even rational: a well-written romantic comedy, or even farce, would very rarely be improved by the characteristic coherence of a rational setting and characters.

UNSONG, to name a specific example, is in my opinion an excellent but non-rational novel - well written, characterised, and plotted; but while it hangs together well it violates Sanderson's First Law (magic mechanics are relevant to the plot while also unpredictable to the reader). This isn't a bad thing, it's just a different genre!
