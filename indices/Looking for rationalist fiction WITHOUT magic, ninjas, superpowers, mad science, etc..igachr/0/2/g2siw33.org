I anti-recommend Ishmael. It has weak reasoning and an overall smug tone, and really is just a long tract wrapped up in a little fiction to make it more palatable and avoid the need for citations. The case against civilization has been made better elsewhere.

Edit: Hmm, after saying this I realize one could also claim this applies to HPMOR. But Ishmael really is just pure preaching, HPMOR at least has plot.
