  As to your last point, I have to disagree. No other species has self-regulated so poorly as to cause a mass extinction since algae started releasing oxygen into the atmosphere. "Second-wost self-regulation ever" isn't exactly stellar praise.

No other species /needs/ to self-regulate. It's not that they philosophically accept being culled and eaten by predators as a necessary part of the Circle of Life. It's that they don't have spears, or bows, or guns. So they get eaten. They aren't wiser; they're just weaker. What happened with US is that we're sort of an evolutionary singularity. Our intellect allows us to improve and learn on a time scale that's orders of magnitude faster than anything evolution can keep up with, and increases exponentially. So we just broke the game, and even our awareness of it and desire to self-regulate aren't enough to fix that, because we still wouldn't be willing to literally accept /dying/ in order to restore the natural order.
