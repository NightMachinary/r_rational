There us no "natural order". Predators outcompete other predators to extinction if possible, until only those species are left in the ecosystem that can't outcompete each other either due to different primary food sources or for some other reason. Self-regulation doesn't play into it and wether anything or anyone ever "needs" to self-regulate isn't a thing either, except when they are at risk of hunting their own prey to extinction. Which is also not something other species arw capable of avoiding on purpose.
