By "natural order" here I didn't mean anything mystical, just the pre-human equilibrium that was more or less stable - with all the unavoidable dynamical fluctuations - as long as the Earth's climate and other external conditions remained approximately constant. There is still change of course, but usually it's on MUCH longer timescales than what we do.

  whether anything or anyone ever "needs" to self-regulate isn't a thing either, except when they are at risk of hunting their own prey to extinction

Which is exactly our situation. We've hunted many species to extinction, we indirectly destroyed many others, and we threaten the very climate conditions from which our own food supply depends. So, yes, we /do/ need to self regulate, because nothing can regulate us otherwise short of straight up global environmental collapse.
