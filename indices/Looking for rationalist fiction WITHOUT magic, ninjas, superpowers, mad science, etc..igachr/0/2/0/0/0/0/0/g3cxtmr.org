You don't even need to "imagine". We brought rabbits, goats and cats to islands in the Pacific where they'd never been, and where a much less harsh competition had led to life forms that weren't as used to defending themselves. The outcome was a complete slaughter. Fuck, cats kill /everything that's smaller than them/, and their main advantage is that thanks to us they managed to breed way more that they had any right to as predators, because they share our food supply. But that doesn't somehow make them happy with their luck; leave them free to roam, and they'll obliterate your local fauna of small mammals and birds. And often won't even eat their prey. They just kill for the fun of it.
