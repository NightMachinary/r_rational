Ah, I can see that. That is definitely a useful concept to have, and the book does do a good job of explaining it as far as I remember it. Still, I'm not really comfortable with it also having so many false claims and ideas being presented as fact.

Re: self-regulation, I'd attribute our mass extinction to being way more powerful than other species, rather than self-regulating less. Imagine some predator species gained the ability to kill as easily as we can, say a supernatural ability to shoot magic bullets just by force of will. They would spread across the world and utterly devastate every ecosystem in existence. There would be no conservation efforts, no hunting quotas, no protected wilderness areas. They would simply hunt everything. Humans aren't doing a great job on that front, but we are self-regulating to some degree. Non-human animals simply are incapable of self-regulating on a species-wide or population-wide scale. At all. Ever. That's the whole idea behind group selectionism being wrong, evolution only works on individual families, and never does anything for the good of the species/population/ecosystem as a whole.
