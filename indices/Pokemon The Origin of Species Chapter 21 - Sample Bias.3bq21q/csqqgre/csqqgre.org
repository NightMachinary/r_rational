Here's my theory as to the diversity of Pokemon, after thinking about it for five seconds: Pokemon evolve to be different from other species of Pokemon. This is why the more time goes on, the whackier they become as the Blind Idiot Gods grow more and more desperate for ideas.

I have no idea how this would function in practice.
