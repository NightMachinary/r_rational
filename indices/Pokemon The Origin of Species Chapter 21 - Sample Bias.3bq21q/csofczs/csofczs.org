Hey all, welcome back! Quick note about pokemon nativity, as I've had a few people ask this before:

The criterion I've used so far is the latest generation that includes Kanto, which is Heartgold and Soulsilver. Any pokemon that appear on a route in Kanto in those games are what might be found in the story, including obviously their evolutions, which I believe are largely excluded from the games for balance reasons and design restrictions.

Keep the comments, questions and feedback coming, and enjoy!
