Yay, an update!

Some notes:

"and the earliest specimen show many of the same features as them" -> technically wrong (them should be they), but really I think you should just rework this part of the sentence.

"specie" -> I think "species" is the singular and the plural form.

"by many human's standards of beauty anyway" -> "many humans' standards" or "many human standards"

"Why not read him what your review of the museum?" -> "read him your review..." or "what your review... says"

"I can give them the head's up" -> I think it's "heads up".

I can't wait for the next chapter.
