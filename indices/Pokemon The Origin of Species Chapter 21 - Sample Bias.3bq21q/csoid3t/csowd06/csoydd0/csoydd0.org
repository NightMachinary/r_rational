Those, and the rangers involving the kids extensively during the event with the beedrill, and running into 8-badges rival-to-famous-dragon-trainer Donovan and petting his skarmory, and Red getting a personal response from Giovanni, one of the most famous people around. No single event is out of place, but there is a definite trend of having fantastic luck getting high-status people to humor them.

The only exceptions I recall off the top of my head are Blue getting blown off during an emergency, and Blue getting confronted about his Shiftry. Since those both happen to Blue, it just feels like he's not in Red and Leaf's good luck bubble.
