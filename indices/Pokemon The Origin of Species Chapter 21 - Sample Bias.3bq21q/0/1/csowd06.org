  That was my first worry for your story, and I admit I've kept a bit of doubt about that even when Red wasn't right immediately. I think that after Red's musings here, I'm completely on board now.

Glad to hear it :) Do keep on your toes though, so you can point out if I slip up!

  but this is several times now that authority figures have acted unusually inclusive for our heroes. As a trend, that makes me raise an eyebrow.

Mind helping me remember the other ones? Other than Professor Oak obviously, there was the guy at the first House in Viridian who helped Red after he pestered/persuaded him a bit, maybe? Or am I misinterpreting what you mean by inclusive?
