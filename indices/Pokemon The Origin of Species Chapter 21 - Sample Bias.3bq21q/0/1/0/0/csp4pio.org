Ahh I see. The Rangers actually have SOP to include any willing nearby trainers in operations, but if you'll recall they excluded them from any of the planning. Donovan was just being friendly, but Giovanni sending a response, however short, was definitely a highlight for Red... and may or may not have something to do with him name-dropping Oak.

Blue definitely has been having a rougher time of things socially, but then, he does have higher social ambitions and lower social graces. I'll keep an eye out though to ensure I'm not being /too/ hard on him disproportionately to the others :)
