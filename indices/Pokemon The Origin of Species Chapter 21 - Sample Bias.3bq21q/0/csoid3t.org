Of course, in the real world, we know that pokemon /are/ intelligently designed! I'm curious to see where that line of inquiry goes in your world, especially considering baffling things like voltorb, trubbish, cryogonal, lunatone, and every ghost pokemon. Girafarig's nerves and the mentioned transitional species point to biological evolution in spite of those ridiculous things - this world isn't going to give up its secrets easily, if at all! That was my first worry for your story, and I admit I've kept a bit of doubt about that even when Red wasn't right immediately. I think that after Red's musings here, I'm completely on board now.

I hope we get to see what Brock thinks of the whole museum business, if he is indeed involved. I imagine Red wants to know too if it isn't too awkward to bring up, with whatever he's doing with Blue. I can't think of how you could write Brock as anything other than a creationist strawman at this point, but I'm sure you'll surprise me. You haven't written an idiot yet.

It did seem a little strange to me that Dr. Brenner was so nice to some random kid pestering other visitors, and not even about sciency paleontological stuff. I might understand the behind-the-scenes tour better if she met Red instead of Leaf, or if Dr. Brenner was shown to know Leaf's connections... It's not unbelievable - She works at a museum, of course she loves doing outreach stuff! - but this is several times now that authority figures have acted unusually inclusive for our heroes. As a trend, that makes me raise an eyebrow.

I'm quite enjoying this story so far!
