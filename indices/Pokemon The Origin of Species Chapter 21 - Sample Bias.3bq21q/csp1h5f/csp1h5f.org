Awesome! I recently recommended this story to my biology instructor and he's going to read it!

Also, why are the main characters (or at least Red) so mature for their age? They seem like adults, rather than 11 year olds. Does it have something to do with how they're taught to survive independently from such an early age so aren't sheltered so much? Combine that with Red's psychically suppressed trauma from his father's death, and maybe that explains why he seems psychologically more like an adult than a child? Although it still seems weird to me...I'm half expecting there to eventually be a reveal for Red like the one in HPMOR where Harry wasn't REALLY mentally an eleven year old, but rather a magic brain-clone of an adult Tom Riddle with memories erased. There IS a reasonable explanation for why Red doesn't act like a child, right?
