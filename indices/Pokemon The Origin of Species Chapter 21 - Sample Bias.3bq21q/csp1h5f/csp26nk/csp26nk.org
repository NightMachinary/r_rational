Actually, they all act similarly to smart children I know. They know a surprising amount of stuff, and they can be surprisingly good at employing strategies they've learned, but they're also distinctly immature. Red takes a lot of things personally when he shouldn't, he hasn't quite mastered the art of empathy, and he tends to assume that everyone sees things his way by default.

This jumped out to me most strongly in chapter 14, when Red is asking to test his spinarak's attack on Blue. Blue declines, and Red gets angry at him in a way that is classically childish. He's the viewpoint character, so he can justify some of what he does, but he is totally a kid.
