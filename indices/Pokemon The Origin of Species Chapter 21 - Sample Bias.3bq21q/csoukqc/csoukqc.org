I notice that their fossil record seems to be a lot shorter than ours. Even if you count only from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion][Cambrian explosion]], ours is almost almost twice as long. And for cyanobacteria there's fossils basically [[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/bacteria/cyanofr.html][since the beginning of geology]].

So if their oldest fossils are really only 300 mil. years old, including cyanobacteria and everything, that would be a meta-evidence in favor of panspermia, because their life would be awfully recent, and the evolution awfully accelerated by our standards. Of course, in universe they have no way of knowing that.
