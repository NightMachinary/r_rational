Hi, I just did an archive binge of your story. I'm liking it! It's like the trio are trying to figure out how to survive in a RPG where they wandered out of the tutorial zone too early.

The one thing that distracts me is the inversion of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedOniBlueOni][Red Oni, Blue Oni]], especially since Red picked up the Fire pokemon and Blue picked up the Water pokemon in that their personalities seem to be the opposite of the symbolism.
