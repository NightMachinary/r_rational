Thanks, glad you're enjoying it so much! Do let me know what they think if they get around to it :)

As for the intelligence/maturity thing, in addition to what [[/u/Anakiri]] said (I do try to keep the characters at least somewhat normally childlike) you're kind of correct too: in the pokemon world people tend to be just baseline smarter and more mature, because of selective pressures and cultural differences, which is why kids go on pokemon journeys at such young ages (though usually in groups). I'll probably expand on this a bit more in the next author note, since it's something that comes up often.
