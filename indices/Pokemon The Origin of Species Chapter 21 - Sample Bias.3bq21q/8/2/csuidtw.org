I was just at a family reunion with my nieces and 2nd cousins. I literally asked my eldest niece what she was doing this summer to achieve her goal of eventually becoming a professional violinist (reply: she isn't doing anything besides the usual practicing and lessons). Very very few real 11-year old would be able to figure how to achieve their world-changing ambition and would instead be distracted by a television program involving princesses, the device the simulations are played on, or whatever seems fun in the moment.
