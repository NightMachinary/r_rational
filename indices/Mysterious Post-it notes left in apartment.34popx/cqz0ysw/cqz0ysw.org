It's very scary to look at the explanations in the other thread and see what was really going on. Memory loss I can almost cope with, but he doesn't recognize his own handwriting, and later thinks a letter from his mother is really from his landlord. He thinks there's people breaking into his apartment, but it was just him all along... It reads like something from the SCP Foundation.

Except it's real. (Assuming OP isn't a pathological liar on top of everything else, of course.)
