The only other thing that's online right now are my entries for the [[/r/worldbuilding]] challenges - you can read those in the links below. Some (most?) are in the form of supershort stories, and some have longer stories attached. Other than that, there's a lot of unfinished stuff, some of which won't ever be finished, but not much of it is online (the only one I can think of off the top of my head is [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zdueoKCpOwienqc7qEa6n9XCsoiY7_1MgU589r6Hlq0/edit?usp=sharing][Dark Tidings]], which only has one chapter "published" and three or four more written - that was my first attempt at proper humor, which I'm not terribly good at). Oh, and I'm also one of the lead lore writers for an indie game called Frontiers, which is still in development and has another few months left, but I'm not sure how much of the stuff I wrote will end up in the books that litter the game.

Edit: Oh, and also [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rZ5xBiQhyBy7iCgt1P7PHq8EuoHZvtU0bUd4qBlj3aw/edit?usp=sharing][Timeline]] which was a short story that I wrote awhile back, which explores a lot of the same space that this fanfic does (this was sort of my testbed for a novel-length treatment about crimefighting in a universe with terminator-esque rules).
