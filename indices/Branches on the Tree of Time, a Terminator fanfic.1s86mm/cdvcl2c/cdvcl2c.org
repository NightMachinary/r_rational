Oh this is good, if not at all character-accurate. But, hey, time-travel!

The fact that it's unfinished on such a goddamn cliffhanger is frustrating. Worse is that the author has run into a nasty potential block-point since Sarah Connor is about to try running her own Preston-Logan Attack on Skynet.

EDIT: Now that the Fic is finished, I'll have to say that it's middling-good. You could definitely detect a little author fatigue by the climax - getting mind-mapping technologies sub-Utopian future timelines is certainly within the bounds of the story-as-written, but singularities make for iffy storytelling. I would have personally felt more satisfied if the story had ended with an friendly-but-traumatized Skynet booking it away from humanity or otherwise showing signs that its unique and heavily extended birth trauma had effected it.

With those caveats/complaints listed, I liked what I read very much [[/u/alexanderwales]]. I'm glad you chose this story to get the fanfic bug out of your system.
