I think maybe I should have just cut it off before the epilogue and made things more vague. I also thought about having utopia be rolled out slower, instead of just having the singularity happen right away, which would give a different epilogue entirely. Either way the central conflict of the story is done, which makes it harder to write. I don't know. I'll be cleaning it up a bit after a couple weeks to let it fade from my mind - it's not really edited right now, and I always find editing better when I've had a chance to get some distance.

Edit: Did some editing, added another alternate epilogue. If you find this fic and get to the end, I'd appreciate you telling me what you think.
