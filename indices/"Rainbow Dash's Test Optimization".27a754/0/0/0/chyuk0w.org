You might as well ask, "Why so many rationalized superheroes?" This is technically just one story updating.

Additional reason: because Hollywood movies have such low fun-levels you might as well not bother rationalizing them in the first place :-p.

Additional reason: because rationalfic of anime aren't updating and neither is HPMoR.

Final reason: don't make me rainbow-nuke you.
