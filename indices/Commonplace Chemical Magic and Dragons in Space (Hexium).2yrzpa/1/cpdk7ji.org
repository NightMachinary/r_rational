So, although magic is only found on Earth, you could bring hexium anywhere and it would work there? It's just that nowhere else has useful concentrations lying around, and nowhere else has life that evolved to use it?

Do Earthlings need a certain amount of hexium in their diet like we do other minerals - you know, a recommended daily intake of 20mg of iron, 10mg of zinc, 5 mg of hexium? Do you have to take hexium supplements if you're eating foods grown on other planets?

  The magic communicates to the individual Hexium atoms in the object and makes them begin to vibrate, heating the object until it combusts.

How do you make the hexium atoms vibrate? Controlling their movement like that doesn't seem to follow from the description you gave.

Are you limited to targeting things by chemistry? "Set fire to wooden things within the range I can affect", rather than "set fire to that door"?
