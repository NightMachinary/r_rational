Hexium functions the same in space as it does in earth. Although with fewer other atoms to control. Hexium is darn near nonexistent in the entire rest of the universe, as far as anyone can tell.

Yes, that would make sense. People could probably get pretty sick from food without Hexium, just as aliens probably couldn't digest anything that had it. That would be an interesting challenge if they ever decided to take on a new crew member.

The radiation communicates more than just bonds. It also communicates things like temperature, density, charge. Basically everything about that atom's current individual state except momentum and position. You could make the other atoms vibrate and heat up by agitating the atoms within your organ. That being said, the target atoms would have to have a source for the energy of that vibration since even magic doesn't come free...

The targeting works through the shielding that surrounds the Magus organ. It works a lot like the pupil of an eyeball, except letting magic out instead of light in. It can point towards specific objects intuitively and all radiation from within is released in a concentrated beam towards that object. Of course you could also do AOE for less effect to more targets if you really wanted to. The particle beam will effect the first Hexium material it hits, whatever that may be. So you can't transmute something past a wall without first transmuting the wall.
