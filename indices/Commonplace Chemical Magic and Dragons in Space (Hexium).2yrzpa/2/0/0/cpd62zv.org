Suppose you have an atom of hexium, an atom of oxygen, and a magi currently set with hexium bonded to oxygen. The hexium and oxygen can be bonded or not bonded. The hexium and magi can be close or far.

Let's set unbonded and far to zero potential energy. Hexium binds weakly to oxygen. Let's call the binding energy b. Potential energy in this configuration is -b. Let unbounded and near have x potential energy. Hexium will now bond strongly to oxygen with a higher binding energy B. Thus, potential energy for bound and near is x-B.

Suppose there is no force with unbound hexium. This would be my guess as to how it works, and it would mean that x = 0. Now bound and far has energy -b, but bound and near has energy -B. Since bound and far has B-b more potential energy, there's that much force moving it to bound and near.
