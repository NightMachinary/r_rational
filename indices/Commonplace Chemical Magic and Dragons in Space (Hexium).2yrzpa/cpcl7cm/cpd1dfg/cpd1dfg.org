I hadn't decided. It's an unusually heavy metal. Its possible it could fill the slot of element 126 (unbihexium), since that element is supposed to be more stable than most in the eighth period, or parts of even the seventh. The similarity in name is a bonus too. Similar arguments could be made for element 164 (unhexquadium), which is also rarely stable, and also has the added bonus of being a metal.

Or, alternatively, since it is magic, however well explained, and isn't supposed to fit squarely within our physical laws, it could have no protons, or have a fractional or irrational number of protons, or even i protons. In other words, it doesn't have to fit neatly into the periodic table. I'm sorry if that answer is incredibly useless, but at least for now there isn't really a better one.
