Does it conserve energy? The description seems consistent with that. If you try to make it bind with the oxygen in water, you'll have to force it away from carbon or whatever it's strongly bonded with, putting energy into the system. If it does conserve energy, that limits what you can do, but it also means that it's not a perpetual motion machine where nobody cares what else it does.

If you're conserving energy, then hexium should be attracted to like-bonded hexium, and possibly repelled from unlike-bonded hexium. It should also take energy to block the magical radiat between like-bonded hexium.
