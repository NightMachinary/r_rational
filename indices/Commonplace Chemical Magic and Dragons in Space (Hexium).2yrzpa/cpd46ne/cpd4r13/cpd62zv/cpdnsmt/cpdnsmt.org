Very interesting stuff. I'd never considered this as a possibility.

I'm going to try and get some estimates for how strong this effect would be.

A powerful chemical bond like a C-C bond or an O-H bond is in the range of a few hundred kilojoules per mole, so let's put that as our value for a "strong" Hexium bond.

Also assume the Hexium field follows an inverse-square law, like all forms of radiation.

Let's say that one metre is considered "close range", so the potential energy of a mole of Hexium is a hundred kilojoules at that distance. "Far range" is at an infinite distance with a bond strength of 0. Then the force on the nearby mole of Hexium would be 100,000 newtons, or a weight of 10 tons.

A mole of pure Hexium is quite a lot, so it makes sense that it would experience a lot of force. If Hexium is indeed Element 126 as [[/u/DCarrier]] suggested earlier, it'll be quite heavy - more than 300g/mol. The acceleration on a mole of pure Hexium would then be 300,000 m/s^{2}. But we're not dealing with pure Hexium, we're dealing with substances that contain traces of Hexium. So another way of phrasing that acceleration is: 1 metre per second squared, for every three parts per million of appropriately bonded Hexium it contains. And decreasing quadratically with distance.

This is assuming quite a strong chemical bond, the attraction would be proportionately weaker with a less powerful bond. And the inverse-square law is an oversimplification, there may be some limit to how strong the bond can get so the attraction wouldn't be that strong at very short ranges.
