That's a very good question. I think it does, simply because the concept of equivalent exchange is very important to me. It would have to unbind from something in order to do as you command it, which may come with its own unforseen consequences as those atoms would then be free to rebound to whatever other chemicals were available. Which is good. No magic system is complete without some kind of unforseen consequences.

Could you maybe give a quick rundown of that bit about attraction? It's a good concept that actually makes the evolution of Magi more easily explainable. I'll probably use it. I'm just wondering what led you to it.
