I wonder how historians in this world ever make sense of the things that happen, because the narrative and the events happening are two entirely separate things. Here, the allied army attacks, is pushed back by the Drow, and then "wins" a crushing "victory" once Pilgrim used his miracle. But the narrative is that Cat just stabbed him with a metaphysical knife, and that's such an abstruse move that it'd be difficult for an outsider to understand, much less study.
