  Catherine Foundling was offering unconditional surrender. It would be a great victory, if he accepted. Victory.

  Gods damn that vicious child.

So what are we looking at here. If he accepts, it breaks the rule of three narrative he'd built and leaves the armies under her command as POW's they have no way of holding, and if he rejects it then he's probably consigned to a narrative that ends with defeat in this battle and long term narrative advantage for Cat.

Either way I feel like I'm missing important factors at play.
