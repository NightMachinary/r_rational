As Cat said in chapter 30, he will not accept since he won't get his draw (and worse, he will not be able to get it anytime in the futur).

The unconditionnal surrender is not a lie, it's the knife, because it will be refused. And because it will be refused, the well against the sun will not end in a draw, but in a crushing victory for Cat since there is no narrative weight for the Pilgrim anymore. And the best part will be at the conference latter "why you didn't accept my unconditionnal surrender?" Malenza/the levantine "You refused Her WHAT?"
