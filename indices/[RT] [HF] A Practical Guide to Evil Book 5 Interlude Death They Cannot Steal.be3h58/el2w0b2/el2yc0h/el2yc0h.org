Cat has specifically crafted a weapon to strike at the sword of the Saint of Swords, but it turns out that Saint has spent DECADES telling creation she IS a sword. That's not Contessa levels of "I win," that's having Contessa on your ass levels of "I'm fucked."

Best part is, Cat put it all together without ever knowing about Saint's cutlery cosplay, she just worked with the narrative she saw.
