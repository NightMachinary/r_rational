I haven't forgotten this, it simply hasn't happened yet.

Cat has /talked/ to people about the possibility of this, and it has been stated as being /possible/, but we as the readers/audience have not actually seen it done 'on camera', as it were. So, until we do, it stays in the realm of the hypothetical.

However, *if* it is true... well, then they are even more OP then I had originally thought, and you are right in that they aren't just one of the best counters to the Dead King's forces, but perhaps the /best/ counter to them.

Lesser Drow could potentially gain in strength fighting and claiming the Night of the lesser Undead, while the greater Drow would do the same hunting down the ex-Named. It could easily snowball out of hand and turn on the Dead King quickly.

Even better, his usual approach of "Kill it, then make it mine" won't matter too much so long as Cat or another is designated "First Under the Night", AKA, High Priest(ess) of the twin goddesses. Because we *have* seen Cat use their power to strip all the Night from a living Drow. Even if the Dead King manages to get his hands on a Drow and convert it to undeath, the First Under the Night can simply take all its Night away and leave it powerless.

I must admit, I originally thought the Everdark excursion was simply 'filler', but recently it has turned out to be one of the key lynchpins to Cat not just surviving, but perhaps pulling off a win over the forces arrayed against her. Fortunately, I am quite happy to be wrong about it.
