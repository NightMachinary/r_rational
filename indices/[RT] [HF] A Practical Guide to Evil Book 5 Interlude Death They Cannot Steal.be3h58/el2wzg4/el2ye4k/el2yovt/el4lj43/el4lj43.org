Actually, it's even better than that, because when you fight, you improve. In a classical army, this experience can be lost (if the guy kills 5 opponents before dying himself), in a drow army, it doesn't. So the result at the end of the day for Drow isn't 50000, but something like 55000 due to the experience gained (and even more if you consider that drow will also harvest opponents).

However, it's not exactly true either. Because some of what which make someone skilled will be shared by everyone and thus, won't give anything to other. If, for instance, your army is composed by guys who have at 100% the exact same skillset, then, you won't gain anything by harvesting them. You won't because twice at good at holding a shield or using a sword if you harvest someone who hold the shield or use the sword in the very same way than you.
