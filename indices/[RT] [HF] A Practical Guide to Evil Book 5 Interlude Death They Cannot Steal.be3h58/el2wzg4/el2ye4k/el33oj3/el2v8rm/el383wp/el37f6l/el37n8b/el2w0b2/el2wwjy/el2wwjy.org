Disagree. Yes, Saint has made herself into essentially a living weapon that can tell reality to go F itself. However, when you live in a world of stories that sort of tale is begging for a reversal. I feel that this manipulation has made Saint stronger against almost all opponents, but more brittle against the wrong (or from our perspective, right) ones.
