Anyone else feels worry over Wandering Bard not appearing for a long time? I have a bad feeling about the lack of exposition of the damned Intercessor. I feel like she is secretly pulling the strings and Catherine and everyone else is unwittingly dancing to her tune. My thought is that she caused Hasenbach to think that she needs to engage the Army of Callow (by deceiving Augur), and all that unfolds is the result of this. It also seems to me that she has her hand in nudging Tariq towards his conviction that Catherine is a danger to Calernia and needs to be exterminated. Does anyone else feel this way?
