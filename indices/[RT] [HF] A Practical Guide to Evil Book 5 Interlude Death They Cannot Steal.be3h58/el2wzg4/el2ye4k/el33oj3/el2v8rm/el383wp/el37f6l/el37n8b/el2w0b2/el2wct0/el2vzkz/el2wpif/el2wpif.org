So if this is the knife, Vivenne's the bet and Kairos is the lie? It makes sense but if anything seems too simple, I'm wary for some inversion. [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2019/04/08/chapter-31-fall-or-flight/][Cat repeats the order, knife, bet, lie, both before and after dictating the letters, to Kairos, Pilgrim, and Vivienne, respectively.]] I can't see the shape of it yet but it makes thematic sense that that's the order the letters are written in as well*. Can't wait til Friday.

*I realize on the face of it that there's a bunch of logical reasons why that order doesn't make sense, but for story reasons, the apparent lay of things makes TOO much sense and we're already mostly aware of it so Narrative makes me suspicious it can't be that.
