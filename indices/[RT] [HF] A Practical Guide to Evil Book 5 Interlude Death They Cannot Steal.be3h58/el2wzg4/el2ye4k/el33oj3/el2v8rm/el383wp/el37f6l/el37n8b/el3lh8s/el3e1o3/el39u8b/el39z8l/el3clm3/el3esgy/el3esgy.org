I think it's outcome -1 : +1, then outcome 0 : 0, then outcome +1 : -1 for some pair of people. The Pilgrim (and Cat, to some extent) seem to believe that they have to happen in order, and that's the narrative trope so I bet that's how it works in-universe. Thus, this would break the three, meaning Pilgrim isn't guaranteed a win in their next encounter, meaning he loses his knife.

Thus, I don't think this is the knife; this doesn't guarantee Cat anything, it just means she ISN'T guaranteed a loss. Unless this starts a NEW rule of three, and the next encounter will lean to a draw and the last one will be a victory for Cat...
