The letter of surrender is such a master stroke on so many levels. Not only does it stab the Pilgrim with a metaphorical knife, it forces the Tyrant to act and make sure the surrender does not actually happen. The Tyrant wants a peace conference afterward and that cannot happen if there is a decisive victor.
