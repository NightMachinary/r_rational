Something occurred to me when talking with a friend about the story, and the Drow in particular...

Cat has a unique fighting force, rarely seen in any form of fantasy or sci-fi. Namely, she has a military unit that does *not* get weaker as individual members are killed. Because of the way the Night works, any 'losses' that occur amongst the Drow here don't really matter in the grand scheme of things.

Let's pretend there are 50,000 Drow, all as strong and skilled as baseline Human soldiers (we're lowballing here, for good reason). We'll call this their 'combat level'. Let's say they fight against 50,000 Humans, who obviously have the same 'combat level'. Let's say both sides lose 10,000 combatants in a fight.

At the end of the day, the Human fighting force has a 'combat level' equivalent to 40,000. 4/5ths what it started with. But the *DROW* have a 'combat level' equivalent to *50,000*, the exact number they started with.

The Drow's losses, while important from the perspective of repopulating their species, are meaningless in the terms of military conflict, so long as they have access to the bodies of their fallen, and thus their Night... which includes their magic powers, their memories, and the skills they acquired over their lifetimes.

Of course, their numbers do give them obvious benefits, like being able to split the numbers into smaller armies, etc, etc. So having 1,000 of them each equivalent to 50 Humans each might have some drawbacks, the concentrated Night opens up more possibilities as well, that weaker troops can't match.

Also, when it comes down to fighting the Dead King, the Drow are perfect for the job. We know that memories and skills are part of the Night, and so when those are harvested, any corpses raised as Undead by definition can't be the sapient kind, and at best would be some common mindless zombie. While losing Drow is not ideal, doing so does *NOT* advantage the Dead King at all, and instead makes the remaining Drow /that much harder/ for him to kill.

--------------

*TLDR*: Cat can tolerate the losses of her special Drow troops *far* more easily than any other fighting force on the field. This will come in quite handy when fighting the Dead King as well, since if the Night is harvested, the corpse is functionally useless--no skills, no training, it's nothing more than an empty meat puppet, and all the living allies of the new Undead are that much stronger.

Going to the Everdark was possibly one of the best, most game-breakingly awesome decisions Cat ever made.
