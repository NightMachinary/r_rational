This is definitely the highest peak for us with Cat. But from a story standpoint, these high highs make me super nervous for the Big Fight coming up. Erratic is basically lifting Cat up only to show us how insignificant she is against the Dead King. We're gonna lose some folks, people. Bare yourself. Or as Zeze says, *Witness*.
