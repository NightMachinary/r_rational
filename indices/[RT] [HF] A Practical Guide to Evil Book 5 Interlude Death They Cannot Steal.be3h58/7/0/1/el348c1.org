  /I feel that this manipulation has made Saint stronger against almost all opponents, but more brittle against the wrong (or from our perspective, right) ones./

A sword that swings itself even when its wielder doesn't want to is not a good sword. Swords cannot broker the details of peace deals or weave stories, that's why they get beaten into ploughshares.

Saint's weakness is basically that she leaves all the thinking to the Pilgrim and everyone else. She just cuts things up, even if it ends up for the worse for "her side". Might end up kissing a pillow held by the Pilgrim if she goes too far.
