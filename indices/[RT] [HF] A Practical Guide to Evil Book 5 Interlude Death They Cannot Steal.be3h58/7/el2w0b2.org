The bit about the broken oaths tipping the scale is interesting. I know the title isn't 'a lie', but if the unconditional Surrender somehow turns out to be both a lie and correct (say, the unconditional part, or she just legs it later) that evens the scales, breaks the possible pattern of 3 and sets them back to 0.
