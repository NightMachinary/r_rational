This is very much /not/ the conflict between truth and beauty that the comments section portrays it as, though. At least within the context of the world of Unsong, it's a conflict between awareness of a bigger-picture truth/beauty and awareness of the present, local situation - the latter of which is directly epistemologically inferior, as the former isn't /unaware/ of the present, local situation, it just realizes its true irrelevance.

The Right Hand Of God isn't ignorance, as the comments suggest; it's the opposite, awareness. And the Left Hand Of God (Thamiel) isn't truth, either: it's a lie.
