Rereading them, I can see how the text is more ambiguous than I remembered, but there's [[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-6-till-we-have-built-jerusalem/][this passage in chapter six]], which I interpreted to mean that Thamiel is more than just a type of angel, and what we see as Thamiel is just the incarnation of something that is far bigger:

  I remembered reading something about how Thamiel was a facet of God and couldn't actually be killed
#+end_quote

Also, when Uriel is telling Sohu why he can't kill Thamiel, he explains that even if he /did/ do so, Thamiel would still be able to interfere (in some way that dead angels, it seems, cannot).

Like I said, though, this is less clear cut than I recalled.
