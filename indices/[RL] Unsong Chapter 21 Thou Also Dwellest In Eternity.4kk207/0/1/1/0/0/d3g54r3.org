Thaumiel is the personified form of the duality of God and the Sephirot. Whether Thaumiel is a person or a place doesn't really matter, just as God is both a person and a spirit. In fact, Thaumiel is both a person (one with two heads and bat-like wings) and a place (which Satan rules).

Anyways, Thamiel isn't Satan. Thamiel is Thaumiel. Sataniel is Satan.
