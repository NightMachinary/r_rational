So, um, literally the first result on Google, if you search for "Thamiel," gets you this:

#+begin_quote
  Thaumiel (twins of God) is the name of one of the Qliphoth in the Kabbalah, the shadow side of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. It is the shadow of the Sephirah Keter (the crown). While Keter is concerned with the unity of God, Thaumiel represents the dual contending forces, struggling, and it is represented by /two giant heads/ with bat-like wings.

Well, okay, his heads aren't giant, but he's still got two of them. Also, that other stuff's been mentioned, I'm pretty sure.

But just in case it wasn't, the article also says this, point blank:

#+begin_quote
  The ruler of Thaumiel is Satan.
