Some of the similarities are causal rather than coincidental; the Golden Gate Strait, which the Golden Gate Bridge is named after, got its name because John Fremont was making a reference to the Golden Gate of Constantinople, which in turn was named by Constantine, who was Christian and presumably knew about the Golden Gate of Jerusalem (especially given the symbolism).

I'm fairly certain that Scott is just putting in a bunch of work though, and hiding all the comparisons that don't pan out, which makes it more impressive.
