A little late to the party, but I'm trying to figure out a new magic system for a novella I wanted to write about mathemagicians.

The idea is that a fourth spacial dimension exists called the Traverse, and magic is the physics, chemistry, and logic surrounding interacting with that dimension (this branch of science would be called traversal mechanics, I think). I wrote a bunch of frantic messages about it that I'm just going to copy over.

Everything in the universe has fourth dimensional properties, we just aren't able to perceive them. Humans go on about the soul or spirit or aura of a person, when really they're just talking about the traversal component of that person. This is the immortal part of a human, the soul. It is beyond the fabric of space time and not bound by it, tied to it only by the fragile form manifested when a person is born. As a square is the shadow of a cube cast into 2D, a cube is the shadow of a tesseract cast into 3D. Think of the human as a cube. The human is the shadow of a fourth dimensional soul.

But everything, and I mean everything, interacts with traverse, right? It would have to, even if just to touch it, like a flat surface in a 2d world would still be within our 3d world.

That's how enchanting and magic work. Figuring out those components through mathematical proofs, and once the interactions are known, manipulating them. They are somewhat arbitrary from the 3d POV, since a layman wouldn't understand why a magician combines gold, saltpeter, ritual prayer and the shedded blood of a goose to alter the weather, but the mechanics are there. (I only offer this as an example, this isn't actually how I want to do spell crafting in my world)

perhaps a magician could create an area where time is dilated by a fourth dimensional object outside our 3d world with a specific chemical process that creates an incredibly dense object just "above" the region he's influencing in the fourth dimension.

I had some mechanics that two quantum entangled diamonds with a traversal current running through them were how they achieved long range teleportation.

the language of traversal mechanics is logic and math. if you know all of the working parts of someone's psyche, you can logically work out their true name (which is not something that can be expressed through verbal communication but doesn't need to be, once you know it it can be expressed by the will in the fourth dimension, in a kind of as below so above deal)

but it's really really really difficult to pin down all the moving parts of someone's identity. you'd have to know all their core memories, all their biggest hang ups and triumphs, everything. so unless you are like high level stalker or they totally trust you with every detail of their lives, you can't just pull someone's true name out of your ass. But this also means that with each new "core event" that changes a person's life, their true name also changes.

so that means a person is a very long function of variables (those variables being their core events that make them who they are, everything from their myer-briggs profile to whether or not their mom or dad are still alive) that once you know those variables, you can make that function equal to whatever you want.

That's pretty much all I've come up with so far, but I really want to build a system that's got hard science rules. My favorite concept about this was the creating a Time Dilation through a heavy dense object along the fourth dimension above where our plane exists. I also love the idea of wizards being dedicated mathematicians, chemists, physicists, and logicians that are able to interact with an extra spacial dimension. If anyone wants to help me build it or break it, it would be much appreciated.
