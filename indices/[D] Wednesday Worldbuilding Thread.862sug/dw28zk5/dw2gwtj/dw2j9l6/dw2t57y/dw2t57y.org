Ah I had assumed that the AI's wouldn't be limited to average intelligence because that would mean they could rarely be perfect partners for anyone particularly clever. Plus given partners with more social intelligence are pretty much always better, even dumb/average people would still prefer socially intelligent humans over AI (meaning high status people would all be able to do better than AI partners, and as a result AI partners would become seen as low status).

Plus of course there's the obvious problems wherein there's no plausible scenario where you can make AI that's average human level but not higher that lasts for any meaningful period of time. Plus given the speed up advancements due to AI (for reasons mentioned below) this period will become even more miniscule /especially considering it will be what everyone is interested in working on due to it's obvious significance/.

However should that scenario come to pass things will still speed up faster since work that doesn't require significant intelligence would still be around, forcing anyone smart enough to do those jobs to do so (though nearly everything would still need to be socialist if only 5% of people had economic value). Science would be much faster since all the practical work would be done by AI leaving only the advanced theoretical work which would be done by any genius humans interested in that.

  It's possible to get AIs to run much faster than a human mind, but just like how super-computers today are exorbitantly expensive, it's the same level of cost to run AIs at faster rates than the norm.

So since cost scales linearly then given the base cost of AI you could still afford to have plenty of AI's working at say 10x speed on many problems which don't require any genius. So like I said /anything/ not requiring genius is gong to speed up massively since a AI running at 100x speed will likely produce 100x the results/profits especially considering that the AI it makes sense to run at increased speed aren't going to be controlling extremely slow bodies.

  Most of the price is in the robotics and compactness of the hardware like you surmised and there are AIs who do plenty of mental labor outside of an android body, but wireless connection isn't good enough to allow remote operation (too much necessary computations in too short of a time frame).
#+end_quote

See that explanation doesn't really seem like it would work. Human like bodies don't operate /that/ quickly, so given all the AI needs to do is control the motor functions, being outside the robotic body isn't going to introduce enough lag to really matter. Especially considering you've said the "base" AI can run at 3x speed.\\
Plus you can also solve these problems a great deal by compartmentalizing much of the code necessary to control the body (implementing fine motor details and maintaining balance) and only putting /that/ in the body, thus allowing you to keep all the more complex AI functions separate thus saving a lot of money.
