I'm reposting a part of my comment to vakusdrake here to address the assumption that the AIs can be run even faster than normal speeds:

  I would say that AIs are at best comparable to average intelligence for a human rather than the genius level that commenters here are assuming. It's possible to get AIs to run much faster than a human mind, but just like how super-computers today are exorbitantly expensive, it's the same level of cost to run AIs at faster rates than the norm. AIs can think about two to three times faster than normal, but it can damage their hardware just like overclocking can damage a laptop with more expensive consequences.
