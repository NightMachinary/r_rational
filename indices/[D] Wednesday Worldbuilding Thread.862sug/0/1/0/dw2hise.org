  Laws would need to be written to keep A.I. from becoming property owners so that they do not become the inheritors of huge amounts of wealth. Assuming they have no life-expectancy, letting them become property owners would be problematic.

Given millions of genius level human-like AI working on curing aging (likely mostly running faster than realtime) the inheritance issue doesn't seem likely to be terribly relevant for long.

Also given most people would want their AI companions to be better people than they are (or rather at least as altruistic of individuals as they /think/ they are), it doesn't seem like letting AI companions inherit wealth would be a bad thing.

Though of course all of this is likely underscored by the fact that everything would already have to be fairly socialist anyway otherwise nearly all humans would have long since starved to death due to their labor being totally worthless.

EDIT: If the AI are /average/ human level intelligences then some areas will still be dominated by humans because you need to be clever to be good at them. However people with a great deal of wealth will also be high status enough that they will want human partners who are both attractive and have high intelligence social or otherwise. And any inheritance passed on to AI won't be stable long term because average intelligence individuals just can't compete in the sorts of areas that grow wealth faster than the market.\\
But as I've said in my other comment, this period of average human level intelligence can't last very long so many of these issues won't be super relevant for long.
