I think you immediately see even more of a decline in the middle-upper class having kids and or seeking human spouses. The would allow anyone with the income to afford it to have an 'eternal child'. Many people may desire this instead of a real child because it is more disposable and less of an inconvenience I am sure it would be costly to let the child pass through phases of life, but some people may still prefer it to human children.

Laws would need to be written to keep A.I. from becoming property owners so that they do not become the inheritors of huge amounts of wealth. Assuming they have no life-expectancy, letting them become property owners would be problematic.
