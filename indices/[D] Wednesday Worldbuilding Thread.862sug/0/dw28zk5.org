It's 40 years into the future and while AI above human-level intelligence haven't been successfully created (that you know of /tinfoil hat/), human-level AIs in very realistic android bodies are viable and cost as much as an average car. Such AIs can be created to be the perfect companion and can adapt and change to match you perfectly as you change and grow. Their appearance can be nearly anything that follows the basic humanoid body plan and often falls into near the human ideal for beauty. Their only 'flaw' relationship-wise is that they cannot be used for reproductive purposes. No having a child with them.

With the creation of androids whose appearance and personality are perfectly customizable to be the ideal romantic, platonic, or familial partner, what will happen to human society/population size?
