Well as people on this subreddit likely already realize even just human level AI is an absolute game changer for every part of society. After all given the adaptability mentioned presumably the AI can match human mental ability in any area, which means human labor is now worthless outside of possibly some extremely cheap third world labor. There also a number of questions you need to answer that will affect the specifics of this scenario:

- How much does it cost computationally to get the AI to run at much faster speeds than a human mind, and how much does that amount of computation cost? Even if the price given is only for 1x speed AI and computation costs scale linearly (though sublinearly is more likely by far), you're still going to have some extremely fast running AI (which remember are all peak human intelligence) which means this pre singularity time period won't last very long on human timescales.

- Given androids are car-cost, how much of that cost is the hardware running the AI and how much is the robotics? Because it's very likely that most of the costs are robotics and making the computing hardware compact (as well as the computational cost of handling the body). Which means that quite plausible most mental labor done by AI would be at least an order of magnitude cheaper. However if this goes too far then there's no reason to have the AI housed in the robot bodies, instead of having it control them wirelessly.

Anyway even in the most conservative scenario it doesn't seem like human populations would be affected just because things would advance so rapidly in a single generation given billions of genius AI's working on advancing things in so many different areas. Or rather I suppose biological human population wouldn't be impacted /prior/ to a technological singularity, after which things become unpredictable by definition.\\
For instance if copying human mind design is much easier than creating AGI from scratch, then singletons are vastly less likely and AI alignment is a very different issue. However due to the sheer number of AI working on the issue by improving themselves and competing you're also going to have major concerns about Moloch which aren't an issue with singletons.
