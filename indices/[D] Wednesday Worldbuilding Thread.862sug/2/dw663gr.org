Let's say you were part of a scientific program involving using a portal to travel to and explore other universes, with different rules to our own. Putting aside the issue of how the portal itself works, or how different universes are able to mingle without something catastrophic happening (because you have to, for the premise to work), what kind of scientific fields would you draw on to examine the worlds you discovered?

I mean, would you bring a geologist? A botanist? A meteorologist? An astronomer? A chemist? What would your research team look like? What equipment would you use to scrutinise any samples you gathered?

I had an idea for a story like this, but I was struggling with the technical details.
