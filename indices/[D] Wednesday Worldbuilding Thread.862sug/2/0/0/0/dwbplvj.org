I'm not a physicist, but some ideas for him off the top of my head:

- Drop some rocks and feathers (or other objects with different weights and air resistance) to see if gravity and air resistance work the same there.

- Bring a prism to see if light refracts into the same visible spectrum.

- Equipment to test for the other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

- Some circuits and a battery, and magnets, to see if electromagnetism works the same.

- Metal detector to see if it reacts with any native material.

- A weak radioactive isotope to see if atomic decay continues as on Earth.

Some of the above might be best done in a slightly different order.

Personally, for a first visit, I would suggest a core science team of physicist, chemist, and Earth scientist, a biologist if you expect life as per the example you provided, and maybe a psychologist or anthropologist if any of the life appears intelligent. Have everyone in the initial away-party be able to function as a jack-of-all-trades (at least) in their field, and bring in more specialized experts as they become pertinent to the situation.

Have someone trained in first-aid. Maybe have a few people to provide security against hostile life (sarcastic and wisecracking field commander with a dark and troubled past optional), but who won't be overly trigger-happy at first contact with a legitimately surprised or frightened intelligence.
