Ok so Easy Allies' Kyle Bosman is making a series called [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DEnIuHTsRI&t=455s][Box Peek]], which has an anime-like story - the premise is similar to Yu-Gi-Oh or Pokemon where a silly-kid-thing is a pillar of the world. There's only one episode out and it's already got me wanting to write a ratfanfic because of some of the elements it's introduced. I don't plan to start writing until the first season is complete, but I figured this is a good place to start planning around the world that we've seen so far.

It's mainly a stream of consciousness, and I'm writing it down mostly for myself, but if you wanna read it I'd love to know your thoughts. And if you do plan on reading this, I recommend watching the episode first, since it's just like 8 minutes and there are spoilers ahead (not that there's much story yet, but some jokes might be ruined).

** Peek Refs
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: peek-refs
   :END:
Matches of Box Peek are referee'd by "floating robots" called Peek Refs, which I assume are there to enforce the rules, but what caught my attention is that there's a specific rule to not ask questions of the Peek Ref. Could just be about not wanting people to argue with them, but the first question asked of a ref was "do you like box peek" and the player was given a warning, which leaves a door open for something more to be going on. Them being whole cloth AGI's was obviously the first thought, and I'm still considering it, but I'm starting to think that maybe memory-wiped human uploads could be better, since the worry could be that questions could trigger elements of the original personality to re-surface.

Also, the idea that floating robots would actually be used /only/ for Box Peek as was asserted in this episode is absurd. Which is great as a meta joke, but perhaps their true function is as data collectors, using Box Peek as an excuse for them to be all over the place. Maybe they're incorporated into the police force, or maybe they're used by BoxCorp (placeholder name for the yet-unnamed entity administrating Box Peek) to spy on and control people.

** Box Porters
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: box-porters
   :END:
Pressing the button on this watch-looking device "summons your box instantly...from the basement fortress". It's asserted that this is not magic (so I assume it's technology). Again, these are used only for Box Peek, but here it's just stated that /Box Porters/ are only for Box Peek, not teleportation technology in general. However, the episode opens with a freighter coming into the port laden with cargo containers, so the tech isn't powerful enough to nullify the need to ship things. Perhaps it's limited by weight (the boxes look flimsy, though on the other hand the whole show is made with paper puppets, so everything looks flimsy), distance, or it's not actually teleportation but fabrication.

That being said, I'm more inclined to say that it's limited by weight and distance rather than it being a deception, because come on dude, "Basement Fortress" just sounds way too cool to not use. So maybe energy costs rise exponentially with the target item's weight and the distance between the starting and ending point, and people don't ship things a tiny piece at a time because there's an extended spool up time for each teleport.

Or maybe there's also a loss in fidelity as complexity rises, and boxes are simple shapes and the molecules are arranged in a simple repeating crystalline structure, which allows for the shipment of raw material easily enough, but completed parts have to be moved traditionally. Not sure about the science behind that, though it seems more interesting to me than the power requirement theory so I'm leaning towards it.

** Fairboat Island
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: fairboat-island
   :END:
Box Peek is illegal here, which seems like an unusual thing. I suspect that Fairboat Island and Letzgo Island (where the story is taking place) are at odds, maybe not at war, but there's got to be some hostility. Box Peek could be illegal because Fairboat Island discovered that the Peek Refs were spy bots, and so are trying to resist BoxCorp's influence. But then why not publicize this? The two islands are willing to engage in trade with one another, and there doesn't seem to be hostility between the citizenry, so any conflict has to be limited to political stuff. Maybe the islands are economically dependent on one another and so put up a front of cooperation as they attempt to subvert one another behind the scenes?

Or maybe all this is wrong. It was my first thoughts, but I'm not feeling super enthusiastic about it being yet another Orwelian dystopia. And since when have governments reacted fast enough to ban something /before/ it gets out? Apparently Fairboat Island doesn't have any knowledge of Peek Refs, Box Porters, or anything else like that, so communication channels have to be either heavily controlled or nonexistent (leaning towards the first because who invents the floating robot before the TV). And I think this is kinda where I have to wait until more episodes come out, because these questions could absolutely be answered in the show proper.

** Trying to figure out
   :PROPERTIES:

   :END:
An alternative reason for there to exist floating robots, but for the only use of flying robots to be box peek. Flying robots aren't as universal as teleportation, but there's still loads of uses for them that even the least creative person can come up with, and yet their purported task is refereeing a kids' game. Why are people cool with this? /Are/ people cool with this?

Maybe the whole point of the game and the robots are for like...babysitting. The whole game is really about letting kids go out and exercise independence and go on "adventures", while the Peek Refs are there to keep the kids safe. Like nanny bots. But for a society to devote that level of resources to childcare, and in such a roundabout way, I think the society would have to have an almost alien value system (people here might say that children are the future but nobody goes /that/ far). That could be interesting, and it gets us away from dystopic territory.

I think that's as far as I wanna get for now, without knowing more about the actual world (I wanna take a similar approach as in Pokemon Origin of Species, where the world is basically the same, but with extra details added and the changes mostly centered around realism).

Still, I've never gone and written a thing like this before, so I'd welcome any feedback or other ideas. Again, I'm mainly writing this to get my thoughts down and organized, but I'm posting it here instead of leaving it in OneNote because I'd love to know what other people think.
