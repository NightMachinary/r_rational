YMMV, but maan, this is hard to read for me. The setting is very interesting but the presentation is so confusing I had to give up around chapter 17. I guess the style of having a multitude of threads interspersed in chapters just isn't for me; I might come back once the story is finished and read it in chronological order for each character PoV.
