Shouldn't you be able to just look at 173 from in front of it? As long as you don't look at 096 face you don't have to even consider him, since they are back to back when you look at 173 you won't be looking at 096's face. Just keep looking at 173 and when you need to blink close one eye, open it then do the same with the other. If you have to position yourself first, focus on the the feet of the SCPs, do the same to move out of the room once you have an exit. What would actually be evil would be to put a picture of 096's face on 173 - which the foundation should have done when having 173 go to 682's containment room.
