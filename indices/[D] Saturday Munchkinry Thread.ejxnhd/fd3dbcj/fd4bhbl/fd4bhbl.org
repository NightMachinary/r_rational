Grow an extra tumor of brain tissue and play around with it to learn how brains work. Be careful about doing your own brain, you don't have backups. I've heard that evolutionarily, brain size is limited by how much head will fit through a birth canal - you can improve on this. I don't know how brains work, but the least an extra brain will give you is an extra you to think/study. I will assume that as in Worm, you have an extra cortex that interfaces with your power. Copying it might not copy access to the power, but growing and splitting it might. Grow a clone fetus, equip it with your brain, and you could acquire extra bodies.
