I like your idea about the organ donation stuff.

Along the lines of cloning, I was thinking more cloning via typical scientific means, where you swipe the nucleus of one of your cells with the nucleus of an egg cell and insert that egg cell into the womb. No magical interaction necessary. If this was done, when would I find the fetus no longer counted as a separate organism, and would I be able to see it's biology while it was in me?

Also, if I found that I could easily make self sustaining factories through meiosis and the manipulation of amino acids into proteins, the creation of a whole lot of chemicals and materials would be trivial. I would begin by making plastics such as Kevlar (Or, taking a page out of Worm, spider silk) that could be used well in a fight. This capability would also be useful as a means of profit generation.

Creating and injecting a virus which adds genes which cause catastrophic failure in potential enemies' biology when an otherwise harmless chemical is encountered would be near the top of my list of actions if my morality aims more towards the logical and efficient than the respecting life end of the spectrum.

The point of heroin wasn't to take an enemy out of the fight, it was to get them addicted and take them permanently out of action without actually killing them. Would this be in line with the character's morals?

For any possible minions I may acquire, synthetic drugs that are both addictive, nootropics, and stuff that only I can give them would save a lot of hassle with possible trust issues resulting from my emotional stuntedness. Maybe we could add some steroids into the mix as well for the goons and stuff, and fallback to the catastrophic failure virus if there's a cue. If morally acceptable, I could offload my schoolwork onto them, while I study more serious subjects.

A way to release chemicals that release dopamine in the brain (to all but me) would be useful during any negotiations, but may only be limited to a single instance if word gets out that this is a possible strategy.

Self sustaining factories making more factories could be useful, especially if I don't want to be pregnant every time I need a new factory. They could also be used for shrinking the size of my belly when being pregnant with a factory, as once the factory is born it could make a more complex factory that does what I want it to do, or it could simply morph into that factory it's self.

Building machines (through use of factories or birth) which could have electrical inputs and outputs could introduce all sorts of nifty long distance and more advanced processing potential. If I can find a way to hook up small computers and wireless transmitters to bug like creations, and I become sufficiently good at programing, the spying opportunities are endless. At minimum I may be able to hook something up to a factory to produce a pathogen (like the virus proposed earlier) in an enemy base. The more I write about this aspect, the less sure I am that it'd actually work, as it almost entirely depends on a skill set that I don't already have, and would be too swamped with work to gain.

If moving my hair is within the magical constraints, then I will definitely grow out my hair (does the resulting hair extension through the acceleration of hair growth count as a permanent change? If not, wearing a hat and re-purposing the rest of my hair into one long strand would be my go-to solution for this) so a strand of it would be able to theoretically explore an entire house, and on the fly repurposing of nerves onto that hair (how long would this take?), certainly not hooked up to any pain centers. This would be useful in situations where I'm in a new environment, or I need to find out what's inside someone's pockets. Making the nerves denser in more interesting areas for better tactical feel. The usefulness of this would depend on how much knowledge I have of where different parts of my hair are. Would this work?

some questions and clarifications:

- How intuitive is it for me to edit my genome?

- How much internal knowledge do I have? I presume I must have some baseline amount or else I wouldn't be able to edit anything.

- How intuitive is protein creation for me? Right now protein folding prediction is incredibly difficult, would I find this task easier, and if so, how much?

- Would my factories count as separate creatures or simply machines? What if I add a basic nervous system used only for carrying electrical signals from one part of the machine to the other?

- How complex could the machines I make reasonably get, factoring in the limits of the magic and my own ability?
