You're a 16-year-old girl growing up in the midwest near the Rockies. You are a perennial overachiever, 5.0 GPA, Student Council, etc. You are stoic and somewhat emotionally stunted, you are rather rational and look for the solution that will yield the most positive gains, even if it comes at your expense. You, along with four other acquaintances, have received a magical ability. You can now freely manipulate any biological structure your magic deems 'You.'

The limits are as follows, you must maintain a similar material to within a degree of reasonability (ie, white fat to brown fat is ok, white fat to muscle tissue or bone is not), if you want to add or edit a structure you have to have a detailed knowledge on how to do so (the power allows you to examine, but not modify, the structures of any creature you are in contact with, failing that having access to extremely detailed medical diagrams can work though would take much longer to implement with more trial and error), you must retain the same total mass (you can't just make extra bone, but you could alter your body so that it produces bone much more rapidly through natural means and then edit from there), the power does not save states or conceptions (if you change your face to resemble someone else you wouldn't just 'change back,' you'd have to manually reshape it to resemble yourself again), the power requires no 'mana' to function, just intense focus and time (time is based on familiarity with the change being made and the complexity of said change, moving extra muscle mass to an arm fo a strike or changing your femur into a spear would take a second or two, turning your follicles and skin cells into the the chromatophores, iridophores, leucophores and papillae of on octopus could take hours on the other hand).

The other members of the group are as follows-

A Mover/Shaker/Blaster/Striker who can summon and channel the aspects of a Storm

A Striker/Blaster/Breaker/Thinker (Brute/Mover/Stranger) who can see through, summon and merge with Shadows

A Trump that can absorb any magic that moves within 5 feet of him and use it for his own

A Thinker that can see multiple different Fates, allowing them to predict or alter the actions of those around them

You must optimise yourself to fight, and hopefully survive, alongside your friends in a secret war against hostile mages, while also trying to maintain your status as valedictorian; how do you do it?
