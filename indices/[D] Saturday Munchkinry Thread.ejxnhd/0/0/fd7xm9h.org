Here is my unpolished train of thought on the subject.

If you're really getting into nitty gritty realism biomancy, the simple answer is that, unless the observation skill gives very very good information, pretty much any major self-modification will throw up serious cascading problems and potentially kill the biomancer. The human body is not modular; any issue or change in the body causes cascading changes everywhere else. The magic would have to provide guidelines, safety measures, computational ability and self-observational ability for the biomancer to not immediately grow ill and die.

At a less nitty gritty level, the biomancer should stick loosely to existing human biological processes. Assisted clone births for duplication, building muscle, and reaching peak human performance, namely. Maybe prevent pain by killing off sensory neurons temporarily? Also possibly minor cosmetic surgeries like changing skin colour, hair properties.

That observation skill plus peak human performance calls for great field or cosmetic surgery potential on allies and precision combat against enemies. It also allows for diagnosing teammates of illness, identifying spies, works as a lie detector, gives a limited history of the observed as in autopsies or archeology, or might assist in teaching or brainwashing.

In crazier territory; can special organs be created to interface with/ surgically operate on others? Could the observational ability allow tailor made diseases/parasites to be made to infect/kill/take over another creature? Can hormones/ drugs be synthesised and used /sold? Assuming the smaller concerns are addressed, of course.

Can cooperation with the Thinker sidestep the lack of knowledge? If the thinker can find a safe way for the biomancer to massively grow computational ability, then any problem can theoretically be solved through the application of sufficient computing time and biomass.

No matter what, the biomancer should cultivate mass ASAP. Maybe the observation skill allows for more skillful eating?

Is the observational ability triggered on the countless micro-organisms within and without the biomancer? Does this drive the biomancer insane? If not, can the extraordinary multitasking ability be used as a calculator/ computer through a combination of the manipulation of the gut biome and the observation of the microfauna?

Totipotent cells pretty neatly sidestep the innability to change between cell types. Totipotent cell production rate could actually be a serious bottleneck.

Consider creating that egg clone, shapeshifting into a shortlived combat form, then changing back to the observed form of that clone before inevitable death.
