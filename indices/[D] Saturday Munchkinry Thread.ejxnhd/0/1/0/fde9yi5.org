So I'm just going to go point by point here because you've given me a lot to go over (in a good way)!

The buddy system works well here.

The magic is very strict on what is you; it must be a contiguous part of your body, must be grown inside you, from scratch, using your cells, can no be attached to another souled creature (i.e., an infant). This effectively means you can see, but not interact with, the various microbes in your body. Hair and fingernails are fine, and blood ceases to be you the moment it exits the body.

Altering amino acids is within the bounds of the power, but cloning is a no go, as it would be considered a different souled entity; your power is magical, not genetic and just because a creature shares your DNA doesn't mean their soul is the same as well (think identical twins here).

Second action is somewhat unfeasible for multiple reasons, most of which you touch on; the malaria virus isn't something a typical American high schooler can reasonably get their hands on, going to a different country would also be difficult as a minor who must attend school and has parents, viruses do not count as creatures, clones don't work making the testing difficult, and all this is predicated on the concept that the effort spent curing malaria is more beneficial than fighting in a crucially important conflict, so I agree that it's out.

Gene editing would be tricky, but the power has some intuition to it (to within one degree of reason) so as long as you have a clear goal and good knowledge as to what you want to do and how it can affect most of the change for you, eliminating a good chunk of the trial and error.

This method wouldn't properly work, as ingesting something doesn't cause the power to identify it as you, you can still affect the same changes, albeit manually.

The character would have a rather anti-illegal drugs view, but most of the same could be achieved by her selling excess organs. As for the whole heroin thing, several natural paralytics, like Fugu fish or Wasp venom, should also work. Failing that, she would view killing as the most logical and efficient, if least palatable, course of action.

The Fate teller's power allows her to see the most likely series of events, provided no outside magical force acts upon it, of anything she can physically see. Stock market predictions aren't particularly great here.

The Storm summoner can only channel electricity through his limbs, and he is afforded minimal protection from its effects. It is excruciating and can cause long term nerve damage if no preventative measures are in place.

Sorry I said no a ton. The power is rather specific, partly to avoid a lot of the loopholes here and partly because of its origin. I'd be interested to see any updated hypothesis you come up with though!
