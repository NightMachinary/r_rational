I wouldn't dare try to mess with anything at first for fear of messing some bodily function up, and I'd never dare work on my brain. so step zero would be touching a whole lot of people, and always having one of my team members at hand (preferably the Thinker who could likely check my work) who I can easily touch to jog my memory on a particular process.

First action: push the boundaries of what constitutes "me" by seeing what layers of skin can be manipulated, how far through the digestive system an object must be, how much control I have over my hair and finger nails, how much I am able to manipulate the bacteria on and inside of my body, what I can do with any blood that may come out through open wounds.

For any permanent changes to my body I may want to make, I'll research the amino-acid specifications of CRISPR, and have that go to town on gene editing. To combat any mistakes, it may be worth it to invest in limited cloning of myself (just to fetus form, without any brain function, or even with brain function if the first doesn't count as a creature) so I can check to make sure my genome is sound by bringing a cell to the surface of my skin, using it's nucleus for a clone, and checking that creature's genome with the original fetus. Thankfully, being a girl, I would come pre-equiped with the proper machinery to make such clones permanent.

Second action: get my hands on the malaria virus and creating a counter virus/bacteria/other with my own biosphere if it seems easy enough, gene editing myself so I constantly produce that, and go on a tour of Africa and Southeast Asia.

Potential problems so far: viruses may not count as creatures, it'll take a lot of mental energy on my part to make significant changes to myself through gene editing, how do I keep the clones alive? How do I get on a tour of Africa and Southeast Asia? How do I get my hands on malaria?

If viruses don't count as creatures, I'll see if mosquitos/bugs can give info on virus, and if they don't count as creatures I'll see if people do, although with limited access to Africa and Southeast Asia I may have to drop the project all together at this point.

If gene editing turns out to be harder than a few online courses and textbooks (likely freely downloaded from Archive.org or Library Genesis) can handle, then simply copying already identified Phenotypes from stuff will have to do, with some basic molecular machinery mixed in as well.

Keeping clones alive? This is a tough problem, but I think can be most simply solved by stealing some liquid nitrogen from the school, and keeping them cryogenically frozen in an ice chest or other container, getting the Thinker to help me figure out a safe place to hide them, and potentially the Striker/Blaster/Breaker/Thinker (Brute/Mover/Stranger) to shroud the place in shadow. I presume it would be very devastating to my valedictorian status if these half-formed frozen babies were discovered.

How do I get on a tour of Africa and Southeast Asia? How do I get my hands on malaria? Meh, the more I think about this problem, the more problems I find, may need to scrap this plan or make the virus universally contractible and hope it eventually reaches the problem areas.

To limit the time spent on body modification, structures can be created using CRISPR which can be triggered by a single protein or chemical, not commonly found in the body, which I can eat or have injected in me to constitute as me so I can move those chemicals or proteins into activation sites on the structure to trigger a process. This can be used for things like coating my skin in poison dart frog poison, releasing chemicals from my skin (airborne or liquid), and other semi-minor typically global things I may want done quickly.

For pocket money I would make and sell drugs on the black market. Would likely want the shadow person to do the actual selling, as they could both hide their identity, intimidate competing gangs, and avoid being followed. If we launder the money (maybe through fake scholarships and such) this could be a way to get to Africa and Southeast Asia and cure malaria, as well as be a source of tremendous money for other projects. These same drugs could also be repurposed for fighting. using my bone as a needle and lots of heroin in my system (made sure not to interact with anything important, or maybe surrounded by proteins that are broken down by other proteins as it goes through the "needle) to take out my enemies for good without killing them (or killing them if needed). In fact, I could cover my entire body in similar simple spikes which use the same process as bee stings to inject the heroin in anyone were to touch me.

If blood is still counted as me outside my body, I could use it to control machines, wreak even more havoc if I get it in other people (or do even more good). Combined with the creature touch, I could probably worm my way into taking control of their body to an even greater extent than my own.

We could violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics by making HCl and NaOH and mixing the two, creating lots of heat.

As far as school goes, I could always make myself look amazing, take as many bio and chem classes as possible, as well as ecology, and math (since this will be useful if gene editing and protein result prediction becomes harder than originally thought)

I could likely work out a way to get cancer cells into my enemies (gene edited through CRISPR).

In 2 years I could create and sell more useful drugs, setting up the steps necessary to grow the necessary facilities in my womb, and use the proceeds for the war effort. To both launder illegal money up to this point and make even more money I would use the fate teller to predict the stock market and run angel investing.

We could make a power plant run by the electricity from the storm summoner.

looking pregnant while pregnant with clones and drug factories would be a problem for my valedictorian status, however the first time I could get an "abortion," and subsequent clonings I could likely buy a pig from drug money, and impregnate that.

IDK just a few starting points, not many explicit ideas in here, just general principles. I'd be very appreciative if you could tell me how the experiments would turn out, and anything I missed or misunderstood.
