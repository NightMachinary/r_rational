OK, so, this chapter notes!

We wanted the story to focus on conflict within an established relationship, so we knew we needed a time skip in there somewhere. But so much happens in relationships that you can't really just go "FOUR MONTHS PASSED, THEY ARE NOW REALLY CLOSE" - so we've got a first fight, small generic romance scenes, some frustration, some sacrifices, and we finish it off with a literal pet the dog moment.

Some hints at vampire lore: William's hungry and talks about his lungs straining. Our Vampires eat through their lungs - turns out the lungs are a much more direct route to the heart than the stomach is, so it only makes sense. Plus, the digestive system is used for making new vampires.

Don't worry - the vampire meeting was important, and there will be consequences!

Oh and, [[/u/Atilme]] : not sure if you still are following the story, but I remember telling you to wait for "peak adorable", and I'm sorry it appeared so much later than promised but I hope if you are still around here, you enjoy it.
