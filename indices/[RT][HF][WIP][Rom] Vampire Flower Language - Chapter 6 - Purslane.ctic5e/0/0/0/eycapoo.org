  If you hadn't username'd me I probably wouldn't have seen this, so thanks!
#+end_quote

No problem! I was worried it'd seem a bit obnoxious/attention-seeking but I suppose one solitary little username mention isn't very intrusive....

#+begin_quote
  Thanks for continuing with it though, it's awesome to read!
#+end_quote

Of course, it's a pleasure to try to put something a little bit different into the world!

#+begin_quote
  Dang this is so good! I definitely do enjoy it, thanks for writing and posting it!
#+end_quote

Aww you're making me blush! Thrilled you enjoy it. If you want, I can try and remember to username ping you at each chapter / interlude if you don't have a way to keep up

(I actually made an rss feed for my associated beeminder goal that I'd happily dig up for you if you want - maybe I should put it in the end notes of the story for others...)
