If you hadn't username'd me I probably wouldn't have seen this, so thanks! Now I have to check on all the other fics I haven't been keeping up with... XD

Will edit once I've read it! Thanks for continuing with it though, it's awesome to read!

(Feel free to username me in the future as well, it was very nice to come back to this!)

/squeees intensify/

It was nice to come back to this and have all of it to catch up on! Dang this is so good! I definitely do enjoy it, thanks for writing and posting it!
