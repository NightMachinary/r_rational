Oh, so it's basically warding as represented in Worth The Candle. There's plenty of great ones:

- Ward against blood or bone entering the circle, for massive internal hemorrhage. Depending on the specifics of the environment, pretty much any element you want to omit will damage humans passing through. Just disallowing the entry of Iron (Fe) will probably kill someone with red blood pretty quickly (as their inertia rips the iron in their blood out of their cells) and defend against most blades or projectiles.
- For non-aggressive purposes, you could get resource refining that's perfectly efficient by ejecting the contaminants from the circle while leaving the metal you want. It'd be rough to do this with solids that don't flow, but you could easily sort liquids and gasses by using a series of circles to allow or disallow specific things. The industrial uses would be endless, unless the total power required exceeds what a person can do.
