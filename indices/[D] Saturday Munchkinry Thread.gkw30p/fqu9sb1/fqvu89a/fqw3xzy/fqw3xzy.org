Compared to Worth The Candle's wards, circles in Pale seem to be less absolute, and the options are block/emit/insulate instead of block/annihilate. And the normal list of things to apply a circle to are the classical elements plus connections (maybe?), while the normal list in WTC is stuff that has latent magic (notably blood, bone, skin).

They're obviously drawing from the same inspirations, but I think the "emit" option is really interesting compared to what's normally included in these systems. The first novel combination I thought of was using both emit and block symbols to create a vacuum - literally in the case of air, metaphorically for other things.
