Wildbow's new serial [[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Pale]] just went into some concrete mechanics of magical circles. The details are contained in [[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/2020/05/16/lost-for-words-1-3/][chapter 1.3]] if you want it straight from the boar's mouth and just want to skip to it. Mild spoilers for Pale follow.

- Magical circles apply to a specific substance or concept. We only know the symbols for circles about the four classic elements, but they can be much more abstract.

- The circle either blocks the subject from entering, emits it from the circle, or blocks it from leaving the circle.

- We've seen circles blocking wind, preventing a campfire's heat from leaving a camp site, and blocking a person's personal connection to their home.

- (Good to know but less munchkin-friendly) Circles are technically just instructions to spirits, with their effects mediated through the practitioner's intent, working relationship with the spirits, and history of having performed this kind of effect before.

- Our protagonists have been encouraged to stick to magic circles about air for now.

Anyone see any interesting applications so far? It seems like you should pretty easily be able to make a wind engine with what we already know. One of the protagonists has done some inventive work with air circles trying to keep her witch hat on, which was much more convoluted than how I would've done it.
