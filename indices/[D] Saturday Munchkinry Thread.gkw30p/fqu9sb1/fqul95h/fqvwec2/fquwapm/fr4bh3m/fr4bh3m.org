Presumably food. Provided it's eaten promptly and it's a simple foodstuff, a significant portion of it should be at least partially digested before the one-hour mark is up. I don't know if this would cause the original constituent atoms to all disappear, though. If so, it might leave whatever atoms it's bonded to in the meantime behind. I imagine this might have some weird effects, so a sufficiently clever chemist could perhaps abuse that?

Also, I don't play tabletop, but a "cantrip" is a trivially simple spell, yes? Does a cantrip have a limit on how many times you can cast it?
