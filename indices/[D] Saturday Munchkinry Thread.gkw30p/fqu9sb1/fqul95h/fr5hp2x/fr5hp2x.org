Something that came to me while reading WtC: Joon is falling from a great height and doesn't have any flight-bestowing or teleportation entads on him. He does, however, have Sable, with a basically infinite supply of all the useless crap Fenn ever stole just because it wasn't nailed down. Sadly, she has never stolen anything as practical as a parachute. He also has a full supply of blood and plenty of bones to play with to increase his speed and strength.

Could he, at any distance from the ground, slow his descent to a survivable speed by pulling arbitrary heavy objects out and throwing them at the ground as hard and fast as he can? How fast would he have to eject matter? Assume he is over some hellish exclusion zone and does not care about smashing it up. Also the dragons are all busy because one of them said "Shia Labeouf."
