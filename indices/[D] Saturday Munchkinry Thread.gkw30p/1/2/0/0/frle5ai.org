So, assuming it takes half an hour or so to cast this cantrip (I've no idea), a trivially skilled mage can manufacture ~25000 X 16 = 400K calories of butter over the course of an eight hour shift. Going by the calorie density of the butter in my fridge and half-ass-guessing how much of that would occupy a cubic foot. I'm probably off because I'm lazy, but we'll call it "Fermi estimation," that's how Randall Munroe gets away with it.

Anyway. That's pretty impressive, or not depending on what happens to half-digested food after an hour. Best-case scenario you just have to have people eat quickly to claim it and be free of dependency on land for good, with the ratio of mages to other people depending on how much efficiency you're willing to give up to have a diet that isn't mostly butter. Worst-case a lot of people die and we never speak of it again. Somewhere in between you've got guilt-free ice cream for people on a diet.
