Another book that does this as well is Empire of the Ants by Bernard Werber (but it's with quotes of an encyclopedia). Dune's extract are on the shorter side (I've just checked again). I remember seeing it done with longer extracts (around half a page per chapter) but can't remember which novel it was. I just remember that it was something I enjoyed.
