Also, the backstory that you previously posted feels kind of weak and strained compared to the rest of the book, which is really strong with all the plot tokens consequentially related to the rest of the world. And it's also unnecessarily cataclysmic: there's no consequential reason for an excession event in the solar system.

Maybe limit it to the rise of Albert and the events immediately preceding it, just enough to set the stage?

As for the "typical readers", maybe you could consider the benefits of targeting average Greg Egan readers?
