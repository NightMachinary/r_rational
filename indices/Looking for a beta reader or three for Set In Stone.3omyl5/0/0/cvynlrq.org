That's valid, but I also need to consider that I'll be selling this as a science fiction book, and the lead is a swineherd in a rural low-tech setting. I feel a little uncomfortable with that as an author. It's not genre-switching but the genre might be difficult for a reader to validate in the beginning.

I'm trying to consider that people here are a little more perceptive in their reading than average. [[/r/rational]] folks are great, but you aren't typical readers (that's a good thing.)
