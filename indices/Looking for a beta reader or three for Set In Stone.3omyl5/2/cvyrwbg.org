Maybe one thing that could work would be to write it as an history textbook and have extracts from that book at the beginning of each chapter... This would get people to slowly discover the story of the world as they go through the story?

It would solve your problem regarding selling it as science fiction and it wouldn't be such a big infodump. And letting people read the backstory piece by piece might be better. It would allow readers to try and guess who Albert instead of being spoonfed.

I've always liked books that do this (Dune is a good example), it creates a richer world without ever becoming too much of an infodump.
