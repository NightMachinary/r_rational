Yeah, the increasing +insanity+ complexity of the greater DC universe is the primary reason that I didn't go with those cliffhangers. Batman, Brainiac, and Zod probably make for the most believable antagonists for a continuation, because they require the least bending.

/Metropolitan Man/ is set in 1934 though, and I kept thinking that if I ever wrote a sequel it would have to be about WWII in some way - a time period that I think is surprisingly untouched by comic books, probably because they don't want all the messy reality that would come from a superhero dealing with international politics. Captain America does this facile version of it, and X-men has it as a backstory, and there are certainly post-war Nazis aplenty, but what I really want to see is the harsh reality of children peering out of their bombed out homes. Which means that if I were ever to write a sequel, I don't think I would be able to resist making my own version.

(It's somewhat curious to me that we've set so many videogames and movies during WWII but haven't really done that much with it when it comes to superheroes. I understand the impulse to preserve history though.)

If you want a justification for the Green Lantern showing up, Earth /was/ just visited by an enormously powerful alien. I sort of imagine them as a large agency that's stretched /way/ too thin. But you're right, it doesn't dovetail as nicely with the story as-is.
