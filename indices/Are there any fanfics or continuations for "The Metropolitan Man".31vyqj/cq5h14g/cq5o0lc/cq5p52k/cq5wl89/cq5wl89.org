I'm probably overlooking something, but is it possible for the Green Lantern problem to be solved by changing their mission somewhat? Rather than policing individual worlds, the Green Lanterns police interactions /between/ worlds.

Or they police activity that has to do with interplanetary interactions (so a criminal organization with no direct ties to the Examplanarians, but using Examplanarian technology gotten from someone else, would be a concern of theirs).

Or, in what will probably change them the least, they have a Prime Directive equivalent which discourages them from interacting with a species until another civilization (Krypton) has contacted them.
