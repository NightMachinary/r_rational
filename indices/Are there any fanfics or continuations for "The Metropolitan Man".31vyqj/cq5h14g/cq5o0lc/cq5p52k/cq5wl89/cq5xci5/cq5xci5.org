I kind of assumed that with any rational Green Lantern Corps having a Prime Directive that means they only police interactions between planets was a given. At least that's the only explanation I've ever thought of for why they wouldn't have shown up on earth anytime before. Maybe there's an exception that GL agents can use their rings for the benefit of their own people as long as it isn't at the expense of someone else. That would explain why they suddenly show up now, with this being the first time a human Lantern had been chosen. Although Supes showing up could also be an adequate excuse. Actually, maybe there could be a plot point that the Corps wants earth to turn over Superman, who of course is dead and buried as very few people know.
