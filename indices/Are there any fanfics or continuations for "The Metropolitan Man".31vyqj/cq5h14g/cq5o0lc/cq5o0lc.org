Nice! From the man himself, no less. Perhaps Lex's efforts to colonize space could work as a sort of revisionist history leading into the moon landing? Realistically I suppose you would need to add obstacles to prevent it from coming a lot sooner though. Maybe that's not such a good idea.

You know, a GL related continuation did occur to me but I thought it would be way too difficult to rationalize. Not only do you need to explain a galactic-scale civilization with the means to generate any physical object imaginable out of energy, but also why said interplanetary police force has never shown up on earth in the past. The Amazon ending brings up similar issues. In general the more complicated a universe becomes the harder it's going to be to rationalize why it looked mundane to begin with.
