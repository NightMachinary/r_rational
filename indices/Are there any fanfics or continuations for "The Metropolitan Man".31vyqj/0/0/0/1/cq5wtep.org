I just had an idea that's probably a little too crazy. What if Thomas and Martha Wayne died during the bombings that Lex organized to test Superman? Years later, a twenty-something Bruce sets out as the world's greatest detective on his own heroic crusade, perhaps with a ring of willpower, or not. Meanwhile, WW2 is in full swing, but the US is not yet involved. Then Pearl Harbor happens, and Brainiac volunteers to help Lex build a bomb that could end the war. What Lex doesn't know is that Brainiac helped cause Pearl Harbor with the help of the Amazons and Mercy Graves, who have some ulterior motive I haven't figured out yet...

That's all I've got for now. And it obviously needs a lot of work. Probably at least a few entire subplots need to hit the cutting room floor. The timeline needs work and the plotlines that stick around need to be better integrated. And everything needs at least a few rationality checks and rewrites. But whatever. Just thought I'd get the idea down while it was fresh in my head.
