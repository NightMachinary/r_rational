I feel like I'm even more worried about Hector's mental health than his mom. Telling her he doesn't want to bring "Hector" to Doc Stevens' attention? Reminds me of an episode of Batman Beyond when Bruce Wayne knows it's not his own voice he's hearing in his head because the voice was calling him "Bruce".

And, yeah... maybe the CIA shouldn't have kidnapped a little girl in order to poke at the omniscient super hero just to see how far he could stretch.
