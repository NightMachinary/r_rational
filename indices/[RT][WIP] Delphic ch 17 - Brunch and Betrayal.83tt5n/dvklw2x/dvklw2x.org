I'm going to guess here that Hector was initially being monitored because the government actually has some currently secret way of detecting supers that they don't want to go public with yet, so they knew he was unregistered but weren't willing to arrest him (since he didn't appear to be doing anything).

Though going by the lengths he goes to in order to make his computer use undetected, I'm very interested in how they linked Hector to Delphic. My current guess is: they have an actual technology super, capable of bypassing any and all cyber security they have access to.

They used this to figure out the Hector is connected to Delphic, but don't think he is Delphic because, as far as there tech super can tell, he isn't using his computer to get passwords and stuff, he just appears to magically know them. Since they don't know about View, they probably just think Hector is a guy Delphic has help him with the physical side of things, or a close friend he allows 'in on the action' because it's good company.
