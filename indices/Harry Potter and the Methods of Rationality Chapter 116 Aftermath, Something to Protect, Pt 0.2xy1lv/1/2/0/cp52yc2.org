I suppose it wouldn't be beyond Voldemort to have a minion polyjuiced as Harry Potter on hand as leverage in case Dumbledore managed to interfere. He can probably at least get reasonable doubt with that given that he was sitting under a widely discussed banner at the Quidditch match with everyone else the whole time. As long Dumbledore takes more than a Time Turner resetting day to get out of the mirror any evidence to the contrary might be gone.
