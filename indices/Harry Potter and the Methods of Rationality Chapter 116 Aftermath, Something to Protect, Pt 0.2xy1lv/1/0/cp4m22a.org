True, but in this case he doesn't have much of a choice.

He just discovered that he is Voldemort's eigenself. Then he took the Stone, which it turns out combined with the True Patronus Charm is a resurrection device. Then he killed many Death Eaters, many of whom were very politically connected, and erased and transmuted Voldemort to bypass his defences.

In addition, he lost his greatest and most powerful political ally in the process. Possibly both of them if Malfoy finds out Harry killed his father.

That is not information that is conducive to him living a long and/or happy life in any way shape or form if it gets out to the generally irrational and still-much-more-powerful than him rest of the world.
