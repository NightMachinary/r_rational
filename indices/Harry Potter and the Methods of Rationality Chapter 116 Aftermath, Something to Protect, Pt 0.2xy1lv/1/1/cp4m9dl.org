In this universe, he can reasonably decide to tell someone only after they become a perfect Occlumens. He can even tell them beforehand, "Hermoine, there are some things I haven't told you, and I can only tell them to you after you become a perfect Occlumens."

I'm not saying it won't damage trust and all that other stuff, but in this world/society, if someone tells you that kind of secret AFTER you become a perfect Occlumens then it seems like it would be easier to forgive them lying to you until that point, especially if you warned them that there were secrets you'd been keeping from them.
