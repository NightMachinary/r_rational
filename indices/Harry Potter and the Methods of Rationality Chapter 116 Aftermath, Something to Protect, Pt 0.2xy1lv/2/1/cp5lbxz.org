Does not really matter. What would happen if someone would say "I don't believe you!"?

"I don't believe you! I think YOU killed Voldemort and 30 death eaters at the same time and probably also made Hermione immortal and resurrected her and are pretty much most powerful wizard in centuries and... Yeaa I believe you, don't kill me please."

Anyone who will not believe him, would be damn smart to pretend to lose.
