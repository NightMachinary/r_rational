Well the eye of vance is never described as being specialised to see things without being detected and I highly doubt that voldemort wouldn't have some spell that let him know (even if he can't obscure himself) if he was being observed by a very specific magical artefact wielded by one of the most dangerous men in Britain who would actively hunt him.

The alternative is that Moody just needs to be able to be within zoom range (from any direction since he can see through solid objects) of whatever he wants to know If this i the case he must go on frequent strolls through the ministry and just casually finding out every state secret and basically anything else he wants to know....which is silly.
