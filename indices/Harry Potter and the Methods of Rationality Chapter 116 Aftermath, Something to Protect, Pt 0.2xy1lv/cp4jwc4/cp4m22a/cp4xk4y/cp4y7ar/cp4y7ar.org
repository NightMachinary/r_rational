It's a term from some science fiction stories, most notably to me /Accellerando/ by Charles Stross.

An eigenself is another person who, at one point, was either a copy of your mind-state or branched off for the same original mind as you did. In some stories it also covers people who are from different Everett branches (alternate reality selves) but I use it here in the first definition.

Eigenselves will retain the memories of their progenitor, and likely most of their morals, but will have different life experiences and so can still change significantly.
