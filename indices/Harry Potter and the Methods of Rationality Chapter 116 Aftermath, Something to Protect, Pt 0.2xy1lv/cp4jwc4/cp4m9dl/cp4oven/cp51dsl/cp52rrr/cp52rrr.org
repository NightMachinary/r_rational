There was a lot made of how all wizards seem to know, even if only Quirrell seemed to always remember, that if a wizard firmly tells you you can't know something magical (e.g. how come your patronus killed that dementor) you don't push.

It'd be interesting to see how that balances out with grave yard full of headless corpses, a resurrected student and a forgetful Voldemort.
