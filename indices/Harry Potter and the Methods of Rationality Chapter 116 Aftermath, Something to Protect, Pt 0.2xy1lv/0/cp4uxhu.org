I am pretty convinced this is intentionally over the top. The truth is too convoluted, and too dangerous for public consumption- I think Harry knows perfectly well that the inner circle is going to question him, and he will have to explain things, but I think he is creating the public facing myth- he knows that this event is going down in history no matter what, and he has already seen how the stories get out of control, he is simply laying the foundation for the best public outcome.
