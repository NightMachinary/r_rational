If it is asked for free and given for free I don't see the problem. The world-building and munchkinry threads both already allow people to do exactly this if worded smartly. Also, just getting help with the setting/premise doesn't make a book on its own. They still have to write a book that is actually good enough to make them money. And if they were planning on posting it online for free and live off of donations then there is even less of a problem. In fact if a story ends up being written based on stuff the community thought of and finds cool then that's a good thing.
