Yeah, but what if I'm doing 6 polls about how people feel about bow-wielding protagonists vs sword wielding protagonists. Or asking, "how would you construct your defensive settlement given earth magic and 2 weeks to prepare for a goblin horde. Give me 20 bullet points in a step by step process please."

It quickly becomes overwhelming. In the early days of the LitRPG subreddit there were dozens of people doing that every day, and most of them clearly had never read a LitRPG book before, they were just looking to get people to tell them what would sell so they could cash in on the trend.

As a result, you end up with a large quantity of low-quality discussion that's poor for the overall health of the subreddit.
