I don't want to be mean, but the OP for this post did start quite a few threads one after another, most of which have been deleted one after another, so it kinda was spam.

But to answer your question about market research being bad -- it almost always is a fairly simple question that requires extensive answers. It ends up as the poster trying to get the community to do their work for them. OP's original post before it was deleted was essentially asking readers to structure the race selection scene in their story.

That's the writer's job, not something to be crowdsourced on the forums.
