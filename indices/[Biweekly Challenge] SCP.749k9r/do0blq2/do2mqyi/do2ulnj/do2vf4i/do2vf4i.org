I think the low wordcount version worked, but the pacing isn't too good.

Like, the whole point of the story is how the Tyrant deals with the Protagonist and the Cabal, but both are kind of rushed and awkwardly written. The story would probably have been my favorite if the payoff had been as good as the setup.
