I agree. This is part of what I meant when I said "a bit of a mess"; the challenge had already been posted when I found the time/inspiration to work on this, and as a result, I /did/ rush it.

The other part of "a bit of a mess" is the actual concept of the story, which is basically a kitchen sink of every concept that's currently en mode in this sub: hard fantasy with evil protagonists (Practical Guide), Isekai (Worth the Candle), general munchkinry, meta-aware jokes and references, as well as a bunch of other guilty pleasures of mine.

After winning with /Hronar the Barbarian/, an over-the-top rationalfic of the most non-rational of fantasy archetypes, I kind of wanted to see what would happen if I really overdid it with the tongue-in-cheek memey approach. We'll see how well this works out...
