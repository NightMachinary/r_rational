So your body becomes a p-zombie but still matches up with everything you will it to do. I know there was a philosopher that believed that normally happens, but I can't remember who it was.

The boy is spreading this, and Dr. Gears (I assume) doesn't know anything is odd when he's talking to him, so I get the impression that only the p-zombies can see the p-zombies, or if it's just an illusion only the people under it can see who is infected. If so, they can't just put the infected under quarantine. Though I suppose they might be able to give them pictures or something.
