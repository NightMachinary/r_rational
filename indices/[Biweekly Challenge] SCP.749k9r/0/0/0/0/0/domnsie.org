Silly mental image: "Oh no. My body is now a P-Zombie, and it's taking advantage of its status to say /really creepy things/ to scare me, which is /exactly what I would want to do!/ (to lighten the situation by scaring my disconnected consciousness if I were in the position of being reduced to a consciousless body.)"

Remembering nostalgically a Greg Egan(?) story involving a divergent personality-copy being unsympathetic to the presumably-horrified original.
