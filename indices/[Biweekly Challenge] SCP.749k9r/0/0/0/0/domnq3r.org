Coincidentally relevant to the username of the grandparent commenter, my impression was likewise that the boy was a carrier (like Typhoid Mary)--notably, he didn't make any mention of suggestion about his reaction to his own face, even though that [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror][Tomato in the Mirror]] moment would have been the most horrifying aspect. He might be the greatest hope for a vaccination, or for (potentially P-Zombie) bodies to work out how to reconnect the disconnected aspects. A more existentially disturbing concept is for all of (surviving) humanity to end up as carriers, anything observing them turned into a P-Zombie, though hopefully some observers could take similar measures.

(There are the normal issues of how pupils could tighten with shock as a reflex reaction without there being any meaningful emotional circuitry leading to it, or--if the meaningful emotional circuitry was still there--how the connection or disconnection of the conscious aspect could be perceived through means of sight; alternatively, it could of course be that it /is/ wholly memetic, and the narrator is only convinced that the body is acting in parallel with what he wants it to do. How would you know? Why /wouldn't/ the body whisper the second mantra, or at the least create-it-without-speaking (mind's ear), because that was exactly what the disconnected aspect would do..? Hmm.) (It was only with the mirror that any disconnection was noticed, so maybe the boy too doesn't feel disconnected, only would become convinced that the seen--himself--was disconnected upon seeing... alternatively, if real, then seeing a disconnected makes you a carrier, and being seen by a carrier makes you a disconnected..? But does being seen by a disconnected make you a disconnected or not?

--Going round in circles. Returning to the parent comment, other than 'Why did the boy go straight to second-stage?' there would be the question 'Why did the narrator go straight to second-stage?' (when the friends didn't). Hm. Other classmates looked normal, as did the narrator at first. P-Zombie in apartment was seen immediately as P-Zombie, no delay as with narrator and boy. Possibility that other boys saw apartment P-Zombie, but didn't perceive as abnormal? Qualitative change, since not all others seen equally. Even after boy saw narrator as P-Zombie, narrator didn't see boy as P-Zombie, though could be delayed. Since qualitative change, not seeing-others-as--consider if voice-based transfer from 'carrier' (as in Slouching Towards Bedlam, maybe Northern Caves), data band not reflected in the meanings of the words themselves. Sight-based transfer from P-Zombie? Degree of voice-based transfer affects not only time-to-symptoms, but severity of symptoms? Perhaps Stage 1 doesn't permit sight-based transfer or voice-based transfer or self-recognition. Stage 2 permits voice-based transfer and maybe self-recognition, if boy is too terrified to even think of looking in mirror. Stage 3 permits sight-based transfer, presumably voice-based transfer, presumably self-recognition.)

Sight of Stage 3 results in Stage 2. Perhaps severity of symptoms and incubation period are determined once, and after that unchangable? Can sufficient talking with Stage 2 before symptoms show innoculate you enough to bump you all the way up to Stage 3 (guaranteed self-recognition, sight-based Stage 2s), or only to Stage 2 (then self-recognition, voice-based transfer)? Since Stage unchangeable once set, worst-case-scenario of sight-based spread of Stage 3s doesn't happen, nor does self-upgrading from Stage 2 to Stage 3 happen.

If real, then perhaps only Stage 3s are self-recognising, whereas Stage 2s recognise others and spread, Stage 1s don't recognise and might not spread. All true P-Zombies? Stage 1s spreading slowly by voice to make more Stage 1s might be as or more terrifying than Stage 3s spreading fast to make more Stage 3s. The classic P-Zombie plague situation. There, overinnoculation giving Stage 2s or Stage 3s can serve as warning bells that there's a Stage 1 spread, cooperative/deceived Stage 2/3s used with care to identify and eliminate Stage 1s, or rather eliminating vast areas and then screening for Stage 1s.

If delusion only, there still needs to be a recognition component of the infected, but... hmm. Most aspects could be the same, except 'recognition' being 'recognition of infection through false perception of disconnection' instead of 'recognition of infection through perception of true disconnection'. True disconnection at higher stages only is also possible, but less clean to have both delusion and reality of the same thing in play, both reflecting infection.

Summary: Apartment spread by sight (Stage 3->2), friends spread by (X) (Stage 2->1), narrator spread by (X) (Stage 2->2/3). Friends and narrator should be all spread to by (X), and the main noted distinction is the amount of exposure to talking by the Stage 2 (who isn't capable of the sight-based transfer exhibited by Stage 3; Stage 1s not capable of any recognition; Stage 0s not recognised by anyone).

...It would be amusing if Stage 3s perceive Stage 0s as P-Zombies too, in which case for the 'real' case it would indicate that all of humanity were P-Zombies all along, and the stages only influence how perceivable this is (1, 2, 3) and how perceptive the infected can be of it (2, 3). By that point, there's effectively no difference/distinction from the 'delusion' scenario, with (Stage 0s) everything adding up to normality. Again, with the 'real' scenario, there's the underlying complication of why the P-Zombies are saying 'I think therefore I am' in the absence of a true prompt for saying so... going round in circles again. Perception of something missing that was never had, no difference from delusion of something missing that was always had, distinct from true loss of something which used to be had... quite possibly this is too long for anyone to read in practice. Hm.
