You assume too much of me, such as a passing familiarity with the SCP mythos. I've never read a single SCP report in its entirety ^{I'm} ^{an} ^{imposter} ^{^{I'm}} ^{^{sorry}}

  only the p-zombies can see the p-zombies

In fact, there are two separate stages of the disease; a first stage which causes you to be seen as a p-zombie by second-stage infected, and a second stage in which you begin to see first- and second-stage infected as p-zombies. This is why the other boys at school registered as p-zombies to our subject, but didn't freak out at all. The question that remains is why the boy progressed to the second stage at once. I confess I'd have to make something up to explain that :)
