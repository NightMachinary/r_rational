It's not an issue on my desktop computer, but I've been able to replicate it on my phone. And apparently, it's also been an issue with my entries to previous challenges. There doesn't seem to be any setting I can change; as a band-aid fix, I've made a [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/rikb81aio0jzao6/Uncanny%20Abyss%20%28Final%29.pdf?dl=0][pdf version]] which you'll at least be able to read on your phone after downloading, though a pdf is of course not optimal.

Thank you for pointing this out. If you have a preferred hosting method/file format to read on your phone, please tell me, so I can do better on upcoming challenges.

EDIT: Never mind, I just tried the pdf link, and it doesn't work on my phone either. Sorry :( For now, I hope you have access to a computer, though I'm of course still searching for a better solution.
