Canon HP would be luckularitied in under an hour. Or regular singularitied if you use wit-sharpening potion instead of felix.

Then, turn a space probe into a horcrux and use a compulsion charm on yourself so that you never feel remorse for the murder, or remove it from your memory altogether, so that your horcrux doesn't self-destruct. Congrats. You are now immortal.

That's to say nothing of viral imperius curses and compulsion charms, which are basically global-scale brainwashing.

Naruto has the most broken force multiplier in fiction. Even civilians can survive at half chakra and a single shadow clone means you learn twice as fast.
