A rational!Naruto would certainly break the world with this technique alone, as would anyone intelligent enough to understand the implications. Therefore I am of the opinion whoever tackled this endeavor would have to tweak the canon to some amount.

One such tweak would be that the Originator of Chakra (Sage of Six Paths) was aware of the dangers general use of chakra could and would introduce to the world and preemptively put some rules down to prevent or mitigate these. To name but two: transfer or retention of memories/experience is exponentially reduced by number of active clones, meaning you get an increase, but the chakra costs are increasingly higher; the ability to come up with exploits is considerably reduced to the whole of humanity. These are of course rationalizations of the narrative course the series took. Many of the more intelligent characters should have been able to come up with the memory exploit, especially Orochimaru, who had an expressed interest in jutsu acquisition and thus a motive to look for jutsu's with a memory component.
