How long can they sustain the thinking incredibly fast for? And are they affected by relativity?

EDIT: According to the picture you posted, they are affected by relativity. But can continue thinking, rather than being affected by time dilation?

Anyway, I agree, the ability to think that fast alone is broken. How does the Flash ever lose a fight?
