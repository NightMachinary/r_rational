They often are. A large part of the problem is that they put out an issue every month for decades, and the quality of the writing can vary a lot, not to mention character interpretations and the necessities of working in a larger shared universe with crossover events and things of that nature. Part of the thing that I like about comic books is that they have this very mythic quality to them - there's this spread of probable Flashes that have different powers and temperaments, and when you read a story you should really just be stepping into that particular universe (with Flash being a little different because there are a number of people that share that mantle). For every dozen turdlike stories about Superman, there's one that takes the concept and the familiarity and uses it as an effective tool.
