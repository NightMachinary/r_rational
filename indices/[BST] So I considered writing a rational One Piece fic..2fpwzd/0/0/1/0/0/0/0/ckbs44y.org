To recharge you need the actual lantern on hand, and most people keep them at home. The Speed Force user would just keep moving them away from their home, or maybe follow them to see where they live then steal the lantern.

If, for the sake of argument, they were carrying the lantern, then the Speed Force user would just steal it immediately.

If the lantern was covered by the shield, then the Speed Force user would wait until they took the shield down to eat or sleep or go to the bathroom, then kill the Power Ring user. Or just steal their lantern and ring if they're immortal in their base state.
