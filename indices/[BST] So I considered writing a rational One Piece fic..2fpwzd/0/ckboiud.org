Most Disney movies are pretty breakable. Aladdin doesn't even really begin to abuse the power of the genie, to say nothing of Jafar. Rapunzel has hair that can cure wounds, aging, and diseases, and half the time seems to forget that she can actually use that power. Ursula can, at a minimum, give herself and others a human form but is far too Evil to use this for something clever. Frozen is probably the worst offender.

Many of the DC superheroes are similarly uninteresting unless you ratchet down their power levels. The Flash is the most willfully underused hero in the modern age, in part because if he used his demonstrated abilities there wouldn't really be any plot to speak of.
