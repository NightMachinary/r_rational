SF users /might/ be able to space travel in the way you're thinking, but /I/ was thinking that since Momentum = Mass x Velocity, and you have more than zero mass that if you jump fast enough you can generate enough momentum to escape Earth's gravitational pull and fly through space. Jump FTL and you'll /fly/ FTL. You can't steer... but meh.
