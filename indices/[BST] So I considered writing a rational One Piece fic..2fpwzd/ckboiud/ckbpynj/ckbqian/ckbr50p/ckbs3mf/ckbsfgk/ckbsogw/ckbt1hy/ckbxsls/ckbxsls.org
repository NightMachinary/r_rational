There are plenty, but they generally dont interact with the main plots except in minor areas, as it would really break suspension of disbelief if an omnipotent character was beat by someone. Generally, when a character gets strong enough, they become rebranded as "force of nature" or "part of the universe" and cease to do anything useful. Living Tribunal, Galactus, The One Above All, etc... the only exception I have seen is when Kyle Rainor (or someone) became one with the green lantern power or some shit and he became omnipotent and omnipresent, which he used to stop all crime and war everywhere.
