Depends on the writer, but they usually aren't affected by relativity, and can maintain thinking fast indefinitely (though it gets boring). In the past this has been used for speed-reading, but generally the information gained is temporary, probably because, again, it would solve too many plots. It's occasionally used to pick up a language in fractions of a second. Bart Allen is the exception, for whatever reason; he is noted to have memorized every book in the San Francisco public library, and that knowledge stuck as part of his rebranding from Impulse to Kid Flash.
