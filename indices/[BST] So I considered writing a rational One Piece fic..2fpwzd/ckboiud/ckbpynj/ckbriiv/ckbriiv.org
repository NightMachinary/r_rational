Super speed isn't that broken, at least in its conventional form as possessed by Quicksilver or others. However, the Flash has the Speed Force, which I think started out as the answer to how he can travel at Mach 10 and not burn up from the air compression or friction, and just got more out of hand from there. There's a panel where [[http://4thletter.net/2006/09/flash-fact-jla-89/][the Flash]] removes a half million people from a city in .00001 microseconds. There's his infamous [[http://i.imgur.com/AarVpKD.jpg]["Infinite Mass Punch"]] where he knocks a guy into orbit.

Basically, the Flash can punch as hard as a nuclear blast and not feel anything from it. He can phase through walls and outrun laser beams. He ran faster than death once. If he were really pushing his limits instead of fighting against stupid enemies like that dude with a boomerang or the guy who's basically Mr. Freeze, he should be able to lock up every criminal in astonishingly small fractions of a second.

But he doesn't, because that would solve plots. Also, Flash is one of those superheroes that's never written terribly consistently.
