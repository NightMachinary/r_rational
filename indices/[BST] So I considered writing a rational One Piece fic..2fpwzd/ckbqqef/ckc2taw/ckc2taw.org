  Naruto has the most broken force multiplier in fiction. Even civilians can survive at half chakra and a single shadow clone means you learn twice as fast.

Working out a way for the setting to still make sense is not too difficult, but it makes Naruto /even more/ overpowered.

- Shadow clones are a secret technique precisely because the village in the leaves know how overpowered they are, and restrict it to absolutely trusted ninja.

- The cost is absurd: your chakra is divided evenly between every clone, and then a (very high) fixed cost per clone is deducted from your reserves. If this empties your reserves, the backlash is lethal.

Between those, the setting is mostly intact. Naruto gets them anyway because they have to be certain of his loyalty anyway, and he has the capacity to use them at a higher level than anyone else alive.

All the other ideas I had about memory shock, limits to use for ninjutsu training etc (if it's /only/ a memory transfer), inability to train a single thing in parallel rather than serial time... are all contradicted by canon. Of those, memory shock either caps the number or does nothing, and the limits of memory transfer for training just slow things down a bit. Limiting training to one clone per technique just makes the user an absurd generalist instead of an absurd specialist - it helps, but only for a while.
