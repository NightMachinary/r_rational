General proposal: in a "rational" story, there should be an obvious Science Ball. It should be clear who is holding the Science Ball. When a character is holding the Science Ball, they are required to be quoting accurate, or at least at-the-time accurate, real-world knowledge from whatever discipline they are talking about, or the author is subject to critique. Likewise, when the character is /not/ holding the Science Ball, they can fuck up every bit as badly as any other layperson.
