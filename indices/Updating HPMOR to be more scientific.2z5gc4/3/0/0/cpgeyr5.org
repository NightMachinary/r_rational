She's the one who's usually actually accurate. Unfortunately, the story sidelines her, portrays Harry as holding the Science Ball, spends a bunch of time on action sequences mixed with the Transhumanism Ball, then /kills off the character who had actually spoken correct science because she studied/, and then does an entire arc of "Wow, look how /dumb/ Harry was!", and then uses only-semi-accurate scientific speculation to go "Wow, look how powerful a trained rationalist like Harry is even when cornered!", and then ends promptly with the magic of friendship.

So overall, the Science Ball was not the main MacGuffin of the Science Potter Story, and this is a neat summary of my frustrations with the story.
