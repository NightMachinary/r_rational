I dunno, the whole transfiguration thing just reeks of the "no limits fallacy" that pops up all the time in whowouldwin type debates. There should be limits on the magic system but its basis is bibbity bobbity boo and not subject to Sanderson's Laws or any system whatsoever so the speculation should be treated as fun. Really the funnest parts were the bits about things like wingardium leviosa. The assumption that up quarks would be transfigured at maximal density is fun but pretty dumb. Everything else has transfigured over at room temperature and stable at standard air pressures. The majority of Iron in the universe sits molten at the core of stars but if you transfigure something into iron it is solid and room temperature.

SO anyway, I defy you to fit that square peg into that round hole. The source material had no aspirations to follow any rules so you're facing an uphill battle.
