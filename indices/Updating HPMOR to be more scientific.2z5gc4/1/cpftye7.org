[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2z3sz0/hpmor_full_review_su3su2u1/][This]] is the most relevant, thorough critique I can find of MoR, and it certainly touches on this. (There are lots of other awesome [[/r/rational]] authors - looking at you, [[/u/alexanderwales]] [[/u/DayStarEld]] [[/u/writingathing]] - who have offered their own criticism, too.)

In any case, I'd certainly be on board for this. Though I think the best way would be going forward with a genius.com-style annotation of MoR, as was proposed in some [[/r/hpmor]] thread^{I^{can^{no^{longer^{find}.}}}} If that was done, we'd be able to highlight and point out all the deficits and lacking areas, then propose, discuss, and implement fixes.

Ofc, I love MoR and [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]], but it's a first draft, and it shows.
