I have been working on writing the mechanics behind time travel set in a universe which only allows Stable Time Loops drawing on my computer science knowledge. So far, my story is written as a series of experiments to illustrate the important points and the best exploits with no plot involved.

It's not very far along, but if there ever is a scientific!HPMOR, I'll have something to contribute. With a little modification, I could rewrite the protagonist to be Harry instead.
