  I've been thinking about how Time Loops can be used as steps in an algorithm with the Stable Loop as the final step in the algorithm, like Harry tested his prime-factoring algorithm in HPMOR.

Hence my mention of dataflow analysis: fixed-point algorithms seem like the right way to compute a stable time loop.

  some randomness mixed with probability theory, instead of all the Turing Machines people use in sci-fi (we never even see the really interesting non-deterministic variant!).

Oooh, probabilistic programming/stochastic computation. Have you been reading my mind?
