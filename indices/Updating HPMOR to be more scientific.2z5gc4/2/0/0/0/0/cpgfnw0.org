Oops. I thought dataflow analysis was about sorting and modeling large amounts of data which I was going use to illustrate the power of the time loop (if it weren't for information constraints I'm inserting to keep from smart people from abusing this ability). I need more sleep...zzz

Looking at the wiki article, it sounds like fixed-point algorithms is exactly what I was looking for when I checked through my computer science textbooks. Thanks! I think I haven't learned too much about it yet, because it's covered in the /upcoming/ Algorithms course (time travel would be so useful right now!).

Not really, it's just happens to be the obvious thing to talk about when my time travel mechanic works by squeezing probability mass from unstable time loops into more stable loops as its method of selection. I'm actually debating how it would 'know' which loop to squeeze the probability of occurring into. I'm slightly worried that I won't know enough about stochastic computation to do this justice.

Forget boring discussion of free will vs determinism! Just figure out how to munchkin your foreknowledge anyway!
