A little bit. I'm not actually at the point where I would incorporate that type of knowledge into the story. I'm currently at the stage where some preliminary testing is being done as I flesh out the rules behind my time traveling mechanics. But I do intend to get to the point where actual computer science knowledge like dataflow analysis (what little of it I actually know) and some randomness mixed with probability theory, instead of all the Turing Machines people use in sci-fi (we never even see the /really/ interesting non-deterministic variant!).

I've been thinking about how Time Loops can be used as steps in an algorithm with the Stable Loop as the final step in the algorithm, like Harry tested his prime-factoring algorithm in HPMOR.

But what if that idea could be extended to make each loop execute an algorithm to allow a program of multiple algorithms to be executed over several Time Loops (in a sequential manner since according to my 'rules' timelines aren't stimulated in parallel). This (probably dumb) nascent idea was inspired by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree of Time]] in how multiple timelines could influence other timelines.
