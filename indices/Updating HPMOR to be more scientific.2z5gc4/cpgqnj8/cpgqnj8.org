I'm kind of interested, but I do not know how much I could assist. I have a law degree, so mainly I'd want to tackle chapter 97 where Harry handwaves away the complexities of the legal system. The more simple you make a legal system, the more interpretation you will require from judges and government. Famously, you could make the penal code a lot less complex by replacing it with the rule 'do not bad things'. Doesn't make it clearer for the general population though.

Small societies have a tendency to have simple rules, since everyone knows each other and all business is intertwined with personal relations. It's not until societies become larger, that people desire more laws and regulation. Of course, that's normal societies. Don't know how it works in a wizarding world where about 90% of the population is employed by the government.

Ooh, blood dept would also be fun to work out. The rule could be formally introduced in Rita's fake article in the beginning, so that Lucius falls under it but not the other death eaters.
