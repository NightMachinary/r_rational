  With "multiple writers and beta-readers from multiple scientific disciplines" you'll just get a bunch of bored undergrads with too much time on their hands arguing for their pet theories. I expect the result to be an incoherent mess.

This would at least rule out the scientific mistakes made by people who didn't even take relevant subjects at the undergrad level. Or, God help you, you could ask your bored undergrads to do a literature review in preparation for becoming bored grad-students.
