  It will probably require multiple writers and beta-readers from multiple scientific disciplines. And since the protagonist will be more curious, the story will involve a lot more exploration of the magical world, and therefore more side-plots and "filler" chapters.

More exploration of the magical world requires that there's a good explanation of what's going to be observed in the first place. "Just add more science to it" doesn't work for a fictional setting, you actually have to come up with the answers as well.

With "multiple writers and beta-readers from multiple scientific disciplines" you'll just get a bunch of bored undergrads with too much time on their hands arguing for their pet theories. I expect the result to be an incoherent mess.
