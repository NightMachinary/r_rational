My point is, if the story is going to glorify Harry's good sense whenever he does something particularly intelligent, then ideally it would do as much as it can to take apart his flaws rather than simply excusing them. Which isn't to say HPMOR makes Harry seem perfect, just that Harry still has a long way to go, and exploring the areas in which he still comes up short has merit.
