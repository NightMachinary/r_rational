I mean, did you read the last arc? Pretty much every chapter is "QV did something evil, hahahaha. And Harry Potter felt very bad because he was stupid." Even the last chapter is "Oh wow I am still very stupid."

The idea of "Harry still has a long way to go, and exploring the areas in which he still comes up short has merit" is ever present throughout the book. "Tsuyoku Naritai!" might as well be on of Harry's slogans.
