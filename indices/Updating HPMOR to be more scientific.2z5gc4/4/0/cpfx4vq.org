HPMOR still aspires to be rational though, and Harry is very much an over the top rational aspiring character. Giving an excuse like that seems a lot like trying to have it go both ways, letting Harry be in many ways smarter than anyone around him, while at the same time excusing any shortcomings on his part by saying that he's still just a kid.

If HPMOR is trying to be rational story, then there are still many ways to think of how it could be improved. That goal, in and of itself, is not undesirable or not worth aspiring towards.
