The calculations are not perfectly fast, but any linear operation becomes infinitely parallelizable. Effectively by allowing perfect thermodynamic work, you have removed the effects of noise on computation. Since the cardinality of the real numbers is unimaginably larger than the integers (to say nothing of the finite precision arithmetic we use in digital computers), we can encode an infinite number of these into a single real number (for example, we could represent a series of 64bit numbers as a_0+a_1/2^{64} +a_2/2^{128} +...). We can then perform linear operations on this real and extract the results. Things get a little more complicated with nonlinear operations since you need to avoid aliasing, but it is still theoretically possible.
