Couldn't we use these machines as analog computers with infinite precision and accuracy? It seems possible that one such computers would have the same processing power as a cluster of infinitely many digital computers. With these things you could brute force any encryption with O(N) operations (as opposed to O(2^{N)),} breaking any encryption scheme but the one-time pad. This could also be applied to protein folding, climate modelling, finite element analysis, etc. This would basically allow you to perform most scientific computing calculations in days instead of years (with one computer instead of thousands). You could also use these computers to perform perfect correlation and combining of large data sets, allowing you to meet the information theoretic bounds of any system. This effectively allows you to pull any signal out of the noise given enough independent samples. Look for massive improvements in wireless communication speeds with significant reductions in power consumption (though the number of antennas on each device would sky-rocket). Look for imaging systems capable of taking 3D pictures with nearly perfect accuracy from almost arbitrarily far away (and do similar things when sensing with sound, magnetism, gravity, etc).

In short, humans would no longer need to guess anything. Everything would become observable, and we would be able to test theories against observations as fast as we could come up with them. Whether this would increase or decrease the rate of scientific progress is an open question. All the theories men have ever made are wrong (i.e. there some observation that they contradict), so I'm not sure how fast things would progress when the people setting forth theories know exactly in which ways those theories fail to match observations. It could be that all of the pure scientists would have nervous breakdowns from trying for perfection, and only the more practical, engineering-minded folks would continue.
