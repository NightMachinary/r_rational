Assuming that they are versatile and powerful enough, it would almost instantly boost humanity to Kardashev Type II level abilities (i.e. able to harness the power output of a single star). Because of mass/energy equivalence, this is practically unlimited free energy.

Want some gold? Grab a lump of dirt and throw it into the machine. 100 kg of dirt has the same energy as 100 kg of gold so you don't need to add any external energy.

Want something accelerated? A 10 ton spaceship at rest has the same energy as a 9.999 ton spaceship moving very fast.

As soon as you can freely break down matter to do work, you're practically done climbing that branch of the tech tree.
