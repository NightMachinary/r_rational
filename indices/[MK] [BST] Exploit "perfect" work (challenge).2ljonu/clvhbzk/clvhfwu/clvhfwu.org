We only have human levels of technology. Once the hypothetical civilization reaches the point where they can freely break down matter for energy, it hardly matters whether the work is 100% efficiency or not, you're going to be nigh-omnipotent anyway. I probably should have clarified that the "magical engine" can't break anything apart, except as the "output" of its reaction.

Is there any fast way to break down matter to energy using simpler rules? Maybe you could throw a baseball, and convert that baseball's kinetic energy to the kinetic energy of a hydrogen atom in a fusion chamber...
