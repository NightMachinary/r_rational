For micro-scale stuff, you can suddenly build microchips that use the fundamental minimum amount of energy to do a calculation. Heating is no longer an issue. Expect a revolution to bump computer performance a few orders of magnitude, in the short term.

Macro-scale, I think the 'magical completion of work' bit is equally useful. For example: (at perfect efficiency) something rising takes work, falling yields work, and hovering at constant altitude is work-less. Boom, everyone can fly horizontally without effort. And you basically just invented a space elevator everywhere, so expect a space revolution too!
