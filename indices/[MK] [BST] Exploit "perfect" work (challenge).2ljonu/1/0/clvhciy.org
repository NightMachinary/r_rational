Very interesting. I never thought of microchips, nanotech was what I was going with, but a tech boom of any sort can be expected, but that's only after civilization achieves that level of technology. I was also thinking production, as we now have a really precise tool that can use really tiny amounts of energy to get a complex task done. However, prior to that I don't think there are as many easy ways to abuse the system.

The horizontal hovering seems to be a problem... There has to be a force opposing F_g, right? Would it take energy to output that force of resistance or am I failing at basic physics?

Care to explain the space elevator? Just W = F*d?
