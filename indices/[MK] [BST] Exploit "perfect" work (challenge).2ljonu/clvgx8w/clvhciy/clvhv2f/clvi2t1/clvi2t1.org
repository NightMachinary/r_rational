I see... Perhaps then there exists similar "perpendicular to the relevant plane" munchinkery? And this makes me think that to use this in a novel I'd have to make it revolve around forces, not energy, which kicks a couple of my ideas offstage, but also makes new ones.

As far as the space elevator, I see the point. Making it based more on forces does resolve the issue a bit, but still leaves lots of opportunity for a space boom... And the problem is that, sans proper elevator, you still have to carry fuel, you just can use it to the maximum possible degree.
