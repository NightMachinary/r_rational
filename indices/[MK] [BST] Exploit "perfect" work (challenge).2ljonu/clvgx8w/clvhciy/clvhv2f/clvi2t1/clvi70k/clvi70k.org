Is our magical not-machinery limited by distance? If not... 'magical' pistons and ropes connected to celestial bodies makes space travel easy. Even if the action is simply "raise from earth" and "push away from horizon".

Yeah, if we're talking about work/energy (with 100% efficient conversion) that's utterly broken. Force might be a little better, but maybe not by as much as you expect.
