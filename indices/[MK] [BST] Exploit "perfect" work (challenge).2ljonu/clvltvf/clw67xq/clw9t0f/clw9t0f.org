Why use and create(*) new energy when you can do work with the same energy over and over without loses to heat?

Fast trains going without energy loses in circles would solve all transport problems with only initial energy investment to get it moving (to allow people to board without stopping make the leaving passangers move to the last wagon, prepare new wagon with entering passangers to the front and switch them at each station (add balast to keep the momentum constant)).

AC, heating and refrigerators could be solved similary by moving the heat (without loses) to where it is needed at the moment.

I think such world could use very little energy to do the same things we do (orders of magnitude less).

(*) Yeah yeah energy conservation you know what I mean.
