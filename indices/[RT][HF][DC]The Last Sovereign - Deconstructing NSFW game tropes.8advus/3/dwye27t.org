I've actually considered making a post about this game here, so it's neat to see that someone beat me to it, and the author too, no less.

Besides the characters, I really like the game's focus on soft power as a necessary complement to the traditional RPG power treadmill. This is especially true when it comes to economics, and I love how much the investment and economic developments you make play into how the game progresses.

It's something that's woefully neglected in mainstream games, so to see it in a genre that isn't often known for deep thought was a real treat.

To anyone who is not turned off by the thought of NSFW games, I cannot recommend this one enough.
