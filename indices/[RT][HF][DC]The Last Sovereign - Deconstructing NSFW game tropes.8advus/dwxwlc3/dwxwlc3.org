For what it's worth, I definitely recommend The Last Sovereign to any [[/r/rational]] redditors who don't mind NSFW games.

I've played about 50 hours in the past and one of the things I like best about it is the worldbuilding and the characters. I find most characters in harem games ( and NSFW media in general) pretty forgettable, but TLS manages to make all of its characters memorable.

The worldbuilding is pretty great as well. I guess this is where the characteristics of [[/r/rational]] stand out the most to me in the game, because of how carefully constructed the world and backstory is.

All in all, if you like text based RPG's and you are ok with a NSFW game, you should give this game a solid shot.
