HotDropMarble has done a good job answering many of these questions. I felt a JRPG was a good match for the type of party system and strength progression I wanted in the game - but as mentioned, grinding isn't possible.

In terms of branching, the game has only some. It's hard to answer this question because you can never be sure about someone's points of comparison. But it's a long story with a lot of moving parts, so deep fundamental branches would quickly become untenable.

In terms of consequences, including many is one of my main goals with the game. Nearly all the player's actions are tracked and have multiple consequences along the way. Rather than trying to laud my own game, it might be simplest to look at the wiki guide for the recent war event: [[https://thelastsovereign.miraheze.org/wiki/Third_Arclent_War_guide]]

The "variables" section at the beginning will give you a sense for the kinds of things the game tracks and how they have consequences. There are spoilers if you go lower.

Can't promise the game is to your taste, but thanks for your interest!
