When beginning work, I chose an engine based on a very large number of different factors. Cross-platform compatibility was one of the considerations, but it was a fairly small one. Sorry about that.

Most of my other games (Crimson Gray, Ouroboros, Kingdom of Deception) support Mac and Linux. But I couldn't have built TLS in those engines, not under reasonable conditions.
