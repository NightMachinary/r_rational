It would be difficult to list all the factors. In very broad terms, the three most important are:

1) Support of solid game mechanics that allows me to focus on my writing strengths. This is a complex and subjective one, sorry.

2) A large library of freely available resources, sufficient to create a diverse world with artistic consistency.

3) An active community and ongoing development of both engine and resources.

I'm not as concerned with the software being free or open source, though both are pluses.

You're asking because you want to suggest another engine? I don't mind, as recommendations could always lead me somewhere new and worthwhile. But to be clear, I do not intend to throw away several years of work to recreate everything in a new engine.
