I shudder to think what a port to the last version of RPG Maker (MV) would entail for a game of this size (MV is cross-plataform: works in Windows, Linux and Mac natively, and it's possible to port to Android too, but that process is more complex).

But realistically, I don't think that it's feasible as it would imply a huge amount of work (among other things they have two different programming languages).
