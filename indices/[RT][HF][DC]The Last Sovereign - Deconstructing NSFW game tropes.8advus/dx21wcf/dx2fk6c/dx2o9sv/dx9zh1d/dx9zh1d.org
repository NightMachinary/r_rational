Wine [[http://thelastsovereign.wikia.com/wiki/Running_on_Linux][has worked for some]]. If you discover any additional trick to getting it to work on Wine, letting people know about it will be of more use to other potential players than trying to get the developer to switch engines at this point in development.

I suppose you could also contribute to a project like [[https://github.com/mcanterb/JRGSS]] if you really really care about this issue in general.
