While I'm not sure what your definition of a good eroge or good RPG is, I can guarantee that there is zero trash mob grinding in TLS. In general, each enemy appears on the map only once. Once you kill them, they don't respawn. This can make the game pretty difficult because you can't level grind your way to victory. Instead you have to learn the skill system and equip your characters carefully in order to win the harder fights.

It also forces you to make some difficult plot choices. If you skip that tough optional dungeon, you may be missing that exp gain until much later in the story, which can make fights down the road harder. But if you're not good at playing the game, you won't be able to beat the difficult optional dungeon right now.
