Well, I think TLS fits your good RPG criteria. The game has a ton of choices and there are visible consequences (some permanent) to your poor or great decision making. Now, you can't take the main story off the rails, but you can cause some pretty significant ripples in how it plays out.

(Slight Spoilers)

For example, when you end up fighting in a war later in the game, all your previous choices as well as the tactical choices determine which battles you need to fight and who survives. Your previous decision affect which fights you get and which decisions you are allowed to make during the battle. And your in battle decisions will also contribute to your success/failure scores at the end. If your choices were really poor, you still end up winning the war, but it becomes more like a pyhrric victory and it can dog you for the rest of the game.

(Spoilers End)

The number of choices and the extensive combinations of consequences is actually one of the toughest parts about playing TLS for me. I love to be highly optimized in RPG's, but its almost impossible to perfectly optimize the game because of the huge interacting decision trees. I even spent a month of free time looking into the underlying source code of the game to try and map a "perfect" game, but in the end I gave up because of the difficulty.
