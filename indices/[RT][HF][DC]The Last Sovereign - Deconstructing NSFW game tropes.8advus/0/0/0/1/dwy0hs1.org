Many many choices. They don't all branch, but rather most give +/- points to invisible stats the game keeps running in the background like "city stability" or "population unrest" or "siege defence" or whatever and when those bits come up in the plot the game checks for what score you have and things can change from there. Entirely made up example: you're under siege, after having spent time and money investing in building up the city. A siege def of +20= enemy repulsed with ease with massive casualties, future fights with them made easier and you can sally out. siege def 15-20=enemy repulsed and have to pull out of their planned next attack. siege def 5-10=enemy barely repulsed and immediately attack again. siege def under 5, they break through and you have to personally deal with the invaders while the city takes damage.

But the money you invested in the siege defence might have been needed for personal equipment, or sponsoring a religion or helping magic studies or w/e and you can't grind much so money is not limitless so time to make some decisions. Maybe a siege def score of 5-10 is worth it in order to get a better sword for that boss fight coming up, or maybe you accidentally overfunded the mages school before realising wait shit the walls need to be repaired.
