We are still finishing the [[http://thelastsovereign.wikia.com/wiki/Ardan_succession_crisis][guide for the latest update]], but I can already tell you other examples:

(Minor spoilers): did you advise your old acquaintance (a nun in a somehow safe church) to leave the safety of the convent's wall behind to help others? Or do you choose to not say anything? She could end dead and missed, or she could choose to join the group and to help (a little) undermining one of the candidates to throne during a Succession crisis. And we are talking about a minor character here.

Do you take the time to examine a small farm of... slimes in a elf city? Maybe that will get you a young, energetic elf as a business partner that down the road will help a worthy candidate.

(Spoilers End)

About the TAW guide it was a TON of work for a good number of people. I'm ecstatic that you mentioned it elsewhere.
