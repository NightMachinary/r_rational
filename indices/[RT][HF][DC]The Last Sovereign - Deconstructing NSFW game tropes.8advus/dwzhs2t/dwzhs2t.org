As a sex game, I'd say CoC/TiTs > MGQ>Your Game (greater than meaning better, >= may be equal) As RPGs, I'd say CoC/TiTs>=Your Game> MGQ. As for an interesting story (i.e. rational), I'd say your game >= MGQ>TiTs/CoC.

May change that later, haven't finished the game yet, but that's my first impression after ~3 hours.
