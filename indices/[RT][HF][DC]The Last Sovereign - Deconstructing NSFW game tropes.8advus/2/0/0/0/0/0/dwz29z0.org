Yeah I was joking around too, but I think the reason for the discrepancy between r!Animorphs' popularity and its frequency is because your list is only counting the number of posts made without taking into account the upvotes any given post has. Which is a perfectly valid measurement to make considering we only needed to know the composition of posts one would see rather than something like wanting to know what the sub enjoys the most or something like that.

Either way, thanks a lot for going to this effort making the list!
