No, it's actually based on r/rational/top/all-time, i. e. on the 200 posts with the highest rating in the subreddit's history. It's obviously biased --- for example, a significant part of the subreddit's activity is in weekly threads, and not a single one of them has more than 31 points.

You're welcome, but that really didn't cost me much effort.
