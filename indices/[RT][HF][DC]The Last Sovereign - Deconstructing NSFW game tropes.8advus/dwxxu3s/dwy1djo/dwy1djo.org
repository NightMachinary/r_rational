Good question; apologies for not being able to give a thorough answer right now.

My primary inspiration and influence for this game was the deconstruction aspect. Playing a variety of other adult games, I often felt dissatisfaction with the worldbuilding and the protagonists' impetuousness. I recognized that I'm not the target audience for those games, though, so I set about making something for myself. That includes both the aforementioned aspects and just going all in on the detail-oriented investment and hidden variable stuff. Fortunately, other people seem to like it too!

The TV Tropes description is a good summary of the game, I think. Glad you like the concept!
