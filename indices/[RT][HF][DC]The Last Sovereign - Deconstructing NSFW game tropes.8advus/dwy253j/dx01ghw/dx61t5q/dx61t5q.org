Kai isn't primarily what's important about the intro, Altina is, her character and what can happen to her is one of the most important OPTIONAL and EASILY MISSED aspects of Act 2.

It's like dragon age origins but occasionally more punishing so playing through again is no problem; I enjoy the writing, interdependent strategic layers, and progression.

We haven't even seen Altina's Custom Staff yet, and to think on my first run I missed her totally, it was a fucking disaster that run, Carina's men got stomped and it really took me by surprise how important the optional stuff is.

The start is slow but provides context and altogether the game forms something that no other RPG maker game approaches.
