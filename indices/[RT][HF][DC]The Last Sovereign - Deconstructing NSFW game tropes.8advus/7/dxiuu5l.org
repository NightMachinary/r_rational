I'm really enjoying the game. This is the first time in years that I've been this engaged with a story-heavy game. I'm not even that much into the porn aspects of it. (Playing a game and enjoying porn require different moods for me and I can't switch so quickly between them.)

Still, the world-building and dialog are amazing. The only /slightly/ annoying thing, is that to experience everything, you have to regularly talk with all possible characters to double-check whether they have anything new to say. I'd prefer if there was some visual indication whether a character had something new to say or not.

5/5 from me.
