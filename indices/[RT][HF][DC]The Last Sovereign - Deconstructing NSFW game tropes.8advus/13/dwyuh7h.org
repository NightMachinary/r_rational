The game looks pretty fun so far, thanks for making it and reccing it here!

Slightly annoying: Making the runtime work on linux. For other linux users, virtualbox does the job, ie no trouble with the nightmare that is directx pass-through. I did get a couple of random crashes, but this may well be my fault (running a weird setup).

Has anyone managed to make the runtime work under wine? Or, even better, on an arm / android (an arm tablet would be a quite natural device for playing this)?
