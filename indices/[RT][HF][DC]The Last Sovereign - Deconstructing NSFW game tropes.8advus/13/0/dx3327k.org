I just copied the files of the complete version. Worked with wine without any configuration required although it may have been due to me already having the necessary dependencies. If it doesn't work for you, just scour the debug log and check on google to find out what dependency to install from your distro's packages.

As for ARM, I can't imagine trying to get it to work (nicely) considering it is not native to the architecture. Not really worth the time vs just remote accessing to an x86 computer.
