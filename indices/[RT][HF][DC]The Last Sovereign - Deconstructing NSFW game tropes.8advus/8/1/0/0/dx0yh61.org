Ok. I would say then that the main character behaves in most cases in a rational and logical way, but both the situations and a good number of his antagonists don't.

Do this make the whole story rational and logical? No, not really.

But in the context that Simon finds himself, he makes (most of the time) rational and overall practical decisions, no matter how ruthless or distasteful they are .
