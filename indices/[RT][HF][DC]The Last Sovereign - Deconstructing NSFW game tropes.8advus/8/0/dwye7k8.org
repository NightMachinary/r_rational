Having played it, I'd say that the rational aspect comes less from the setting, and more from the main characters' response to it.

In particular, there is a strong emphasis on making practical, well thought out choices, and building up soft powers such as economic and political, rather than just follow the standard RPG progression of "kill monster, loot stuff" (though a certain degree of it happens anyway).
