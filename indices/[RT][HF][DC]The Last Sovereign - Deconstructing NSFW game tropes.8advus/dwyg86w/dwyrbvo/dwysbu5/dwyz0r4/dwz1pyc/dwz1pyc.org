No, it's just so small a part of this subreddit as to be a rounding error. I'm sorry, [[/u/CouteauBleu][u/CouteauBleu]], but statistics don't lie.

... Okay, I analysed a second set of 100 top entries, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8aa92m/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dwz2d82/?context=3][here's the results]]. But, don't make me push it any further, lest I'll end up with some /actual/ significant results derived from hard time-consuming work, instead of this low-effort joke I have going.

+(Also, it's off-topic. I apologize, [[/u/SierraLeeTLS][u/SierraLeeTLS]]. Should we move this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8aa92m/d_friday_offtopic_thread/][somewhere else]]?)+

*Edit:* On second thoughts, that's exactly what I'll do.
