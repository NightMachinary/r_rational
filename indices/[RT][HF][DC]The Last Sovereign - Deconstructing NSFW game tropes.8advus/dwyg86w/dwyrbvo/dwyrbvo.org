Indeed you jest. According to my rigorous statistical analysis, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/top/?sort=top&t=all][it's actually]]:

- 40% /Mother of Learning/
- 25% /Worth the Candle/
- 21% miscellaneous short stories
- 3% blatant transhumanist propaganda
- 2% deep discussions regarding all forms of fiction
- 2% /Harry Potter/ fanfiction
- 2% whale puns
- 2% /Worm/
- 1% /A Practical Guide To Evil/
- 1% dirty paperclip-maximizer wish-fulfilment fantasies
