Awesome post [[/u/xamueljones]] ;)

***** Chapter 13

- I really enjoyed the cantor diagonalization discussion
- a lot of punning: BlooP <-> Pool B <-> Blue Programs <-> Blue BlooP Programs
- why is the subset of BlooP blue (okay pun?) the subset of FlooP *green* and GlooP *red*? Pushing/Popping tonics are blue/red, the tortoise's shell is green but I think that is a little far fetched.

***** Dialogue
      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: dialogue
      :END:

- Figure 74 is cool

- on p.435, it says:

  #+begin_quote
    /Achilles/: A king without a subject would be -

    /Tortoise/: - an anomaly, of course
  #+end_quote

  Which is similar to p.44 (Two-part invention):

  #+begin_quote
    "A tortoise playing football would be -" Achilles was beginning. "- an anomaly of course," the Tortoise hastily interrupted.
  #+end_quote

  referenced by DRH in chapter 4 on p. 96, as discussed in a previous [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/30a22q/geb_discussion_5_chapter_4_consistency/cprj4ti][comment]]

  This time it seems to refer back to p.208 (chapter 8):

  #+begin_quote
    It is a sentence without a subject (or a sentence whose subject is an out-of-context pronoun). For instance,
  #+end_quote

  #+begin_example
           is a sentence without a subject
                  would be an anomaly
      runs backwards and forwards simultaneously
          improvised a six-part fugue on demand
  #+end_example

  #+begin_quote
    are nonarithmetical predicates.
  #+end_quote

  Which is why the tortoise says in the same dialogue:

  #+begin_quote
    "IS A KING WITH NO SUBJECT" IS A KING WITH NO SUBJECT

    It seems to me that it might make more sense if it said "sentence"
  #+end_quote
