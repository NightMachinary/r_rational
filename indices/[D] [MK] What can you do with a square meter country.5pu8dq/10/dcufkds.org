  the country you are in does not care that you've taken some of their land, unless you get on their bad side.

You need to be more specific about what "get on their bad side" means. For reasonable definitions of "get on their bad side" it may mean that you basically don't have your own country after all (for instance, if not paying taxes to the country you are in counts as getting on their bad side).

Also, most of the exploits described would require hiring an international relations lawyer and/or a diplomat, since you probably aren't educated in the fine points of diplomatic immunity, border control, trade agreements, treaties, arguing at the UN, etc.
