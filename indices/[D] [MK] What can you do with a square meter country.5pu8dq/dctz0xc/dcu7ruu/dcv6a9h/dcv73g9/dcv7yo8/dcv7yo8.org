Yeah I can see your point, this strategies effectiveness is limited by the host government. So you would want to ideally be in a country that will accept bribes to not cut your power or whatever for breaking laws they don't care too much about and also isn't too politically aggressive so they don't try too hard to leverage you.\\
Also you probably want a country that isn't too unstable so you don't have to worry about regime changes messing up your plans, and is safe enough not to have to worry so much about non-state actors in invading you.
