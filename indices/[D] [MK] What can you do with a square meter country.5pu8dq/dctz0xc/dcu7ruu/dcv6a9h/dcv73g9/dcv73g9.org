You'd have to find something that the host country leadership either wants to do or doesn't care about.

If it's the former, you essentially become a puppet state of the host country, since it has /so/ much leverage over you.

As for the later, I don't know enough about international politics to give an example I'm confident about. Maybe there are countries that don't give a crap about e.g. piracy but are forced to give a crap by international treaties?
