Put your 1 square meter on an oceanic coast.

If you can, instead of making it an actual square meter, make it a 10 centimetres thick and 100 meters wide. Still 1 square meter.

Thanks to how the [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_sea][law of the sea]] works, your coastline projects a set of national waters out into the ocean to a range of 12 miles at a minimum.

You also own all the natural resources on the seabed on that area, and your laws apply to that area. Other boats can cross it on the way through, but must obey your laws.

Choose an area near a transatlantic data cable, with good tidal / solar/ wind power options.

Now fill in some of that area to make an artificial island or two. Put your data center there.

While you're at it, build one of those fancy artificial lily pad style green islands.

There, I just hacked the system to up your land area by a factor of several thousand.
