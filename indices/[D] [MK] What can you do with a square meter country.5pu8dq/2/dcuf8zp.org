*Short term:* Begin requesting embassies with all world governments. Embassies are granted land that are in effect, owned by their sponsor government, so this is a quick way to increase your land holdings. An embassy even on a measly 0.5 acre plot of land is ~2000 sq meters, so every successful embassy request represents approximately a > 2000% increase of your original land holdings.

*Medium Term:* Act as a asylum/defender of innocents/charity cause and receive non-profit donation status in other countries. Use your embassies as a way to shelter wrongly convicted/suspected foreigners from their host nation.

*Long Term*: Use charity proceeds and whatever funds can be acquired to create a lunar/mars/space colony. Earth is a long-term dead end, military conquest of land being non-viable due to WMD's and your lack of them. Space represents the only possible frontier to expand into.
