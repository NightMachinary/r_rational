Assuming that the international community not only recognizes you but will continue to act as if you are a fully operational country and not just completely ignorable, you could use your international immunity as a diplomatic shield and declaration that other countries' laws did not apply to you, both for yourself and to any other legal entity you may choose to grant whatever rights to.

This means you can shelter internationally wanted persons (presumably in embassies rather than in a stand-on-each-others'-shoulders tower in your actual homeland). You could incorporate an unlimited number of companies and other legal and taxation structures. You could launder money, set up data havens, issue your own merch (stamps, flags, history books), have legal structures which allow external legal entities to funnel money and resources through you without trace (at least in theory).

You could send international observers and journalists to anywhere at any time. If you had the resources, you could interfere in wars, spy on other countries and people, technically /wage/ war. Claim islands in the middle of nowhere (and their surrounding waters) as your territory. Probably participate in the Olympics.

In the end, it's not about how much land you own, it's about how much power you wield, either overtly or covertly. Land is just a convenient placeholder to mark your legal jurisdiction as recognized by other national-scale entities.
