Sell top level domain names, and since you get to pick your country name you could chose something that will sell, though maybe not as well as .tv

Declare your own home to be the embassy of your country (or sell domain names and passports first and buy a better one)

I don't think secure data storage could be very secure if you can't defend your server from random thieves. How do you make an impregnable 1m fortress? Thick walls would eat your real estate real fast and even then a determined thief with a digger could probably knock it down unless you have cooperation from someone in the host country. In fact you might be better off to build your embassy AROUND your country :-)
