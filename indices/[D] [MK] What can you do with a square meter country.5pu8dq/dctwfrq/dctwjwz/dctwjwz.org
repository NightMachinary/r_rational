The surrounding country doesn't restrict visitation. To immigrate would require the ability to live in the square meter of land for an extended period of time, so that's not an issue for the moment. Tax evasion would be the same way. If by some miracle you manage to expand your territory these start becoming available options. The country you're within looks on you favorably but if you start doing shady things relations will get a little more frosty.
