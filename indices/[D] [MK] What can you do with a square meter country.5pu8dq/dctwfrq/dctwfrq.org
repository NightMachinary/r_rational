what are the rules regarding immigration from this country into the surrounding country? Would citizens of your country (possibly including you) have to get a work permit to work in the surrounding country? Could you dodge taxes by living in a tent in this square meter? what about just declaring that you live there? If things worked out, you could allow people to "immigrate" to your country, thus allowing them to avoid taxes, and then put in place your own (lower) tax. ...Though that might result getting on the surrounding country's bad side.
