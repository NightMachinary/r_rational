You don't have much chance to leverage your physical territory, but you've got a lot of legal pull. You can make yourself tax heaven, trade passports to shady people. You can sell tickets to UN sessions. If position of your country is inconvenient in some ways to surrounding polity, you can probably trade it for a bigger patch of land in more convenient area and leverage the physical territory. Also depending on surrounding country laws you can establish a small casino. Most of it would be situated in surrounding country and will be just a fancy hotel/restaurant and you will install a single gambling contraption per floor over your territory.
