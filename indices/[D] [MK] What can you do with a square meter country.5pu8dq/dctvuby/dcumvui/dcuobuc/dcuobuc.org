I'm saying this in reference to "micronations", whose claims of sovereignty are dubious at best. Typically, they cling to the idea that their home country acknowledges their independence by choosing to tolerate them. In truth, they are simply so tiny and unimportant that they are beneath their home country's notice. If they attempted to leverage their "nation" to do anything important, they would be quickly and easily crushed.
