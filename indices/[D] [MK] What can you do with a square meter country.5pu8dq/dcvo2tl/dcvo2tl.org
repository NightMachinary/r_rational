Tax and legal haven. Cybercriminals headquarter in Russia because unless they have Russian victims it isn't a crime there. Corporations are incorporated in Hong Kong because they don't tax transactions where neither party is in Hong Kong. You could exist solely on paper and end up being the most powerful country outside the G8 by simply acting as a collective bargaining unit for businesses.

You won't need to gather tons in tax, nor maintain law and order. So you'd be essentially impossible to beat in this race to the bottom.

[I'd like to clarify the question is what /can/ you do, not what /would/ or /should/ you do.]
