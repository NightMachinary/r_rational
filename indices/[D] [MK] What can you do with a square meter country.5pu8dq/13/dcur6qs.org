After a little more thought, here're some more ways to monetize being the king of your own country:

- Contract with some mint somewhere; establish your own fiat currency. I don't see how any investor would be interested, but you can at least sell coins to collectors.

- Contract with some printer; sell stamps to collectors. Maybe look into concluding some treaty so they can actually be used to mail letters.

- Establish a system of nobility, and sell titles. They don't even need to mean anything, but if you want, you can also establish a House of Lords that gets some input into what designs go on the stamps and coins.

- Also, since you have sovereign immunity, you don't need to pay any parking tickets ever.

It wouldn't be a consistent income, and it'd obviously depend on how you price the titles of nobility, but I think you could at least earn several thousand dollars a year doing this.
