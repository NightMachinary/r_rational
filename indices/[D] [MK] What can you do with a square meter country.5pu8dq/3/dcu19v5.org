Congratulations; you now have sovereign immunity and cannot be prosecuted by anyone ^{except the International Court of Justice} for anything. You can, however, be expelled from any nation ^{except your own square meter} at the discretion of the executive.

Also, you can give diplomatic immunity to just about anyone. If you want, you can sell it for large +bribes+ gifts. Of course, do it to the wrong people, and they just might end up living on your square meter.
