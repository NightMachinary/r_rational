Ah... dissolving it in artificial stomach acid and quickly putting the result through a human corpse's digestive tract (with a mechanical pump), would that count? What if it's only a human soon-to-be-corpse? (A terminally ill patient who volunteered or something, if you want to let petty /morals/ stand in the way of senseless munchkinry.)

What about animals? Could we force-feed it to a whale, say?

I suppose setting the corpse-machine up or finding a whale and bribing its owners to let you kill it would take quite some time, but I'm rather doubtful you would be able to organize or even collect a thousand people /and/ put the hummus from that bowl in separate bowls /and/ teach the people optimal eating /and/ figure out where to put them in one hour either. It has to mean "one hour starting from the moment the first bit of hummus is eaten, ending with the moment the last bit of hummus is eaten", not "one hour since you accepted the challenge".

In which case, researching genetic engineering and nanotechnology to create an artificial human with a house-sized external stomach and nanomachine-assisted mouth would probably be a better way to win. 50 years on preparations, a few seconds on the eating.

Actually wait a moment, why are we even doing this? There's no mention of a reward for that. You tricked us!
