So according to news articles it is 10 metric tones of hommus. So you would need between 20k and 50k people in order to eat it. Lets assume 20k people each eating 500g of hommus each. They need 15min to eat the hommus, so we have 45 min to distribute hommus to these people. If you have a person serving hommus from a tub they can portion about one portion per 2 seconds and then 5 people can distribute this hommus and to queues. Thus in 20 min each portioner can portion for 600 people, using 300kg of hommus, this is about 6 wheelbarrows full or one car trailer. We need 67 such lines. To fill a trailer takes about two minuites with a back hoe or a vacuum so you need about 7 of them working in order to fill all the trailers. Plus 5 minutes es to drive to distribution centers So in total you need:

- 7 back hoes or high speed vacuum hoses.
- 70 car trailers lined with plastic.
- 70 servers and 350 waiters.
- 20k people each able to eat 500g of hommus in 15 min.
- A crap ton of tables and plastic serving ware.

Edit:10 tones was the 2010 record this 2015 one was 15 tones so multiply all numbers by 1.5 giving

- 12 back hoes or pipes,
- 115 queues and
- 30k people.
