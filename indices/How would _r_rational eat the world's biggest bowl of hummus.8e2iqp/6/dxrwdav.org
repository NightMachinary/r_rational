Well, depends what the Hummus Maker calls eating. It can't be needed to be processed by the body. (sorry missing vocabulary) Since that would take longer than an hour.

There are some really cruel and disgusting ways to do that with a lower number of persons. Just take one skull and a funnel. And every other thing the Hummus Maker requires. (I hope it is not needed to be alive to count as eating.) If 10 metric ton is correct you would need to 'feed' 166kg per minute. So maybe use 5-10 skulls. Or a bigger skull.

So I hope I don't need to add stomaches or any other disgusting details. If I have o, maybe the existential threat is to be preferred.
