Dude hummus is great! It's chickpea paste, like peanut butter but with a subtler flavor. Dunno where you live, but if it's not in stores, you can make it by blending canned chickpeas, tahini, lemon and garlic if you like. Eat with raw veggies or pita bread or crackers, put it on a sandwich, have a shawarma plate, the possibilities are endless.

For the sake of the riddle, let's say the Hummus Maker has made a believable existential threat that will be nullified upon completion of the Great Bowl.
