Hummus Maker says all hummus must be contained within living /homo sapiens/ when the time is up. You have to complete the task within a year or you lose. Time starts at the first scoop of hummus.

If you win, not only is Earth spared, but everyone involved gets a lifetime supply of Hummus Maker (tm) Hummus!
