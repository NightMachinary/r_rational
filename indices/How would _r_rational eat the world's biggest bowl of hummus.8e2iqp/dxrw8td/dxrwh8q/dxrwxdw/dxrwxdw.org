  Hummus Maker says all hummus must be contained within living /homo sapiens/ after 1 hour.

Hmph. Partially skinning people, putting the hummus on the inside of their skins, then stitching the skin back on would technically work, I think. If it also needs to be "consumed", put it through the corpse-machine as outlined above first. I'm sure the consent is a non-issue; there's a plenitude of contract tricks that cold be used to make people agree to that, and plenty of potential incentives to give them.

It has to be much faster than eating the hummus.

/^{I wonder who would blink first, me or the Hummus Maker? What degree of atrocity would I need to suggest, in order to make it leave in horrified disgust? How precisely would it need to define the rules, before I give up and admit defeat? Remain to be seen.}/
