  If the game is capable of tailoring Amaryllis looks to MC brain, it is definitely capable to create Fenn in such a way, that she will like MC naturally.

"Naturally liking Juniper" and "never starting to like Juniper less" are two different things. The latter is much harder to implement without reality-warping, and it would likely result in either a horribly twisted human mind, or not /human/ mind at all. Can you imagine someone who always likes you at the exact same level, no matter what you do?

Good point point about the probabilistic nature of the kiss-related statement, though. It indeed said "there might even be a kiss", not "there will be".
