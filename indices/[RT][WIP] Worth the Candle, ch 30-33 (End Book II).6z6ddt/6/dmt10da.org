Ahaha. I suspected that the "kiss at the end" of this particular quest might have come from someone other than Amaryllis (it seemed like the kind of dickish thing the game layer likes to do), but for some reason it never actually occurred to me that it would be /Fenn/. On a more serious note: this indicates an absolutely insane amount of precognitive ability on the part of the game layer, which combined with the whole "Juniper Smith" thing pretty much shoots the dream-skewer hypothesis to dust.
