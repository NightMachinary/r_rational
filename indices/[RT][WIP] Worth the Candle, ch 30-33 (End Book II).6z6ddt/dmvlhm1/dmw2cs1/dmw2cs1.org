First level explanation is that there were surprisingly few personnel and especially grads in tower. There were no one to find out, or if somebody found out they were not motivated to investigate/raise alarm but prefer to run away. Second level explanation is that the Game Engine was influencing situation heavily.

That also was looking suspiciously like Game Engine shenanigan. Plot needed innocent victim, but protagonist managed at least not kill boy completely. "Intended outcome" seems was death of the boy or boy left to die so that protagonist had pangs of conscience later. As it was it was natural for protagonist completely forget the boy. There will be much more collateral damage later anyway. That was Watsonian explanation. Doylist explanation is that author probably forgot about boy.
