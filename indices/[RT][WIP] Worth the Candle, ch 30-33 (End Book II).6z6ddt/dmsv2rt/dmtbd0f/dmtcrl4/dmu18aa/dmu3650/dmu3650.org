Book I is chapters 1-14, Book II is chapters 15-33. If you're asking how many books there /will be/, then the answer is that I don't know, but probably not more than ten.

(I just counted out the planned arcs and it looks like there are about fifteen of them, but some will occupy a B-plot position, others will be only half a book, and some will inevitably get dropped when the story takes a turn, which will probably be balanced out by others coming into being.)
