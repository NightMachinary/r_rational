That's when Juniper learnt about her condition in the first place. And Bormann said she wasn't familiar with it, so they opted not to try and heal it right away (because she couldn't promise any results).

The next step would have been to find out more about the "rat rot" and whether it was curable within the resources available to them. So I'm surprised it wasn't mentioned again during the week Joon spent training. Unless I'm missing something?
