They come and go. If I had to recommend a few with game systems, I'd say [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/death-march-kara-hajimaru-isekai-kyusoukyoku/][Death March]], [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-death-mage-who-doesnt-want-a-fourth-time/][Death Mage]], [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/no-fatigue-24-jikan-tatakaeru-otoko-no-tenseitan/][No Fatigue]], [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/tensei-shitara-slime-datta-ken/][Slime Tensei]], and [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/manowa/][Manowa]] are generally pretty well translated and also not terribly written.

But that's based purely on my personal standards and preferences, so your mileage may vary greatly.
