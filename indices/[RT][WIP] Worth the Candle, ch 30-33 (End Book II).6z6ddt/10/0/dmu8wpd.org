My taste is somewhat questionable but I'll link some I've liked recently:

In this one Earth gets absorbed into a game system and due to being underground at the time the MC spawns in a dungeon leading to some powergamey stuff.

In this one the MC ends up in an abandoned inn and becomes an inn keeper in a magical world. Much less focused on power gaming than the other 2.

And finally in this one the MC and her class are killed by dimensional magic and then are reborn into a magical world, with MC spawning as a spider.
