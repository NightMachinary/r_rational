Interesting to think about what the best investments would be to fix Juniper's bones and Amaryllis' Ratrot... It seems obvious to me that getting Bone magic up can only help for both problems, so dumping 3 points into Kno to get it to 20 might be wise. On the flip side, that's a big investment for something that might not work.

Dropping all four points into Luk and hoping it influences things to start breaking a bit easier for the party as a result might be the best bet for a quick resolution, or else investing 2 into Men and 2 into Soc to try and engineer a solution... Tricky.
