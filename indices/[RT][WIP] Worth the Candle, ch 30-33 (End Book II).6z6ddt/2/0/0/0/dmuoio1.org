  But if the stats affect you directly, every point you dont use to get smarter is going to result in you missing things.

While ideally mental/social stuff is the best, adding physical attributes makes you directly harder to kill*, and all Joon /really/ needs is to buy time to get exp - as long as you don't minmax physical entirely, I think it makes the most sense to focus on inherent (i.e. can't be undercut by betrayal, e.g. stealing magic items (cough Aumann cough)) defense. And as a bonus, revision magic looks /super/ useful as a defensive tool, so you'd be dumping points in MEN anyway.

*Specifically, harder to kill in an ambush - i.e. when you /don't/ predict everything. By the same logic, luck is also super-important.
