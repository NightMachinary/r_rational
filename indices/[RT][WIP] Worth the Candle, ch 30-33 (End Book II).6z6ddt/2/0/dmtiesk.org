| Intimidation | 10    | INS     |           |
| Deception    | 8     | POI/??? |           |

Edit: Note that you can also draw some conclusions about what secondary attributes /aren't/, e.g. if Unarmed is capped at 18 then the secondary attribute can't be CHA or POI, since skills cap at five times the value of the secondary stat and that would be 10 for both CHA and POI. That information is known, but not included in this table.
