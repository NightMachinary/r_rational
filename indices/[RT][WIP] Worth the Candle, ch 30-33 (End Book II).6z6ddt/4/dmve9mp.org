And on the seventh day, cthuluraejepsen giveth four chapters at once. /cue chorus/

Ugh, the Aumann +showdown+ letdown. It's official: gold mages suck. I thought there was no way Aumann would fall for their obvious scavenger-hunt bait, being the schemer that he is - having outmaneuvered two gold mages, presumably through knowing his profession's weaknesses. I mean, gold suddenly springing up at conveniently remote locations (then disappearing in their dry runs)? Here hold my +beer+ idiot ball.

If it can't be ignored despite one's best rational efforts, the call of gold seems like a severe Achilles' heel. I imagine the few gold mages stronger than Aumann are all rabid prospectors twitching at every granny's gold tooth passing by.

  Wards are heavy, absolute velocity, blood and bone to stop us, but all three breakable in five minutes.

Warding is a surprisingly unreliable field. It's overpowered when you can set the field for an imminent confrontation against a non-warder, but amounts to a glorified delay tactic against a warder of equal or greater skill. At least this applies to Bessemer's temp wards. Not sure how Sheriot would have subverted the permanent wards at Caer Laga.

  I was wrapped in a golden glow, tinged with red this time, and it was like a goddess had taken my brain for my skull, trailing every yellow-white nerve from it, then stuck it into her mouth and ran her warm, sucking tongue along the tip of every nerve ending.

Lewdest level-up ever. Now I'm expecting a smut warning at level 20!
