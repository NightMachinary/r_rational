The way the elevator is handled is strange.

After the still mage is killed and the elevator boy presumably stabilized, the whole thing is effectively forgotten. This is very strange, as:

1) The elevator is full of arrows and blood. So the party would have to jam it on the 19th floor to avoid discovery. This is however still problematic, because somebody might come through the staircase to investigate the now non-functioning elevator. The staircase door to the floor is missing, a hallway full of blood is visible from there and the party does not have a line of sight to this location. This means that they can be discovered without them noticing that something is amiss. Neither the jamming of the elevator nor the staircase access is addressed in any way.

2) The elevator boy is apparently still there during the after-gold-mage-battle cleanup but neither his condition nor he himself is ever mentioned again.
