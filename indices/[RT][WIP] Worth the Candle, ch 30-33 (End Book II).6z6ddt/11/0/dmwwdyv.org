1) Security overall was weak and/or poorly designed in the tower. No one used the stairs, there were only two guards on the way to the top floor, guards flirting/reading books, the warder who was the pillar of the defense was located at the closest point of contact to a breach, there was no designated backup for the warder as a countermeasure to the obvious threat of a hostile warder (we don't know what other magics counter warding).

So lax security protocols and understaffed security as [[/u/serge_cell]] mentioned.

Also when there's one elevator to the penthouse, the penthouse is expected to have priority and one of their head honchos did just go up.

2) I expected the time they spent on healing the boy to come back to bite them. Besides the possibility that he may yet have background significance as the only survivor and witness to the assailants, not every minor character can be expected to be plot relevant.
