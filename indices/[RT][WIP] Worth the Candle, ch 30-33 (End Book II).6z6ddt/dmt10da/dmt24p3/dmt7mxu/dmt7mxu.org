No need for subtle reality-warping/precog. If the game is capable of tailoring Amaryllis looks to MC brain, it is definitely capable to create Fenn in such a way, that she will like MC naturally.

Plus, I think there were hints that Fenn likes MC. For example, Ch 19:

#+begin_quote
  I couldn't tell whether she had any actual interest in me or whether she was just having fun at my expense, or maybe both.
#+end_quote

So, the kiss was probable from the game POV, and it added "maybe kiss" to quest description.
