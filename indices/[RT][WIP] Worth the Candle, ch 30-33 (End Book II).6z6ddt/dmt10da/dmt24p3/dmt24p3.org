  I suspected that the "kiss at the end" of this particular quest might have come from someone other than Amaryllis

I'm still a little disappointed it wasn't Amaryllis kissing Fenn or something, as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6vcsdh/rt_worth_the_candle_chapter_23_siege/dm0djad/][someone]] in a previous thread speculated. That would have been hilarious.

  this indicates an absolutely insane amount of precognitive ability on the part of the game layer

I would bet on subtle reality-warping/probability-manipulation instead. We've seen, apparently, how it manipulated Fenn's mental state, so that it corresponded to her loyalty level. If it was working on precognition, what we should expect is Fenn and Juniper never ending up in a situation that would lead to her loyalty going down, not the game rewriting her mind --- which is exactly what happened, since Juniper's game-assisted model of her personality (as well as Fenn's own model of her own personality) strongly disagreed with Fenn's actual behaviour.

That said, it /could/ still be precognition --- a situation just special enough that Fenn exhibits model-surprising behaviour --- but the evidence are more indicative of reality-warping than precognition. Remember also Juniper's speculations about DM retconning these two girls he left to die in the Risen Lands into not being Amaryllis.

We're choosing between reality-warping + precognition, and reality-warping. Occam's Razor suggests the latter.
