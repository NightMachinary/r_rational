If you haven't read it yet, /Worth the Candle/ is a self-insert litRPG portal fantasy, but probably not as bad as what you pictured when you read that. If you want to start from the beginning, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][chapter 1 is here]] or [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249?view_full_work=true][read the whole thing in one page]] (but it's past 150K words, which is getting on the long side for a single sitting). If you want to stay up to date, get an account on Archive of Our Own and then click the subscribe button. Also maybe stay out of the comments unless you love spoilers?

Apologies for the delay, I've been sick the last few days, but am (mostly) better now. In four days I will have been writing this story for two months without a break, with an average daily word count of 2,607 words. Go me! Thanks to everyone who has read this story, recommended it in other places, or clicked any of the buttons that make the metrics go up.
