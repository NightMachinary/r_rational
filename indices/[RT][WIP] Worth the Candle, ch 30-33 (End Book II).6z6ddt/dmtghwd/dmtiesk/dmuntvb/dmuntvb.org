Clearly he needs to drop more points into mental/soc. Not the subskills, because unbalancing his reasoning ability is not a good idea, and also it would probably distort who he is more. But.. mental/soc. Because most of the magic runs on them, and being smarter is victory. Seriously, people in gamer setups going for physical hurts. Min-maxing a physical combatant when you are sitting at a table and can use your real life mental faculties to reason out a plot your int-3 barb could never ever follow is fine. But if the stats affect you directly, every point you dont use to get smarter is going to result in you missing things.
