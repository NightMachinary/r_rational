I guess I got suckered into it and can't stop now. If it was all bad I wouldn't read it. Especially the existential angst embedded in the power fantasy is very intriguing. As is the the quest for Arthur and Joons friendship with all its baggage and half-truths. I could go on but most of you will know about and agree on the high points. I'm just a bit worried to be strung along indefinitely, with no clear end in mind, retreading the same old until it's just about beating a dead horse to keep collecting patreon bucks. (No offense, Mr. Jepsen. ;) ) Like I said before this reminds me a lot of HPMOR and what that story desperately needed was an editor, or just a second pass and (a lot of) time. This isn't supposed to be me being snide, instead I spotted some hints of greatness and I think it could be a lot more.

I think the point you're making about whether criticism is earnest or well-intended and its effects on creators sharing their work is incredibly weird.
