I can kind of see where you are coming from here but I think it supports what we know of Amaryllis' character if you think about it a bit differently.

I think Amaryllis' response is supposed to be seen as overly in depth and more akin to a college professor speaking a formula than a lay explanation. Amaryllis has been thoroughly taught this information and is personally interested, given her usage of void weapons early in the story and the Void Beast being a known threat. It's realistic that she would say this, and that others wouldn't fully understand it. Even reading and rereading it I didn't expect the results we see later. This could also be an early part of Amaryllis "trying to be more useful" by using her knowledge and planning abilities as we see her do later.

I think this conversation was a fantastic moment of rational fiction. They didn't just blindly accept a new weapon and use it without understanding the capabilities as best they could. Just like soldiers given a new weapons system they checked how it should be used from someone experienced, with void weapons, before putting it to use. Especially in this case since there are concerns about friendly fire and minimum range.
