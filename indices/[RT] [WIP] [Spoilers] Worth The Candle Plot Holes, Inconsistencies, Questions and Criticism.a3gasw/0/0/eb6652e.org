Thanks for the word of god reply (and of course to the others). I actually found the relevant passage.

Not quite sure what you're referring to with the last paragraph but I assume it's an answer to my 'ramblings' accusation. To give a specific example: When Amaryllis autismed-out into specific calculations of void bombs during the void-arrow-in-prison-scene.

Since you're the author and you replied to me directly, I'll just ask away: Are word of god comments (on reddit) supposed to be canonical? How do you feel about close engagement with your readers AND revealing story/world-details outside of your text?
