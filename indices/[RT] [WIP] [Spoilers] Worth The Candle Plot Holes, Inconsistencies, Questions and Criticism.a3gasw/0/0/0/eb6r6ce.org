  Not quite sure what you're referring to with the last paragraph but I assume it's an answer to my 'ramblings' accusation.
#+end_quote

No, I'm just explaining that 1) I originally wrote a section that went over shelf-stability of unicorn blood, in contrast to typical RPG systems and tabletop assumptions that sacrifice realism for fun/ease, and 2) I cut that section because it felt too pointless and uninteresting, but this eventually leads to problems. In a non-serial work, or maybe if I just had more time to spend on editing, these issues would be more likely to disappear or be caught by beta readers.

  Are word of god comments (on reddit) supposed to be canonical? How do you feel about close engagement with your readers AND revealing story/world-details outside of your text?
#+end_quote

Word of god is only as canonical as you want it to be. I think there's a strong argument to be made that the text is the text, and everything else is up for debate. On the other hand, authors have to calibrate for different reader interests, and one of the most difficult to calibrate for is how much information readers want/need. There are sometimes details that 90% of the audience doesn't care about, but 10% of the audience gets bugged by because something gets glossed over, and that's one of the places where WoG comes in handy, because it's extra-textual material that doesn't clog up the main text (or more importantly, severely mess with flow).

I generally try not to give WoG, and where I can, I answer with direct in-text citations. If you WoG everything, then that leaves less room for discussion, and WoG can be hard to collate and track down, creating a barrier for readers.

(I also tend to not engage all that closely with the community for a lot of the same reasons. An author giving their interpretation of the characters is, IMO, somewhat poor form. Same for response to criticisms, though this somewhat varies depending on what the criticism in question is and whether it's fact based or opinion based.)
