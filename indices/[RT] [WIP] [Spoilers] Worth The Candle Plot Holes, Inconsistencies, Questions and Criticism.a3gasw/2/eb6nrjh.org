Is this the thread were we can point out inconsistencies in WtC? I found one but never pointed it out since I wasn't reading when it came out. In chapter 21:

  “Ya know,” said Fenn. “Elves can hold their breath for an hour. Guess I didn't get my dad's lungs. Also, let's never travel by glove again.”

But in chapter 62 Fenn gives Fallatehr, an elf, a breathing mask:

  “Fenn, you remember riding the rocket?” I asked as I stepped up beside her.

  “I remember it not going so great,” she said. “Actually, I remember it getting so fucked that you were racing across the desert and burning through your bones, which is what got us in this particular mess in the first place. Besides that, we don't have a rocket.”

  “You've got the sand bow,” I said. I glanced at the wall, which stood thirty feet high and at least a football field's length away from us. The shot would be simplicity itself for someone as skilled as Fenn.

  “You're nuts,” she said, but she gave me a grin. Her eyes quickly scanned the top of the wall, and I looked with her, to the places where she'd removed the gargoyles. We already knew, from the birds that Solace had sent over, that the laser gargoyles had been the primary means of keeping things from going over the wall. “Not enough masks though, and however great Mary is, I doubt that she can keep it up for long enough that we can make more.” We had made more of them during our week off in the bottle, so that we had five on hand, enough to cover the whole party, but assuming that we still needed to keep up our end of the bargain, that wasn't enough.

  I moved back over to Fallatehr. “We have to leave them behind,” I said, gesturing at the pelehr. “Non-negotiable.”

  “Convenient for you,” said Fallatehr, watching me closely. I agreed with him, it was very convenient for me, but that didn't make it any less true. Bad enough that we'd be taking him and three others, nearly even numbers except that the nonanima didn't count, but not releasing more of Fallatehr onto the world was a plus in my book, given what he could do. “Very well.”

  “Wait ten minutes before you try to get out, we'll pull you if it's clear,” I said. I wondered whether he would think it was a trap, because that's what I would have thought, but I was apparently bad enough at lying that it was an asset to me, because he nodded along.

  Fenn surprised me by stepping forward and handing him a breathing kit from her glove. I hadn't even heard her sneak up next to me. He took it for a moment with a mild questioning look, but he put it on all the same.

It is possible Fallatehr saw this as an opportunity to dispose surplus minions without it being obvious that this is what he was doing. But there is no way Fenn would forget that elves can hold their breath for an hour, they spent her childhood rubbing in how superior they are.

Though it's not a big deal regardless, the number of masks can be reduced by 1 and any elf minion that needs to die can be replaced with a non-elf minion.
