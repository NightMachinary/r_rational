  Yes there's some depth to it, but for every genuine character moment, clever subversion, interesting piece of world-building there's juvenile power fantasies, pseudo-rational ramblings lacking all literary merit and god-awful descriptions(sometimes!).

Why not just... not read it if you don't like it? The author is providing this story --which many of us like a great deal -- for free. Literally no one is forcing you to read something that you don't enjoy, and criticism of this type, no matter how earnest and well intended you might mean it as (and it's by no means clear that it actually is well intended), is far more effective at discouraging writers from sharing their work here than it is at helping improve anything.
