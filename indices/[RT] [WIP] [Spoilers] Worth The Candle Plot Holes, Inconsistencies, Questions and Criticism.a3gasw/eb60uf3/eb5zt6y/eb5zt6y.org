1) How would Unicorn blood even help? It cures any disease if you drink it, it does not refill your blood, I don't think that was ever implied. Fenn needed a transfusion.

2) Same thing, Unicorn blood doesn't cure being dead. And your other point - I don't remember the mood exactly, but there was stuff going on everyone had to concentrate on, there wasn't really time for mourning at all. It goes from her dieing to them fighting the prison to them "fighting" (Fallather? I don't remember the name, damn it) a soul-mage. There is never any time off to grieve.

Oh and for the record, I don't agree with "juvenile power fantasies, pseudo-rational ramblings lacking all literary merit and god-awful descriptions" at all. Not even sometimes.
