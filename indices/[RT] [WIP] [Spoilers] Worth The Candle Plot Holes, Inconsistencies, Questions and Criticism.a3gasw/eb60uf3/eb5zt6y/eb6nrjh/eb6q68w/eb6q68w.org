... okay, will fix. (I would rather that these just get PMed to [[/u/inked_cellist]], who will either fix them or pass them on to me if they're not easily fixed.)

WtC is 800K words long, with a whole bunch of stuff in it, and while I /usually/ catch minor continuity errors, it's being written pretty fast, and there's a ton of detail that doesn't always make it into my notes for later reference. So, I apologize for the occasional inconsistency, and will try to fix them if pointed out, but I have no editor.
