But ... why would unicorn blood help? It's established to cure physical diseases and reverse most bodily damage. The thing that's wrong with Fenn at that moment isn't one of those two things, it's blood loss. Unicorn blood hasn't been previously established to create more blood in the body.

I think perhaps there'd be some merit to Juniper saying something like this when facing the problem ... but mostly for this exact reason, which isn't terribly compelling to me.

And yes, there was a scene that featured a rant about how games abstract out materials and components as being atomic and without decay, but when I was writing it, it didn't really feel like it had a place to fit, so it became Word of God instead, eventually being canonized in (IIRC) ch 101.
