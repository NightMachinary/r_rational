Maybe my perspective is skewed by working around engineers, but bickering about math is /exactly/ the sort of thing that people I know do when they're dealing with immense amounts of stress.

As far as whether writing about calculations-- life-and-death calculations-- is good prose, I think this subreddit would err on the side of "shut up and multiply." (I think few readers of this subreddit would say /The Martian/ was characterized by bad prose, and life-and-death calculations figured prominently.)

For what it's worth, I don't think it's productive or civil to use stereotypes. It doesn't help you communicate clearly and it can reinforce harmful ideas.
