My point basically boils down to it being bad prose which is a shame because he can clearly write well. I used 'rambling' very loosely. This scene happens not soon after some pretty fucked up shit happens and while it does build some character, it completely took me out of the moment and destroyed any atmospheric build-up. Your mileage may vary. I'm not sure what Amaryllis' condition is but maybe she's on the autism spectrum, hence my use of a stereotype.
