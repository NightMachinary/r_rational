  To give a specific example: When Amaryllis autismed-out into specific calculations of void bombs during the void-arrow-in-prison-scene.

Is this what you're talking about?

  “If they're further than a foot away from each other, there's a cascade,” said Amaryllis. “Less than a foot, and the void effect just consumes the crystal with no effect. I've already done the math, we'll need significant distance and heavy mass for cover.”

  “Voiding whichever ones are within a foot of the spherical void wave, cascading to those outside it, putting a limit on total void effect, yes,” said Amaryllis.

  “No,” said Amaryllis, “Void propagation is constrained by the inverse square law, it'll eat through the same amount of mass at any distance, but for the projective form, that means if you conceptualize an inch-thick sphere around a projection at distance x which completely captures the void projection, then an inch-thick sphere at distance two x will only go through one fourth of an inch.”

  “So at two hundred feet, which is where the bow caps, that's ... a half-inch of steel per detonation, when up close?”

  “For projection, it's usually given as a half-inch steel or other sufficiently dense metal at five feet from the center of the void projection, regardless of crystal size, so long as it's under one foot,” Amaryllis nodded. “I told you that I already did the math.”

I'm not sure what "autisming out" means, but the section isn't terribly long, and IMO it shows a lot about Joon. My read on the scene was that he was upset they didn't tell him earlier, and wanted to give a reason for it, so he decided to construct the reason that he could help with the math, even though he didn't actually help.

Amaryllis indulges him, but I really don't think she's rambling as Joon is pretty much driving the conversation.
