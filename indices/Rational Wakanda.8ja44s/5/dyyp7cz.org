How much Panther Spirit are we putting into our Rational Wakanda?

Like, obviously the hand to hand leadership is dumb, so presumably that is a constraint imposed on us by the Spirit.

Heart Shaped Herb is similar, can we give super powers to any/everybody, or only those that the Spirit approves of as part of its arcane leadership tests?
