  And honestly, as Killmonger himself demonstrated in canon, Wakanda itself has an unrealistically unstable power structure. Hand-to-hand combat to decide the leader? Really? I understand trial by combat but are there any groups of people in the real world who appoint leaders by combat, save cliques of middle school boys who have watched too many movies about leaders being appointed by combat? Broke my suspension of disbelief at least. That would need to be entirely reworked immediately. It's also a blatantly contrived primitivism as an aesthetic literary choice.

The problem with the system is not Killmonger, who is a once in a century event. It's M'Baku.

The other tribes...you can explain it as them essentially being bribed off by the King.' It's an armistice. The king doesn't piss them off, and they don't try to kill him and he doesn't -if he wins- enact reprisals.

But the Jabari...it makes no sense. How is it possible that no king has gone to cater to the Jabari if they can literally kill his children at any challenge? There's no incentive for the Jabari to /ever/ avoid challenging for the throne. They have nothing to lose.
