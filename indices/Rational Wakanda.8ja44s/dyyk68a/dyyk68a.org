It depends on whether Wakanda's power is due mostly to superior tech level and an abundance of infrastructure and human capital, or mostly just due to the magic properties of vibranium, and also whether we're in the Marvel universe or just inserting black panther stuff into the real world.

The Heart-Shaped Herb is also very important as a source of mass produced superpowers, but realistically, in a rational Marvel Universe, superpowers and freaky tech would have already been mass produced by other peoples. So if it's really just the Vibranium, Wakanda is actually in a pretty precarious position.

And honestly, as Killmonger himself demonstrated in canon, Wakanda itself has an unrealistically unstable power structure. Hand-to-hand combat to decide the leader? Really? I understand /trial/ by combat but are there /any/ groups of people in the real world who appoint /leaders/ by combat, save cliques of middle school boys who have watched too many movies about leaders being appointed by combat? Broke /my/ suspension of disbelief at least. That would need to be entirely reworked immediately. It's also a blatantly contrived primitivism as an aesthetic literary choice.
