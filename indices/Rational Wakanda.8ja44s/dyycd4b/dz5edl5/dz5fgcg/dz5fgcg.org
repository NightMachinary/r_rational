That's an option, but I think leaving the current system in place until the next change of power isn't really a power grab, as Wakandan kings can already rule for life right now anyway (I believe Killmonger was the exception in that he was allowed to challenge the king during his reign, normally challengers get one shot at the coronation and that's it).
