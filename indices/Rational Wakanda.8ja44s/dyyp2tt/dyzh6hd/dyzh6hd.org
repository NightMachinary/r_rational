  Also depends on how much deep their tech advantage goes-is it just medical and vibranium-based, or is it across the board?

Have you /seen/ their nanotech suits? Nanotech on that level, even if its vibranium based, changes everything. Also apparently some form of direct neural interface system. ... (Heck forget vibranium, just use that nanotech for, well, everything. So broken.)

Stark still needs a trunk to deploy his suit from and AI/voice control/kinesthetic interfaces to control his tech, and uses that on a personalised 1-person basis. Wakanda can mass produce that stuff!
