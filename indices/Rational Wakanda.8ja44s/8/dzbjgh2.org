Since the Vibranium appears to be a substance in extremely limited quantities, at least relative to potential global demands, the immediate future thing for Wakanda to do would be to sell services.

Manufacturing and medical, at a minimum. Even if they aren't willing to export products containing a significant amount of vibranium, their ridiculous bullshit tech should be able to make export products that are almost as bullshit. And of course medical services, that alone would make their GDP one of a firstworld country in terms of hard currency.

I guess it is true that they don't need anything. They seem to be so advanced there is nothing anyone but Tony Stark or other rare, high tech characters in the MCU can offer. Oh, and Dr. Strange probably has all kinds of good stuff, but his organization's magic items do not appear to be mass producible, or something he can just share out even if they could be reproduced.

I guess the problem I have is that the whole concept of a tiny kingdom developing tech far more advanced than the rest of the earth, totally in secret...tech advances just don't happen that way. Except in comic books. But I guess in the MCU's alternate laws of physics, different slightly from our own in some ways with lots of extra stuff, that's just a normal thing.
