Right. The OP seems to be talking about how to act rationally given the premise of the film as it happened, but your take on the Panther Spirit is definitely cool from an AU perspective.

As to what expectations he might have carried into the ritual, that's a good question. I'm guessing he knew something about what the quest involves since he clearly researched enough to engineer a successful takeover of the kingdom. And he did believe that he was the rightful successor to the throne so it's not like he was expecting to be rejected by the test.
