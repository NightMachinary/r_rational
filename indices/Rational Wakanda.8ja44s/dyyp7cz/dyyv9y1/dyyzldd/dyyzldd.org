Killmonger's dad wouldn't have been incorporated into such a being though, so I don't think that scenario would adequately explain why K saw him during his own Herb Quest.

My guess is that the Quest doesn't involve any supernatural interactions with the dead at all; it just induces a hallucinogenic state in those who undergo it, and the things they see are guided by their expectations of what the ritual does.
