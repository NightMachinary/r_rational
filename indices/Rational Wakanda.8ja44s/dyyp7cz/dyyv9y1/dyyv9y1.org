Rational Spirit: The panther spirit came from the first King who was also a superhero whose power was that he could exist in a disembodies state and fuse with others. Each generation of King was taken away at the moment of death by the First King, all merging into a gestalt that grows greater and more knowledgeable over the years. The Herb Quest allows one to temporarily fuse with the spirit while still alive so that it can advise/judge the next King, although one with sufficient willpower van still resist.

Why isn't this thing in charge? Well, for one, it's rather forgotten a lot about mortality, which is why each King is advised primarily by the previous one. More importantly, it sees itself as an advisor, slowly educating and nudging it's descendants toward some great goal that requires it not to reveal it's existence to the world or universe as a whole until it's plan to save it's people can come to fruition.

The hand to hand combat is ritualized, serving more as a test for the King,one of many. There are tests of intelligence, skill, history, etc, and a prospective king must pass them all. Fighting is necessary to determine the physical hardiness of the King, his ability to survive the Vision Quest, and as his role as the Black Panther itself.
