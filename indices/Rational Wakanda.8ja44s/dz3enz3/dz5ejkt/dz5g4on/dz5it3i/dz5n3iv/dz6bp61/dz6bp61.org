The Jabari live in the mountains though. It's pretty cold up their place.

Funny thing: before going to Japan last summer, I did not realise just /how popular/ kimonos still are. A distinctly ancient style of clothing, they're now used for pretty much any fancy occasion, like parties or even visits to the temple. And of course new ones have modern, colourful patterns - the making updated with the time, but the cut is still the same as a very old fashioned article of clothing. Apparently, in South Korea, the traditional hanbok is undergoing a similar modern resurgence.

I think Wakanda may be similar to Japan in that sense. Modern but also still very attached to its traditional roots. The Jabari look... silly, true, but mostly because those costumes are just a hodgepodge of stereotypes, and not what would likely result from a natural evolution of old styles into modern ones. For a movie so worried of being anticolonialist, Black Panther surely has some very prejudiced ideas of what makes an African society African - aka funny clothes made with animal skins and tribal duels to the death. Either way, really, people should just wear what they want to. If I ruled a country where people enjoy going around their lives in Naruto cosplay, it'd be their call anyway. There's nothing rational about deciding that one style of clothes is superior to another outside of something like "layers of fur are better than a T-shirt and hot pants if you're walking in the middle of the Siberian tundra". Or clothing habits that can be outright unhealthy such as corsets.
