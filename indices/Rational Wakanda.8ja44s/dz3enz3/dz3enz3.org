You should only sell tech. China is doing this with Neodym (Is for powerful magnets important.)

1. Not reveal Wakanda (I love secrets too much). But start plans in case it gets revealed. (If you want to be rational, you should reveal it.)

2. Give my citizens fucking pants. And flying cars. I would only sell so much Vibranium (and only in tech) that they wouldn't develop an alternative to it. And I would talk with other countries before I reveal it. Starting with the ones, that already know about Wakanda. I would try to play it cool. Like pretending Wakanda was always there, and always that powerful. I wouldn't give a press conference.

With more influence because of Vibranium sales and healing +magic+ tech, I would try to stabilize other countries (starting nearest to Wakanda) and uplift them. At the same time giving my military time and oportunity to adapt to modern warfare. I would try to start an African Union (Wakanda is in Africa?), to get more influence.

I assumed T'Challa wants the best for his country and not fuck over other countries, maybe benefiting them.

But anyone else sees a problem with telling afro-american kids they should identify with a foreign king who hides healing +magic+ tech and other techs from their country and plans to leave the USA to go to Africa. Euro-American kids get Captain America. (And spiderman, ironman, dr strange, +hawkeye+, blackwidow, antman,...)

okay I know black panther was made in the 60s and then [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-to-Africa_movement][the back-to-Africa-movement]] was popular among African-Americans (so BP wasn't in mean spirit). But still, I think that BP is very dubious. Still better than 6 of the 8 new spiderman movies.
