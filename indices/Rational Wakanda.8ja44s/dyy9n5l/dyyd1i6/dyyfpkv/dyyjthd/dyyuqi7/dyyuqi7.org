To be fair, they weren't. The leader wasn't chosen that way, that was merely a method of determining succession when it was contested by viable challengers. For thousands of years this wasn't a problem.

It was only a problem when an heir was born in another countr and had never been raised by Wakanda.

If anything, the succession fight stops potentially years of argument within the legislature equivalent and in most cases was easily resolved. The problem isn't their laws on succession, the problem is their laws on CITIZENSHIP.
