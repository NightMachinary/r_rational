  I would not open up tourism, and it seemed like Wakanda already had open borders to their citizens. That'd be too much to fast, or limited to elitism, etc.

Frankly, unless you need really cheap labor opening one's borders seems like a horrible idea, given their geographic position.

  The military doesn't have to go. We see them capable of extremely effective surgical strikes, and we see a host of technology that would be extremely capable at national defense. The civil battle, given how close the various groups ere, seems reasonable to assume was "ritualistic". In other words, they weren't actually fighting to kill each other - the people who were were Killmonger and BP, and the aerial battle. In both of those cases powerful weapons were deployed without restriction.

Infinity War basically establishes that it wasn't a "counting coup" situation; the military is as horrible as it looks.
