Strictly speaking, I don't think he does reveal Wakanda. He just says "we're gonna start doing shit now", and then starts doing it (Oakland).

I'd do the same thing, seems reasonable. "There's changes I'd like to see in the world. I'm going to start making them".

In terms of changes to Wakanda, we don't actually know enough about them to say. We know what virbanium mining looks like (sortof), but not what any of their manufacturing or media, or software, or financial institutions look like.

It seems very reasonable that they have a substantial ability to interface with the rest of the world's economic system, and that they've had that capability for a long time, it's just that now they're starting to exercise it.

I would not open up tourism, and it seemed like Wakanda already had open borders to their citizens. That'd be too much to fast, or limited to elitism, etc.

Instead, I would seriously consider a trade city. Start a place specifically for the blending of cultures.

It doesn't seem like Wakanda needs to leverage vibranium to meet any of their goals, although maybe there are ecological or space-related goals that would make sense. Key bit here is that Wakanda doesn't seem to need anything from the rest of the world (at least, not that it can't already get), so it really gets to make free choices about what, and when, and how to get involved.

The military doesn't have to go. We see them capable of extremely effective surgical strikes, and we see a host of technology that would be extremely capable at national defense. The civil battle, given how close the various groups ere, seems reasonable to assume was "ritualistic". In other words, they weren't actually fighting to kill each other - the people who were were Killmonger and BP, and the aerial battle. In both of those cases powerful weapons were deployed without restriction.

In other words, again, it seems like their military suits /their/ purposes just fine.
