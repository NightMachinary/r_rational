It definitely makes sense to reveal Wakanda to the world, with everything that is happening in the MCU world it is pretty much inevitable that Wakanda gets revealed sooner rather than later (even before IW), better to get out in front of it.

I'd focus on steering the world into a post-scarcity future. Technology wise, the MCU is pretty close already, so start big education project all over the planet and offer scholarships to every future Tony Stark and Peter Parker on the planet (especially those that don't have the means to go to existing centers of research) to come to Wakandan universities to learn about all the bullshit that vibranium tech is capable of. Aside from that, I'd keep your borders mostly closed to outsiders initially. Wakanda has a very xenophobic past and it takes time for a society to shake off that kind of history.

Meanwhile, use outreach programs and economic incentives as well as your considerable network of covert intelligence agents to get your neighboring countries to modernize and reform both economically and sociologically. At the world stage, make sure you are seen as 'one of the good guys': stick to climate accords, help with international crisis, contribute to boycotting countries that are being assholes, etc. In addition to just being generically helpful to the world that sort of behavior keeps popular opinion on your side and makes it harder for other world leaders to interfere with your plans and gets you some moral high ground to push other countries around.

As for changes I'd make before revealing Wakanda, if at all feasible I'd get rid of the ritual combat portion of electing a new leader and separate the role of Black Panther from the role of king, though I'd want to do that regardless of whether or not Wakanda gets revealed to the world. Combat prowess does not correlate very well with leadership ability (as we've seen with Killmonger) and the requirements for being a good Black Panther are different from the requirements of being a good king. Moving to democracy too quickly is also dangerous though, especially during a period of rapid reforms, so maybe put something in place that means Wakanda moves to some kind of democracy during the next transfer of power (ie. your death or abdication), that gives you plenty of time to sort things out and prevents another killmonger from messing things up.
