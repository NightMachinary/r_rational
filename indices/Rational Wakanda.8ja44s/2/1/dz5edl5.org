  As for changes I'd make before revealing Wakanda, if at all feasible I'd get rid of the ritual combat portion of electing a new leader and separate the role of Black Panther from the role of king

Politically speaking that could only work one way: T'Challa keeping the title of Black Panther but stepping down as king, possibly in Shuri's favour. Otherwise it'll be perceived as a power grab.
