A bit, yes, but the US president doesn't operate as an absolute monarch and you can use the fact that public support for the system will be at an all time low given what Killmonger just did.

Also (as a complete outsider to us politics) I suspect that if a US president did come out strongly against the electoral college, they could get a long way towards changing things.
