Depends on if their military is based on what we've seen, or if that was mostly ritual combat-a phalanx is a TERRIBLE idea versus fighting in entrenched positions, let alone the lack of artillery and air support. Also depends on how much deep their tech advantage goes-is it just medical and vibranium-based, or is it across the board?

Generically, I'd reveal Wakanda to the world, but have limited interaction for the next generation.

For the rest of the world: Make a deal for vibranium-based energy production, in exchange for an international agreement to either not use vibranium weapons, or starkly limit their use (accepting that everyone that gets some is just going to use it for a futuretech division, and setting your goal as "not being the world's arms dealers"). Leverage that soft power into uplifting the rest of the world-educational outreach, incentives and penalties to encourage stability and growth, aggressively invest in the communities you want to see grow, etc.

For Wakanda: Find out if the heart-shaped herb is actually gone, or can be resurrected/cloned/found somewhere in the forests/etc. Encourage Wakandans to go out and see the world, and discuss how they would like to change your system of government so that someone like Killmonger can't murder his way to tyranny. Good news is you have an heir and a spare that are pretty sane, so you have some time to talk it over. Maybe have the chieftains eligible for the throne be approved/disapproved by their tribes? Maybe have a system in place where a king is overthrown by the ruling of a majority of the governed? Wakanda is small enough to not need THAT much changing in the immediate future, but the time to discuss how you want to adapt to being in a bigger world is NOW, to prepare for the eventuality.
