having 100% of a plant essential to national security in a single chamber when that plant is also highly vulnerable to fire... seems unreasonable.

My first thought was of a data center where someone shouts "burn it all" and does but doens't even consider that there might be off-site backups.

For the herb that would mean secure seed banks around the country with samples.
