Oh, they definitely can do that. Or maybe they'll just stumble upon some more growing in a random cave somewhere.

But even in that case they should still /seize the opportunity/ presented by the (possibly-temporary) absence of the plant to change the rules of succession anyway. Any die-hard traditionalists would probably be upset by the change, but if they believe the ritual is no longer physically possible then they're more open to begrudgingly accepting a new set of rules. Plus there's the whole "barely avoiding a hostile takeover of the kingdom by someone who's basically an outsider" thing that would already be swaying many opinions.

Then if the wakadans one day discover or otherwise acquire more of the plant at some point, maybe they can just keep that under wraps until the necessary changes are made. Then at some point in the future they'll be like "oh I guess we have more of it after all lol" but by then it will be too late to reinstate the old rite of succession.
