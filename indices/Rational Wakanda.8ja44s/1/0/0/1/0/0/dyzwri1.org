I mean...that's just not true. It's a problem right in the movie, in the first challenge.

That's the problem: it's not that the challenge system is necessarily disastrous (though it's really not good); it could function as a check on a king's dynasty and a way to force him to take the interests of each tribe into account. Unless the King is horrible you don't want to try to kill him and run the risk of reprisals and he doesn't want to piss you off enough to make you want to do it.

The problem is the Jabari. They have /no/ stake in the system. And, as we saw, this led to them challenging for the throne. You can't have a system like that /and/ a pissed off minority that's totally willing to be pissing outside your tent or fucking with your apple cart constantly.
