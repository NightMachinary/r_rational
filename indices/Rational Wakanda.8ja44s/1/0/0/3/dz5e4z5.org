Their entire well-being is founded upon mining, refining, and using in the most creative way an alien metal. By all means, they should venerate knowledge, and choose the greatest scientist of the country as their leader. It makes no sense that they have that kind of social structure with /that/ kind of economy and history. It was just a way to make them feel "more African". Law of the strongest holds when physical strength rules the land and is the driver of the economy. Hunter gatherers do that. Technological societies, not so much.
