I nearly dropped this story when the Olivander just casually obliviated her. If I was in that situation, I'd probably obsessively make backups and precommit to treating anyone who messes with my mind without permission as an enemy. But Hermione is not even aware of this type of attack and thus cannot hope to detect it.

Somehow I find myself hoping that whatever precious 'destiny' awaits her, Hermione will say "deal with your shit by your damn selves, you mindraping bastards" and do something more productive with her time.
