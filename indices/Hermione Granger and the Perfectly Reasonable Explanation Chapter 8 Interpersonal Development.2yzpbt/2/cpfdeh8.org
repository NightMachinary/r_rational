Canon!Hermione was always a little too overzealous for me to really like, but almost every fanon version of her toned that down. I mean I sure was smart enough at 12 to realize that people don't like it when you stand out too much.

This fic definitely covers that feeling, even if Hermione has read Carnegie. Sure the science stuff is going well too, but the emotional notes pull me in.

(once tried to read a realistic!abused!Harry fic, but he seemed so realistic that I couldn't much empathize. Although he was totally reading ahead and stuff, he just wasn't enjoyable for me to read.)
