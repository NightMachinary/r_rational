And I do not condemn use of this spell when it is used with consent or as an emergency medical procedure. But casually erasing valuable information from someone's mind just because you feel like it? That's too much. I didn't get the feeling that Hermione knowing about her 'destiny' would present some catastrophic risk to someone, rather Olivander just felt it would be more proper for the heroine to not know this for some reason.
