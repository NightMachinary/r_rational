Ollivander in canon is mysterious to the point of being counter-productive...this is more of the same, only in reaction to a couple of my "tweaks".

Hermione /has/ heard of Obliviation, but only in the context of Official Authority using it on muggles For Their Own Good...she's had no reason at all to imagine it would be used on her. When she does run into reasons to start actively questioning that sort of thing, she will definitely develop strong opinions on the ethics involved.
