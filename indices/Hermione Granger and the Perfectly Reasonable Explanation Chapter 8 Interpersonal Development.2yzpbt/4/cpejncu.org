Robin.Drew,

Brilliant writing. I love the clean and smooth prose and the subtle rationalist spin so far (subtle when compared with HPMOR's aggressively overt rationalism, that is).

Please keep them coming as fast as you can. Hermione is by far my favorite character in canon, so I'm eagerly awaiting the next installments!
