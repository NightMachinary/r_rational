Also, I recommend Blindness, another HP fan fic.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness]]

It's really fantastic, which has rationalist and non-rationalist characteristics, but is really quite engrossing and well written.

And I am very much looking forward to more Hermione. Selfishly speaking, a loose writing schedule would really be appreciated, but certainly do take your time; your writing is quality.
