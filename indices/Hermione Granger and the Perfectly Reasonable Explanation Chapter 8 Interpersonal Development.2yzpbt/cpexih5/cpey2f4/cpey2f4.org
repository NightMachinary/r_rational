I am not as harsh in my views of hpmor, but I do agree that I'm hoping this will remain what hpmor /seemed/ to be at the start, but ultimately kindof /stopped/ being, namely, a rational exploration of magic in the potterverse - after a point, fairly early on, hpmor became more of a treatise on rational philosophy in general, and spent shockingly little time actually applying said philosophy to magic, or further exploring or developing on any underlying system of rules for it.
