I'm trying /not/ to be derivative of HPMOR, but I was definitely inspired by its example. One handicap for HPMOR I think was that if you do a true scientific investigation of magic, you run into one (or more) of three typical side-effects:

1. The implication that most canon Witches and Wizards are and have been incurious simpletons.\\
2. Realistic scientific research (with rigor) usually requires a lot of time and effort.
3. The number of exploitable situations in canon is large to begin with, and adding scientific underpinnings and meta-magic will only make a protagonist OP that much more quickly.

1 can be fun in small doses, but begins to drag on if repeated. 2 would tend to require big and/or frequent time-skips, or an unrealistic portrayal. 3 wasn't in EY's interests, he wanted /rationality/ to be the superpower, not science in itself. I have notions for getting around 2, and I don't have the same problem with 3, so expect my Hermione to eventually start figuring things out and shaking things up, assuming she doesn't get killed first. :)
