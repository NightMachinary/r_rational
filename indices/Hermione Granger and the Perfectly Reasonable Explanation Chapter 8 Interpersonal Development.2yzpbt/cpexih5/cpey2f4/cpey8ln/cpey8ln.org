Yeah, that's almost exactly my thinking.

Just to clarify, I didn't mean it like HPMOR is something /bad/ to be compared with, just in general sense that an author may be offended that their work is compared to something else, maybe implying that they're derivative. It's just great to see a story that has a promise to become something that HPMOR might have been.
