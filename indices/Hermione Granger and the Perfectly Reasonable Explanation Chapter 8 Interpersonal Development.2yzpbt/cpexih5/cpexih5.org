I like this fic very much thus far. Hermione is the most identifiable character in canon for me, who I felt was taken for granted and didn't get a proper appreciation, neither from characters nor the narrative. She was dumped with Ron for Merlin's sake! So it's nice to see her in the center of a rational narrative.

Also I have a great hope about exploration of the idea "science and reason meet wizards". Especially since HPMOR kind of dropped the idea closer to the end.

I wouldn't want to offend the author by comparing the fic with HPMOR, but my current hope for it is to become second and better iteration of "rational Harry Potter".
