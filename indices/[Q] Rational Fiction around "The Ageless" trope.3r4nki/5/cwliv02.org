"The Man from Earth" film is the most rational one I can think of.

Forever annoyed me too he does not seem depressed and miserable so why does he keep looking for ways to die it does not make sense. The you must remain celibate if immortal trope is annoying also sure you will outlive your mate and children if its not inheritable but you will get over it most other people do probably marry again and again.
