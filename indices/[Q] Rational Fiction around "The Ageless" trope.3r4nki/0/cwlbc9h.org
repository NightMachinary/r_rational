In The Sandman, there is a normal guy called Hob Gadling who does not die, because of a bet between the god of Death and the god of Dreams. He becomes a good friend of Dream.

He only appears in one chapter (I think? Haven't finished reading yet) but I thought it was a very good story because he didn't turn into a whiny emo "bored with life" kind of character I was expecting.
