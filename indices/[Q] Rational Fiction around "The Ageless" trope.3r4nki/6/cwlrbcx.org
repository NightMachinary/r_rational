I want to second the Sandman example. It's probably the best instance of what you're looking for. It comes from The Sandman issue #13: Men of Good Fortune.

Also, while the above issue is the best example, the whole The Sandman series qualifies, as it's main cast consists of immortal, yet flawed, characters.
