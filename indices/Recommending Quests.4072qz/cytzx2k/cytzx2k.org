Panopticon - old world of darkness Technocracy quest. Great writing, mastery of the setting and mechanics, and just all around a good time. Votes are also weighted by the characters personality (so, something the character would be unlikely to do might be a .5 * number of votes, while something they're very inclined to do might be a 2* votes) which I find to be a good design decision.

The various Sage quests are all fairly long, good rides, and fairly heavy on the feels in places.

CORE: Control the head of a government sponsored anti-supernatural task squad, basically.

Deathworld: Control a person on Earth after it faces two existential crisis (and both of them are still active on the planet.) Mutations, psychic powers, aliens, etc.

What do little dragons dream of: Control Zhang. A simple, humble farmer.

Lastly, the Konamikode quests, which I don't have easy access to the links for. He's a great writer, and he has mastery of the feels. Unfortunately he also has the attention span of a butterfly or some other metaphore that makes more sense.

Two works I'd highly recommend of his: A Dragonball C2K quest following Bulma, and a MGS5 / Valkyria Chronicles (Big Boss, an extremely beat up base, and some NPCs / troops get dropped in VC just before the first game starts).

I hear he's doing stuff on QQ now, but I haven't looked into it at all.
