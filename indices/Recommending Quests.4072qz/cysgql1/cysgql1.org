Polyhistor has been mentioned, but if you haven't read it I want to recommend it again.

Also on QQ, I started running a quest earlier this week, called the City of Ruin. It may or may not be your cup of tea: It's about a group of (former) slaves with suspiciously complimentary skill sets who wake up outside a big scary ruin city in the middle of a desert. Imagine somewhere in between Evil Hogwarts and Moria. There are only two chapters out, with a third coming tomorrow.
