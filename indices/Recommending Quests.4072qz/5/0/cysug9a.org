That's totally true, but when I first started saving links to the interesting threads, it was only two or three stories which were updating once in a blue moon. By the time I noticed how many I was keeping track of.....well it can take a disaster to notice what one has.

But I'm not too worried, a lot of what I was forgetting has been mentioned by people here by now.
