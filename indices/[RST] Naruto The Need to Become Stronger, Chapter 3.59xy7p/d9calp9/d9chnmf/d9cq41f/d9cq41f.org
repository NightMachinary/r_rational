I disagree with most of your statements. There are some plot holes near the end that were poorly foreshadowed, like kaguya and zetsu, but overall I thought the series held together pretty well. There's a Naruto reread thread on spacebattles that shows how much of the criticism of the show is, actually, quite wrong. I recommend check it out, or rereading the manga yourself.

I'm also not sure why you think no one had character development except Sasuke. Counter examples: Naruto, Sakura, 'Hinata to some degree, Gaara. All changes from part 1 to part 2 and changed even more during the end of part 2.
