Just read your first chapter.

In order as I read:

-the comical ineptness and malice Iruka shows towards Naruto reeks of bad fanon. I think you try to justify it through the "foul chakra" reference, that Naruto somehow makes people angry at him, but I still don't think its a good plot point.

-Your Sasuke is completely different from canon, in the worst way possible. Who says this: "“You see, Sakura,” Sasuke continued,

“What you just saw was no duel. This boy attacked me, the last member of the noblest clan of the greatest country, while my back was turned.” He slammed his foot onto Naruto's left shoulder and repeated the procedure of before. “A crime that, I think you'll agree, should not go unpunished.”"

-And this: "“... and honestly, you're lucky you got off so lightly,” Sakura continued unabated. “I mean: Once Sasuke comes of age he'll be the Lord Uchiha, and you attacked him out of petty spite. They could have executed you, for that!”"

-Really?! You're going with an interpretation of clans that has 0 basis in canon and basically does nothing but make your fic dark and Sasuke comically evil.

-"The Inuzuka were half-feral themselves: They acted almost entirely on instinct, and challenging the alpha was both first and second nature to them. If this new teacher did not prove himself somehow, there would not be much done in the way of teaching before the final academy exams arrived."

-sounds weird as hell. I guess your ninjas very inhuman in mindset, which sounds... interesting, but ripe with potential for characters that are hard to sympathize with.

Chapter 2 Comments:

-"“Oh, it's just you. For a moment there I thought you were Ino, or better yet, Sasuke come at last to profess his undying love for me.”" --No one talks like this in real life. or like this:

"“This isn't one of those stupid tricks where you're pretending to ask for help with your exams, but really you're just trying to get close to me, until one day I let down my guard and in a moment of weakness allow you into my heart, is it?”"

Your descriptive writing is actually quite good, though a little overdone and lengthy. We don't need 3 paragraphs on Sakura's pink room-- one would be enough.

"Sakura's mother looked over her shoulder with a benign smile even as she was pushed out the door by her daughter. “So is that your new boyfriend? Whatever happened to that noble Uchiha boy? This one looks kind of cute too, in a dopey sort of way..."--I've never met any parent in my who is that obvious;y clueless. You're overdoing it here again.

Random comment:

-Not sure if you're trying to stick to canon, but FYI your interpretation of the substitution technique is not a canon one. In canon, substitution is high speed movement + distraction object, and its generally used when the ninja using it is substantially faster than the ninja its used against. So its a lot less useful than people think. Its not really a 'switch'-- its more "I run really fast, grab something, run back, leave it where I was, hide, and use the momentary distraction to attack from somewhere else."

-Another deviation from canon: In canon, transformations are completely physical. See: Naruto being thrown as a shuriken, Kiba and Akamaru doing a combo transformation, Naruto and Gamabunta doing a combo transformation, etc. They're just usually not that strong, so they're useful for hiding and deception but not for hitting someone. So "physical illusions like the transformation or clone technique must work by bending light as well" is not canon at all.

-Your mizuki knows far too much for a random chuunin, or really, for anyone who isn't part of the Hyuga clan.

"There was a polite cough behind him. “I'm afraid Hinata-sama's mother died from her illness a few years ago. I believe the two of them were quite close... it can't have been easy for her, growing up in that household with only her lord father and his servants to raise her"

"Though based on the rumours going around, it seems like her younger sister might replace her for that position, regardless. I'm afraid one simply cannot be the heir to Konoha's greatest remaining clan without also being a great ninja in one's own right. The clan would never accept it.”"

That's the kind of info Neji knows, Hiashi knows, Hinata knows, and the elders of the Hyuga know, but why would anyone else? That kind of stuff would be kept secret.

K, so it might sound like I hate your fic. But I don't. I'm just being super critical because I think that your writing is very technically strong (MUCH better than your prologue, IMO) but your characters and minor worldbuilding details could use work.

I'll be awaiting more updates, and good luck :)
