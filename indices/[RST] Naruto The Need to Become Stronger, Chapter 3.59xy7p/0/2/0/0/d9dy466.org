In defence of Tracers' claims:\\
1) Naruto IS typical shonen, but that's also why it's so popular as an intro to anime.\\
2) Characters do have development, but most only have the extremely lazy "start out bad, then turn good" character arc. Look at Neji: Starts out as promising character, then is turned into a Naruto fan through the power of face-punching, then... nothing.\\
3) The world domination plot is indeed idiotic: The moment Madara actually TRIED he succeeded in capturing all 9 beasts in a matter of minutes, yet he makes his plot that convoluted?. Throughout the whole story the main villain, who was unkillable and could teleport anywhere instantly, took 16 years to do... nothing.\\
4) Power use is often clever and interesting, but they are also forgotten or invented as the plot demands.

I love Naruto for the setting, the great fights and of course magic ninjas, but it certainly does have big weaknesses!
