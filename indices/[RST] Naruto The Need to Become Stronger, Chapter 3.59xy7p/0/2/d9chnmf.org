Canon of that show is pants-on-head retarded. It embraces all the worst shonen anime tropes with a zeal I've not seen before or since. One character with any development, (Sasuke, and he has a shitty character arc) a nonsenical world domination plot that relies on the power of narrative causality, ignoring whatever in-universe rules previously detailed so the MC can power up with power of FRIENDSHIP/DREAMS, and plot holes the size goddamned Hummers. Attempts to make the story a bit less dumb are commendable.
