Transformation is not game breaking at all.

1. Breaks easily unless you have a special technique like a combo technique like Kiba and Akamaru or Naruto and Gamabunta. Those special combination techniques seem to relatively limited in usefulness or costly (Kiba doesn't use his 3 headed wolf thing all the tone-- it's a finishing technique.)

2. Ninja fights involve lots of physical impact, so if something breaks easily, and it hits an enemy that can withstand being punched into solid rock, take down giant bears, jump 30 feet at minimum (all part 1 Sasuke feats) then that technique isn't useful for anything except stealth. And in fact, thats what it's used for. Naruto, probably the most skilled user of it, uses it to trick enemies until he can deliver a finishing blow. Ways to counter: passwords, code words (ala Chunin exams).

So I don't see how it's game breaking.

You're right about inconsistency of substitution, but those uses are very rare and it's generally only used against opponents that are much slower than the ninja using the substituon-- Kakashi vs the demon brothers, orochimaru vs Sasuke in the Chunin exams, etc. All ninja can escape from restraints pretty easily-- see Sasuke escapinf Naruto tying him up in early canon. So it's not inconceivable for someone to quickly untie themselves and substitute to trick an enemy.

Re: clones

The academy technique is illusory but every other clone tech uses is solid in some way.

Re: shadow clones

They have varying levels of durability. Early Naruto shadow clones break easily. End game Naruto shadow clones (in fight against kaguya and against Sasuke) survive immense damage. Seems to be a matter of number of clones made and the skill of the user.

Re: writing

The prologue felt very stylized, like faux!mythic, and while that style can be good, it's usually overdone. IMO you're a great writer when you stick to the regular style, but it's hard for anyone to write a long scene with mythic style.

Re: Sasuke

Canon!Sasuke, until the Kage Summit arc, is very sympathetic. He's honorable, brave, never needlessly kills someone, but also kind of a sarcastic jerk sometimes. Here he comes across as a pretentious jerk who relies on his clan name for respect. Very few good qualities. In canon he isn't interested in social domination or respect. Here he loves it. Completely opposite characters.
