  the comical ineptness and malice Iruka shows towards Naruto reeks of bad fanon
#+end_quote

That surprises me: I remember fanon being that everyone in the village is evil and wants to kill Naruto for no reason, except Iruka and the Third who are the only good ones.

In canon Iruka was always a bit of a prat, screaming at his students whenever they did not obey him. He only became nicer to Naruto after Naruto brought up his parents, and since that did not happen here...

I agree that the chakra thing is a bit of a weak plotpoint though.

  Your Sasuke is completely different from canon, in the worst way possible
#+end_quote

This might be a case of YMMV. Everyone who comments keeps saying things like "X is bad, Y is good!" while forgetting that there are others who say the exact opposite. Remember, canon Sasuke was just as divisive amongst the fanbase.

I'll tone Sasuke down a little, as well as the reference to the Inuzuka.

  In canon, substitution is high speed movement + distraction object
#+end_quote

I'm aware of the original explanation given by Sakura, but Kishi completely contradicts this when characters use it to teleport out of their restraints (Sasuke vs Kakashi, Pain vs Jiraiya...) So I have to make it consistent somehow.

Given that both replacement and body-flicker are described as involving high speed movement, I think my interpretation is reasonable.

#+begin_quote
  In canon, transformations are completely physical.
#+end_quote

Kinda true (It's actually more like a shadowclone 'shell' around the user that breaks when damaged), but the problem with this is that such a power is completely gamebreaking, and it's never explained what the limitations of such a power would be. As such I elected to nerf it to prevent it from dominating the story.

Considering that regular clones definitely /are/ purely illusory, again I think it makes sense to say that the two techniques work in more or less the same way.

  Your mizuki knows far too much for a random chuunin
#+end_quote

Ah, but this is rational!Mizuki, and I bet someone like Kabuto would know at least as much.

#+begin_quote
  I'm just being super critical because I think that your writing is very technically strong (MUCH better than your prologue, IMO)
#+end_quote

Cheers! Again though, it's surprising to read this because I have had at least one author that I respect tell me that the prologue is much better written than chapters 1-3!
