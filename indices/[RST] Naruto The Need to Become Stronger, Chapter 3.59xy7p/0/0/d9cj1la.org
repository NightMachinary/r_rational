Tips for becoming better at dialogue:

1) Write a script and ask people to or act it out yourself.

2) Open a novel and read the dialogue.

3) Have a fast-paced IM conversation with someone.

- “Oh, it's just you. For a moment there I thought you were Ino, or better yet, Sasuke come at last to profess his undying love for me.”

Would turn into (not correcting for character since I don't know who's speaking):

“Oh, it's just you. For a moment there I thought you were Ino--"

"Piss off."

"... or better yet, Sasuke come at last to profess his undying love for me.”

"You really talk like that, don't you? Huh."

4) Do or watch long-form improv.

5) Read a script written by Aaron Sorkin, then the script for The King's Speech. Which is more real?

6) Read whatever is the current best faithful, non-modernized translation of The Tale of Genji or Snow Country to get a feel for Japanese dialogue translated well, if you're trying to account for the Japanese background of Naruto. Anime dialogue isn't very good, generally, instead depending upon style and voice acting skill. Most people can't speak as eloquently as Japanese voice actors, so anime is a poor representation of human vocal intercourse. Hence the novel suggestions.
