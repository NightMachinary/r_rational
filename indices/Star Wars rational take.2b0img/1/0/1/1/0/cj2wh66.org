Yes and no.

Being a celebrity of any kind quickly becomes exceptionally annoying to most people. It might be exciting and ego-boosting at first, but over most people's reactions become more bothersome. (This, of course, depends on the person, I'm just talking about the average.)

Basically, your reputation usurps your status as a living breathing person.

I would treat the dignitary with respect, maybe buy them a beer or such as a gesture of thanks, but for their sake I would try to restrain myself from actions designed to make me happy but which would just be aggravating to them.

edit: of course, in the event that the person has expressed a desire for such, I would happily do it.
