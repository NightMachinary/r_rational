IDK Eliezer, midichlorians have been researched too thoroughly by the likes of Darth Plagueis to be thrown out here. While I'm planning on writing a rational Star Wars fic, it is also a fic for EU lovers, and one of the bases I'm working on here is that /everything/ is canon.

But I can think of many reductionist explanations for the Force (although the non-nitwittiness is up for debate), particularly if one considers midichlorians to be a symptom of Force sensitivity and not a causal factor (as Force-sensitive symbionts, as suggested above), or perhaps as wet nanotech used for FTL signalling to a central "Force Source." Throw in the Celestials, which are clearly transsapient AI with dubious Friendliness, and who are often linked to the concept of the origin of the Force as an artificial construct in hints throughout certain EU work, and a picture begins to form... One that of course I wouldn't reveal here since after all explaining the Force is a thread that keeps the entire story together. ;)
