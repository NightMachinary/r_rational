Interpret facts in a certain way, perhaps, but as one of those guys who's spent far too much of his time on certain forums making sense of every tidbit of inconvenient canon, it'd be a shame for all that effort to go to waste in outright rejection!

And indeed my explanation of Darth Plagueis' midi-chlorian manipulation does fall somewhat along those lines (although the fact he is manipulating the midi-chlorians is cemented in Star Wars: Darth Plagueis and I'm not willing to treat the narrator as unreliable otherwise I might as well ignore canon entirely). Indeed, as there won't be any afterlife in this fic, it wouldn't be the first time in this fic's universe where Force users make errors in interpreting their powers, with Force ghosting from beyond the grave being perhaps the... gravest, no pun intended.

As for the article, as amusing as it is, it's sadly incorrect in so many ways (such as lack of Force power manifesting until training, inability of technology to detect the Force... not to mention it doesn't cover the more esoteric applications of the Force in the EU like draining planets of life force). Although, one of the characters for the fic was going to be a sort of James Randi who demonstrated fraudulent Force mastery through an alter-ego that utilised electromagnets, power generators and hypnosis, so this'll come in useful!
