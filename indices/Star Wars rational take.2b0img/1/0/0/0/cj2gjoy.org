Well, it is an original idea of mine, but clearly not all that special since DeliaEris came up with the same idea in the comments.

And given that a certain Sith Lord manipulated midichlorians to resurrect the dead and create life, midichlorians can't /just/ be parasites with absolutely no effect on life or the Force. In my mind, they are symptomatic and not a cause of Force sensitivity, yes, but they still have an important and adverse role to play in this fic; I'm using them as the reason why the galaxy, despite its insane technology levels, still hasn't mastered biological immortality... and why cloning Force-sensitives doesn't work, why you can't induce Force sensitivity with a blood transfusion, etc. etc.
