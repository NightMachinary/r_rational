No no no. Midichlorians were a huge mistake from a rationalist storytelling standpoint. If you live in a universe with something like the Force, there are things going on that work as if there are basic mental entities that can directly influence reality without midichlorians as intermediaries. If there's a simulation behind a magical universe, that simulation is pretending that mental entities are basic. Midichlorians are a horrible hybrid concept tacked on afterward, an attempt to mix what Sounds Like Science into a universe that clearly wasn't generated by actual scientific thinking. In universes that require midichlorians for magic, magic does not work like the Force does in Star Wars. Let your magic be magic, and your science science.

The only possible way to come up with a reasonable explanation of magic is to start with an underlying reductionist scenario that would yield something like magic, then extrapolate magic which specifically and exactly fits that scenario, which does not look like standard magic and could be used by a sufficiently smart reader to figure out what underlying scenario generated it. Then you can present a non-nitwit explanation and have readers not throw their tablet computers against the wall. There is no non-nitwit pseudo-reductionist explanation for the Force because the Force, as described in the canon universe, was not generated by reductionist thinking to begin with.
