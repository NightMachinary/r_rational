The problem with midicholorians is that they are a horrible retcon bullsh[erase, revise]

The trouble that midicholoians pause to any Star Wars story is that they anchor the Force in the physical. If the Force is some sort of intangible magical thing then fine, sure, only certain people can feel it or manipulate it, whatever.

But! The minute you say that the Force is somehow anchored in physics, chemistry, and biology to the extent that there is *something living in your cells* that makes you a Jedi...suddenly, the whole thing is just stupid. The SW universe has enormously advanced medical technology(*) as compared to real world earth. I simply refuse to believe that "learning how to disobey physics at will and, simultaneously, protect yourself from mind-manipulating Jedi" is not a major research item on every planet in the galaxy. When you throw literally trillions of intelligent researchers and unlimited funds at a problem, it's not going to be THAT long before everyone in the galaxy can become a Jedi on an outpatient basis.

Doctor: Have you got your forms signed?...yep, looks good. What package did you want?

Patient: Oh, the 'Master Yoda' please.

Doctor: That's expensive, you know. You sure you can afford it?

Patient: Sure, no problem. [drops the equivalent of $200 in the cash register]

Doctor: Ok, here you go. [shoots Force-enabling goop into the patient's arm] Now remember, you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And don't go swimming or Force-jumping for at least an hour.

(*) The SW medical industry is remarkably primitive compared to the rest of their tech. They can travel FTL, but they can't regenerate a hand? There are no neural-interface devices? No uploading? (at least, not as far as I'm aware) And so on.
