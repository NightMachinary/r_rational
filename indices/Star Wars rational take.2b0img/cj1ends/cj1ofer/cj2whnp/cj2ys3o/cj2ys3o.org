Agreed. Which is why I'll be turning midi-chlorians into Force-dependent, Force-sensitive parasites that have a pretty adverse effect, and are closely linked to Force sensitivity to the degree that they are technically interlopers, at a stretch, between biological life and the Force, but are certainly not the cause of Force sensitivity. But ultimately, yes, everything will be rooted in the physical; this fic's universe won't be /fundamentally complex/ where interactions between complex minds and physics itself is somehow hardwired into reality. But I hope the explanation I have will be more palatable than the distinctly non-reductionist, vaguely science-y explanation Lucas gave us.

And as for aforementioned adverse effect of the midi-chlorians... Well, let's just say it has much to do with why medical technology is so remarkably primitive.

And neural-interface devices do exist (even in the movies, with Lobot), as does uploading (Ssi-ruuk entechment), but they certainly aren't mainstream to the degree you'd expect them to be. In general, Star Wars technological development is very... uneven... and stagnant. That's going to be attributed to the fact that pretty much all SW tech are just toys more ancient races let the younger races play with. A Star Wars scientist who designs a new hyperdrive doesn't possess some revolutionary understanding of physics, he's just barely clever enough to tweak some ancient races' Clarketech without blowing up the entire star system in the process. Science as we know it, as in HPMOR's wizarding world, is really quite primitive in this fic's GFFA.
