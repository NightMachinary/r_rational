Apologies if I didn't make it clear. This isn't a self-insert fic. A self-insert in an online RPG is what led me to try and deconstruct the Star Wars galaxy and provided many of the ideas I'll be using here, but no amount of plot or even characterisation (beyond the fact I'd like to think of myself as a rationalist) is being carried over.
