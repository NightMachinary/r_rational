I've thought about a lot of things that don't make sense in the SW universe before - here's a list of the stuff I can recall off the top of my head. Maybe it'll help:

1. Spaceships as relativistic kinetic weapons. It makes little sense that you don't see this being used. In the Battle of Endor, it's been calculated that the Rebel Fleet had to accelerate in excess of 30.000G to engage the Imperial Fleet in close range at the distances seen from Palpatine's throne room, in the time observed (I'm quoting from memory, can't for the life of me find the page where I saw it, but I recall that it was as solid as the Turbolaser numbers given below). Given that kind of acceleration capability for even the smallest of fighters, anything can be turned into a gigaton relativistic warhead if you've got cash enough to do the modern-day equivalent of buying a decent car. By most standards in any universe, anything that can go to space is practically a WMD.

2. Power of the weapons. Let's do a bit of math: an Imperator-class Star Destroyer has the stated ability to reduce the surface of a planet to slag with its Turbolasers, something which is called a Base Delta Zero operation. Using the most conservative figures and estimates ([[http://stardestroyer.net/tlc/Power/index.html][source]]), this means that it needs to (at the *very least*) maintain a power output of around half a billion terawatts, or the equivalent of every single one of its Turbolaser turrets detonating hundreds of megaton-range warheads /every second/. Even if you don't accept anything but movies as canon (since BDZ is an EU thing), an ISD's ability to utterly vaporize medium-size asteroids during the asteroid scenes in Empire implies at least a power output of around 30 terawatts per Turbolaser bolt (half a Hiroshima bomb), which is again a ridiculously conservative estimate. Note that since ISDs regularly participate in prolonged fleet engagements, this also implies an ability to defend against strikes of this magnitude. Either lower these ridiculous energy levels to something manageable and rework the lore entirely to remove the idea of BDZs (and everything else requiring these energy levels) entirely, or figure out how a universe works where X-Wings fire off Hiroshima bomb lasers in the course of regular dogfights. Many of these changes could drastically change the feel of the universe, so there's a challenge here.

3. Midi-chlorians. No. Just no. Figure something out: get rid of them, or simply make them work differently. You cannot do a blood transplant to gain force powers. You cannot artificially study them and recreate them with 'replicators' or nano-tech (which SW only has a rudimentary version of, anyway). You cannot do any of these things for strange and unknown reasons - I simply don't buy that a society of this tech level, having existed for tens of thousands of years, has not at some point tried every single possible variation of this. The easiest is to just remove midi-chlorians and do something else.

4. The 'dogfight' style space warfare, when weapons have been demonstrated to work at distances of tens of thousands of kilometers at the very least (Death Star superlaser, again the visible fleet engagement from Palpatine's throne room). Either the dogfighting has to go, or some reasoning for this kind of warfare needs to be thought out. Otherwise it would happen in ways that are more akin to how it goes on in the Honor Harrington novels by David Weber, which are fairly hard as far as realistic depictions of space warfare go (see [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/essay-on-realistic-space-combat-i-wrote.131056/][this]]).

5. The crappiness of droids. They run on /computers/. /They should be able to aim/. They should be able to aim from the hip and hit a fly at a distance of several miles, as long as their weapons are accurate enough. Even if you make the software stupid and "biological", IE simulating a brain or whatever they do, there's no reason this can't interface with a decent targeting computer.

--------------

There's definitely dozens of points that I've forgotten or glossed over here, but I think those are some of the more outstanding ones. In short, this universe is literally /riddled/ with enormous, gaping holes of unrealistic WSOD ripe for exploitation (mostly unsatisfying, I'd say - it makes no sense that nobody's thought of relativistic weapons, for example). Almost any solution you think of for these problems has to be very clever, so it's not just made to be obviously exploitable by a smart person.

My honest advice? Try to ignore all of this and skim over it as much as possible, never going into the actual tech and numbers and force principles. No amount of force haxxorz can keep up with the tech anyway, if the tech is used by anyone but a bunch of inept baboons (kill a jedi? Hypersonic kinetic rounds in a spread pattern - try blocking /that/ with your lightsaber in time, combat prescience or no).

Basically, you can have rational!SW on a moral, philosophical and political level. You can't have it on a power, munchkin or Force level. That's why I like the idea with rational!Anakin more - you can more easily shoehorn that into a solely moral/philosophical/political conflict.

For sources on SW, go with [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page][Wookiepedia]] for general lore stuff and [[http://stardestroyer.net/][stardestroyer.net]] for weapons numbers and calculations, along with a lot of other similar, really useful stuff. While they apply WSOD liberally, they've spent a /lot/ of time thinking about SW over there.

I hope some of this will help. Cheers! :P
