Maybe feasible, but hardly practical in the Star Wars universe, where large power generators literally run on direct matter-to-energy conversion of 'hypermatter', matter which somehow has a much higher energy content than regular matter. For example, when a regular-size 'Imperator' Imperial Star Destroyer makes a hyperspace jump, supposedly it uses more energy than most planetary civilizations (save the planet-wide cities, I hope) use in their entire lifetimes, several times over.
