There are totally neural-interface devices.

C3PO introduces himself as "human-cyborg relations". Later, in Cloud City, there is a character (I think his name is Lobot) with implants in his head to better interface with the computers. Also, robot hands.

(However, in general, it's pretty clear that the SW universe got stuck in a local maximum - probably due to some new, magical physics opening new avenues that terminated in dead-ends.)
