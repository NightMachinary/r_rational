Of course, it limits my audience within [[/r/rational][r/rational]] but not to the hardcore EU-loving community I'm also focusing on. ;) Any munchkin shenanigans will be as much to do with the character knowing pretty much every detail of the EU, coming from Earth after all, than being rational.

And the story isn't quite about that. It's about wrapping up all the loose threads in the EU in a believable and complex way and addressing an awful lot of really cool plot ideas people have came up with over the years (why hasn't there been a galaxy-wide droid uprising yet?). As for the strength of the plot, that wouldn't be my role to talk about. :p

And while something /equivalent/ to that will definitely go down, unfortunately artificially enriching one's blood with midichlorians in the EU merely resulted in an entire planet going insane and killing one another. I'm not going to portray the entire galaxy as stupid; if gaining Force powers was as simple as stealing from a Jedi blood drive, everybody would have done it already.
