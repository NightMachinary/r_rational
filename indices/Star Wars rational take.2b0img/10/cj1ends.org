Focusing on the EU severely limits your audience, unless you care to explain everything important. More than that, I don't see the point in basing a story purely around a handful of abuseable fictional constructs. Might as well right an essay about it. HPMOR does stuff like that, but it also has a very strong plot besides.

That aside, your character should totally steal from the Jedi's blood drive and use it to saturate themselves with Midichlorians.
