i've been thinking that anakin is a potential choice to make a rational!character from. first, forget everything george lucas told you about him beyond the broad strokes of his introduction: born of the force to a slave woman on tatooine, and spends his time (before jedi show up) creating droids.

so he's got a first-hand understanding of slavery, both of humanoids and droids, as well as enough understanding of minds to build two of them from scrap.

then obi-wan and qui-gon show up and tell him he's a wizard, too. the jedi have a lot to say about mental discipline and the dark/light division. but that division maps uncomfortably onto right/wrong: lightning is Always Dark, but mind control is okay for nice, Light jedi.

slavery of humans is widespread, and slavery of droids is somewhere between universal and legally required. anakin's whole childhood is one long process of experiencing the injustice of slavery while learning applied cognitive science.
