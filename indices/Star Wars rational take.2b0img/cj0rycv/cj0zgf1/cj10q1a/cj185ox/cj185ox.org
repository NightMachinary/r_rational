Obi-wan et. al. were en-route, over intersteallar space when Alderaan was destroyed. Ben sensed the event.

Alderaan was located near the galactic core, and Tatooine is an outer rim world. Even if the journey was 90% complete when Alderaan was destroyed, there would have been several light years of distance yet to travel.
