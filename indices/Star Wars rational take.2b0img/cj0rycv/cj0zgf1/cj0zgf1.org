This sounds roughly ten thousand times more interesting to read than someone trying to work out what particles the Force's action-at-a-distance relies on, or trying to understand the mechanics of the propagation a great disturbance in the Force (as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced) has, and it's potential use for FTL signaling. Munchkinning a bunch of contradictory lore from the EU doesn't sound terribly interesting to read, especially as you've presented it here - with no compelling motivations or backstory or characters or plot elements many readers already care about in your fic, you'd have to establish everything from scratch, at which point one wonders why you aren't just writing original fiction instead that you could conceivably e.g. accept donations for or sell or whatever without Disney or Lucas or whoever destroying you.

Stories are fundamentally more interesting when there's actual conflict with both sides, a chance of losing, and a protagonist motivated by their history rather than an author's 4th-wall-breaking-inserted-ideals. Also, stories where the protagonist struggle and have major conflicts that they /don't always win/ are way better than when the protagonist succeeds at everything, especially including failures early on that later successes can contrast against (e.g. - consider why HPMoR and Luminosity are some of the best Rationalist fiction and neither has characters exactly running roughshod over their settings for the most part, and indeed both stories feature significant loses and failures of the main characters).
