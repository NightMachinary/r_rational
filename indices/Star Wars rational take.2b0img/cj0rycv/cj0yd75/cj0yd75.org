I would totally read this.

Honestly, while OP's idea sounds fine if he takes care with the Mary Sue potential (gotta have some very costly and painful failures, character flaws, meaningful conflict, etc), I'd rather see a reworking of familiar characters a la HPMoR than something in a completely different timeline where we have to relearn an entire new OC supporting cast. Of course, this may be subject to how well OP does it, but there you have it.
