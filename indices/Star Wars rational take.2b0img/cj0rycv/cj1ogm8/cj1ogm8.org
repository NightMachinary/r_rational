This is a very good idea for a rational!Star Wars fic, indeed I think this concept blows my idea of a rational Star Wars geek being transported to the GFFA out of the water.

Given that I'll be too busy writing said crappier idea, however, maybe you should take a shot at it. ;) It sounds like it'd be received very well, even if it was just in the form of a series of vignettes.
