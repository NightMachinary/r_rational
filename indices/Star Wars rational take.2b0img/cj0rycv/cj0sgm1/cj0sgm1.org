That's actually a pretty cool idea for re-working that character. Especially the point about how mind control is all cool and good so long as it's jedi doing it, and the way that should clash with Anakin's values.

Now I seriously want to read some of that, that's some very neat conflict there. Hell - you can even have Anakin go Dark without it seeming utterly dumb this way.
