Hmm. It costs me far less to enjoy reading your fic than it costs you to make it. So, keeping my potential biases in mind...

You should definitely go for it. Pull a few all nighters. Heck work yourself to the bone. Just get that story out there! The world /needs/ you. This... this is your destiny...

Just don't work so hard that you die. If that happened I would be very put out.

More seriously: Yeah I'd be interested in such a story. But the extent of EU munchkinry I know about would be the events of the novel Darksaber. Now there's an idea. Screw the moon-sized battle station. Just build the megalaser!
