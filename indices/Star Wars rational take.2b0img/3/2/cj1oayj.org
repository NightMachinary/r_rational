If anything, what's taking so long for this story to come together isn't so much the plot but because I'm sticking to a very exacting "Everything is canon" rule and still trying to come up with a realistic reality underlying all these crazy phenomena you've listed. And of course, with each attempt to be reductionist, suddenly the plot must change because there's no way a rational OC would not notice some obvious exploit.

Fortunately, as a regular on the Jedi Council Forums and Wookieepedia, then yes I'd be one of those people whose spent a long time thinking about SW, so I'm mostly going to take a WSOD route although there will be a reductionist explanation that isn't as cheap as "godlike AI did it." So, as you say, it's mostly going to be rational on a moral, philosophical and political level, although there is going to be plenty of munchkinnery using the Force and technology alike. And while of course tech would beat the kind of "Force haxxorz" we see in the movies, the kind of Force powers we see in the EU would make hypersonic kinetic rounds in a spread pattern look positively cute.
