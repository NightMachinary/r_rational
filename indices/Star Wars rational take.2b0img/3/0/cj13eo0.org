I like to think of midichlorians as a Force-sensitive species that lives symbiotically/parasitically in highly Force-sensitive higher animals. So the midichlorian count can be used as an /indicator/ of Force sensitivity, but blood transplants don't spread Force sensitivity.

What's WSOD? "White screen of death" doesn't make sense to me in this context.
