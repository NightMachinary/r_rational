Star wars EU was actually the driving force in my new view of what the dark side of magic or the force is. The first dark Jedi were Jedi that pushed the limits of the force to higher complexity. So my idea is that dark means complex complex means something you use an access system rather than direct manipulation and thus you don't know it fully, and foremost dark is "magic" that has its own desires. This is off of my observations on the demonization of ambition as a villain's trait.
