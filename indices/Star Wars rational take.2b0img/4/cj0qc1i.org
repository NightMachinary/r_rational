Munchkinry is fun if it pokes fun at the universe and the fandom, but generally there needs to be at least some form of obstacle or antagonist more than capable of getting in the way and causing genuine problems for the protagonist. Otherwise it quickly devolves into "And then Bob did all the cool things, won everything, and fixed everything that was ever wrong ever."
