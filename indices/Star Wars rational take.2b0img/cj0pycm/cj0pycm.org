Munchinkining and optimization are fine, but be careful with it. Nobody likes a mary sue, and the goals you mention may end up making your character one.

At any rate, it sounds interesting, and I'd definitely give it a try. The lack of movie characters wouldn't be particularly off-putting for me personally, even though I have very little knowledge of the EU.
