First, he opens the containers, so one has the label "container of milk" and the other has the label "container of water". Then he closes them. Then someone else moves around the containers so he can't keep track of which is which.

Does the container of milk still say "container of milk" because it keeps the label? Or when he loses track of which container is which, does the label lose information and turn into plain "container"?

If the label loses information when he loses track of the information himself, that's "there's no scenario where the game mechanic provides unknowable information". If the label doesn't lose information, then this is an easy way to test the game mechanic.
