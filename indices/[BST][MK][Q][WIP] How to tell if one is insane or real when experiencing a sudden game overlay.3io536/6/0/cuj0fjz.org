The first example is a nice fringe case I needed to consider - thank you for posing it. So far, no thing has a label that the character couldn't have subconsciously or have consciously noticed. So those opaque containers would either not have labels, or have labels reflecting the containers themselves, depending on how much attention the character gives or has given each jar.

The labels on inanimates give supplementary information that relate more to the how or why of the thing, rather than the what of it.

All people all have labels regardless of whether the character attends to them, because faces are important to the human brain. Someone with a completely covered head would be without a label until such a time as the character comes to view that someone as a person.
