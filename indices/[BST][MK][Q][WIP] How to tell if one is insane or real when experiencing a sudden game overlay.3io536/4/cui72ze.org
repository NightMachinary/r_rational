I don't think schizophrenia does visual hallucinations. Maybe, delusional disorder?

That said: How young would he be when this starts? Because if he's young enough, he might just roll with it. From there the real issue is other's figuring out and then thinking he has a mental condition (Temporal lobe epilepsy? Autism? IDK.)

If he's old enough for it to be notable: He could just look at someone he's never met before, write down their name, and then Google them, look on Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. Find a matching picture.

if he's paranoid enough to think he imagined that: He's fucked, there's no objective way to definitively prove he isn't hallucinating this. If he's willing to talk to someone they could let him know, but that could also just be part of the delusion.

He could jump off a building after buffing VIT/STR and then having himself looked over to prove he has no injuries, but that could be imagined.

Basically, at some point he just has to trust it's real.
