Beyond reasonable doubt?

Get a crowd of psychologists. Explain them the situation and /prove/ it by making stuff disappear by putting stuff to the inventory, or knowing info about everyone by observing them (The Gamer), or such feats.

If they agree it at least looks real, and you can get Penn and Teller there too to check you are not cheating while you are at it, you can be pretty sure you are not just insane.

OFC there is the possibility you are just imagining the psychologists and Penn and teller too, but there is not much you can do at that point.

You can't prove anyone you are seeing stuff. (without some cool brain scans) You can prove how the thing affects the world you all share.

TL;DR: Prove it to others and see how they react.
