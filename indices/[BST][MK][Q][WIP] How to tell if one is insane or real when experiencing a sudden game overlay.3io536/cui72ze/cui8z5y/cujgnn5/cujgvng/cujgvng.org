Would their quest to determine whether they're insane qualify as a freak out?

As it stands now, the kid discovers the ability upon returning from school, when they realize their mother can't see the labels. They then go about the house until they reach the bathroom, seeing what has and hasn't labels. When they see they're also labeled, they fall back against the wall, think for a bit, then start their testing. They refuse to just wait until they can go to the city to test the veracity of the labeling of others' names, as they need to find out whether the thing is real or they're insane.

Does that qualify? Your concern is valid and worrying, so I'm committed to take what you say very seriously.
