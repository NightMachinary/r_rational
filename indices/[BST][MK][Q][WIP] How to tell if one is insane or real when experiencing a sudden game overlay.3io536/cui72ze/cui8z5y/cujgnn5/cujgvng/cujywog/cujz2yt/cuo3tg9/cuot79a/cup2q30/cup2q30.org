Well, I know that personally I am fickle as a reader, and can often lose interest very quickly if it doesn't look like something interesting will happen. Therefore I lead towards sucking them in as soon as possible. So I guess either only cover it if you can do it quickly, or possible start out with something interesting, flash back to a schooling snippet then run from there. Though one doesn't necessarily have to do it a school. Subtle things like marvelling at an atlas of stars or space rockets are also an option.

In the end though, it's up to you. I only started writing recently and though I feel I've certainly gotten a lot better than I was, I'm hardly infallible.
