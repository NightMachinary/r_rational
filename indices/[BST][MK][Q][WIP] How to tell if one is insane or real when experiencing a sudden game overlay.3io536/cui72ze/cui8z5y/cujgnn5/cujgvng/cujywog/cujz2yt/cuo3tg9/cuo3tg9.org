You could establish them as a curious character who takes wonder in discovering new things. Or you could have them have a quiet freak out on the way home then try really hard to let anyone find out because they don't want to leave their friends/something important is happening at school soon/they don't want to go to the madhouse.

Depends on how your characterisation is going to go and how much buildup you're willing to do before introducing the premise. Personally I'd go for introducing it as soon as possible, so as to nab readers early before they wander off.
