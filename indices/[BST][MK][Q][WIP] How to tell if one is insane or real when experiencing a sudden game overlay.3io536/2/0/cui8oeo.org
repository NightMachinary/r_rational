The labels are inconsistent. It will be a function of how much attention the kid has given or gives to a particular thing or things of its set, but he won't think to test for that for a while yet.

The labels are also not so obviously useful. Sometimes it might say what something is objectively, other times it will explain its significance or what it meant to the person that created it, e.g. 'Uppity Failure' or 'Initial Impetus'.

Those are good ideas, though, and I'll keep them in mind.
