I'd test the labels instead of the instant stat gains.

First, I'd check if the labels have senses than me. Look at the back of a card: is it labeled "Five of Hearts" or "Playing Card"? Is it "bottle of water", "bottle of vodka" and "bottle of vinegar" or is it "bottle of clear fluid" x3?

Next, I'd check if it has better memory/history tracking. Is a certain screw a "computer screw", while another is a "toaster screw" despite the fact that they're physically indistinguishable? Is one envelope an "envelope containing $0" while another is "envelope containing no letters"?

After that, I'd check its knowledge base. Can it tell that this oil filter is a PS 789465312, despite me never studying part numbers?
