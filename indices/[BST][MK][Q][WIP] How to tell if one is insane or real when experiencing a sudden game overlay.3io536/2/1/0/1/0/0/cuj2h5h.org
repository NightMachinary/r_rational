ID games are an essential part of the roguelike Nethack, and many other roguelikes, as well as other games. Essentially they only give you the information that your character has detected with their senses. So, instead of a potion of healing, you see an ominously black potion.

  First, I'd check if the labels have senses than me. Look at the back of a card: is it labeled "Five of Hearts" or "Playing Card"? Is it "bottle of water", "bottle of vodka" and "bottle of vinegar" or is it "bottle of clear fluid" x3?

With an ID game, it would be a playing card, and three bottles of clear fluid, some of which smell funny.

  Next, I'd check if it has better memory/history tracking. Is a certain screw a "computer screw", while another is a "toaster screw" despite the fact that they're physically indistinguishable? Is one envelope an "envelope containing $0" while another is "envelope containing no letters"?

This experiment would require becoming uncertain with the items in question. Most games don't have this mechanic, but for example, in Nethack you can forget the entire dungeon map and your entire inventory by drinking a potion of amnesia. In a finer-grained Nethack (or Dwarf Fortress in ten years or so), I might imagine you would be able to have someone switch two items identical in appearance behind your back, and when you turn back you would no longer be able to identify them.

ID games are a small part of games essentially keeping track of the character's mental state and displaying only that which the character knows, essentially making the game interface an organized interface to the character's mind.

  After that, I'd check its knowledge base. Can it tell that this oil filter is a PS 789465312, despite me never studying part numbers?
#+end_quote

With an ID game, you would not be able to glean the model number of an oil filter without examining the object yourself. Essentially, these experiments only tell you if the game-like effect, whether sane or insane, is one that gives you information that you yourself don't have. And if you were insane, your memory could lie to you, so not even positive confirmation of greater knowledge would mean anything without experiments run by an independent observer. In other words, the results of those experiments, at least on your own, tell you nothing of your own sanity.

If you find that the effect /is/ appearing to give you greater information (the probability of which as compared to other effects is indeterminable without information of the effect's source), then you would have something to test with an independent observer, and that would give you information on your sanity. If you don't find that you gain greater knowledge, you don't have anything to test, and only gain information on the limitations of the effect's abilities.
