  Think about all one possibility and see if you could prove that it's true. If you can't prove that it's true, try seeing if you can prove that it's false.

You're probably better off starting with 'prove it false.' It's very hard to prove a statement is absolutely true with no possibility of mistake or alternate explanation, but it's comparatively easy to prove something is false if it is. That's why scientists work to reject the null hypothesis instead of confirm their research hypothesis.
