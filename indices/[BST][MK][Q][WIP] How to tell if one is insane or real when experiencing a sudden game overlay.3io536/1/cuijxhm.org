Ask people on the street if you've identified their names correctly. If they say yes, I don't think most psychotics hallucinate that hard. So your brain is exceptionally and unusually insane enough to prevent any error detection and cause all senory experiences to conform. At that point you might as well expect future sensory experiences to go the same way.
