If the possibility is full insanity, it's impossible to prove either way because of Solipsism (ie. you can't be sure that anything is real because we may be in the Matrix imagining everything). The character has to trust implicitly that everything he's seeing (outside of the game elements) is real because what exists in reality doesn't matter, only what he observes.

Let's say the character decides that this is a mental illness. What does he do? Turn himself into a mental hospital? He might just be imagining turning himself in to the hospital.

He could prove that he has a mental illness by getting someone he trusts that has expertise to tell him so - either he's imagining that he's being told it, in which case mental illness, or he's actually being told it, in which case mental illness. However, it's not falsifiable; there is no way that he can prove that he doesn't have a mental illness.

EDIT: There are three major possibilities:

1. It's real
2. It's imaginary, but that's the only thing he's hallucinating.
3. It's imaginary, the whole world is imaginary.

If 1 or 3, impossible to prove real or imaginary. If 2, then he can prove that he's not in 1 (by using the methods you discussed), but he can't prove that he's not actually in 3, since the fake world could be lying to him about what happened. Therefore, he can distinguish between 1 and 2, but he can't prove that he's not in 3, so he has to go forward assuming that he may be hallucinating everything. If the experiments show that 2/3 is the case, he should go to a mental hospital. If 1/3 is shown to be the case, he should go forward assuming that everything is real, because there is no downside to assuming that and because there's no discernible difference between "everything is real" and "I am imagining that everything is real"
