One piece of "perfect" rationality is thinking about everything like you are trying to logically prove it. Think about all one possibility and see if you could prove that it's true. If you can't prove that it's true, try seeing if you can prove that it's false. Try looking at alternate possibilities.

Using the example from above, we want to prove that it's real. Well, we can't do that because everything could be imaginary. Can we prove that it's imaginary? Well, we need to do tests like trying out what happens. Suppose the power works successfully; then we know that there is a possibility it is real. However, since that would be proving it is real, we know there must be an alternative - everything is imaginary. Suppose the power doesn't work successfully; then we know there is a possibility that everything is real except for the game windows. However, it's possible that everything is imaginary. There are more possibilities, (for example, everything is real except for something insignificant and the game windows), but for his purposes, they fold into the possibility that everything is imaginary.

(Note, I probably messed up some with the logic here, but it's the general idea)

Proving something by trying it a lot is infinitely less valuable than proving that thing logically, since trying it a lot could just mean that you're being very lucky or that there's something fudging the data. But if you prove something logically, then you know that the only way it could be false is if logic is false, and then you have bigger problems.
