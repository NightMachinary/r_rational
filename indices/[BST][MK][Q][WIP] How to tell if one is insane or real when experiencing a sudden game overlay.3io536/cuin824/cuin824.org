If the only game mechanic is the descriptions, then he should start to see if the descriptions will tell him things that he cannot know.

For example. Two identical unmarked, opaque jars. One with water in it, the other with milk in it. Will the descriptions reliably indicate what is in the container, even if the positions of the containers are moved around?

Try to figure out some way that the game mechanic will tell you things you shouldn't know. If there is no scenario where the game mechanic provides unknowable information, then I'm confused about the point of the story, unless it's entirely based around self-sanity exploration.

EDIT: Another option. Find someone who is good at card tricks. Especially if you are not already good at card tricks. See if they can fool you.
