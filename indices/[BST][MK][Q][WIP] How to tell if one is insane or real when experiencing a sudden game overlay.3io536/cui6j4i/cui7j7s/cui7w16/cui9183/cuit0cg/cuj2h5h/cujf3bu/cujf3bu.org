I'd say that the most useful experiment in determining sanity is that which distinguishes between game interface having information you don't have, and game interface behaving like Nethack interface.

Also, if you get close enough to full solipsism (and having significantly unreliable memory is close enough) there is no useful experiments at all.

It seems I completely agree with you on this. Thanks for clarification.
