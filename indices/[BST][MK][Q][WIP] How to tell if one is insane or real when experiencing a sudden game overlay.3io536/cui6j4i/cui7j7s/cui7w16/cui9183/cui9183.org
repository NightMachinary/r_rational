No, the knowledge base wouldn't work, because ID games don't tell you what you don't already know. Besides that, any reasonable experiment of history tracking would require that you become uncertain of which item is which, and that's exactly the sort of thing I would want to lose information on in a game.

You're assuming that the details of the effect follow a distribution similar to what games have been released by now, when you can't actually say how this particular effect has come about. The effect having some details reminiscent of one pattern of games, or of extant games, doesn't actually imply reminiscence of other details. You don't have any real priors for this, besides the probability that you have gone insane.

I would say the only way to determine whether or not you're insane is with safety-prioritized experimentation to determine the effect's behavior, investigating the source of this effect, and then seeking confirmation by independent experimenters, with whatever evidence you can produce from the first two paths. You can't actually disconfirm insanity through your own sensory experience.

Without research, I think the weightiest evidence against insanity would be a continuing ability to feel surprise at elements of your experience that seem the most insane, but I don't know much about delusional ideation.
