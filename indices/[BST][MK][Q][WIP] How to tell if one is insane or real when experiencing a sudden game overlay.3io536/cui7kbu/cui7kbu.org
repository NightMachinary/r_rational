So basically you're writing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gamer_(manhwa)][The Gamer]]?

How do you know you're not already insane?

I figure you could do some simple tests to find out whether it's a simple hallucination or either real or you're too insane for anything to matter. For example, find a random person, ask them their name, and see if it matches what appears above them.
