  What are the names of your textbooks? It's hard to find a good textbook on my areas of interest without asking someone who's already looked through a couple.
#+end_quote

Bayesian stats: /Introduction to Bayesian Statistics/ by Bolstad, with /Probability Theory: the Logic of Science/ by Jaynes for when I just want to read a mathematician ham it up on the level of the finest anime characters.

Probabilistic Models of Cognition: [[http://probmods.org][my God I just gave you the book's name]]. And I've preordered Pfeffer's /Practical Probabilistic Programming/ to help me learn this stuff in a typed language ;-).

Algorithmic Information Theory: /Information and Randomness/ by Calude

I've also got Smullyan's /Logical Labyrinths/ and some old /The Elements of Mathematical Logic/ and /The Theory of Sets/ my advisor threw out (NO REALLY MY MSC ADVISOR THREW OUT THESE BOOKS WHEN HE MOVED OFFICES). Also /Conceptual Mathematics/ and /Certified Programming with Dependent Types/. And Aluffi's /Algebra: Chapter 0/. And possibly a Coursera sequence on statistics, ML, and data analysis, though I'm currently using /Understanding Machine Learning/ by Shalev-Schwartz and Ben-David for the last course of my MSc.

EDIT: OH, and then the /Homotopy Type Theory/ book is very interesting just as a cool new approach to founding math in computation.

SECOND EDIT: NOTE TO SELF, STOCHASTIC DOMAIN THEORY NEEDS TO BE A THING.

THIRD EDIT: LEARN TOPOLOGY. IT'S BASICALLY THE /DETAILED/ MATHEMATICS OF COMPUTATION. ALL TOPOLOGY THEOREMS ARE, IN SOME FASHION, COMPUTATION THEOREMS.

Basically, by the time I'm actually done with /all/ the textbooks I want to get through, I will go from my current academic levels (BSc Comp Sci, MSc Comp Sci, uncredited minor in mathematics with focus on statistics) to BSc Comp Sci + MSc Comp Sci + uncredited second BSc major in mathematics with a focus on statistics + uncredited MSc Theoretical Comp Sci + research-level background in programming languages and a hope to start understanding computational cognitive science.

[[http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/caffienekitty/11224213/2575701/2575701_original.jpg][AND IT STILL WON'T BE ENOUGH.]] I /might/, at that point, be /kinda-sorta/ ready for a PhD program.
