I'll start us off with a classic.

I've only ever done running as serious exercise (jogging 4 miles every other day) and I'm building up some muscle in hopes of being healthy enough to live until the medical singularity. Therefore I promise to exercise every day for five days out of the seven days in a week. The exercise requirement is permanently set at 25 pushups per day.

The quota is deliberately set so low, because the hardest part of exercise is getting started. If I only need to do a trifling amount, I'm sure to do more most days.

I already started by doing 50 push-ups within the first 15 minutes of the New Years!

PS If you have more suggestions of how I should do things, I'm willing to listen and spend five minutes by the clock thinking about it.
