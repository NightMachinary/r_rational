Sorry, wasn't online much for the last couple days, trying to sort things out for my resolution, which is to start following my Emi [[http://i.imgur.com/Kwy0C.jpg][push-up sheet]] and stay 3-4 chapters ahead in my Differential Equations, University Physics, and Electronics textbooks and make easy to reference typed summary sheets for each chapter I finish before going through the homework.

Also, how to unicycle and aim a bow properly.

Much fun to be had.
