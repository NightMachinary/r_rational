  I've only ever done running as serious exercise (jogging 4 miles every other day) and I'm building up some muscle in hopes of being healthy enough to live until the medical singularity. Therefore I promise to exercise every day for five days out of the seven days in a week. The exercise requirement is permanently set at 25 pushups per day.

Wait wait wait wait. You're excited about indefinite longevity, so /you actually set yourself a program of diet and exercise?!/ If you manage to succeed in this, you are already way, way ahead of most so-called immortalists. Congratulations.
