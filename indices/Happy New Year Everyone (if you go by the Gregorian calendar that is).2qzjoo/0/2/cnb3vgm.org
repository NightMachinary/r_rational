What are the names of your textbooks? It's hard to find a good textbook on my areas of interest without asking someone who's already looked through a couple.

Also, doesn't it defeat the purpose of pledging "rational" resolutions if you are going to do it anyway? It seems to only help by clarifying it as a clear goal instead of something you /might/ get to later. Which might be your point!

Carry on, nothing to see here.
