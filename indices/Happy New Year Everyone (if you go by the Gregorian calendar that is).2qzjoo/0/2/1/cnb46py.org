  Also, doesn't it defeat the purpose of pledging "rational" resolutions if you are going to do it anyway? It seems to only help by clarifying it as a clear goal instead of something you might get to later. Which might be your point!

Yes, that's my point. New Year's resolutions are usually signals rather than /plans/.

EDIT: So in that spirit, my New Year's resolution is to /actually find time to indulge a fiction-writing hobby/. This is something I've been profoundly failing at.
