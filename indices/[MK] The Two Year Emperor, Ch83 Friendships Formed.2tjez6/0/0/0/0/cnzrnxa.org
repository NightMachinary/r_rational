No metamagic, remember? But, yes, in a regular 3.5 campaign that would be the best option.

In 2YE-verse, I think the best move might be the Piranha Death Trap -- Celerity, Time Stop, (spent a round shaking off the stun), followed by as many Manyjaws spells as you can manage. Optionally followed by another Celerity, Time Stop, more Manyjaws if you have the slots for it. If you're a 20th level caster you get 10 Manyjaws per spell, each of which does 1-3 no miss damage (assuming the target makes every Reflex save; if not then it's 1d6). It's a 3rd level spell so you can have a whole LOT of them prepared; on average a Time Stop gives you 3 rounds to cast, so if you have filled your 9th level spells with Time Stops you could get an utterly insane number of no-save damage out in one round.

EDIT: Also, it's force damage which can affect extraplanar / incorporeal creatures, and it lasts up to 3 rounds if you concentrate.
