Well, the best spells always were those which didn't offer saves.

The best first action in a combat between 80th level characters is likely a celerity followed by multiple twinned, maximized, empowered, split-ray energy drains quickened for... carry the three... 72? negative levels if all three rays hit. No save, just lose all your half decent spells, most of your HP, and get a -72 to everything.

Probably add a disjunction or Wish first to autodispel any Death Ward effects.
