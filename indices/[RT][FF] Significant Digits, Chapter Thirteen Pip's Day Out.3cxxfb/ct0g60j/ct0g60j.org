The centaurs spouting incomprehensible philosophy delights me. The fact that most (all?) of it is by human philosophers is hilarious. Luna's jab at Umbridge is also amusing. Umbridge's treachery is, well, both in-character and yet somehow still cliched. And of course Harry knows, I should have known. One would think that Malfoy would have spies that didn't actually have an aversion to being rejuvenated.
