Very interesting idea you have going. For the Kipii i personally imagine a race that has been forced to be nomadic due to sparse resources in the region the live in. I'd say to have the way they navigate is to have each individual island have it's own unique magicfield they can feel. The bigger the island, the stronger the field and the further away you can feel it. The songs they sing would then have a certain direction from the obelisk while also subconsciously imparting a magneticfield that the Kipii can use as a homing beacon for the specific island once they get close, this is important as the island could've moved from when the last updated song about it was transferred to other parts of the race. The Lost City could be the an ancient living place where they lived with abundant resources before something forced them away from it. The Song of the Lost City is actually well known and song for all children giving them a sense of longing for their homeland, but it does not contain any magnetic guidance. This could be because the song does not origin from guidance to the place but from some magical melody they wind plays while passing through a cliff overlooking the city, or something along those lines.

An idea could also be to look into ancient nomadic tribes and their cultures. Ancient Mongolians and Polynesian tribes comes to mind.

I'm just throwing some balls in the air, catch those you like.

Now some questions for you; is there a general movement to all the islands around the obelisk ie. do the circle around it like some massive whirlpool of continents and islands. Does the obelisk turn as well or is fixed in place. Are there seasons and how do they work. How is water treated as a resources seeing as it has a tendency to down and off the edges of stuff.

I personally imagine the spot on Jupiter with the obelisk in the center of the spot. Is summer then when islands are closest to the equator and winter when closest to the poles, with spring and fall being on either side of the obelisk depending on the direction of rotation of everything. The islands would still move around compared to each other, but at the same time follow the general rotation.
