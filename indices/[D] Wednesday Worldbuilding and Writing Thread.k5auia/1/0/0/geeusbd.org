Hey! Yeah great thoughts, this definitely aligns with how I imagine the Kipii. I definitely think it's something in between echolocation and the magnetic homing that birds do during migration. I definitely love the idea of the Song of the Lost City as something they all grow up knowing, but they can't find the harmonics in the magnetic lines anymore.

Polynesians is a really good idea! Now that I think about it Moana totally has lines about the Songs that help them find their way home. This is a great parallel, I should be looking to that culture and aesthetic for inspiration. I think they used a lot of star navigation, even very early on in history, to traverse pretty vast distances.

Happy to answer your questions =)

I think the larger islands do orbit somewhat consistently, but it's not as predictable as planetary orbits due to changes in wind and fluctuations in magnetism, and the interactions between the different islands when they pass by or collide with each other. There's a few big continents that generally drift in a fixed trajectory, but many middle and smaller islands that are moving very chaotically through this space.

The obelisk itself is essentially fixed as the center of the world. In Kipii creation myths, they say that the obelisk was the Lens through which their Goddess created the universe, but that it shattered when her essence entered it to manifest the physical world, sending the shards of crystal and islands out into the sky. Whatever its origin, it is absolute in its permanence, despite the cracks and slivers along its surface. No known force can move it, and its limits into the depths of the clouds below have never been explored.

Seasons are a really interesting question. I think I should probably do another whole post on season and meteorology to think through that. I think there would still be seasonal changes and regional differences as you traveled toward the poles of the planet.

your idea about the whole system drifting north and south to create seasonal changes is really interesting, I may have to give that some thought and consider how the obelisk plays into it. it could be that as islands rotate around the obelisk they tend deeper into the north or south poles and have seasons based on their latitude. The spin of the planet would mean you have very complex seasonal cycles, as you might do a full circuit out of sync with the planetary year, and have several mini-winters followed by a super winter when your island's movement lined up with the planet's tilt. Calculating all this would be a tremendous job for budding scientists.

As to water, there is a weather cycle of rain, runoff, evaporation, clouds, and condensation that keeps water flowing onto the islands. the Crystal's "magnetism" causes increased condensation in their vicinity and tends to pull clouds and water around the islands to feed their lakes and rivers. Deep in the clouds there must be a massive sea somewhere as they start to condense with increased atmospheric pressure. The existence of this "great sea" is theorized by meteorologists but has never been confirmed by anyone who has returned. However, sometimes strange floating fishlike creatures and even massive Behemoths will ascend from the depths in search of new prey. There's good money to be made in whaling ships that can brave the deeper storms to search these out.
