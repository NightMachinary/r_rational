With what others have said, being a big naval tower and fairly wealthy, and with the cheap fuel, the city probably has a large and iconic lighthouse, like the Alexandria one.

With wood being used for varnished furniture and ship building, it probably isn't burnt as fuel even in the places where it would be superior. There'd probably be well developed designs for oil fueled stoves and heaters, in both large stationary ones and smaller ones for carrying.

Kerosene can reach much higher temperatures and energy densities than wood, we still use it as jet fuel and rocket fuel to this day. It might be possible for them to melt ores that were not economical to use until much later in our world, or make large fuel-air explosions by aerosolizing it using their mouths. Speaking of which, "fire-breathers" might be more common for entertainment.
