Hi guys, so right now I'm working on a story (I failed nano) and the first few scenes take place in a city on the coast.

By virtue of being in this city, residents can magically summon small quantities of fat. Think Barren Jewel, except you can customize what kind of fat you get (butter, olive oil, lard, whale blubber, etc.)

This is a relatively common phenomenon in this world, and people in other areas can summon other things to varying degrees of usefulness (think, being able to summon pollen. Or fog.) but I haven't fleshed out the rest of the setting yet and don't want to bias any possible responses here.

But my question is: what kind of economy and culture does this city have? So far I've got:

-Export candles and soap

-Diet of fried fish, eels, crayfish, stingrays

-Suet bird feeders hung everywhere to attract tropical birds

-Lots of cosmetics, its common for both men and women to wear makeup

-Weather prediction via shark oil barometers

The technology level is roughly analogous to the Bronze Age and the plants and animals are mostly from Australia, Melanesia, Polynesia.
