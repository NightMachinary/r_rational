fat could also be used as fuel for any work that requires high temperatures (smithing, baking pottery, drying wood etc).

Some fats would make excellent fertilizer, especially if composted or burned first.

Atop of all of that, polymerising fats (like walnut oil, or linseed oil etc) do not go bad, and can be used to water proof and wear-proof basically everything; from buildings to ships, from leather to furniture etc, making everything last easily 2x as long.
