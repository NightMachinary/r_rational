Cheap candles, and thus cheap lighting after dark, would be amazingly useful for any kind of scholar class. Cheaper than any time before the invention of electric lighting.

Fats, particularly suet, are really useful for food preservation. Pemmican is a combination of dried meat, tallow, and dried fruit. It lasts a really long time without any other preservation techniques, and would be a really good thing to export. Potted meat is a form of preservation that puts meat in a jar and has a layer of suet on top to prevent airborne bacteria from spoiling the food. Not terribly long term, but the ease of getting suet would make it extremely common.

Lots of oils don't last all that long without additional preservation, but some do. Salted butter and ghee are different methods of preserving butter, and would be pretty simple to make and export. Suet, and all the liquid oils we use in the kitchen are obvious exports.

Soap is a good idea. I believe you can make a good base by burning seaweed, and you already have the oil.

Pastry could be popular.

Pre-industrial societies have the vast majority of their population farming food. With free calories from oils available to every citizen, there's a lot less need for so much food production, and easy food preservation lowers that need further. This city would be far larger than a normal Bronze Age society could support, and soap production could make said city vastly cleaner than cities ordinarily would be for multiple technological eras. Well, provided someone notices the connection between soap use and less disease.

A barometer seems much more advanced than a bronze age society could produce, given they were first invented in the 1600s.
