This is an incredibly helpful comment, thank you. I really like all these ideas, I hadn't even considered the art aspect with textiles and oil painting but it's an interesting avenue to explore.

And advances in medicine completely slipped my mind. I'd been doing research in traditional medicine in Oceania but man, the good ol' doctors from before modern medicine would use anything. The things Nicholas Culpeper listed as "medicine" make me shudder. Of course the doctors will try any oil they can get their hands on and use it to "assuage pain of the womb" or something.

And the naturally-occurring steroid thing is interesting but it honestly might be too powerful, I'll have to do some research before I introduce that into the story.
