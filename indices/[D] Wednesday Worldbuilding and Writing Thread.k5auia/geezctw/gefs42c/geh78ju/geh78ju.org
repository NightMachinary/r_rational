even applying raw linseed oil to wood would produce a durable coat that water-proofs, weather proofs and rot-proofs wood for years. ANd since now people can quite literally re-coat wooden items in oil by slapping them, their wooden objects will easily last for 3x time they normally would. Wooden ships in particular would become near immortal, with all the hands-on care and repair they normally get.
