- Art industry: You could produce oil paints from linseed oil, though you'd still need pigments to mix with it. There is no evidence of oil painting in the bronze age, though if all types of oil and fat are free and easily accessible, I imagine oil painting would be discovered quickly.

- Textile industry: You can make waterproof cloth known as oilcloth by applying several coatings of boiled linseed oil. This can be used for making umbrellas, water-proof cloaks, raincoats, water-resistant satchels, and waterproof coverings for carts, wagons, and carriages. You could also make waxed cotton sails and waxed jackets. Given free access to linseed oil, wax, etc., I suspect this kind of stuff would be developed quickly.

- Wood finishing: You could produce drying oils (like, again, linseed oil) as an ingredient for wood varnishes, though varnish would still require a resin like amber or shellac, as well as a solvent like alcohol. Wood varnishes have been in use since at least ancient Egypt.

- Lighting: Oil lamps/lanterns, torches, and candles could all be fueled fairly easily, and all date back to before the bronze age. For best illumination, you'd probably want an oil lamp with its wick in a narrow tube of glass, similar to [[https://www.garrettwade.com/extra-bright-brass-oil-lamps.html][this]]. Glassmaking as an industry started taking off in the late bronze age, and if the fuel for lamps is free, it makes sense to experiment with ways to get more use out of it.

- Pharmaceutical industry: This could allow for the mass production of naturally-occurring steroids like cortisone (anti-inflammatory), testosterone, estradiol (an estrogen hormone), as well as vitamins A, D, E, and K. Discovery of these obviously occurred well after the bronze age. However, depending on how the magic works, it might still be possible to produce these even without really knowing what they are or where they come from.
