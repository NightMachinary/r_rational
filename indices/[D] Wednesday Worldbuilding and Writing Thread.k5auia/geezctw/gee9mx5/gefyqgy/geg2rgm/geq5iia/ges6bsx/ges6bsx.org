The technological advancements Athens has allows children to be brought up training magic several hours a day every day until they are 15, while other societies need children for manual labor. The population growth and colonization from magical advancement will happen to Athen's distant only rival, but not to Athens itself because it is not a normal society, consisting entirely of kidnapped "orphans" (the Athenians are the reason they're orphans) who are taught to not reproduce (one of Alexander's directives) and have access to non magical birth control.
