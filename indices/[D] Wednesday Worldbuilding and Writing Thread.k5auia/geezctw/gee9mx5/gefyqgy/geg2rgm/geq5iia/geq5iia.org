  Typically, only 5% of humans can use magic easily, and less than .5% can use it effectively; however, in Athens the number is nearly 100% due to intensive training and centuries of scientific refinement of said training

The biggest issue here I can see is population. If their methods are so effective, we should expect to see them have a population boom relative to their neighbors, which eventually should result in some form of colonization as surplus population seeks space and advantage in the periphery. Even if they are perfect at suppressing discovery of the secrets, the techniques should spread as the more effective population pushes aside the less while bringing their techniques with them.

This could be solved by adding birth control as a very early and easy facet of magic, but this just introduces the opposite problem where magic using populations might decline. This can be made up in immigration, but nonetheless makes it hard to keep the techniques from spreading back along kinship lines.

These can be avoided or ignored for a time, but not for the 6000 years you're looking for.
