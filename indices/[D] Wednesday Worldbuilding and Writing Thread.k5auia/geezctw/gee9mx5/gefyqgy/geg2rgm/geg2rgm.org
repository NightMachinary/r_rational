The geography:\\
The shape of the continent of Lightrot is just the continental united states, but as it was in the Cretaceous, with an inland sea where the Mississippi is. However, instead of being 3000 miles across, it is 300,000 miles across (thus the small scale geography is wildly different). Athens is located where Buxport, Maine is. The world is shaped like a half donut- a donut that makes a full circle, but the inside half is cut out, so the side of the donut closer to the center point is flat, or in this case nonexistant. The planet is noeuclidean- the north line (not a point pole) wraps around the the corresponding longitude at the south line. From the North Line to the South Line is 1 million miles. The Canadian border is a seemingly infinite abyss a kilometer across, with a hurricane force constant downdraft, it thought to be uncrossable. The abyss border extends northwards from Washington and Maine in a trapezoid all the way to the North Line about 50,000 miles away. The Mexican border is just a normal coastline. As for the east-west curvature, the world is thought to be flat and infinite by most cultures, but the Athenians have measured an east west curvature suggesting a circumference of 80 million miles. The Atlantic Ocean has been explored to a million miles with no sign of land. The City of Athens is protected from the outside world by a river on one side, which provides it with abundant hydroelectricity, and mountains on another, and sits on top of a tall mesa. The sun of Lightrot's world is a torus far above the equator, that turns on for 16 hours a day during the summer and for 8 hours a day during the winter (seasonal changes are abrupt and occur every 6 months). In either season, no sunlight reaches the polar lines, and there is a ring of extremely high terrain (above the atmosphere) at the poles as well, so at the edge of the world, the tens of thousands of miles of water ice icebergs give way to rivers and eventually glaciers of frozen air. It is in one of these glaciers that Alexander Fat-Athens went to and froze himself 6,000 years ago using Seethstones, tasking the city he founded with one day reviving him to lead the conquest of the world. Without the Seethstones he took with him, even reaching him would require incredibly advanced technology, ensuring Athens would be ready for conquest when he was revived. (cont.)
