I am working on a setting called Lightrot. In a world otherwise dominated by feudal city states and temporary empires, a single city, Athens, safely tucked on the edge of the world has maintained stability and technological and magical superiority for 6 millennia- until one day, they discover radioactivity, and the true nature of magic and the history of their world is unfurled.

The magic system:\\
All sufficiently intelligent creatures are capable of using magic. The type of magic depends however on the type of brain. Humans, birds and land mammals all can use heat magic. Typically, only 5% of humans can use magic easily, and less than .5% can use it effectively; however, in Athens the number is nearly 100% due to intensive training and centuries of scientific refinement of said training. In the outside feudal world, it is obviously beneficial for the ruling classes to refer to magic as a difficult, ineffable, and often religious force. Heat magic consists of first creating a small mote of thermal energy within 2 meters of yourself, and then moving and manipulating that mote to create various effects. The mote can only be summoned inside a material at most as dense as water, and cannot be summoned into a vacuum. The energy of the mote is taken directly from chemical bonds in the casters body, but since one's mouth counts as being inside your body, mages do not have to become obese, as in a battlefield situation, they could sit in the back ranks and be fed sticks of butter. Mages can manipulate heat motes to fly, to create walls of heat, and to burn arrows in midair. Elves and cetaceans use light magic instead of heat magic. Octopodes (correct plural BTW) use another type of magic I will not spoil. All creatures, regardless of magical ability, produce a defensive shield the Athenians call Pridemight. The more intelligent a creature and the stronger its ego, the greater its defensive capability against motes. Pridemight does not violate conservation of energy; the motes are simply stopped , not destroyed, and in the case of light magic light simply travels along the perimeter of the shield and keeps going in the same direction. The average human Pridemight is 500 kilowatts and 2 meters, but the average feline Pridemight is 5 megawatts and 20 meters, so cats are used to defend buildings from magical attack. Other animals are also very useful for there magical capabilities: ravens, crows, and parrots can use magic to move at hundreds of miles per hour in short bursts, distracting enemies and sending messages across battlefields. Elephants can shatter Pridemights from a kilometer away. Pridemight only applies to magic; so if an enemy mage sets a ground of dry leaves on fire, everyone would still be hurt by the now natural fire unless the mage was actively producing it. With great difficult, a mage can destroy their own Pridemight and kamikaze, releasing about 160 pounds of TNT. The efficiency of magic is 100% at up to 25 meters, 80% at 50 meters, 60% at 100 meters, 40% at 200 meters, 20% at 400 meters, and ineffective beyond 800 meters. Note that in the case of light magic, the effective range can be to the horizon as the photons do not vanish at 800 meters, and the efficiency only matters when generating a photon far away, say to zap someone behind a hill.\\
The second type of magic is Seethstones. The Athenians recognize than the 2 magics are virtually unrelated; heat and light magic follow strict, simple rules and do not violate conservation of energy, while the Seethstones warp reality in creative and diverse ways. Each stone is an unbreakable frictionless sphere 5 cm in diameter. Every 64 days, every stone shines omnidirectional light that passes through all matter and only interacts with eyes, so stones can never be buried under rubble and forgotten. The stones have a 10 digit binary number on them, suggesting there are 1024 stones. The Seethstones play a large role in the plot so I won't reveal many of them, but they do unique, physics violating things like controlling insects, turning people into art pieces that represent their memories and personalities and can be painted over to change them, summoning bolts of lightning, teleporting objects but only the 3 most common isotopes in that object(so a human would arrive a wet pile of coal dust), ect.
