*Navigation and Mapmaking in a Shifting World*

*Intro*

Hi guys! I'm working on a project I've dubbed Skysong.

Himna is a fantasy world of floating islands suspended by “magic” antigravity crystals above the perpetual storms of a gas giant.

The crystals, and the islands they support and give life to, loosely orbit an immense Obelisk at the center of a shattered continent.

In previous WB wednesdays you all have helped me explore some of the cultures and technology that might emerge in this world (and more of this is always welcome!) Today I'd like to focus on a particularly tricky profession on a planet where the ground itself is in constant motion: Mapmaking and Navigation.

The floating islands of Himna are in perpetual flux, massive edifices drifting through the clouds, colliding, combining, and re-splitting in shattering skyquakes as the magnetic/gravitic forces of the crystals inside them fluctuate. Some have formed semi-stable mini-continents, slow moving and persistent enough for civilizations to arise, while others are small, independent islets flitting about through the atmosphere.

At the center of all this chaos is the Obelisk - immovable and absolute, towering tens of thousands of meters above the continent it bisects, and plunging into the unfathomable depths below. While it is not always visible due to clouds and global curvature, its immense stature and fixedness makes it a singular landmark around which most sense of direction would likely orient.

Various skyfaring peoples populate the world, and they will have marked interest in being able to track and find specific islands as their cultures spread.

I would love input on how a few different types of cultures might adapt to these conditions.

*Race 1: Azkhal*

First, we'll take something simple. The Azkhal are a feudal militaristic society of Dragon riders. Their technology level is mostly late medieval, with some recent leaps into renaissance-era discoveries made by their one-time thralls, the Gragir. They have an interest in conquest, and were once fully nomadic warrior tribes, essentially Sky Mongols reaving from island to island.

However, even in the early days they would have had breeding creches for their Dragons in particular mountains that they would want to return to. I imagine this would have limited their range and scope of their movement, except when caravans set out for new lands with a young brood mother and the express intent of never returning.

Writing would not have been a strong suit in those early years, but they have since settled down into a more stable and rigid hierarchical society with landed nobility. Education in the arts is valued by the elites alongside warrior prowess, and they would have developed all the trappings of medieval civilization by our current era.

I imagine they would have some maps of larger islands and descriptions of the relationships between important islands that house major cities. Perhaps there would be some moveable maps with pieces carved of ornate wood in the homes of the rich and powerful. Some work would be put in by court astronomers/meteorologists to maintain communication between islands to update records with their relative trajectory and predict their future course.

*Race 2: Gragir*

In the modern day, most of this work would have been done by the Gragir, mountain-dwelling dwarves who were taken as thralls in the early period. They are shrewd and inventive, and much of Azkhal's industrial advancement was made on their literal and figurative backs.

The Gragir have recently rebelled and struck out on their own, taking with them most of the Azkhal's newly crafted Airship fleet, an innovation of this generation. Until their departure, they were managing a rapidly growing inter-island commercial network, using the greater load and reliability of airships to move substantially more goods between settlements.

Theirs is a decidedly steampunk culture, and they could have technology as advanced as radio, allowing for much more consistent contact between islands assuming an unbroken relay chain.

I picture the Gragir's charting would be more advanced and mathematical. Perhaps compasses, homing beacons on floating balloons, detailed schedules of major Trade Winds, and clockwork maps with moving brass segments for the major continents.

*Race 3: Kipii*

Finally let's look at a more primitive culture. The Kipii are a tribe of sentient mammals, akin to large Sugar Gliders. They are capable of using strong winds to glide great distances, crossing the chasm between islands in search of fresh resources. They also have a keen sense of hearing and sensitivity to the Crystal's magnetism, the combination of which they use for something like echolocation.

Their culture revolves mostly around oral traditions passed down through song. They would likely have Homefinding songs that gave directions to scouts and explorers on what to listen for when making the passage to another settlement. Certain islands might even have specific harmonics associated with them that serve as names or homing signals.

Kipii navigation would be far more intuitive and instinctive, perhaps even spiritual. Their culture maintains a legend of a Lost City, full of wonders, riches, and magic, that many a young scout has flown out in search of, never to return. The Song of the Lost City purports to tell the would be reclaimers the way, giving through its melody the harmonic vibrations one must follow, but none have heard any whisper of its signature in living memory.

So, there's a brainful of storming. What other ideas would fit in this aesthetic? What tools or processes would people invent to help solve the problem of finding their way home? What have I overlooked?

If you got through all of this, thanks for your attention!
