With regards to the seasons, if you don't want to think to much over them you could always say the planet doesn't have any tilt. This would make the seasons purely dependent only on the latitude you're at. But it all depends on what you want.

With the obelisk being such a main focus of the world i'm thinking there'll be a lot of religions around it. The land closest to would probably be considered holy land and something the different races strive to control, like Jerusalem back in the days. You could either have great internal strife between all races close to the obelisk, or have had everyone expelled from the area due to powerful beasts and be fighting to get closer.

With regards to the Azkhal and their culture there's a couple of things you could consider. Are there different zones that different people live in? Example: The high zone, common zone, and the godless zone; in the high zone you'd be close to the obelisk, in the common zone you'd be able to see the obelisk but it's small on the horizon, godless zone is so far away from the obelisk that you can't see it for the curvature of the earth. The closer the continent you live on is to the obelisk the better. Maybe it would just be about what height the continent floats at. Higher in the air means you can look down on the continents floating below you and it's usually the strongest predators that soars the highest. Maybe some islands are so high up airships can't reach them which could make for tactical settlements. How many different continent might they have settled. Are there settled land with only farmers on them which pass the main continents are regular intervals? Twice a year maybe, and then they have to pay taxes when they do. What kind of celebratory events are there. "Day of the obelisk"? the day your continent is closest to the obelisk, any natural way to recognize that day, or do they kinda just guess when that day is from the size of the obelisk. Maybe some holy object is the same size as the obelisk when viewed through a lens on the closest day of the year. Some kind of special event around the dragons mating season/hatching date would probably also be something you'd expect to see.

A fun weather phenomenon that would exist in your world: If and islands is moving in a certain direction a wind would always be blowing from that direction on the islands and anything not attached to the island would drift off into the distance because it's stationary while the island moves. Being on a very fast moving island would be like standing in a hurricane
