by far the most important use is that fat is excellent fuel. Smelly, but highly energetic and slow burning.

THis means that cooking, smelting, bronze-smithing, pottery firing can be done with fat. This saves them a lot of wood, that otherwise would be burnt.

Atop of that:

- polymerising fats (like nut oils, linen oil) are great sealants, that can be used to make boats (including crude inflatables), sails, waterproof clothing, roofs, waterskins, food packaging, etc.

- other fats can be burnt to a tar-like gunk, and thus used as a glue, mortar, sealant, or even crude plastic if mixed with ash-cement.

- military: they can use clay-pot molotovs filled with distilled oil. Combine with resin and fruit sugar and its napalm and Greek Fire for sieges and ship-to-ship combat.

- most importantly, fat is extremely nutritious. A handful of lard contains more calories than a person even needs in a day, and it contains some of the vitamins as well. Fish fat and oil is even healthier. In fact their whole cuisine could be based on fats mixed with vitamin-rich additives. They are safe from starvation: a rare thing for a Bronze Age society.

All in all, this Lipokinetic power (fat-bending? Fatcraft?) Would produce a fairly secure, well fed, and safe society, which needs for food, shelter, fuel, transport and military might are well secured.

Of course this is only a view in absence from the competition from other societies, which can very easily be far more powerful (likely, the more abstract their summoning focus, the more overpowered the society would be by using it creatively).
