The safe-from-starvation thing was the big motivator here, because the city is set in an environment where there isn't a good native staple crop.

I also wanted them to be a military and economic power, which I may have succeeded in too well. Greek Fire is a powerful weapon. I guess the only caveat is that the geography isn't ideal. The city was built around the fat, rather than the other way round. I might have to make limestone really rare just to nerf them. Hmm... that could potentially turn into a plot point.

And yes, competition from other cities is an important theme in the book, although mostly in the background as part of the villain's plot. And I still need to flesh out the rest of the world, I'm not even 30,000 words in yet.
