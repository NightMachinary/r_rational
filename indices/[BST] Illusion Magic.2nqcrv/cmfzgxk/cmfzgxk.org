There's a Brandon Sanderson novella /The Emperor's Soul/ that uses a somewhat similar system of magic. There the magic isn't about /observation/, it's about histories, so you can take a crappy vase and put a stamp on it that will turn it into a really awesome vase. The more similar the two things are, the easier it is to switch from one to the other. (I personally think that story is one of the best things that Sanderson has written.)
