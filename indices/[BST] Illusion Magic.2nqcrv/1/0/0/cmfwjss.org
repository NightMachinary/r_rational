Have you thought about perceptual disabilities and weirdness?

Simple example: give a short rope to a blind person, and it turns into a long rope, or an elephant's tail complete with the elephant, or something.

Crazier example - turn people's hallucinations into real things.

Craziest example: Create Neverending staircase optical illusion. Make it real.

Edit: Are we talking turning people's perceptions into reality, or tricking a God-ish thing that runs reality and can generally see everything we do?
