But you can paint the box yellow and /then/ turn it into gold, yeah? Or a sugar pill into, if not a cancer cure, at least an /actual/ pill? Or a toy computer into a real computer, containing software that people already know about?

One good restriction is probably that the size and weight of the object shouldn't change. Otherwise you can send up a yellow balloon or something and end up with a second star.
