  One possible restriction in need of rephrasing: you can't change something that isn't observed by anyone. No changing a closed empty box into the same closed empty box containing the cure to cancer, or even a bar of gold.

This was my first thought, yeah.

What's the important difference between a box containing a cure to cancer and a box containing circuitry (a computer)? Or a solid gold "box" containing gold - that is, a gold bar? I'm not sure what the distinction is, so I can't munchkin it.
