First thought off the top of my head: base the restriction on information. It could be that you can't create something that you don't understand in fairly good detail. A stick figure into the Mona Lisa? Sure, we all understand how paint works. Fake Batmobile into real one? Nope -- no idea how atomic turbines work, don't know enough about cars, etc.
