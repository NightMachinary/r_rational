Somewhat offtopic: if this is an actual transformation, how is it illusion magic?

Ontopic: How different can the objects be? Can I turn:

- A Toyota Camry into a Formula 1 racecar?
- The prop Batmobile from the 60s campy Batman into a real Batmobile with atomic turbines that can then be reverse engineered?
- A prop from any movie set into the real thing? If so, hurrah for transporters, FTL spacecraft, FTL communications and basically anything else because I can write movies that include whatever I want.
- A picture of something into the real thing?\\
- A hologram of something into the real thing?
- A life-sized painted 3-D model of something into the real thing?
