One-time pads (and other encryption methods) would be tricky when you have humans doing the encryption and decryption, and you need messages processed in real-time for quick responses in combat. However, it could actually be viable in this situation if they were combined with no more than a few dozen predetermined codes to shorten the message length. Imagine a conversation like:

#+begin_quote
  "FLAG-1, this is COBALT-312, message 87, over."

  (Ten seconds later) "COBALT-1, this is FLAG-693, acknowledged, message 27, over."

  (Ten seconds later) "FLAG-1, this is COBALT-328, acknowledged, message 10, over."

  (Ten seconds later) "COBALT-1, this is FLAG-705, acknowledged, message 62, out."
#+end_quote

Cobalt might be the expected callsign of the messenger who works on Wall 4 during weekday night shifts, for example. Flag might be the expected callsign for the messenger working alongside the bastion commander on weekday night shifts.

The numbers following the callsign could be used to indicate both sender/intended recipient as well as message number and truthfulness of the message. A single digit after the callsign indicates a specific officer at an outpost, so FLAG-1 would be the bastion commander. Two digits or greater after the callsign means we have a message number and a parity digit, so Cobalt-312 tells us that the following message is the 31st message that Cobalt has sent to Flag during this shift, the message is to be delivered directly to the bastion commander, and the message is to be understood as a lie likely sent under duress.

The way we identify the lie is to check if the overall number is divisible by three, and there's an easy math trick to do this. If the sum of a number's digits is divisible by three, then the number is divisible by three. 3+1+2 = 6, which /is/ divisible by three, so Cobalt-312 could indicate the message which follows is a lie sent under duress, whereas Cobalt-310, Cobalt-311, Cobalt-314, etc. are not divisible by three and would all indicate a truthful message. In typical practice, these might easily look like random digits added to the end of the message, so it would help to keep an attacker from realizing there's a tell.

After Flag receives the message, they check for the correct location on their pad sheet for the night and find the pad number that should be used for the 31st message; let's say 57. 87-57=20, which might mean "Routine fifteen-minute check in, all clear, nothing to report". However, this is a lie, so the bastion commander is notified that Cobalt is in trouble.

Flag replies using 693 indicating it's the 69th message, and their reply is a lie. The pad at 69 might show 83, so 83-27=-56, which is negative so we add 100 and get 44. Message 44 might be written down on the message sheet as "We are putting out a fire, please confirm it has not spread to your location and ensure fire-safety at your location". Since this is a lie, what it might actually mean could be closer to "We're sending reinforcements immediately, we're going to use smoke to conceal our approach, try to buy time."

Cobalt replies with an authenticated message again lying about things being all clear. Flag replies with an authenticated and truthful message simply acknowledging receipt of Cobalt's reply and ending the conversation.
