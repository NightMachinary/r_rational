Duplicate + use the Earther iPhones/Androids as communcation devices ;)

The problem was that the messages were not authenticated, so Eve could modify them without detection. To prevent this append a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code][message authentication code]] (MAC) with the message itself and a secret as input. The problem is designing this such that it is usable without computation devices. A simple (bad) method would e.g. be to use a different secret as mac depending on how many words the message has.

Maybe, like others have said, it is only feasible to have a different MAC depending on if the message conveys all-clear/emergency.
