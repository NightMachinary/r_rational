Talk in a language that the MTM can't speak, and use that, ala the Navajo Code talkers.

There's a lot of ways for Silvenia to get around this- for instance, by learning the language, or capturing a speaker and using them as a translator.

It also requires having such a speaker in each unit, and the more there are, the easier it would be for one to be captured or the language identified.
