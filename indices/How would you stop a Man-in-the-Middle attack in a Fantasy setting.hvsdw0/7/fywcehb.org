I haven't read that, but the easy answer to MITM attack is asymmetric encryption--even in a fantasy setting. Your encryption algorithms might be much more rudimentary in settings without computers, but the same principle--that a MITM can't decrypt/read messages and therefore can't make believable replies--still applies.
