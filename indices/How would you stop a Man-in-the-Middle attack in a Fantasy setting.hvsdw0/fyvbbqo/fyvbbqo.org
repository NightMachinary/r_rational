As much as I love The Wandering Inn, I never expected it to be mentioned in this subreddit :-)

As for blue teaming this type of thing, I feel like there should have been another set of codes in the middle of each statement. The initial code was good to confirm identity, but then ol' Death of Magic could hijack the stream and do all of what she was doing. But if, midway through, she had to verify again, she'd be screwed.

Also, and this specific situation might not work out since I think DoM is an [Archmage] equivalent if she is not one outright, they shouldn't be using items that are so mundane. Look at Pisces and Ceria's little home brewed message spell; It's custom, does not conform to standard spell methodology, and is therefore far more secure. With the kind of resources that the Kingdom of Rhir has it their disposal, each communication item should be bespoke and unique.
