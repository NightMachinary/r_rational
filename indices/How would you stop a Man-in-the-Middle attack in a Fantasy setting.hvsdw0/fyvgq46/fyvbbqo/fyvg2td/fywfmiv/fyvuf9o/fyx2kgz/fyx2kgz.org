The ideal solve is one time pads, which gets you absolute immunity to this kind of thing. For actual military units, only downside is the risk of running out of pads, though a properly done setup will have the unit carrying an entire book worth of code sheets. (This gets labor intensive in scribe time if you do not have a non-manual way of generating them, but.. well. Worth it.) , For spies, there is the issue that anyone caught with a code book can be summarily executed as a spy, which leads to the next best thing:

The Book Code. Works for any literary culture. First you run your message through a very rudimentary cipher, then you pick a random novel you can get hold of in any convenient book store, and use that as the one time pad.

To crack this, your adversary has to guess the correct novel, and the correct cipher, both, which is very difficult. (The cipher is required to stop people from just brute forcing their way down the list of widely spread books. Decoding with the correct book will still yield apparent nonsense even if you just did a basic Cesar substitution. Brute forcing the full list of best sellers and trying to crack each deciphered message is just... not feasible.
