I don't understand why you wouldn't have different sign in and out codes for different situations.

This is a world with various ways to compromise people, Seliphids being a race that exists for that purpose, so why not have a code that says 'It's me and everything is fine' and a seperate code for 'it's me and everything is going to shit'.

Even this villain is a historically recorded entity and her name seems to indicated some idea of their powers, so it's not excessively paranoid for this to be in place.

Giving a code that IDs, but doesn't correspond to this situation would then raise alarms
