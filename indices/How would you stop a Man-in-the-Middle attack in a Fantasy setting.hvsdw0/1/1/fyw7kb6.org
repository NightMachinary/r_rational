The Bastion-General /almost/ had this. It's clever, because at the start you think he's dumb for asking questions like "how many arrows to the ones place do you have stockpiled", and then it turns out to be useful later on. When the Bastion-General asked for it again during the attack, Cirille could've given a wrong answer, Silvenia would repeat it, and the Bastion-General would've known something was up, except that he frustratingly changed his mind about it at the last second.
