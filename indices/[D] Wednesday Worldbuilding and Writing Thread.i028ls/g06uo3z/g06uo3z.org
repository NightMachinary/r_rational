How would a society function if there was a taboo /against/ monogamy and jealousy? (in other words, if all people were expected to be in open relationships, at least sexually, but preferably completely poly, and monogamists were considered creepy weirdos at best).

What would be the social, cultural, economic and political implications of it?
