Related to worldbuilding: does anybody here use mapmaking software? I'm looking at Wonderdraft; the free version of Inkarnate is junk and I don't want to pay a monthly fee for something I'd be using sporadically. Wonderdraft, you pay and you're done, it's yours. There's also something called Campaign Creator (I think?) but I've read that it's fiddly and tends to crash a lot.
