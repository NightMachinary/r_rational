[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/17XdKfhcpd9xnfjPEwRIEQZXmxF42gW2ImOcqBrsyBp0/edit?usp=sharing][I've been working a lot on world-building a fictional country]] for the past few weeks that utilizes many certain obscure government institutions like Futarchy, and actually solves the low hanging coordination problems described in [[https://equilibriabook.com/toc/][Inadequate Equilibria]] and various writing in the rational blogosphere. It ends up being if not utopian then far better than existing governments, though that is a /very/ low bar.

I'm interested to hear feedback on this and ideas to further extend it.

Essentially it started out as an exploration of a parallel timeline Venezuela that invested its natural resource wealth like Norway. Though it ended up pretty starkly different from any existing government, especially shortly after the regime came to power in the 60's or 70's. This period is also one I'd like to flesh out far more because it's the weirdest, due to how big of a cultural change the dictator is trying to impose. I also haven't thought very much about how much world history is going to change in this timeline, just due to the culture of this timeline's Venezuela bleeding over to other countries (even if the government doesn't meddle with other states like say the US).
