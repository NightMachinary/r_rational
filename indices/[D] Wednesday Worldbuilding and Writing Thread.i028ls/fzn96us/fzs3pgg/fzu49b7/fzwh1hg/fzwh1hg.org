  When a measure becomes a target of optimization, it ceases to be a good measure.

To an extent this is true, but national tests are considerably less game-able than the tradition college system. Having employers pay the cost of vetting their hires outside specialized degrees with national exams also provides a profit incentive to develop effective tests, or purchase them from third parties. It's also much easier to optimize the quality of a test than an entire college, since you can look at the predictive power of past test questions.

This is sort of the point, as I said in the doc [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/06/19/the-gattaca-trilogy/][colleges are generally filling the roles of tests for employers and are comically terrible at the task.]]
