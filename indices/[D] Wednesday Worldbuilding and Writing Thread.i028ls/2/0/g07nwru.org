there would be less expectation that any given child of a male's partner is one's progeny, but also more partners' children to care for. or to put it a different way, familial communism. so it either shakes out as less investment on kids being "theirs" or less investment in their kids over all. i'd imagine that they'd still shun deadbeats.\\
it would be clear who the Mother of a child is, so we could wind up with a matriarchal family unit.

Put like that, it's not that difficult to see /why/ people from such a culture might find monogamists creepy. it's possessive.
