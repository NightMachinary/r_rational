So, I'm working on a story, sort of a side project to my serial to keep my brain from ossifying. It's basically about a child going through a botched vampire turn after stealing some blood. Thing is, the vampires in question are on the /Twilight-Luminosity/ deliberately a bit OP end, so I'm trying to think of a way they could get said blood without permission.

So, scernario, kid (they're about tennish, quite canny, basically trying to be a rational fic protagonist but not quite suceeeding) works as a gopher for a twenty year old drug dealer. Is threatened by him, only for vampire girl to murder said drug-dealer. They manage to have something resembling a friendly conversation, enough to learn that turning is possible. He assumes it involves drinking vampire blood, because pop-culture osmosis.

So, how could he concievably steal a bit of this girl's blood? Doesn't have to be very much at all. For context, she's extremely strong and fast, not unfriendly, would probably turn him if he asked, but he's afraid she's say no. About his size.

Actually, while I'm here, the setting is also meant to be a literal Young Earth Creationist world, about a hundred thousand years old or so. Supernatural beings like vampires are all descended from Lilith, first wife of Adam, with various other creatures. Vampires specifically are descended from Lilith mating with Abel's corpse.

Possible implications of such a set up? It is a misotheist setting, in that God is willing to design the world deceptively.
