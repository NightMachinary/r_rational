What we know for certain is that Arthur has been in that tube ever since he left - Fel Seed came soon after. Though I'll grant there is some evidence for the theory (timeline matches, "you know his weakness", there doesn't seem an apparent reason why else he would be there for such a long time). With that said, it just seems too obvious to me. I also don't like the idea of "Hey, that friend you put on a pedestal and who you loved? The guy who was kind of a dick at times? The guy who saved Aerb a dozen times, brought it into the enlightenment, brought peace and order? Well, he is now the most evil thing imaginable, take that for clinging too hard to your flawed best friend!" And to Bethel: Should Arthur not be Fel Seed I think her obliterating him would go against her becoming more reformed and wouldn't fit the trajectory she is on.
