I doubt it. During the Episode at Speculation and Scrutiny we pretty much see Arthurs Plan:\\
Should anyone of the old gang show up (though unlikely) Masters has a candle to be lit which will notify Arthur to get there.

The candle was lit during a crisis, Arthur didn't show up, presumably because he was already in that tube under what is now Fel Seed. I'm more worried that Arthur really is that most horrid of exclusions, which would kinda piss me of, since for all his flaws I really like him
