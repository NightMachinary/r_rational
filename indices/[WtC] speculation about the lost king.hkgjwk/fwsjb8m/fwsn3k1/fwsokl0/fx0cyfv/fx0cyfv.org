Yeah, I don't like the idea of it either. I didn't like the twist of Arthur raping Bethel either. I feel like it cheapens Juniper's own mistakes in the past, like dating Tiff while hiding it from Arthur, leading to Arthur pining for her up until his death, never having the chance to move on to someone else. Juniper felt so much regret about that and then he finds out that Arthur is a rapist? It just makes things too easy for him if the person he wasn't a good friend to suddenly turned out to be a bad person all along.
