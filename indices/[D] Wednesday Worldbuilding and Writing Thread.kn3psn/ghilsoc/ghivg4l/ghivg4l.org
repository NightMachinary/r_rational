One of the problems with FTL in a post-discovery-of-relativity world is that either relativity is wrong in some unknown way, /or/ FTL is functionally equivalent to time travel.

(I won't say impossible. Relativity makes it take infinite energy to reach the speed of light, but if you can somehow bypass that exact speed and just transition instantly from sublight to FTL in some way - well, relativity doesn't have anything in it that prevents you from doing so with finite energy. Not that I know of, anyhow).

And what do I mean by time travel? Simple. You can take a ship to Alpha Centauri, spend some time visiting the tourist places there, buy a few souvenirs, then return to Earth... a couple of months before you left. What happens if you then /prevent/ yourself from leaving is an... /interesting/ question.

Now, the trope of "our FTL isn't functionally equivalent to time travel" /is/ a well-known and well-used trope in sci-fi in general. And there's nothing wrong with making further use of it. But... why /not/ explore the consequences of all FTL travellers having access to a time machine?
