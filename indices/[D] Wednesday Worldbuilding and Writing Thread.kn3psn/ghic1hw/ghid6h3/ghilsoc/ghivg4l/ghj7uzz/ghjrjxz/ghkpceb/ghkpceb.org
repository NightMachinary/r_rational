  I don't really get why FTL travel implies time travel to be honest. I'm not above bending the rules or tacking on fictional physics to make something work.

It all comes down to simultaneity. Consider this; when it's six in the morning here, what's the time over at Alpha Centauri?

--------------

Now, one of the central tenets of relativity is this: as long as you are not accelerating, and as long as you are far from any sources of gravity, then you can assume that you are at rest (and everyone else is moving).

So. Let's assume you are in a spaceship, and you want to know what the time is on Alpha Centauri. You can assume that you are at rest; so you fire a beam of light towards Alpha Centauri (where, fortunately, someone has set up a mirror). Two hours later, the reflection gets back to you. Then you know that exactly halfway between when you fired your laser and when you saw the reflection, that moment was simultaneous with the moment that the light beam hit the mirror (that is, it spent one hour going towards Alpha Centauri and one hour heading back to you). Since light always travels at the same speed, it's forced to go the same speed there and back. Neat, simple, and straightforward. Similarly, and assuming you have enough mirrors set up, you can figure out the time conversions between you and any other point in the universe.

However.

While you're sitting pretty at rest, I'm zooming past you in my own spaceship at (say) 80% of the speed of light. Specifically, I'm zooming away from Alpha Centauri (having left the mirror behind...) Since I am not accelerating, I can also assume that I am at rest, fire a beam of light at the mirror, see how long it takes to get back to me, and figure that the moment the beam hits is simultaneous with the moment halfway between. Just like you did. In fact, if we both release our light beams at the moment we pass each other, then the beams will travel exactly with each other all the way there... and back. At least until they get to your ship. You see your beam... but in those two hours, I've travelled 80% of two lighthours further out from Alpha Centauri. So you're going to see that my beam of light has to spend a whole lot longer catching up to me. In fact, according to you, my beam of light spent one hour travelling towards Alpha Centauri... and /nine/ hours catching up with me on the way back.

So, we disagree about which moment on my ship is /simultaneous/ with the light hitting the mirror on Alpha Centauri.

As long as we can't travel faster than light, this is little more than an odd peculiarity of the universe. But if we /can/ travel faster than light... let's say that we can travel from anywhere to Alpha Centauri in five seconds. If you go from your ship to Alpha Centauri - a distance of one lighthour - in five seconds according to the reference frame of your ship, then I just saw you step back into the past. If you then go from Alpha Centauri back to your ship in five seconds according to the reference frame of /my/ ship... well, then you get to meet your younger self.
