Pick a Russian tsar: Catherine the Great, Peter the Great, Nicholas II, etc. They all had lots of personal power, and none of them were free from wacky personal beliefs.

Could a different Nicholas have reformed Russia without losing his life and country to the Communists? Could a different False Dimitri have survived his crazy situation and founded a successful new dynasty?

Lots of options.
