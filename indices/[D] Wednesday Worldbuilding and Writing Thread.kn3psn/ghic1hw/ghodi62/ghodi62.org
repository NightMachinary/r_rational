Whenever a setting includes gods of conceptual niches, I imagine a god of ignorance that nobody knows about, and a goddess of secrecy who's kind of jealous of how much harder she has to work than he does. This plays out interestingly in a world as thinly known as the one you describe.

The intersection between D&D necromancy and copyclans seems potentially fertile for all kinds of shenanigans. Can you animate a copyclan corpse as an undead? Can you shave off a bit of copyclan soul using a soul jar and killing a few bodies? How does vampirism or lycanthropy or such things work?

I'm imagining a copyclan (or several) being employed as a musical instrument, sort of like a pipe organ, except instead of pipes you have clan members instructed to sing their note when the contraption's hammer taps them or whatever. Could a bard use this arrangement as an implement to cast spells?

The weight- and friction-manipulating metamaterials could be rigged up to make pretty intricate counterweighted elevator systems, particularly for getting up and down the wizards' towers. I can imagine having to interact with one of those in detail could be lots of fun.
