Starting in January, I'll be running a new D&D campaign, and [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1myLJHKWlukHTvJQuVMC0AxEj93i1xr1Te3xQpJ6K5jE/edit?usp=sharing][here is the provisional worldbuilding doc]]. It is, as usual, hampered by my unwillingness to write custom rules for everything, and by my desire to be accommodating to whatever races or classes people want to play, and it will undoubtedly expand in whatever direction the players push it in. I don't really /need/ feedback, but would appreciate anything you think might be cool, given what's there.
