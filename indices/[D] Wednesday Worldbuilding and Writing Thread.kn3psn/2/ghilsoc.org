A sci-fi tabletop setting has been brewing at the back of my mind for some time.

Basically, FTL is extremely cheap and fast as long as there are relatively few gravitational bodies around. Therefore, a civilization from outer systems of a galaxy can easily travel to other similar systems, even those from other galaxies. Travel speed and cost rises exponentially with star density so inner layers of galaxies are largely unexplored. This satisfies Fermi Paradox in my mind. Central star systems are also more resource rich to incentivize exploration.

FTL capable ships travel using complex navigation systems to avoid gravitational fields and park at the outskirts of their destination system. Smaller vessels with sublight engines are then used to reach planets and moons. Such travels usually take days or even weeks to enable space opera type shenanigans.

This type of FTL also makes space +dungeons+ stations very important since you can simply jump on top of them.
