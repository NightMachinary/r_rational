Wouldn't anyone who was real be a rational character by definition?

I assume you mean if they were /more/ rational as individuals, which certainly applies to someone like Hitler who was straight up bananas. Rational Joan of Arc doesn't go out of her way to leave the village and take the incredibly low probability path of “holy virgin that inspires and leads armies to victory”, and not sure Lincoln or Caesar deserve to not be considered fairly rational in the first place.

What about rational!James the VI of Scotland and I of England, “the wisest fool in Christianity”? The man was really learned but also absolutely obsessed with fear of witchcraft and other nonsense, to the point he'd spend his time writing a demonology treatise instead of governing. Or rational!George III, or rational!Louis XVI, both of which could have resulted in no USA, and possibly no modern republics at all.
