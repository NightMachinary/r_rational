How about a rational [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_(emperor)][Julian]]?

He was the last emperor of the Constantinian dynasty and grew up in a treacherous environment that saw many of his family members killed before he reached adulthood. Nevertheless he managed to become emperor and by many accounts was a solid one.

To my mind, he had a mostly solid grasp on the problems surrounding Rome's decline, except for a decidedly nonrational religious streak that put him at odds with the existing christian power structure and arguably led to his death.

A more rational take of the character would be a great way to explore the Late Roman Empire and all the struggles that led to his decline. I tend to see his reign as one of those big inflection points where it could have changed directions, but instead accelerated the fall.

Ripe for exploration, but generally overlooked in historical fiction.
