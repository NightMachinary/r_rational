Hmmmm. First question - how is the /protagonist's/ body still working? If the universe runs on different rules - then how does that affect the flow of his blood, the beating of his heart, the firing of his neurons? Human bodies are made to work under /our/ laws, not theirs.

I can see four options:

- It doesn't. Protagonist dies. Unless the rest of the story is going to be about people in the other world learning things from his body, this is probably not the way to go.
- It just works. Somehow, for no easily apparent reason, his body remains healthy under the rewritten rules of reality. The question of "but /how?!?/" is never explicitly answered.
- For some reason, there's a skintight field around Protagonist inside which the laws of his home universe apply, and /not/ the laws of This Place. This allows for various shenanigans, where he can put things in his mouth to prevent local laws from applying to them. (Example: Evil Wizard makes a potion of Bad Stuff. Protagonist drinks it, but magic in the potion instantly stops working because it wouldn't work in his world...)
- Protagonist has a new body. There may be visible differences (his tattoo is gone, his skin is all a single colour without shading, perhaps he isn't exactly human anymore and merely humanoid...) but his body is simply running entirely on the new rules, and his brain was copied over (he /thinks/ it was copied without change, but really, how would he /know/?)
