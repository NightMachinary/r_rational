I've been wondering, in an Isekai-like scenario, what if the physical laws as you know them from this world aren't the same over there?

Sure, things on the surface level look the same - anything else would be exceedingly hard to write and even more so to film - but we regularly see things in fiction that would be physically impossible in the real world. Flying creatures with wing spans wholly insufficient for their prodigious mass, superhuman strength allowing you to throw a punch orders of magnitude stronger than a calculation on mass and speed would suggest, swords that cut through plate... (I'm deliberately only listing things that appear mundane without the "It's magic!" handwave).

Someone trying to introduce chemical warfare(or of course its less violent applications) in a pseudo-medieval world might run into an impenetrable wall when it turns out the basic building blocks of matter aren't atoms but the classical elements of fire, earth, wind and water. Or even phlogiston of all things.

How would a transplanted, rational person adjust when they have no guarantee that the laws they know still hold true. How would you even test that for example conservation of energy still applies? I touched on this in the fic I started some months ago and currently the protagonist assumes that the atomic model doesn't hold true but the basic building blocks of creation can have inherently magical properties, mainly because of the existence of alchemy. Mix some common flowers and foodstuffs and suddenly you get a magical substance(Skyrim, if you're wondering).
