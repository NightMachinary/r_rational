One idea I had was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawus][rational!Kawus]], the more politically/militarily experienced and socially radical brother of the much more famous Khosrow I. This was a highly malleable time in Iranian history and Old World history as a whole.

They were contemporaries of Justinian the Great. The sun was setting on Antiquity. Less than 75 years after Khosrow's death Islam was spreading and the the Empire was collapsing under the Umayyads.

Without getting too long-winded, the idea I had was Kawus managing to seize and consolidate power instead of being passed over and brutally destroyed. Becoming a more fanatical Constantine for the Mazdakite movement which already had sympathies in the establishment, including Kawus' father, Kavadh I.

Many of the reforms under Khosrow would be common sense for any relatively ambitious king and some of them would feed more into a Mazdakite revolution. Plus a rational!Kawus would avoid some of the more egotistic posturing of the OTL and could take advantage of diplomatic and economic opportunities.

Keep in mind that despite brutal repression under Sassanian reign, the Mazdakites had successor movements that persisted in Iran for centuries afterwards.
