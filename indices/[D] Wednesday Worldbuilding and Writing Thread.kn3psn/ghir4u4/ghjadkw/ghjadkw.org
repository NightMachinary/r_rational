Rational! or Gamer!Nobunaga could probably find a large audience.

Rational!MacArthur---who nevertheless insists on using nuclear weapons more flagrantly than anyone else would like---could be hilariously terrifying, though perhaps not conducive to a long story.

Perhaps Rational!Wilhelm II, who doesn't put Germany in a terrible position right up to the Great War.

It gets a bad rap because, in its original form, it completely ignores the social and environmental forces which you acknowledge as also influential. Any other formulations of the Great Man theory are defensive revisions along the same lines as a theologian who is trying to incorporate scientific discoveries without giving more ground than necessary.

Yes, the actions of particular individuals can have a marked influence on the course of history, but we risk confusing our terms if we conflate that admission with the idea that history is solely determined by the actions of specific individuals whose unique genius had little or nothing to do with their environment.
