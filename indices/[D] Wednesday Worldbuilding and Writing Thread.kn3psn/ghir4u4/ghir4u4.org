What are some historical figures that it'd be interesting to make a rational!character out of?

Preferably ones that haven't already been done and staying away from those who are heavily saturated in alternate history. I'm sure rational!Hitler, rational!Joan of Arc, rational!Lincoln, or rational!Caesar have been done in some form. Plus they should be figures where making them a rationalist would heavily change things one way or another.

"Great Man" historiography is appealing, and I think that it gets too much of a bad rap. That being said, a rational approach to history would acknowledge that history isn't just the actions of individuals, but also largely caused by collective social and environmental forces.

There are many iconic people whose choices one way or another wouldn't create nearly as many butterflies as one would think.

Still, there are plenty of figures whose actions or inactions created waves that shaped human history as we know it.
