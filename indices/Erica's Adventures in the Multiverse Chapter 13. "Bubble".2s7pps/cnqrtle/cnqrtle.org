The problem, if I may chime in about that, of having MIRI in a children's novel, and yes I am uncomfortable with that also - is that you may plausibly and perhaps accurately be accused of propagandizing to children. Which, well, it's not really /better/ if you file off the serial numbers, but it doesn't look as overtly advertisy. Image matters.

[edit] FURTHERMORE. Author guy! Have you read /Momo/? Because if not, you /really really/ need to read it. It's a critique of consumerism and the warped pressures of city life and Moloch. It's also a children's novel, and I consider it the shining example of how to communicate complex concepts to a child without talking down.
