Chapter 1 was definitely very good; the "That's a road to a dark place" bit got my attention in particular. Unfortunately, the rest of the story doesn't meet the standard the first chapter sets. Things seem to devolve into a confusing mess of random events pretty quickly; whether or not there's a reason for all the weird stuff that's happening, you can't introduce random stuff that quickly without doing serious damage to the coherence of the story.
