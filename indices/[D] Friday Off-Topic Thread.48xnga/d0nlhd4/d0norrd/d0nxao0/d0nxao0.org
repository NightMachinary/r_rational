I got a copy from a friend full of his notes, in black pen, based on what he'd figured out (and references he'd uncovered) while reading. I added my own notes in pencil and gave it to another friend. She added highlighter and green pen cross-referencing a lot of our comments with the existing editorial footnotes.

Sadly, at this point the pages are falling out.
