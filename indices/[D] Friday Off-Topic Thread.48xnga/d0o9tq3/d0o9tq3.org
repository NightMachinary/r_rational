Developer [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVl1Hmth3HE][Sean Murray's interview]] on creating No Man's Sky's universe from procedural art generation. I loved the part about the algorithms setting up rules for the world. And the planets and animals generated dependent on things like how far the planet is from its sun - so what'll be its water content and climate be like, subsequent colour of the sky.. It's so beautiful. Been really looking forward to this game for a while.
