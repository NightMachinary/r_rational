I really enjoy watching turn-based games, where the person playing can take as much time as they need to make their decisions and explain their process. X-COM, Darkest Dungeon, Europa Universalis, Hearthstone, Crusader Kings, Civilization, games like that. I tend to like turn-based games more than real-time games anyway.
