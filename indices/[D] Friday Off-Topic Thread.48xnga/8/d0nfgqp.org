Which video games do you prefer to watch /with/ commentary? Which video games do you prefer to watch /without/ commentary?

--------------

In my opinion, video games can be grouped into three broad categories for this purpose:\\
*1.* Too simple to benefit from explanation\\
*2.* Too complex to be explained in real time\\
*3.* Both complex enough to benefit from explanation and simple enough to be explained in real time

/More detail:/\\
*1.* Most platforming games, for example, are pretty simple. The controls are universal--moving and jumping, and maybe some other items such as running/dashing, gliding/hovering, or long-/high-jumping. Anyone who's playing *or watching* a platforming game knows at a glance /exactly/ what actions he wants the on-screen character to execute. There's no need for a commentator to explain what he's doing when the viewer can understand immediately what's going on.\\
*2.* Most fighting games, for example, are pretty complex. The controls for executing a move as simple as an uppercut could be completely different between /The King of Fighters/, /Street Fighter/, and /Super Smash Bros./ A person casually watching a fighting game has no idea what buttons are being pressed by the player, and cares only about watching the on-screen spectacle of the battle, which progresses at a pace too quick for a commentator to explain in a satisfactory fashion. If I'm watching a match of /Under Night In-Birth/, I /might/ be interested in hearing someone explain how one move was an exact counter to another move--but there's never enough time for such a full explanation, so the commentator will instead regress to saying, "Oh! That was a great anti-air DP!" Even if I know what an "anti-air DP" is (a rising attack used to knock a jumping enemy out of the sky), I really don't care about the tactical background of the action if it can't be explained /play by play/, and discussion of such matters only drags me out of immersion in *the spectacle of the battle,* without replacing it with anything as satisfying.\\
*3.* In the middle of this spectrum are games that are simultaneously complex enough to need explanation and slow enough that they can be explained in real time. For example, in a slow-paced game such as /The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth/, there's always enough time for a commentator to explain *in detail* the rationale behind his choices, since those choices are separated by long periods of repetitive combat that doesn't need much explanation beyond a few simple tactics (which are mostly obvious, as in category 1).
