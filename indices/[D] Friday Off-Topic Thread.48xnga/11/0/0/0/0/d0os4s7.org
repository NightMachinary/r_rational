Ah! I understand your objection, now. It is indeed a joke; it's supposed to be funny.

You're viewing the parent's hypothetical scenario as its own case, whereas I've been never stopped associating it with the original RB hypothetical. [[#s][]] What code is that? Rot/n/ didn't decode it.

I'd still prefer to err on the side of being overly cautious, for I think it /can/ trigger someone whose sanity was previously unseated by Roko's Basilisk; and for that, just an explicit title will suffice. Warning removed.
