But this is not a hazard in any case. It's a description of a fantastical hazard. This is dangerous in the sense that the story about the fractal basilisk image is dangerous, or that Snow Crash is dangerous. It isn't a memetic hazard, it's /about/ a memetic hazard. And, I repeat, an anomalous one, which is not possible for /entirely different reasons/ than Roko's Basilisk. This is completely unrelated to Roko and has nothing to do with acausal trade!

The idea that we have been in hell all along is a memetic hazard. The idea of hell is a memetic hazard. The idea that [[#s][]] is a memetic hazard. The idea of a literal basilisk that paralyzes people with indecision is a joke.

Your edited warning is even edgier than before.
