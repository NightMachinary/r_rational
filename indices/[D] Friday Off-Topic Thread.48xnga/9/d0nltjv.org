** Why did you make this latest script?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: why-did-you-make-this-latest-script
   :END:
I noticed the misuse of certain phrases on [[/r/relationships][r/relationships]] such as "open and honest communication" and "brutal honesty" and thought I'd make a joke based on it. The former is used in a way that is often not meaningful, and the latter is usually code for being an asshole. Why not make people more honest?

  I'm an otherwise normal person, but because I am brutally honest, people dislike me. It's sad that I can be disliked just for my brutal honesty.

** Do you hate honesty? I think honesty is great.

No, I don't hate honesty. It's just fun to see how these word replacements end up working out. These filters are /for fun/ should never be used seriously or if you are over, under, or at the age of 45.

This script works with [[http://tampermonkey.net/][Tampermonkey]]. There are also other tools that will let you use it.

You can find the script here: [[http://pastebin.com/raw/7XgH0hQr]]

** Some great examples:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: some-great-examples
   :END:

- "I'm sorry you are going through this pain. For some reason your assholery about your feelings and rational behavior makes your sadness very real to me. I hope the best for you and your son."
- "The point is that the relationship fills a void or is free from a stresser that is in your relationship. Assholery is the first step, if you can both actually do that"
- "Let me tell you something, when someone says they are 'an asshole' - it's not about honesty. It's a way assholes excuse shitty and bad behavior."
- "He sounds like one of those assholes that uses 'I'm just an asshole' as an excuse to be an asshole. NOPE."
- "One of the reasons I fell for him was how totally, an asshole he was."
- "As far as him telling her, your boyfriend is an asshole remember? He tells everyone pretty much exactly what he's thinking as the thought runs through his mind...."

And the grand finale:

- "After spending some time in this sub, I think 'my SO is an asshole' is code for 'my SO is an asshole'"
