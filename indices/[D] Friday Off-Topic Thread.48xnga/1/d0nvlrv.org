I'm 23 years old and after 5 years of meandering through life, I'm finally going back to college. And this time I'm going to give it my all. No excuses.

I'm going for a computer science degree, and hopefully I can work that into something that allows me to mess around with artificial intelligence. At least that's the dream.

Money and time are going to be really tight because I'll be balancing this with a part time job. I have faith that I can make make it work though. And maybe down the line I can pick up some writing classes and actually start contributing to some rationalist fiction.

This is a big step for me, so I just needed to share. How are your college lives going? Do you have any advice if you've been in a similar situation?
