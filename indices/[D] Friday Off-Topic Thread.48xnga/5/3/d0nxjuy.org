  Wiki site to combine lots of disparate vignettes none-linearly, character anecdotes and 'appendices' into a broad structure that tells it's own story. Anyone have thoughts on that?

Sounds vaguely SCP-like. Maybe with shades of other creepypasta stuff, like the Slenderman "mythos".

It'd probably be good for horror.
