I'm contemplating alternative story telling techniques, such as using a Wiki site to combine lots of disparate vignettes none-linearly, character anecdotes and 'appendices' into a broad structure that tells it's own story. Anyone have thoughts on that?

On the other side of things I'm contemplating just what a game focused more or less entirely around the mechanics of diplomacy and politics would look like.

At present I'm mostly thinking most of the mechanics end up being about making agreements.
