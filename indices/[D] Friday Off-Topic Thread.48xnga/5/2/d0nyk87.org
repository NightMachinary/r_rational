  I'm contemplating alternative story telling techniques, such as using a Wiki site to combine lots of disparate vignettes none-linearly, character anecdotes and 'appendices' into a broad structure that tells it's own story. Anyone have thoughts on that?

I am usually very frustrated by this sort of thing. I love complex stories, but I hate complicated story-delivery mechanisms. Usually I give up on a piece of fiction if I can't easily figure out basic things like what order I'm supposed to read it in.

(I anticipate there are many readers who strongly disagree. The above is meant only to be a single data point about my own personal preferences.)
