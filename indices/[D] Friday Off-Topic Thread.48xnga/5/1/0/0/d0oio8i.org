Undum hasn't gotten a lot of attention because it's harder to use than other similar formats. [[http://squinky.me/theplay/][The Play]] is probably the largest example, but it's essentially a CYOA. [[http://eblong.com/zarf/zweb/matter/][Matter of the Monster]] is very short but shows off by wandering around the page.

It's a powerful system, and produces the best output so far as I'm concerned, but there are only a few great examples of what it can do.
