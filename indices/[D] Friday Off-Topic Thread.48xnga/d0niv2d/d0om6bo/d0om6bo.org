This isn't a memetic hazard, this is a monologue /about/ a memetic hazard, and an anomalous one to be precise. This doesn't need a trigger warning (for what triggers? it doesn't warn you of /anything/) or a caution, because anomalous memetic hazards are only hazards fictionally. Additionally, you don't even give the appropriate context by saying "R's literal B" because probably only a very few will understand that those are abbreviations /and/ then make the jump to 'Roko' and 'Basilisk,' and this has nothing to do with Roko in the first place. The warnings feel so very edgy. Don't use warnings for things that don't need them, it dilutes the warning's usefulness as a signal for /actual danger./
