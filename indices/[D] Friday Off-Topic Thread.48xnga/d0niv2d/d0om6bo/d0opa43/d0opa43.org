It may be a fictional hazard, but it's still a hazard for some. I remember a post by someone mentally unstable having a breakdown after hearing tell of acausal blackmail; since then I've taken the threat of the idea very seriously when speaking publicly. The intent was to warn people like that. What words might better serve that intent? I've made the title explicit, since it doesn't matter anymore.
