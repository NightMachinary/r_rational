It's a term made up by the /SCP Foundation/ horror wiki. In that setting, there are not only magic books that are dangerous to read and magic music that is dangerous to hear, but also magic ideas that are dangerous to think.

The closest real-life equivalent would probably be a song that you can't get out of your head. Or a conspiracy theory plausible enough that you keep entertaining it for a long time after hearing it but you don't have the time or knowledge base to disprove it. Or an assertion about human nature that confirms your pre-existing biases and lets you ignore people who try to disprove it.

This particular one is a hypothetical future timeline with just enough basis in lesswrongian ideas (simulation arguments and the inevitability of strong AI, specifically) that it sounds plausible to someone used to thinking in those terms - but is sufficiently far from established science-fiction that it's not obviously fictitious.
