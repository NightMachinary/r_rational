I just finished watching it last night.

The good news is that it's much better than season three was, which was my big concern. The bad news is that there are a few places where they leave realism behind for a bit in favor of story and drama. The worse news is that they're leaving a lot that won't get resolved until season five.

Taking those in order, and staying as spoiler-free as possible ...

For the most part, it's a return to form as far as scheming, backstabbing, play and counter-play go. This is where House of Cards has always (to me) been best and for the most part they don't get bogged down in the ponderousness that plagued the third season. The moments of people soulfully staring at things are mercifully short and the majority of the character and plot development is done through dialogue and action. This is a vast improvement.

My complaint about realism is mostly about spoilery stuff. I think they /know/ that it's far-fetched, and try to sell it anyway, which is only partially a success. It leads to good moments, but there's a small part of me scratching my head and thinking that this isn't the way the world actually works. I think /stories generally/ tend to be best when they're grounded in some way, and this is true of House of Cards in particular.

The lack of resolution leaves me deeply troubled. My defense of season three was that they were setting up for Frank's downfall in season four and the completion of the series. /House of Cards/ is a tragedy, it takes its cues from Shakespeare in a plethora of ways, and the narrative arrow is pointing in the direction of Frank losing everything that he's built up, having sown the seeds of his own destruction. This is implicit in the metaphor that gives the series its name. Also, it's the general path that the British series followed.

The show seems to be in no hurry to resolve /anything/. The complications keep piling up and the deceptions keep getting layered on top of each other, but this is meaningless until there's some actual resolution. I hate this with a passion. They've already announced that there will be a season five, and my worry is that there will be a season six, then a season seven, and so on until it's no longer profitable and then there's no ending. Even if there /is/ an ending though, building up to a climax has diminishing returns, which I think this show hit somewhere in season three. It's still good television, but it can only leave me with narrative blue balls a limited number of times before I cut my losses.
