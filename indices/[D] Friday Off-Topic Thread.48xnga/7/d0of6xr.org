How do you guys go about writing stories? For the last few weeks I've been working on building a magic fantasy world for my first real story. But suddenly today I had an amazing idea for a VRMMO. Specifically I knew exactly how I wanted it to end. Therefore despite it currently being three am I wrote the whole epilogue and am now planning to start writing chapters of this story instead. Do you guys write your stories through slow world building? Or like me did lots of you have sudden ideas that you just started writing, with the ideas simply seeming to come to you?
