Short stories I usually hammer out in the space of a single session from start to finish, sometimes two if it really needs the word count. Basically, if a (short) idea captures my attention enough that I want to write about, I just write about it non-stop.

For longer stuff, writing as I go tends to get me in trouble, so despite not really enjoying it, I do quite a bit of planning prior to actually writing anything. I'm not sure how much fruit this bears though; ask me again in a year or two. Sometimes I'll take a have measure and bang out a chapter before trying to figure out the overall structure.
