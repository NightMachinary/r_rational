For fighting games, that only really applies if the commentary is simply play-by-play, which is the basest form of said commentary and definitely not the most interesting. You don't need to know which buttons are being pressed to understand that one of the players is spacing his attacks better, or seems to be playing more patiently.

The best Smash commentators talk about the players' playstyles, the general flow of momentum and what a player may need to do more of in terms of ideas, not physical button-pressing.
