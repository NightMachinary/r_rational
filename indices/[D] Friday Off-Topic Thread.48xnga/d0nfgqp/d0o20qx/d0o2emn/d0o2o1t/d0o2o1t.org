You can pause at any moment and do pretty much anything while it's paused. The games even encourage this by auto-pausing when a new event comes up. So generally speaking, the games tend to play like they're turn-based, because play divides up into chunks of sitting at a paused screen trying to figure out what to do, and sitting around waiting for things to happen, even if they're not discrete turns.

This doesn't apply to multiplayer though.
