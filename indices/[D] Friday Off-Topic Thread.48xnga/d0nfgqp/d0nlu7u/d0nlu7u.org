I like watching people do building games with commentary and people who kind of 'wear their reactions on their sleeves' in games so I can get a more honest feel for how the mechanics confuse, frustrate, delight, amuse, annoy etc.

This is honestly more of a "game developer taking notes" thing but it's super useful.
