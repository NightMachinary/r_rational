Pretty much any spot in North or South America could work. There's enough coastline you could claim a private beach, just use a world clock to check times and use estimate for sunset depending on season. If you want something like a hidden gem, you could use somewhere like Hamilton Pool, Dripping Springs, Texas where it is a cave lake/pond with its own little “beach”
