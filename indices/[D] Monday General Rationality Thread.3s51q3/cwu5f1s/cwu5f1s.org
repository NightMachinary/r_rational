I'm having consistent communication problems with my boss, and I can't figure out how to fix it.

Aside from mumbling, not adjusting his volume to match the surroundings, and flat out misspeaking instructions (which I don't think can be easily solved), he also uses pronouns with no antecedents, uses inconsistently incorrect language, and generally expects me to read his mind.

Does anyone have advice for dealing with those last three problems?
