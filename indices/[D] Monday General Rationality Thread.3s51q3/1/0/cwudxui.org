I'm not sure this is true, at least so far as I learned in my Biology of Aging course. Even unicellular organisms can age. For assymetrically dividing yeast where you can differentiate between the parent cell and the daughter cell (due to bud scarring), after a certain number of replications the parent cell begins to replicate more slowly. This might be due to accumulated cell damage in the parent cell over time, from things like oxidative damage and other stresses. Repairing that damage is costly, and maintenance might become more costly as the cell ages. The daughter cell might serve as an evolutionarily advantageous way for the cell to renew itself because all the old, damaged cellular machinery is left in the parent cell while the newly created, good cellular machinery is put into the daughter cell. I'm not even convinced that embryonic stem cells are truly immortal. They have unlimited replicative potential for as long as we've been able to test them, but I wouldn't be surprised if they ended up slowing down eventually. Either that or they'd become tumors after a certain number of replications just because of DNA replication errors.
