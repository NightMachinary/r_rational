Telomere shortening is separate. Rather than damage to cellular machinery, it's an "intentional" process for determining how many times a cell can replicate, probably intended to prevent uncontrolled cell division and tumors. Telomerase is an enzyme that is expressed during development to increase telomere length but gving that to an adult might give them cancer since turning telomerase on is a very common cancer causing mutation. Also keep in mind that most of the cells in your body don't replicate and are in the resting phase of the cell cycle. It's mainly the stem cells that replicate so that you can grow, heal wounds, and replace damaged cells, etc. That's why old people have slower wound healing and weakened immune systems (the body needs to constantly replace old immune cells).

Damage to cellular machinery is wear and tear. Things like oxidative damage where products of respiration like superoxide anion oxidize cell parts and cause damage. DNA damage from radiation and other causes as well. A lot of the mechanisms for this stuff are not well-understood. Cell damage from trauma, disease, or just everyday stresses is probably what causes most of the initial damage in aging. The reduced ability of adult stem cells to replicate and replace damaged cells as you get older ( probably due to telomeres, cell damage, DNA replication errors, etc.) prevents the body from fixing the damage. But aging is really poorly understood so all of this could be wrong in a few years, and even now these are just hypotheses and there is no scientific consensus on this stuff.
