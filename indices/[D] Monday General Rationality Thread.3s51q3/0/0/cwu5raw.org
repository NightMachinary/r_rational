I've dealt with people like this a fair amount. Is there a difference between written and oral communication? If you can switch some or all of your communication to being written, you might be able to remove some of the misunderstanding between the two of you. This isn't a surefire method, because some people are /worse/ in written communication than in oral communication, but people tend to utilize different modes of thinking when they switch between the two.

Other than asking for clarifications, there's not a lot you can do. Some people just suck at communicating and don't want to change that, even if they know it's a problem. I've worked with a number of people where that was the case.
