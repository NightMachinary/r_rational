I used a written log of tasks and activities when I faced such problems. Usually I sent a summary of my tasks after talking with my boss via email and asked for corrections if I had misunderstood something. If communication via email is not possible you could do the same on paper, just have a more detailed written plan and ask for your boss' input. Keeping these dated and archived can also be used as evidence later if you're accused of something.
