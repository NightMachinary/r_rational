The last three problems sound like they have the same root cause: Very poor [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/11/03/what-developmental-milestones-are-you-missing/][theory of mind]]--he expects you to expect pennies in the skittles bag; he expects you to have been following along with his train of thought since before he actually began speaking.

I'm lucky enough to have only a co-worker who communicates like this, not a boss, so I feel comfortable interrupting him to say "back up a minute; who are we talking about, here?" or "can you show me the email chain that started this?"

If it's the kind of boss who responds poorly to such clarification attempts, your best bet might be intense and constant reconnaissance to determine his current priorities, so you actually do know what he'll be talking about before he says anything. Or, y'know, seeking another position, with someone who's mastered basic communication.
