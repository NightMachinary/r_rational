Currently reading Immortal Cell by Dr. Michael West (non-fiction). One of the most elegantly simple books I've seen written for non-biologists. Aging seems to have evolved when non-specialized germ line cells started dividing into specialized somatic cells to form useful organs to be exploited and discarded. Really mind blowing that all of our suffering and death can traced to this strategy that these replicators stumbled on.
