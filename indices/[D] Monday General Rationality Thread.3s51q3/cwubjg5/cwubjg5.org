I thought of this fun metaphor a few days ago:

#+begin_quote
  Diplomacy! It's a subtle dance. An advance here--bold or rash? A retreat there--prudent or cowardly? Does that lush and welcoming valley conceal a vicious ambuscade? Does a powerful artillery piece lie camouflaged at the top of that apparently-undefended hill, ready to repel all comers at the touch of a smoldering fusee?

  Truly, these are dangerous endeavors...

Where are you the best and the worst, on the battlefield of socialization?

- /Grand strategy:/ "What are my goals in this relationship?"

- /Operational strategy:/ "With what conversations can I achieve these goals?":

- /Tactics:/ "With what words can I achieve these conversations?"

- /Logistics:/ "How can I juggle this relationship simultaneously with other concerns?"

--------------

I'm only a middling operational strategist, and my logistical capability is definitely quite bad (I lack patience--agricultural output to sustain my soldiers if they aren't rushing forward and plundering the enemy's fields)--but I think my grand strategy is fairly realistic (very limited goals--just answers to questions of varying spiciness, in text with the rare illustration), and my tactical ability (skill in English) is excellent.
