Two questions:

1. Is it possible to write characters that are smarter than you? And by smarter I mean in a qualitative sense, not just that they can think the same thoughts as you at a much faster rate.

2. How would you demonstrate a character becoming noticeably smarter?

I've had two conundrums lately. One is trying to write the motives and thoughts for a human-friendly AGI. The other is that I'm interested in LITRPG, and many of them have an 'intelligence' stat, but it seems underpowered. It rarely ever translates to IQ, and if it does it seems to stop having benefits above the author's IQ.
