Thanks to this thread last week I've been able to put my finger on why I don't like the first chapter of my story (the two lovers-to-be meet in a very random, coincidental seeming way). I was also talking with a friend / beta reader who said that the story started out kind of boring but then got very good when the vampire stuff started getting revealed and he said he liked the worldbuilding. So those two things coming to a head in the first week result in me realising that we need more vampire PoV, since vampires are /weird/ (also, reading Crystal Society made me realise that seeing inhuman PoVs where they are being exploitative can work if done well, so I will not shy away from it). I haven't written up a proper first chapter yet, but I've written a first part of the first chapter.

Here's the old one: [[http://pastebin.com/72WudD2c]] (will be chopped up and used for parts)

Here's the new one: [[http://pastebin.com/UmYrMSgv]] (kind of want to start the story with the last line in that passage, in a "truth universally accepted" lets-have-a-good-first-sentence sort of way)

Observations from re-writing include that the act of writing all last month has kind of improved the quality of my writing, as I like the quality of the second attempt at an initial chapter better than the first.

(Also I'm back into calling it supernatural romance rather than vampire yaoi. Probably the genre it best fits in. I should read at least the first Twilight novel to see how the amount of action/etc compares. Definitely have more romance and less action than say /Hunger Games/ though that's not saying much.)

Finally, I spent like 4 hours yesterday reading through the whole thing from start to finish and editing it, mostly to see how the continuity thread goes through. (For example I decided at some point that one of the characters would buy an encyclopaedia, but needed to find the first mention of that. Also, one character lies and says he's a naval officer, but with the new first chapter that may no longer happen, so I went through and flagged all of those). That took /so long/ and was really fun in some places to re-read what I wrote, but the passages I'd edited thoroughly only a few days earlier were a bit boring to read through again. I think next time I do that I'll have to take a "detox" from the story and then approach it with fresher eyes.

It's at 30k words now and based on all the stuff I've sketched to go in, I think it's going to end up at 35k-40k. It will be the first volume of three - it's actually a prologue to the stuff I'd /actually/ wanted to write! - but it's gotten a life on its own and has been fun and satisfying to write for its own sake.

No specific questions beyond, "is my new first chapter better?" and "does anyone have advice on how to do big editing marathons?" and "does anyone have any advice or thoughts or anecodotes they want to contribute".
