Dialogue is probably the hardest writing skill to teach. I'm not an expert (though I do like my dialogue more than most other parts of my writing), so take this with a grain of salt.

If you're trying to write a serious dialogue (this technique is overkill for a few lines, though it might be good to do a quick run-through), break it down like eaglejarl suggested.

For each participant, ask yourself a few questions:

1. What do they want to get out of this conversation (e.g. information, catharsis, manipulation, persuasion, bonding)?
2. What is their emotional state (e.g. calm, angry, sad, joyful)?
3. What is the context of the conversation (e.g. in public, in private, after a traumatic experience, before a known challenge)?
4. If the group is united by a common thread, what is that thread (e.g. classmates, friends, family, colleagues, strangers on a train)?
5. How do they relate to the other participants individually (e.g. like them, love them, irritated by them, unfamiliar with them)?
6. What is the character's background (personality, intelligence, charisma, upbringing, social status, profession, education, experience)? You don't need to explicitly list all this every time, just keep it in mind.
7. What is the character's voice? This one is complicated, because people often have trouble with giving characters distinct voices (I sure do).

You can use this information to narrow down the direction of the conversation. It can also help you find points of conflict like asymmetric relationships and opposed motivations.

Actually writing the dialogue is both easier and harder. Easier because there are thousands of books, TV shows, and movies out there with well-written genre- and mood-appropriate dialogue. Harder because it's not easy to translate everything you've read and heard into your own story.

Tips:

1. Intersperse the dialogue with actions. Actions can help set the scene and moderate the dialogue's pacing. If an action is significant, put it in. If the dialogue needs a stronger break than just a full stop, put an action in.

  "You, John Doe, are a selfish, cruel husk of a man---" She slapped him hard enough to set his ears ringing. "---And I will never love you."
#+end_quote

Conversely, you don't want to interrupt a line of dialogue that needs to be in one go:

#+begin_quote
#+end_quote

Try to choose the actions so that they provide insight into the character performing them. Refer to your answers to the questions above.

2. The length and tone of a line of dialogue affects the mood of the scene. If A questions B repeatedly (especially if not waiting for a decent response) it feels like an interrogation. If A and B trade short, angry lines it feels like a shouting match. If A has long, rambling lines and B only has short responses, it feels like a lecture.

You can use this to your advantage to get a particular effect, or you can vary the length and tone to create a more conversational style.

3. Characters that aren't talking should be responding somehow. You don't need to actually write how they're responding (dialogue would get very clunky if every participant needed a "response shot"), but you should keep it in mind and mention the most important things.

Their response could be anything; an action, an emotion, a thought, readying a response, distractedly looking around.

4. A character not speaking when they could is another type of line. You may want to have them pointedly do something that isn't speaking to get the idea across.

  "It's well after midnight, your clothes are filthy, and I can smell alcohol on your breath," said Sarah's mother, sneering. "You've been out with that disgusting boy again, haven't you?"

  Sarah looked at her mother's dowdy clothing and perfunctory makeup. Why did she care what this tired old woman thought? They were nothing alike. Sarah wondered if her mother had ever been young, or if she had been born a frump.

  "Well?" Sarah's mother put her hands on her hips. "What do you have to say for yourself, young lady?"

  Sarah considered responding, then shook her head. She pushed past her mother and climbed the stairs, angry exclamations following her.

  There'd be hell to pay in the morning, but she smiled as she locked her door. She fell into bed without undressing. In her dreams, her mother's shouting and banging on the door was the squawking of seagulls. Sarah soared above, aquiline and untouchable.

5. You can also have characters interrupt (or not interrupt) another line of dialogue. Again, this decision should reflect the characters involved.

Generally I'd use interruptions sparingly, because they feel disproportionately numerous (so do most techniques really). A person in real life might interrupt every second sentence, but if you do that in a story it'll feel like it's constant. One or two interruptions a conversation will make a character feel like they interrupt regularly.
