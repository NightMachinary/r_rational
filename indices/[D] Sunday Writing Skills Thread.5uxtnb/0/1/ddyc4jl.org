I actually like writing dialogues most! My approach for them is to have the conversation in my head multiple times before I ever start writing. I tend to just try to get into my characters' heads, and then to see where the conversation goes. Every repetition, the characters might react just a little differently, which sends the conversation in completely different directions. So after going over the dialogue ten times or so (typically while going out for a walk, doing dishes or cleaning the house), I have usually found the reactions that lead to the things I wanted said to get said.

Oh, and a completely unrelated second point: pay attention to character voice. It's very easy to fall into the pitfall of making all the characters talk like you talk. /coughs guiltily/
