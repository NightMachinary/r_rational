I thought a while back that what would have made for an amazing reveal at the end of the first season was that that one councilmember was wrong about his brother being Amon, the burnt face is real, and he can really take bending away by spirit bending, not just block them with bloodbending.

Seeing Korra get tricked and punished for being too Gryfindor would have been pretty satisfying.
