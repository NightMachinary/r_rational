  Korra never addresses his complaint, benders remain powerful
#+end_quote

Republic's city does get some kind of reform, we just don't know how it was before well enough to know if it really mattered (mentioned briefly in the last episode of season 1, also can be inferred from minor differences in republic city before and after end of season 1). The whole deal with having a president instead of a council was part of the reform... Not really sure how that was supposed to matter... I think Sokka was on the council in one of the flashbacks, so its not like non-benders couldn't be on the council, but if the council explicitly tried to represent members from all 4 nations, benders might have had an advantage in terms of getting elected/appointed to the council given how each nation is associated with an element.

  Korra partially addresses his complaint, and removes the boundary between the spirit world and the physical world

I think Korra did the best she could with this situation actually. Humans already had some issues adjusting with the canon introduction of spirits, anything to introduce even more spirits might have been even more troublesome. Also, the spirits aren't exactly helpful, see season 4 ending where they did nothing to help, even after living in Republic City for some time.

  Zaheer
#+end_quote

Zaheer had zero plan beyond creating anarchy... He creates the problems that Kuvira tries to address. I like how the showed him completely surprised by the end result of his action. I think it made him a sympathetic but still villainous.

  As I see it, it's not as cut-and-dry as the poster on 4chan put it, but there is definitely a point to be made about how the villains are portrayed in the series.

Overall, I liked Legend of Korra's villains. Each was flawed, with good core ideas that they took to evil extremes. Korra definitely wasn't* as diplomatic as Aang, but she was able still able to learn from her enemies. Also, I think if she took Aang's super pacifistic diplomatic approach, she would have felt too much like a boring knockoff of Aang.
