- Amon

  - Speaks out against a society where one class has extreme power over another
  - Is defeated when it turns out he's part of the powerful class, and therefore a hypocrite
  - Korra never addresses his complaint, benders remain powerful

- Unalaq

  - Wants to bring back the balance that was disrupted when the first Avatar came into existence
  - Is defeated when it turns out he wants 10,000 years of darkness to balance out the 10,000 years of light that has occurred
  - Korra partially addresses his complaint, and removes the boundary between the spirit world and the physical world

- Zaheer

  - Same basic views as Unalaq, but views the existence of the avatar as unnatural and destructive
  - Is defeated when he attempts to kill Korra, the main character, in order to enact his plans
  - Korra does not and cannot address his complaints, but does seem to have a crisis of identity that leads to a better self awareness

- Kuvira

  - Wants to restore the Earth Kingdom to the state it was in before the 100 year war
  - Is defeated when it is revealed that she is willing to do so at any cost, no matter how personal or monstrous
  - Korra is willing to let her work thus far remain (uniting almost all of the Earth Kingdom), as long as Kuvira herself stands trial for the crimes she committed to get to that point.

As I see it, it's not as cut-and-dry as the poster on 4chan put it, but there is definitely a point to be made about how the villains are portrayed in the series.
