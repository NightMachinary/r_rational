They moved from a council of elders to a presidential system, yes, but that doesn't really address the fact that Benders still hold a great deal of control over non-benders because of the lethal magic powers they were born with. The first president was a non-bender, but so were some members of the council (Sokka).

I mean, look at the very first episode after the defeat of Amon. What are some of the first things we see? A pro-bending match, a police chase which was only resolved using bending, and then Korra using her new Airbending powers to win a race (during which she cheats by using the Avatar state). Nothing has really changed, benders are still the ones doing the powerful, important work and using their powers indiscriminately. The only non-bender who is able to compete with them is a certified super genius whacko and the rich girl who has access to the anti-bender technology. Normal people, the non-bending middle class, have almost no presence in the story.
