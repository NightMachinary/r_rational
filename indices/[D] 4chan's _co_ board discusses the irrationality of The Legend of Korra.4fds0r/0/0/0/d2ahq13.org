  Republic's city does get some kind of reform, we just don't know how it was before well enough to know if it really mattered (mentioned briefly in the last episode of season 1, also can be inferred from minor differences in republic city before and after end of season 1). The whole deal with having a president instead of a council was part of the reform... Not really sure how that was supposed to matter... I think Sokka was on the council in one of the flashbacks, so its not like non-benders couldn't be on the council, but if the council explicitly tried to represent members from all 4 nations, benders might have had an advantage in terms of getting elected/appointed to the council given how each nation is associated with an element.

It also acknowledged Republic city as its own political entity, with legitimacy coming from the population, not a shaed entity of teh otehr nations with representation wildly out of step with population (the 5 airbenders get as many reps as teh Earth kingdom!?) its an old elites to masses transition, which partially ut not exactly mirror the bender /non-bender distinction
