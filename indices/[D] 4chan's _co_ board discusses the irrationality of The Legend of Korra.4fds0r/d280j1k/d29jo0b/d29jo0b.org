Why are a lot of paintings unrealistic anyway? Don't they have cameras?

Like painting, story-telling is a rich tradition - rational and rationalist fiction is one corner of that, but at its core, a story is a program to hack your brain, and that means there are some stories based on symbolism, some stories based on emotional arcs, some stories based on bringing moments of pure awesome to the fore.

Recontextualized, you could ask the same question of sci-fi and fantasy in general - why do these stories include such unrealistic elements?

The answer, generally, is that if you're asking that then you're missing the point.
