It's about trying to find balances. The problem with having a sympathetic villain is that it makes it difficult to find a satisfying resolution. In Legend of Korra, there's a natural segregation of society between benders and non-benders. Benders are always going to get better jobs than non-benders, which means that they're almost certainly going to be richer, and the upper echelons of society are almost always going to be benders. The non-benders have a legitimate grievance, and while there are potential solutions, none of them are really dramatically satisfying. It's not a problem that can just go away; it's always going to be there, even after a compromise is reached.

To the larger point, most stories are about trying to make the reader experience something, and most readers are either willing to look past the irrational parts or just don't notice them in the first place. The stories are irrational because there are few penalties in place for that.
