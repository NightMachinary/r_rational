One of the things I actually liked about LoK was how it showed problems not having easy fixes, and changes having consequences

E.g. the earth kingdom from the previous series is still a corrupt oligarchy, despite Aangs best efforts, Or in reference to teh OP, none of the problems were magically fixed, they wee ameiorated with messy compromises.
