I don't think peacemaking would have worked with Amon. Amon was in it solely for power. Making peace and helpng non-benders find a better place in society would take away alot of Amon's followers, but Amon was still an OP bloodbender who would have caused problems anyway.

  But doesn't that character also go through many changes that result in her becoming a different person?

I think Korra has a more direct style to problem solving than Aang, even after both of their character developments... (hmm just noticed that Aang learned to get more directly confrontational, and Korra learned diplomatic ways of problem solving. Never noticed that symmetry in their arcs before.)

  Do you think Korra develops into a stronger character over the course of her adventures like Aang did, rather than just more experienced at being the person she is?

I think Korra has learned to make her way of doing things work for her. She also recovered from some really bad situations, similar to Aang, (nearly killed by lightning versus nearly killed by mercury poisoning), so I think she measures up to Aang pretty well.
