So, point to MLP: FiM.

A story where Korra publicly apologized to Amon and asked to join him in solving injustices. Even if he eventually betrayed her due to his character having an agenda beyond punitive action for benders and equality for non-benders. Peacemaking would have prevented a lot of collateral damage. But LoK shows us in the first episode that Korra isn't that kind of person, even as a child, right? But doesn't that character also go through many changes that result in her becoming a different person? Actually I'm not sure. Do you think Korra develops into a stronger character over the course of her adventures like Aang did, rather than just more experienced at being the person she is?
