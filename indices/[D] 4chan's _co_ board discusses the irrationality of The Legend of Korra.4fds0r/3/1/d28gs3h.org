People don't always want rational stories. Possibly my all-time favorite Anime, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (Seasons 1 and 2) is about as far from rational as you can get. It doesn't try to have sensible self-consistent worldbuilding or super well-motivated characters with legitimate ideological goals, but it doesn't need those things to be great. There's nothing about, say, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BgqFYrD8UM][grenade trick]] that is rational, but it's still completely amazing. The focus on form and emotive power over any sort of rationality makes a season finale like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1YcJkYBAxQ][this]] possible. If you made a rational version of JJBA, it would be interesting, but I would like it in a completely different (and probably lesser) way than I like the original.

This does not mean that rational stories are a bad idea. JJBA does the right thing, and, finding it cannot be rational, abandons the idea entirely and does not draw your attention to it. The villains aren't people agitating for social change. If they are, you should go whole-hog with it and write a good story about it, including having reasonable motivations and a satisfying end that is also satisfying to we who understand those motivations. Make it happen, or don't.
