The point is that sometimes the process involves changing the occurence into something else entirely, which was the point of the distinction

If for example theres some magic in a story which is way too powerful, one approach would be to say that there is a special order which kills anyone that abuses it, whuch could count as "rationalization" under the definition you quoted, while i still think the nuances are a little different. Another approach would be to plainly remove the spell. That i dont think falls into even the broad definition you quoted.
