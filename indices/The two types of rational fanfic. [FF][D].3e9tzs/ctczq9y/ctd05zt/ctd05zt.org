The way I see it, it's sort of the same thing.

You're making the imagined universe "more rational" by coming up with reasons for existing canonical evidence or character actions. If there's a lingering question like "Why didn't character X do this?" then the answer is "There is hidden limit Y which places constraints on their magical power". This is taking a sub-optimal action and making it optimal through author fiat.
