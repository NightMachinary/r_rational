On the flip sides, some stories have genuine inconsistencies in how their magic systems work, that need to be consolidated by the author. Under those conditions, it's perfectly find to change things around a bit. Alternatively, I feel that, if you can rationalize a magic system with only minor changes, then it's still worth it, as audiences have more fun when they understand the magic involved better.
