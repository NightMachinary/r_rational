That's hard-AU rational fanfic vs. mostly canon rational fanfic (or even fixfic). Those are well established fanfic terms that seem to cover your models.

Can't disagree with the preference, though it does leave open the question of how to deal with canon history being less than rational, in some really bad ways sometimes. Seems like you'd end up with "everything history says is a lie" a lot, even with world mechanics remaining the same.

Which, now that I think about it, is sort of realistic...
