I've found that a lot of ratficers (or at least the strawman ratficer I'm constructing in my head as I write this) pay insufficient attention to the fact that humans are very, very broken optimizing functions. "Why didn't the character do easy option xyz that would have seriously improved the situation?" Because he had five seconds to think of it, and didn't. "Why didn't the character put more effort into solving the mystery faster?" Because he was depressed and it wasn't entirely clear that the mystery was solvable anyway. "Why did the character take Option A when Option B was clearly a much better fulfillment of his values?" There was a value conflict and apparently your model of what value took precedence for the character was wrong. "Why is this entire civilization so inefficient?" You apparently need to study history and civics some more.

It's much more satisfying to see a hero use rationality to solve his problems, rather than brute force, but humans are necessarily flawed and those flaws are very important for interesting fiction.
