In my experience and perspective, if you can exclusively do a Type 2 story then the story you're rationalizing wasn't really that irrational in the first place, or there weren't as many disconnected irrational elements.

HPMOR does a pretty good job of mixing both: it retcons what's blatantly incompatible with intelligent characters and a consistent world (like loving sacrifice being enough to block the killing curse), while rationalizing what is apparently true (the philosopher's stone's true effect rather than "gold and immortality").

Part of what makes rationalfic so interesting is the latter Type 2 rationalizing, but for longer or complex works it just isn't feasible all the time. Short stories that only explore a bit of the world, yes, because there simply isn't time or space to explore all the possible alternative problems or exploits that can come up with the new rules of reality. Even long stories where only one or two things are different from our world, yes, because there are less riddles there that need solving. But there are fictional worlds where Type 2 rationalizing at every junction and instance, if even possible, would quickly break everything apart in terms of world consistency, story structure or character decisions.

In other words, Type 1 rationalization vs Type 2 is more the consequence of the fiction being rationalized. Not always, of course: it's possible for someone to think a problem can only be solved by Type 1, and then have someone else think of a Type 2 solution to it. But when you're talking about a more complex world or longer story, the probability of being able to do it with /each/ and /every/ thing swiftly becomes unmanageable.
