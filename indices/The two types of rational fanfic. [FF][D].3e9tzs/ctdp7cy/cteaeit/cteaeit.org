This is one of the reasons why I've always loved the Tremors series of movies. The characters (and the monsters) often make mistakes but they are /plausible/ mistakes. The sorts of mistakes that otherwise perfectly intelligent people make when they're scared, tired, and not perfectly educated about the situation they're in.

There's none of the "let's split up to explore the scary haunted house! Oh, it was just a cat, therefore there's nothing actually sneaking up behind me!" idiocy, that stuff's terrible. But when a character falls off the roof onto Graboid-infested soil and in a panic scrambles onto a spare tractor tire for "safety", yeah, it was a dumb move but it's a mistake that even a really smart person might make under the circumstances.
