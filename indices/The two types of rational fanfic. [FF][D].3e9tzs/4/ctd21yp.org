My fanfic /The World is Your Oyster, The Universe is Your Namesake/ is pretty damn close to a Type 2.

Really it is a spectrum. Type 1 is more focused on preserving plot structure and overall flavor of the original work, while Type 2 preserves canon information as presented.

One is heavier in world building, the other on interpreting the facts. A story like Luminosity overall does little to deviate from canon world building but still wrecks canon by making the villains smart. What category does that belong to?
