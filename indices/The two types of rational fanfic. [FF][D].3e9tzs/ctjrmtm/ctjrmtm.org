I can't comment on the fanfiction side of things because I don't write strictly rational fanfiction. My fanfiction does tend to be pseudo-rational. I try to have the characters do things that make sense, but keep the fictional world as close to canon as possible.

I can comment from the original fiction side of the road though - while writing original fiction, you have to do BOTH of these things to your own writing, constantly. The lead and all the literary elements have to react rationally, and the world they live in as well must respond rationally. Irrationality had better be a conflict point rather than something to be glossed over, or your readers will be irritated.

I'm writing a rational original fic, but it's /hard/ compared to non-rational fiction. Rewarding in a different way, but I can understand why so few authors of original work try for strictly rational work. Especially rational/ist/ work. It becomes as much science as story. There's nothing wrong with science, but it requires more care. More care requires more time. More care is more mental work. More care means that typical free-writing is less useful for idea generation. Recently I've had a hard time even getting started on chapters because I know I'm going to spend at least 24 hours of writing time to create 5-8k words. When writing irrational work, I can sometimes hit 1k words per hour, or more. If I were making money writing, well...

I will probably not be trying to write rational fic serially again, though I will probably write follow-up works to Set In Stone in a non-serial manner.
