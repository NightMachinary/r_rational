  We spend a lot of time here rationalizing established fiction. Most of the time, we take the MoR approach of altering the source to create an AU with as many elements in common as is realistically plausible. I'm going to call this Type 1 fiction rationalization.

Just to make sure, by "rationalization" do you mean making something more rational? Since it also has another meaning: coming up with reasons for your existing beliefs or past actions like convincing yourself how a suboptimal purchase was actually worth it.
