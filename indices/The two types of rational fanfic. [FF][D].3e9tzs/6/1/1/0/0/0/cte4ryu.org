To put it another way.. I can't really get you to believe that a fictional character's thoughts, feelings, and story is completely real, especially not if it's written in a fantasy setting. OTOH, I might really be able to get you to believe that that there is a viral persona living in my head, fighting for mental clock cycles, plotting to depose my primary persona and make its egress into reality. Some might refer to it as a pathological tulpa. The self-aware mind-worm is in a sense more real as a character than the temporary fictional projection.
