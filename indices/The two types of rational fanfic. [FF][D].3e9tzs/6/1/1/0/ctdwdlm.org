Heh, personally, I rather enjoy writing characters who know they're characters in a work of fiction. For the author it's immersive and I like to think that for the audience it makes them seem more real. But there are usually other explanations for seemingly narrativium-driven worlds. Often Mind-Reading Daemon-related, but not always. When I was reading Worm I was nursing a theory that one could collapse the question of why Taylor got so lucky so many times to the question of "why this timeline rather than the many alternatives where she died?" The answer seemed obvious; we are reading a story told in the past tense, and in all of the timelines where Taylor didn't survive, [[#s][worm]].
