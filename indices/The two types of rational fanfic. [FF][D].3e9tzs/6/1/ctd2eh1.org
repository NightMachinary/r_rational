Yeah it really is rationalization in the derogatory sense. Reality, canon, gives you a data set you don't like and don't know how to explain. If you respond by inventing another reality where things are simpler and insist that this is how reality really is just because it makes more sense to you, are a godawful scientist. That is the definition of scientific bankruptcy. For a rational fiction author to do that, they need a damn good reason.

There're a lot of good reasons though. Maybe there's a solid inconsistency in canon that you have no choice but to untangle. Maybe the possibility that there was some conspiracy to misrepresent the reality of the universe(unreliable narrator/explicators) would be genuinely probable and genuinely interesting enough to explore. Or maybe you're just tired of writing about sapient mind-reading daemons, or capricious gods, who run around behind the scenes making sure the universe's mind-projection mechanics(superficially simple but physically intractible magic) work.
