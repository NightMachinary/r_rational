This is the /agent provocateur/ tactic, isn't it? I.e. assist or encourage someone to commit a relatively low-harm crime which then justifies extensive retaliation.

It seems simpler and safer to do this kind of thing without firearms involved, but we know of at least one case ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATF_gunwalking_scandal]["ATF gunwalking"]]) where something similar was tried with guns. Yes, it was probably a bad idea there, but that might be due to peculiarities of the Muggle world.
