[[https://mangadex.org/title/38309/whispering-you-a-love-song][Whispering You a Love Song,]] [[https://mangadex.org/title/13939/tamen-de-gushi][Tamen de Gushi,]] [[https://mangadex.org/title/5083/kase-san][Kase-san,]] and [[https://mangadex.org/title/21431/yamada-to-kase-san][its sequel.]] All four are great, and currently ongoing (well, Kase-san technically isn't, but the sequel is). Whispering You a Love Song is definitely the most Bloom Into You--esque, if you're looking for something to scratch that itch now that it's over, but it's slow to update; and Tamen de Gushi is unfortunately made in China so it's not that overtly lesbian.
