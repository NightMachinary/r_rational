That is perfectly valid. The comment you responded to was refering to anyone who downvoted on sight, or because they read it and felt it was not rational.

I would 100% peg this as slice of life, there isn't any drama, and in fact there are effectively just two characters. Furthermore, we don't get to see the results of their actions later on in their lives.

I liked it because of the brief portrayal of two uniquely different people in different circumstances who have fostered a relationship. Also, the extremely tight storytelling.

The very first problem is Emiri's lack of focus on national exams. An initial solution is actually provided immediately, to skip prep school and head for Ai's place. This was entirely Emiri's solution to the problem at hand.

Once there, we are smoothly introduced to Ai, and provided a new problem, getting to a restaurant. Handily, Ai has obtained a car, because she also has her drivers liscense. But she is not very good at driving.

At the restaurant, we get more relevant background information. Ai seems selfish, but Emiri explains that she cannot lie, making her trustworthy.

At home we hear about Ai's household situation. Also, neither of then seem particularly worried about Emiri's national exam. They make plans for tomorow, and Emiri appeals for a kiss. Rejected.

After a train ride the next day Ai confesses she couldn't have driven because she can't park in the small spaces. Her honest streak strikes again.

Then we get a key conversation with a coworker. Ai nonchalantly lies about going shopping with him, just being polite. Note that Emiri is taken by surprise, didn't think Ai would lie. Because she has always been totally transparent with Emiri, but we now know the statement "Ai cannot lie" is false. She consciously decides, at every junction, not just to tell the truth, but to actually refrain from withholding anything from Emiri, as demonstrated with the line about parking the car. This is absolutely impressive imo.

Then we get a quick demonstration of Emiri's math skillz and that Ai picks up on her poor condition from /a slight pause when calculating percentages/, which says as much about Ai as it does Emiri.

Alright, heres the meat.

Emiri brings up what has been bothering her. Ai, almost disbelievingly, asks if Emiri is really that worried about the exam. Disbelieving, because she is totally confident in Emiri, but /still asks anyway,/ just in case Emiri isn't confident in herself. Emiri's internal monologue explaines what the real problem is, and shows that Emiri actually knows what is bothering her, which is pretty introspective tbh. And she is even very self aware about it.

With things about to end on a sour note, Ai, unbidden, brings up exactly what was bothering Emiri. She correctly calls Emiri out on how dumb it is, but immediately admits to her mistake and apologises for being mean. Readdresses the problem. Offers up her own failings and eventual success (getting her drivers liscense, which resulted in getting the car, which resulted in solving the last-mile-to-the-restaurant problem! Full circle!) as evidence of how fine Emiri will be. Of course, Emiri hasn't gotten her request properly fulfilled so she doesn't give up, because it is important to her, as demonstrated multiple times (including her dream sequence for crying out loud!).

But Ai doesn't give any ground, and instead just freaking *motivates* Emiri like a total badass.

We have our resolution. Were done. Ai states it isn't a gamble, very fitting with her meticulous and pragmatic nature, and her faith in Emiri's excellence. Except...

She says it isn't a gamble, because she /did/ do the silly ritual. That night, the "secret" kiss!

Imma rant about how cool and rational this is.

Ai didn't want to do the ritual. It isn't her style, after all. She didn't need to do the ritual. She had just *motivated* Emiri like a badass. *But she did the ritual anyway,* because she knew it was important to her partner! Holy shit! Even better, *she did the ritual preemptively because she anticipated the needs of her partner who has a very different mindset!* HOLY SHIT!

This might just be the tightest damn manga ever written, and it did it whilst building layers upon layers of complex characterization to which the characters' motivations and actions remained true! Unneccessary dialogue? Where!? The only line I can find is at the very end, a joke about dying in dramatic resolution momements. Do you know what that was? That was a freaking nod to genre-savy characters! Could it possibly get any more rational up in here!?

Mundane!? Guess again! This girl has been working since JUNIOR FUCKING HIGH and has a real plan for her life, *including her partner whom she cares very much about,* to make up for an absent father and probably without seeing her mother much since she has to work too!

These are problems faced by *real* people, so they might seem boring but its actually pretty badass! I can see why you might have missed it though, because it was all done through *actual honest to god communication skills* instead of crying and whining and hiding from a love intetest in the rain until predictably and conviniently being located!

I'm not mad at you /(sorry for ranting with swears and caps in a way that seems aggressively against your experience with this manga)/, and if you found it boring, then you found it boring. I just hope I managed to impart some of my enthusiasm with you, because I truly feel that there is a lot that could be savored in this oneshot.
