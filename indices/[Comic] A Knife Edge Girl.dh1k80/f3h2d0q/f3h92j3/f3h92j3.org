For those who downvoted so quickly they either judged the submission by its cover, or have previously read it and found it non-rational, I will support my reasoning for posting it by identifying themes from "A Knife Edge Girl" that are listed in the sidebar as features of a rational work:

1. Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

Reasoning: the problems might be mundane and solutions similarly ordinary, but they are central to the story and the characters' relationship.

1. Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

Reasoning: what you see is what you get, a character's internal monologue makes things clear.

1. Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.

Reasoning: this one is debatable. A counterarguement might be made that the concluding solution is not intellectual, but empathetic. Because the character who has provided the solution is shown to be highly pragmatic, I argue that the solution is both empathetic AND rational. In addition, I find that the conditions in which the solution is provided are about as pragmatic as it gets.
