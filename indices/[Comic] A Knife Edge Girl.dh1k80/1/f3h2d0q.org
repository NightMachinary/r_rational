This is oneshot, which means it concludes in just a single brief chapter. As a reminder, you read top right to left and work your way down. It contains lesbian themes, and it is part of a larger work, meaning it is bundled with other totally unrelated chapters.

It isn't the "hardest" rational manga, but I thought it was appropriate. Pretty much every single line of dialogue is meaningful and relevent to the story being told. If you don't think so, just go back and read it a second time :)
