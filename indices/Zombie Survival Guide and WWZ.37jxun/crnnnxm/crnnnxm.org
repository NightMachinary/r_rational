World War Z is a fantastic book. It's got a few weak spots as far as rationality goes (places where it's being cool rather than practical) but overall it's pretty good on the "rational" scale. It's an oral history of the zombie war, and is fundamentally about people triumphing through intellect and determination. Many of the failures are logical intellectual failures, and many of the triumphs are intellectual triumphs.

The Zombie Survival Guide is written as a non-fiction book, and basically says "given our premise, these are the consequences", which it does a good job at. Aside from one of the appendices (which contains fictional accounts of interaction with the undead) it doesn't deviate from this non-fiction schtick, but it worked for me. Highly rational, in that it's an application of actual thought to the problem of zombies.
