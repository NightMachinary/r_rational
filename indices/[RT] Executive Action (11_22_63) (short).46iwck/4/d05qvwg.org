I think 11/22/63 is awesome, but I didn't really think about goal optimization while reading it. It's pretty clear Jake could achieve a lot more if he was smarter about the way he treated his goals, but he doesn't do anything incredibly dumb. Otherwise, the writing is enjoyable and the story is interesting.
