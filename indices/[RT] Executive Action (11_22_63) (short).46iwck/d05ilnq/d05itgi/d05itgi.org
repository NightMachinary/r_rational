My guess is that attempting to change time goes terribly and the moral is that we shouldn't try to screw with time, but that guess is mostly informed by reading a lot of other time travel fiction and seems like it would be a little cliched. (I wouldn't be entirely surprised if it ended with JFK causing nuclear armageddon, but I have no idea whether that's something King would write.)
