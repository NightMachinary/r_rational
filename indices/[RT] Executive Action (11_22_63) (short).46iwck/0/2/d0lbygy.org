I finished it, and I disliked it quite severely. I wasn't miffed by the time travel, I was miffed at the characters and plot itself. It's a long book but I kept pushing on, expecting it to "get good" but like chaosmosis said, it dissolved into bad metaphysics instead, and I think I felt personally offended as a result.
