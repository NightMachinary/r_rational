Writers can be usefully put across a spectrum with people who meticulously plot things out at one end and people who make it all up as they go along at the other end. George RR Martin calls this distinction "architect" and "gardener", the Writing Excuses podcast calls it "plotter" and "pantser". "Discovery writer" is just another term for someone who's feeling out at as they go along. In reality, most writers are impure (they do both) but there are definite trends.

Stephen King is firmly at the discovery writer end of the spectrum. His method (as stated in "On Writing") is to create some compelling characters and see where a challenging situation leads them. His method for writing "The Stand" was to write a chapter, end it on a cliffhanger, then write another chapter from another viewpoint, and continue on like that, occasionally dipping back into a viewpoint he'd already hit to resolve a previous cliffhanger then end on a new one. Eventually the plot gets where it's going, the viewpoint characters come together ... and then Stephen King gets some terrible writer's block and nearly gives up because he doesn't know how the book ends. This is one of the reasons that Stephen King seems to have trouble with endings (and the same is true for /many/ authors who have trouble with endings, especially people who write web serials, which are usually not tightly plotted).

For contrast, Brandon Sanderson is a meticulous plotter. He plans out his whole book before he's written a single word and figured out the shape of the plot with all the story beats well in advance. He goes in with a plan and then executes that plan as well as he's able.

(My natural tendency is to write by discovery, but that's left me with a lot of drafts that have difficult problems by the late-middle, so I've made a commitment not to write things until I've pinned down the climax and ending.)
