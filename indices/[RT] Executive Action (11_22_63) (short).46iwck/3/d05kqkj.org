As a huge Stephen King fan, I've resisted reading 11/22/63 for years now because it's been greatly hyped as one of his most recent best and I've found most non-rational-fiction stories about time travel to be terrible. I guess I should give it a shot, if just to appreciate how much better it could have been.
