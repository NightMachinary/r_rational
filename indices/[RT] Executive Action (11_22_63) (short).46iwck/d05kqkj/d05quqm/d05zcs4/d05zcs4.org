Yeah, I think I'd agree that it's one of Stephen King's best. My problem with Stephen King has always been that he's a discovery writer who doesn't do enough to clean up his works after they're written. I first noticed this in /The Stand/ and when I started reading about Stephen King's process I went "Oh, that's why that was that way". I think there's a lot that /11/22/63/ does right, but I kept getting that same sense that Stephen King hadn't gone back and done enough editing to streamline things after he'd done his first pass. There's good atmosphere and the prose has a lot going for it technically, but the plot just didn't seem tight enough to me. I don't think I stopped reading because of that though, something probably just drew my interest more and then it seemed like too much work to start back up again after I'd been away from it for a month.
