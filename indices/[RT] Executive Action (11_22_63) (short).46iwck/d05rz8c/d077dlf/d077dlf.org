That bothered me for a bit, but I got over it. Yes, they could have sent him back for a few hours, got him to drop messages to the right people and then let the butterflies take their course, but they couldn't know what he was actually doing.

They maximized their chances of a good end by giving him more time, so they gave him more time. Also, it's not like their lives were valuable for anything /else/ in their soon-to-be-erased timeline.
