That reminds me of how comparatively well time travel was handled in X-Men: Days of future past. When they decided to do the time travel they were aware that they were effectively killing all living humans. But they considered it worth the price because their world was so fucked up. Maybe they should have asked those other people who they were killing but at least they didn't make the decision easily. They only did it when all hope was lost.

(However, the screenwriters lost a good chunk of my admiration with that whole "we need to keep the connection with wolverine" even though Wolverine wasn't doing /anything important at all/.)
