Take out any errors and unwanted sounds. Check that the recording is the same as the text and master the audio to make it sound awesome and add any effects. If several takes were done, picking the one that sounds the best for that character.

Audible advises that it takes about 6 hours per finished hour of audio to edit so its no simple task. A 10 hour audiobook could take 60 hours to edit + the time to record. (A professional editor can probably do this much much quicker.)
