Dude, this is really great! I was a bit skeptical about this, since I didn't really like the narration of HPMOR by Eneasz and most other free audiobooks that I came across (I still appreciate the effort people put in), but this is actually high quality stuff! I think your voice fits my image of how Zorian could sound pretty well. Thank you so much for doing this. I'm really looking forward to new chapters.
