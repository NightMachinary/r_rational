Thanks for doing this Jack. I see a lot of people talk about this story but since I am strictly audio I have never gotten the chance to enjoy it.

Hopefully there are more people out there like me. $42 dollars isn't so much between a small group. Good luck. I hope this trend continues because I've heard there's really good content on RR.
