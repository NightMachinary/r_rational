wow your voice is great! I have over 4 months on audible listened and yours is one of my favorites. I'm Not a discerning listener and have only given up on a book due to the voice actor maybe 5 times.

If you want one persons opinion, you don't need to go so high in tone for females, your voice is great and deep, just go more natural.

Huge fan already, will check out your other work
