There appears to be an editing issue in chapter 1 at around 3 minutes and 38 seconds. The phrase "you don't really intend to go out looking like that" is repeated several times in the audio but is said only once in the text. I'm guessing that the narrator made some extra takes that should be removed. HTH.

Overall, excellent quality, I'm looking forward to more.
