Wow, this was surprisingly good from a "what does the world look like" sort of angle. Loved the visual take on the various Pok√©mon. I kinda wish it had stayed closer to the premise and just kept following the Nuzlocke run; by the end it has pretty firmly gotten caught up in epic grandiose storytelling and it seems to have lost its focus somewhat. It's ironically a lot like canon in this regard.

For anyone tuning in, the art kinda sucks at first, but the artist gets better as time goes on: [[http://www.paragonsigma.com/images/nuzlocke/candaceink0163.jpg]]
