Since eroticas has already posted a link to a crapton of stuff, I will a curve ball here. If you want a Pokemon fic that has a very different feel, because it is based on a Nuzlocke run, look for Apocalipse Johto. The premise is basically that Pokemon started going on rampages out of nowhere. The result is a world that is is the most logical result of giving obscene powers to every wild animal.
