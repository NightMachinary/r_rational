One that I've never seen reccomended here but is one of my favourites is "The Saga of Kings, Book I, Hero" by Vile Slanders.

The protagonist could be described as somewhat of a foul- mouthed but honorable and intelligent hardass which might not be your cup of tea (but he definitely grows on you and there is imo some really well done character development). The ranger corps which he's a part of is like a military unit tasked with fighting back against the threat of humanity's extinction coming from rampaging pokemon and the author seems very knowledgeable of how the military is set up in the real world making the organisation seem very realistic. While the story could probably not be considered explicitly rational it does a very good job of making you buy the premises set up.

It is still unfinished but there's a lot more current content available than Game of Champions has.
