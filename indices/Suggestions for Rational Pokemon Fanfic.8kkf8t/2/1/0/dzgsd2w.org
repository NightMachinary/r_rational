The most frequent justification I've seen for why intelligent pokemon choose to join trainer's team is that all pokemon are driven to reach their maximum potential, and joining a trainer permits them to achieve this faster.and with a higher chance of success. This would mean that pokemon are always free to leave whenever they wish. And of course there is a middle ground of intelligence between human and the animals we are familiar with.

Or the story can just be grimdark, which I would be perfectly happy to read.

I do agree that its disturbing and common to have psychic pokemon holding advanced conversations in english and still being treated like animals.
