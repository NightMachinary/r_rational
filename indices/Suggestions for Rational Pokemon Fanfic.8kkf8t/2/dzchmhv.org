I remember enjoying [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8466693/1/Traveler][Traveler]].

I disliked Pokemon: Origin of Species because I feel that it went about rationalizing the setting in the wrong way. Dumbing down pokemon into simple animals loses the interesting part of the setting in my opinion. I think it also tried to create a scientific explanation for powers using real world physics, rather than trying to rationalize the setting's magic system. It lost the interesting parts of Pokemon, and the new stuff failed to interest me.
