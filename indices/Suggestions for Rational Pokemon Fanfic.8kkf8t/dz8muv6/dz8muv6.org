Personally, I'm a big fan of Pedestal: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4871317/1/Pedestal]] by Digital Skitty.

I wouldn't call many of the characters themselves particularly rational, but I think the author takes a fairly rationalist view of how the world of Pokemon might operate, and the conflicts that might arise. Still, the characters are, at least in my opinion, extremely well-portrayed with many dimensions and very believable motivations.
