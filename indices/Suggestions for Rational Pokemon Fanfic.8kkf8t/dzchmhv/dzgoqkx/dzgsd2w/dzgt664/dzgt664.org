My problem with the "pokemon just really love fighting/getting stronger, so they join trainers to do that" still totally upends the world of pokemon as most people know it. If such a thing were true, humans would not need to struggle to catch pokemon at all: they would instead be in a mutual partnership, where pokemon are actually competing to find the best trainers and join their teams.

This is what I mean by treating pokemon like people, with their own thoughts and feelings and rationally pursued goals. All the added justifications don't make up for the intrinsic dynamic of the pokemon world of the games and anime and manga, where people fight pokemon in the wild who struggle /not/ to get caught, and upon getting caught they suddenly are willing to die for their trainer/to get stronger.

Even if it's a case of "so human, you have caught me fairly and thus proven your worth as a trainer..." What stops pokemon from just joining another trainer that beats theirs? The entire conceit of pokemon (again as most people know/represent it) relies on pokemon being essentially less than people. Whatever might come between humans and animals doesn't really interest me if it doesn't answer those essential questions: if they're ultimately treated like animals anyway, they might as well just be animals, so that people now have to deal with that reality the way we would rather than have convenient "cheats" that don't make consistent sense.

I'll check Hyphen out at some point, thanks!
