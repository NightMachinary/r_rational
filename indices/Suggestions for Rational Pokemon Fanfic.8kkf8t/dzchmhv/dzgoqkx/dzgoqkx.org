So these are pretty fair points of different taste in pokemon rational fiction! One thing I'm interested in, though, is what you believe a rationalist/realistic take on pokemon with human level intelligence would look like, or does look like in some currently existing story.

Because I have yet to find any fiction do it justice: not only do they take the enslavement of sapient beings for granted, but the pokemon inevitably end up acting just like animals who can speak English (or whatever language) anyway, rather than treating them like actual /people/ who have wills and goals and plans of their own beyond "survive and kill" if wild or "serve my master" if caught (or "rebel for a bit then realize I just want to serve my master" if caught but unruly).

Which is basically why I took my cue from the games and made them animal level intelligence. Any story that actually treats them like people would /have/ to be about the liberation and eventual equality of pokemon to be rational and, in my view, have likeable characters. No humans working against those goals would be good people. And that would be an awesome story to tell (kind of like Temeraire), but not one that I have an interest in writing, personally :) If someone else has written a story like that, though, I'd live to read it!
