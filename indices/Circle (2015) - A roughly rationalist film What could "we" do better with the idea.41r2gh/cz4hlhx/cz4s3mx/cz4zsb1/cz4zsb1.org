I think there's definitely some ambiguity in regards to motivations. I've been meaning to give the movie another watch to see whether there were tells or foreshadowing.

I think Resistance, Werewolf, Mafia, etc. are all substantially different in that there are hidden roles and actual sides with variable win conditions. This is different, in that all roles are known (because they're the same) and players still have to win, which they can only do with cooperation from the other players. Playing those games might make you better at bluffing, but it's a different sort of game because so much is out in the open.
