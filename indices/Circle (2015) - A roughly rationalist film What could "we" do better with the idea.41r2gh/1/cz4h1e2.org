Haven't seen it. I assume I get stuck in there with no warning, so I won't spend any time thinking about it.

Hmmh. Well, in the very beginning I'd personally probably stay quiet unless for some reason the vote started to turn my way. If that happened, I'd try and turn it around on whoever's pushing the vote (the 'you're next' argument). If it comes to random deaths, which it probably would in the beginning, I'm unlikeliest to die early and gathering attention to myself without knowing roughly what sort of personalities the other people have and how they're going about things is liable to end up in getting me killed.

Two minutes is extremely short. I would first see if we had anyone willing to volunteer to die, in order to maximize the amount of time we have to think. No 'apparent' escape route wouldn't stop me doing my very best to try and find one, and get others to do the same. If and when we have no-one to kill who is willing to take the hit, I would attempt to steer the vote first against anyone who's managed to annoy a majority of the people still alive (specifically violent, threatening violence or dumb enough to say things that other people find distasteful). Once we run out of those, I'd look into figuring out a criterion for choosing the next victim as efficiently as possible. It has to fulfill two primary goals: First, it has to be something that leaves me near the very last people to die (but not last, that'd be too obvious) and second, it has to be acceptable to the majority of the people still alive by my judgment.

If we can't find a way out, we're running out of people and I'm nearing my own turn to be killed according to the criterion, I'd spend time talking to people ahead of me in the line and directly after, choosing based on whom I believe after the time spent observing them thus far to be susceptible, and try to create a voting bloc for us to survive to the end. Then I'd try for a Survivor-style elimination hoping to manipulate people to vote off each other gathering smaller and smaller voting blocs, hoping that when there's just two people left we'd be let out. If there's two people left and the 'game' doesn't end, I make a judgment call on the nature of the other person with me. If possible, I convince them to vote for themselves. If that seems impossible to me, I try to convince them to flip a coin now to see which one we'd vote off. If the coin lands on me, I won't vote for myself.

That's all I can think of to survive as long as I can on short notice.
