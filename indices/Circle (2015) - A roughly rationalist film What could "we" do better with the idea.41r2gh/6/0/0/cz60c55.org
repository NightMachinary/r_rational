Ah. Well... I guess I'd probably die right at the start. The most moral response would be trying to break the system, even if it meant my death, especially since the system will kill me anyways. Dying sooner sucks, but the real sucky thing is the whole world where this could happen.

The only legitimate response to this kind of oppressive terrorism must be revolution, even if it means violence, even if it means your own pointless death. Your goal in this kind of scenario is to destroy the system. Battle Royale conveyed this pretty well, I think. Maybe this is entirely motivated by spite, pride, and anger, but sometimes those can be forces for good.

You might even say it's categorically imperative to try to break out of any sort of death game and bring ruin upon the people running the game, in a sort of "The United States does not negotiate with terrorists, so don't bother taking hostages" kind of way.
