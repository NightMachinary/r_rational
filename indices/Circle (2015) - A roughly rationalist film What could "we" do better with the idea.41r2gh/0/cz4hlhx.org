I really liked this movie, for what it was. It's very much a game theory, character-driven drama, taking place entirely within one room with very little that gets in the way of its simple premise and the somewhat complicated plot that follows from it.

I mostly found the logic to be sound, though there were a few times I was thinking to myself, "Your fate is in their hands, be more sympathetic, people will kill a loudmouth". But I didn't find that to be unrealistic, especially since these people were put into a high-stress situation with no warning.

I also liked the ending, which I think sold the movie for me.

I didn't have any real issues with the script. It spends a good chunk of time with people trying to subvert the mechanism through various means, which was enjoyable. And the fact that all negotiation and game-playing has to take place out in the open was neat as well.
