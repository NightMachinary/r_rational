There's also an annoying degree of luck to it as well. Based on your average sample, it's unlikely that the winners would be:

- Minorities
- Criminals (or people that looked like criminals)
- Over 40
- Hot headed

Those are just a few of the things I can think of. And hot headed is debatable, as that's something a person can control.
