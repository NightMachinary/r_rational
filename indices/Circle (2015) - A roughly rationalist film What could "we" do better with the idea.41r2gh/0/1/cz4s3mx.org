[[#s][Actually,]]

Edit: I also wonder what type of player ultimately has the best odds of winning going into the scenario. For example, how much playing games that use related skills (I'm thinking specifically tabletop games like [[https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/resistance][the Resistance]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Werewolf][Werewolf]]) would improve your likelihood of winning, opposed to someone who's studies game theory and is able to adapt their theoretical strategies. Children, who have an innate advantage of being essentially taboo? [[#s][]] Or sociopaths, with experience manipulating social situations and motivated from the beginning.
