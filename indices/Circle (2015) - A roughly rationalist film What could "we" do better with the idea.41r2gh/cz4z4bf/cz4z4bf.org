- I wake up in this weird environment with either no recollection of what happened prior to that point or with no memories of noticing anything wrong up to the point of losing consciousness;

- There are some unknown technologies in use that are capable of:

  - instantly killing people without any visible projectiles being hurled at them and without any lag (i.e. a person gets killed right when they're about to touch someone else);
  - moving objects (bodies) without touching them;
  - messing with my head without me even noticing it happening --- let alone being able to defend myself against it (implementing a brain-computer interface and augmenting my perception of reality).

- the experimenters are likely to be malevolent (or at least apathetic) towards the subjects;

- Among my top priorities in life are a) getting more positive experiences out of it than negative ones and b) preventing unnecessary suffering.

So I think the best option in this zugzwang would be simply dying. If I were able to think about the whole thing calmly and my self-preservation instinct didn't get in the way, I'd just step out of the circle. If I didn't get randomly killed at the very beginning, maybe I'd try to convey the same idea to others first, but I think the end choice would be the same.

Another interesting thing to note is that when we encounter such situations in fiction (literature, television), our [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy][genre savviness]] will more likely help us [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropicPrinciple][make accurate predictions]] than serve as a source of bias. But if something like this were to happen IRL, I think expecting the sole survivor to either get some awesome boon for their troubles or at least to get freedom would be like expecting for a laboratory mouse to get released into its natural habitat after one single testing on it is accomplished by the med interns.

This premise is like that one story in which a bunch of people find themselves in an underground (?) hypermarket with all exists cemented shut.
