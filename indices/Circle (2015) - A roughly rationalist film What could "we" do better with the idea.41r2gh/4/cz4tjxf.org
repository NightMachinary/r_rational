/spoilers/ I loved the movie for what it was. But it seemed like it would have been important to check more memories in order to establish that aliens did it. Or that maybe a human did it. Or the various reasons a human, or alien, might have done it. Or why everyone woke up at the same time except two random people. And use more time to figure all that out. Because whatever the end result of the experiment is, it depends on whoever designed it.

If anything, it taught me that we apply our own struggles and worldviews to everything too quickly, without taking the actual facts into account sometimes.

I thought everything else was remarkably well made, rationalfiction-wise.
