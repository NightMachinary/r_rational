Hmm, last one gets to live, eh? This means if you make it to the last 2, you get a 50% chance to live when votes deadlock. Well, I guess more importantly you want to try to break the game before it gets to you. Hope someone next to you dies (or push for it), and see how it happens. Were the poisoned? Shot? What happens to the body? Maybe they can't tell easily who's dead. Maybe they can't easily tell who is voting whom. Is there a vulnerability to the circle or room? A means to escape?

Ultimately, within the bounds of the game, only one person escapes. But if you can break the rules somehow, maybe more can live. Do what you can to reject the cruel framework imposed on you and your fellows! Resist!
