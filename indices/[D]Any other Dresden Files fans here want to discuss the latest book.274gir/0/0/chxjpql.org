Agreed on all points but one: the coin can be freely given up at any time. We've seen the nickleheads do it a number of times, so at most it would just be a major, but temporary, distraction.

But yeah, there's really nothing that seems to make the Gate of Blood require his daughter's death. I'm hoping that's revealed later, because right now it just makes no sense.

As for Molly, meh. They've got a couple centuries /at least,/ depending on whether the Winter Mantle gives Harry immortality too. Time enough for him and Murphy to work out some long held tension before moving on to the love of his life :)
