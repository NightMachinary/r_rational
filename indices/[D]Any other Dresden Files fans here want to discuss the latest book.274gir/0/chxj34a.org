It does annoy me that the Dresdenverse has an "all religions are truish but Christianity is the only one that's /really/ true" thing going. I love the Fallen, not so keen on archangels walking around betting their mantles of grace on Xanathos gambits.

But what annoyed me the most in Skin Game is how stupid Nicodemus was. First of all, he had loyal minions who could have opened the Gate of Blood for him. Their loyalty was unquestioned, and there was nothing at all to indicate the gate demanded anything more. Secondly, he could have defeated Harry any time he wanted to just by sneakily touching him with a new coin. A Fallen's shadow hostile from the get go could cause horrible damage for Harry. Even if they are stuck in the same situation as Lash was to start with, they would be able to add hellfire to Harry's spells whether he wanted it to or not. Good luck subduing but not killing in the future. And no one seems to know how to get rid of them, so... Yeah, just touch him with a bloody coin.

My strongest objection, as always, was that Harry did not consummate his inevitable relationship with Molly. They /belong together/. Other than that, great book. Not my favourite in the series, but still good.
