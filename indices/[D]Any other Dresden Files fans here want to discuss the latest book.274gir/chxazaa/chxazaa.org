Well, to the extent that the story has stuff like the Knights, operating the way they do, having a bit of deus-ex-machina is kind of narratively inevitable.

What might be fun to see is if that gets subverted somehow. (Maybe canceled out by a baddie's faith in some evil principle?) The faith-is-powerful thing cuts both ways. (Hrm... third way: wonder if a well intentioned but confused person's faith in "everything god does is good, all is under the dominion of god, therefore everything that happens is in some sense good" has an "evil = good" effect that would allow the baddies to benefit from whatever faith faithful "good guys" might have.)

Not sure the author would go that route, but might be something to play with, showing that "faith" can cut both ways.
