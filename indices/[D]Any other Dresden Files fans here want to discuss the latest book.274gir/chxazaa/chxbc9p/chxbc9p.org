Definitely. I was kind of hoping the "white god" would show up at some point, the way Odin and Hades and whatnot have, but at this point I'm pretty sure Yahweh is being held above all the pagan gods, which is rather irritating, because it seems to limit the possible ways it could be subverted.

Jim Butcher may not be actively proselytizing Christianity or monotheism, but it would be nice to at least once in awhile see someone's faith not go rewarded, because rationally it just makes people like Harry look like a stubborn idiot to see it happen again and again and still not be a believer.
