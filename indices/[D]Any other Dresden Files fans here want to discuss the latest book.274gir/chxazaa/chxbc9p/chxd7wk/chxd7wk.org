Honestly I think christian god whorship included in books helps them sell in some countries like america. I'm okay with this as long as it's not too bible thumpy and in your face. Butcher strikes an okay balance for me, and he makes his sales which means more demand for books and more books for me! Otherwise without his white god is awesome and better than all the others he might get his books on a banned list by some sects/schools as his character 'is a devil worshipping magic user', and whatnot. I'd prefer it denomination free though if the had to have religion in it.
