I find the contrast here between political narrative and Story here really interesting, especially with Cat's ability with them. A prince pinions her pretty effectively by leveraging his understanding of the /political/ narrative, and she takes the hit without contesting it much. But as soon as the Pilgrim speaks, she goes full-on analysis mode, swimming through the shapes of stories easily.

I wonder, is this the influence of Winter on her or just her natural knacks and experience?

Also, what the fuck, Cat. Biting of your goddamn tongue. Think about what that looks like. You have to stick your tongue out into the space behind your lips and /bite/. There's no way to make that subtle, in a diplomatic situation where everyone's watching carefully. She was pretty clearly aware on some level what kind of intimidation factor that had - exploited it, even - but she barely even noticed it in her thoughts. Just sort of... /did it/. Never change, Cat. Your attempt to be less cheeky and shocking by biting off your tongue was probably the cheekiest, most shocking thing you could have done, and leveraging it to your advatage came so easily you didn't even think about it.

I love the idea of her making that last pronouncement with lips and teeth still stained red with her own blood.
