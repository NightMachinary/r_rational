Sort of a random question, but was it ever explained what lead Black to choose Cat as his Squire?

I would say her two biggest strengths are her ability to work with Stories (as demonstrated in this chapter and elsewhere) and her charisma, but I have trouble thinking of any cases where she demonstrated those traits before Black chose her. I know Black had her (among many others) under observation, but she was pretty much a loner at the orphanage and I don't know what she would have done that would indicate Story adeptness to Black.
