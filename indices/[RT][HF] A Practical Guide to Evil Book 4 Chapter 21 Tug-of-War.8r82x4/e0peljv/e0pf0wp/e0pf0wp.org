I think it was just him caputalizing on a narratively obvious opportunity. He needs to break Callow and Praes's stories, and tie them together in a way that will outlast him. What better way to at least start down that path than to train a villain born in Callow, with ties to both nations?

In hindsight it all looks like he planned her rise to power, and at least by book 2 it seems like that was his long-term design, but i think early on it was just him seizing a fateful opportunity.

...in fact, i wonder if the Gods Below /arranged/ for Black to show up in that alleyway? Hmm...
