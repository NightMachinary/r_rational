It may make sense from an in-universe narrative shenanigans (like the oath to Hakram or Archer's detached attitude being weak death flags), but I doubt the author would exchange them for characters introduced only in this book.

I mean, /Wildbow/ couldn't pull that off well, and he used better established characters as the new teammates, it made sense in the context of the existing plot and the mood of the arc reflected the detachment of the protagonist from the new state of things. Anid it's /still/ the least appreciated arc.
