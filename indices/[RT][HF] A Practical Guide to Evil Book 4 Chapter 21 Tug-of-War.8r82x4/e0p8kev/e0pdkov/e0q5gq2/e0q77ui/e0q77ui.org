That's why I doubt it's the plan. Everything points to Catherine being the next Dread Empress, except that Cat herself would hate it and she's getting very proficient at breaking stories she wants nothing to do with.

That said, my dream bet for an ending is Catherine being crowned Dread Empress and taking Amadeus as her Black Knight, mirroring their meeting at the very start. It probably won't happen but a man can believe.
