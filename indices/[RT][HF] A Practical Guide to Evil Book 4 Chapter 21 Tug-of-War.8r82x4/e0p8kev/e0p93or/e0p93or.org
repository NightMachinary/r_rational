To add on to that, Cat didn't mention breaking off from the Tower nor agreeing to attack Praes. She's implying that Callow wants to join the Grand Alliance against Evil.

My guess? There's one more Evil north of Procer, the Dead Kingdom. Cat is going turn the Alliance's force towards the Dead Kingdom instead of Callow & Praes. This brings the battlefield away from Callow to Procer, keeps the ties between Callow & Praes, breaks the story of Praes being Evil (and hence Black's motivation) and adds to the reason for the Dead King's awakening at the end of Book 3.
