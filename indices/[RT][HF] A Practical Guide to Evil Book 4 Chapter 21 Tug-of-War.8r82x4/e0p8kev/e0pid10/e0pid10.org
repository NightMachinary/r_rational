She's got two options here. The first is that she's rebuffed. Good narrative. Queen tries to be good, good guys sneer and send her off. Not part of 'their' crowd but she tried. Sticks to her own kingdom, her own people. The Queen in Callow rules her people and doesn't take sides. She's 'good' or at least 'neutral' which should fool the Hashmallim. Probably the best she can hope for unless she's got Ranger hiding in a pocket to crash the negotiations.

Second is that she does join, and god only knows where that leads.
