As am I. I think you're going to see some objections, especially from Praesi sections of the officer core.

The loyalty of an army to its leader, especially an undefeated leader, is not to be underestimated.

I think you will see a group of Praesi object, but not with hatred or vitriol. I do wonder if we will see a lone wolf assassination attempt, and who it would be from.
