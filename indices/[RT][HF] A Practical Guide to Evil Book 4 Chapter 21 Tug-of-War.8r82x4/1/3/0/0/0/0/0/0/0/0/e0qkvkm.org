I think Hune will voice dissent if it is about the Army more generally.

The classic Hune objection is over the great loss of life and leaving the mortals to face down the heroes alone. The rate of attrition frankly has been unacceptable.

What makes me think that any immediate objection won't be coming from Hune is the fact that Cat went out of her way to sue for peace, when from the outside it may have seemed easier for Cat to press her advantage.

Might even win some points with Hune for it (fat chance).

Sooner or later though, the Praesi loyalists (to what extent anyone is loyal to the tower system) will need to come to terms with the fact that they serve a Callowan.
