The Angels would demand penitence and redress in the form of servitude or something similar should she want what you said to be more than a farce. Remember she did mug an Angel and did claim one of their own (The Stalwart Paladin). Sins the Angels would be inclined to forgive if she would make appropriate redress. Given her nature we can be assured that is not going to happen.

There are no antiheroes in Calernia. The closest approximation to an anti-hero is a Neutral Name like Ranger for example. So no, either she becomes completely good, in which case she'd need to swear to a choir or she becomes a neutral entity.
