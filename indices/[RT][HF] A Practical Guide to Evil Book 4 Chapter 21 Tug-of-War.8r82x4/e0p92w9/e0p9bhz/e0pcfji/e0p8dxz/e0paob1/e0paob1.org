  If he was spying on the leaders of the northern crusade, that was a possible angle for Thief to exploit. Turning him seemed unlikely, but if his spying apparatus could be infiltrated... Something to discuss with her later. I made a note to have Vivienne dig deeper into the man, as there was apparently more to him than his reputation.

We know from Pilgrim's interlude that Arnaud is a sociopath. I don't know if that would make him less likely to be fazed by the intervention of a Named, but given that Rozala knew /something/ disturbing enough about him, the investigation may well bring (or tie up) a minor plot thread.

  We also knew, from Masego, that they were at least a decade behind Praesi spell formulas when it came to that, which meant they couldn't do relays and their range was limited: they could chain the reports manually, but that was tricky business.

Didn't Klaus mention in the very first Interlude of this book that at least the mages sent with the Ashuran fleet were there as relays? That's a foreshadowing of Catherine trying to capitalize on the delay and getting blindsided if I ever saw one.

  I had beaten her, or at least she believed as much. According to the sack full of razor blades that was Praesi philosophy, that meant she was my follower now.

That, and I suspect some of Catherine's personality might have bled over from using Winter, given how it was described. I mean, just compare the tone of something like [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/01/17/villainous-interlude-crescendo/][interlude Crescendo]] and [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/06/04/kaleidoscope-vi/][Kaleidoscope VI]]: the shift isn't from just Akua /playing/ a more herosic role, or from being in a less powerful position, but also from a different perspective on using her power as simply a means to a broader end rather than part of the plan. Well, and from more self-awareness too.
