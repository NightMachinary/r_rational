Isn't this whole thing still foredoomed to end in the Princes' Graveyard? I'm calling it that by doing this she bends the Named into an impossible position and Pilgrim sacrifices himself by breaking truce, to prevent either becoming her mentor or some worse fate. She ends up killing the lot of them, but has to make good on the follow-through with the Grand Alliance and somehow ends up in the group of five with Saint. Buddy-cop tale of the year!
