  Tyrant would definitely not approve. He might even end friendship with Catherine and go for a new friendship with Black or Malicia.

Disagree, Tyrant acts mad to pursue long term unknown goals. Also, he loves wrecking shit(which may be is actual long term goal, similalr to Cat that way). Cat loves wrecking shit too and this statement was a giant wrecking ball. I don't doubt he'll mock cry about the betrayal, but he at least recognizes Cat as a player of the game of the highest order.
