I think it would be a serious concern, if Cat gone any farther than signaling her intention of join the alliance.

She's not joining the crusade and marching against Praes. She's not even joining the alliance with any sort of alacrity.

Cat has a full year to go back, or to spin this choice to her people. We don't know what she intends to make public.

What exactly is going to motivate an assassin?

Edit: I think you'll see dissent, and perhaps plenty of it. But if you look at what her actions will be doing, especially in the short term?

She beat the invaders down, with a numerical disadvantage. She defeated a crusading army, and forced them to leave without a speck of Callowan land.

Who exactly is complaining? The Army knows how badly it would have gone, to keep fighting.
