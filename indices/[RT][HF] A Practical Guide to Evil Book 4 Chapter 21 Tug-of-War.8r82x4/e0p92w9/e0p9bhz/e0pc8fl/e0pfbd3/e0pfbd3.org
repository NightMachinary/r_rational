Good point. "The good guys magnanimously let in a supposedly reformed villain who later betrays them" is a Story, and "The good guys magnanimously let in an actually reformed villain who becomes a steadfast ally" is a Story. But I've very rarely seen a story where the good guys outright reject a villain's offer to join their side, and when they do it's usually a mistake.
