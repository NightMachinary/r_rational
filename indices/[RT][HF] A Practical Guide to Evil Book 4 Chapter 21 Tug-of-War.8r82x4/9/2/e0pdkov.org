Or not. Right now, it's a narrative that leads straight to backstabbing former friends, though she can seize that to topple the Tower, sit on the throne and say "Look, I'm the Dread Empress now". Her Praesi allies would applaude at how beautiful it would be, but I doubt that's the plan.

Of course, if it were to turn out that a certain Dead King is getting involved in the crusade at the invitation of Malicia, well, Catherine has all the excuses she needs to frame her move as "Lesser Evil cooperates with Good to stop Greater Evil gone batshine bonkers". Which is her preferred narrative from the very start.
