  There would be a time, after the war turned here and the Red Flower Vales broke, where the Heavens would assemble their sharpest blade. The ancient forms would be observed. Five heroes, sent into the breach to quell the howling dark. Young Hanno would lead them, for the Seraphim had shaped him to the duty. As for the faces of the others, they could only guess. That charming young Valiant Champion was likely, as she'd followed the White Knight before. And there would have to be a practitioner. The most powerful of these was the Witch of the Woods, should she survive her confrontation with the Warlock. And the two of us, the Pilgrim added silently. Relics of an age already past, dusted off one last time. There was always a price to pay, to end the rise of Evil. Tariq hoped it was the two of them instead of young lives cut down before their prime.

Regarding who'll join in the end, other than Akua I hope (from the perspective of somebody who is unironically rooting for theam Practical Evil) to see Hanno and the Bard on it. Hanno - because there're no other unaffiliated hero that could qualify as a leader in the sense of having "his own" agenda, and Bard - because, if [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/07/19/chapter-20-skew/][Thief's speculation]] is correct, then Bard's presence in the band would be a placeholder for the Valiant Champion (who'd hopefully get killed at the Red Flower Vales, otherwise we have a monster hunter facing the legions led by an orc, a vampire and a dragon). Also, Bard's presence and advice has a big chance to backfire for the heroes around her, after seeing the Bard in a new body Hanno and Akua would finally start asking questions, and Seraphim and/or Bard directly guiding the Crusade [[https://old.reddit.com/r/PracticalGuideToEvil/comments/8klqa0/thoughts_on_hierarch/dz96ihe/][would leave them open for reaping the consequences of that]].
