Malicia's reason for keeping the Gestalt was to have a means of getting to that negotiating table since Procer will never deal with Evil otherwise. Cat's background puts her in a perfect position to try to work a lasting peace between to forces of Good and Evil. Before Callow was merely the stage for the East and West to kill each other. Now, Callow may yet be the stage where Good and Evil finally settle their differences and seek a condition where they can prosper together.

... Psssshthahahaha, yeah like that would ever happen. The agents above and below demand blood and the grooves are too well worn into Creation. Still, narratively speaking, it would be a very nice ending to Cat's story if she could broker peace between the Principate and Praes.
