I feel that the Army of Callow's loyalty to its warleader is not to be underestimate.

She has lead them through hell and come out victorious, time and time again.

She is the final great hope for Callowan independence.

She, as the inheritor of Black's legacy, has orcs in important positions of power within the (often victorious) warband, and within her inner circle.

She has allowed the goblins to settle in Callow, and is close with several.

You've got something for every party in there, and enemies of Cat within the army will have to keep their heads so far down they come out the other side.
