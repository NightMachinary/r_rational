Let's look at the potential impacts of this...

- Malicia is definitely going to find out about this, but the question is whether being it's a signatory constitutes rebellion or whether the intention itself can be interpreted as such... Both Cat and Malicia have /some/ room to maneuver at least, so that's probably fine, but definitely puts Malicia in an advantageous position with regards to Catherine. She can't really do much with it at the moment (Thanks Ashur!) but it will definitely come into play in their next scrying and Cat will have to be very careful treading these waters.
- Black and Malicia's current relationship is also similar to Cat and Malicia, which means he will eventually be an independent power in Calernia (assuming he survives the battle of the Vales). Cat's action here might give him precedent to do something similar with the Papenheim, but that's going to be difficult to pull off. Black views things practically so he probably would only see the joining of the alliance as a textbook "villain infiltrates heroes to gain advantage, maybe betray them later" move by Cat. He would approve.
- Tyrant would definitely not approve. He might even end friendship with Catherine and go for a new friendship with Black or Malicia. (Edit: Everyone missed my attempt at the "friendship broken" meme, FeelsBadMan).
- Hasenbach's position has just come under a powerful attack by that single line from Catherine. She will definitely have to reconsider a /lot/ of things about Catherine, decide whether she can even enter the alliance, and deal with the consequences of either decision. Both of which seem quite bad for her. Declining the request here and now rejects a potential villanous redemption arc and that would horribly weaken their side narratively. But allowing her in her Alliance also means acknowledging Callow as an independent entity and all the political bullshit that comes from it. Her life just got a lot harder.
- Army of Callow... she has their trust for now, but that will definitely see some shaking in the coming chapters. I'm guessing this is where the story will focus on, the loyalties of Cat's minions to her and the impact of this decision on it.

All in all that was a *bold* move by Cat. Can't wait to see how this plays out!
