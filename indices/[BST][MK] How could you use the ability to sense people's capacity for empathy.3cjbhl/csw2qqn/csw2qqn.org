First things first. Look in the mirror, to calibrate my expectations of this power. I have some sociopathic tendencies, and don't really emotionally care about other people much, but intellectually I've chosen to do my best to help humanity anyway.

Then I'd probably give in to my curiosity and go on a wikipedia binge on various important movers and shakers.

After that, I'd start thinking on how to actually use the power. It's not exactly simple or fast to prove to anyone you've got it, but first I'd need to try and figure out whether revealing it would be very useful. I wouldn't just trust myself for this evaluation, instead asking a number of other people whom I believe are intelligent enough to contribute (such as you're doing here), but off the top of my head I might aim for becoming a career diplomat in the EU.
