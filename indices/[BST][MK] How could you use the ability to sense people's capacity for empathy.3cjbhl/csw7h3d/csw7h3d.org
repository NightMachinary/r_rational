But I could work with Paul Ekman's group to develop better software on microexpressions.

Then, I'd use his connections to get video footage of various terrorists, violent criminals and other threats and analyze them for the days to weeks before their crimes and tag various sections to flag dangerous signals. To avoid a confirmation bias, I'd also use video clips from people wrongfully accused of crimes, people in an insane asylum, etc.

Then, "Minority Report" style, I'd help to develop a program that can use standard phone cameras, security footage and traffic cams to filter through the population and identify people 'at-risk' for committing a violent crime. I'd be able to predict a crime before its committed(?) or identify past offenders. We'd start with the really big headline-catchers at first.

Here's the critical piece. I'd contact them before they crack. Many of them would be highly paranoid, fundamentalist in their religious beliefs or otherwise difficult to get through to. Using my ability to cold-read and my knowledge of their activities, I'd be able to quickly bypass many of their defenses and I'd disarm them and get them to therapists I've screened for compatibility and get them to take psychoactive medications as prescribed by physicians I trust.
