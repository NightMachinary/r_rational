I've never understood how/why authors that start a serial for free think that it's a good idea to stunt the growth of the audience and put some of it behind a paywall. Doesn't this just result in natural attrition and over time a failure in support?

I would also add that I am an enfranchised member of the serial community, I have several authors that I support on patreon.
