I think part of it is the story imports a lot of cultivation novel background/tropes without actually doing enough worldbuilding to really justify it. IE, it's just kinda never stated that as the heir to a sizeable clan without the ability to advance in cultivation he's probably looking at an assassination 10 or 15 years down the line if he doesn't do anything to change his situation. He's both a liability to his family, kinda an embarrassment, and a dangerously tempting target for an ambitious uncle or nephew. And we never really get the characterization for why Tingfeng is willing to just murder a guy whose existence is a mild inconvenience for him, but if you've read enough Xianxia stories your mind basically goes, oh, yeah, core disciple of some bigwig sect, massive entitlement and casual disregard for the lives of others pretty much comes part and parcel with that. The conflicts could work, but the social dynamics driving them aren't sufficiently fleshed out. There's a good story here, but it needs a heavy editing pass to really shine.
