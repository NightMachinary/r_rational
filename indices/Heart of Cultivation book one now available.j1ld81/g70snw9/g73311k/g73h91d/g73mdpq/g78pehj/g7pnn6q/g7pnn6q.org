If an assassination is in the cards, there is not much indication given by Jian that such a thing will happen. He's also a son of a second or third son of the patriarch, pretty well enough down a typical feudal line of succession. The thing is your typical line of succession is made irrelevant if someone has greater cultivation. The whole clan isn't going to just hand responsibility to some guy like Jian if there's more powerful people around, no matter who his father may be. He also has more powerful cousins who would be given a leadership role regardless of whose son he is, they don't even need to murder the guy. You're right about how motivations could be more fleshed out though.
