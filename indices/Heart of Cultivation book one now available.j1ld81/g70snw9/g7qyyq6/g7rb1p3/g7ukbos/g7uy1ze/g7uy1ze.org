I don't think that parses that well. You can't just point to the top 20 or so... anything, and expect anyone else to reach that level.

That's like saying the top 20 businessmen all make billions. It's factually true, but woefully oversimplified.

Hell, I'm /in/ the top 20 on RR and I wish I made 4-5K a month on Patreon. Maybe I'll get there one day, but even full-assing it as I am it'll take a lot of time and effort. I'm pretty sure I could be making more money doing as Jacob's doing if I were to jump platforms too, but I don't because of a few reasons (that are not part of this discussion in particular).

Knowing Jacob as I do, he put a lot of thought into it, and is doing this partially as an experiment to see which venue and platform is best in the long run.
