First, I won't pretend to have any knowledge about this subject beyond just having supported some author's patreons and snooped on many more.

Anyway, I think that the ceiling of amazon and kindle is obviously much higher, and if I had to choose one to bet all my chips on, it would be there, no question. But taking into consideration that he already makes $1k from only 2.7k or so followers (averaged between his two stories), it makes sense that he isn't at near his peak potential readership there. It seems almost a sure thing that his followers would continue to go up if the story were still on RR, while there is no guarantee that the almighty algorithm will favor him with a receptive audience on amazon.

While you might say that there is no guarantee that he would increase his income proportionately to his readership, I would reply that he hits all the essential checkboxes for a popular story on RR:

☑ litrpg or xianxia\\
☑ power fantasy\\
☑ big reserve of chapters for patrons\\
☑ frequent/daily updates

I speculate that the last one is particularly important, being the common denominator between all the high earning stories, from what I can see.

That all said, I think his prime earner is probably Solomon, and taking Heart of Cultivation from RR is likely an experiment to see if he should do the same with SC. In which case, very smart. Hope it works out for him.
