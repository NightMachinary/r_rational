Don't forget that once a story has passed its Trending phase on RR it's exceptionally difficult to advertise it to the RR crowd unless you manage to land in the first few pages of Best Rated. Amazon and Kindle U are much more accessible for an author once a story is complete.

Also, Patreon has plateaus. I've been hovering at 500 for a while now. It's not always a steady growth.
