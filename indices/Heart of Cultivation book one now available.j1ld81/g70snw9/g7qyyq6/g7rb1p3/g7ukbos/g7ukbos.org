I think the gist of [[/u/Gofarman]]'s critique is that the money you make by focusing on the webserial route and growing your audience would likely be more than if you split your focus and remove your story from the web to sell it on kindle unlimited, as jacobk has done.

It's hard to say for sure. I know the income for patreon supported webserial can be pretty decent, as most of the top 20 authors on RR make ~$4-5k a month. [[https://www.patreon.com/Shirtaloon][One guy]] makes ~$20k. I have no idea what an average on KU is.

My intuition agrees with him though, half-assing 2 things will generally be worse than full-assing one thing. Ironically, I was a former patron of jacobk who stopped supporting him because I felt he was half-assing three stories.
