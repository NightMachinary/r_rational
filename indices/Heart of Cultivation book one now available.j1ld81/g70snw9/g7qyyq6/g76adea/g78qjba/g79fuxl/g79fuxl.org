It's a specific fantasy genre popularized in China that is loosely based off the older wuxia genre. It largely reached the west via fan translations, and has been slowly growing here, especially with web serials. (Though some, like the /Cradle/ series, were released in novel format)

The exact nature comes down to a bunch of established tropes that are present in some combination, but essentially the core of it is magical martial arts with significant power scaling in the setting. Generally, this is at least partially quantatized, with distinct levels of power that have some sort of qualitative difference between them^{1.} Beyond this, there are a whole bunch of common setting elements that mirror Chinese martial arts tropes, such as schools/sects dedicated to specific styles or families, mystical and powerful martial arts techniques, gaining strength through careful meditation techniques, etc.

^{1. in this specific story, the central plot revolves around a birth defect in the main character that makes it impossible for him to go from the first level to the second, despite being very talented compared to most at that first level}
