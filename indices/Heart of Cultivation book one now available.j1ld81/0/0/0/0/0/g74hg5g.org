Yeah, I enjoyed his Tanya fic a lot too, dude can do work when given a really interesting idea/world to draw from. His other current project, a LitRPG, is kinda similar in quality to Heart of Cultivation in that its taking a genre's generic premise and just doing a solid rendition of it. Although it's pretty true to the genre, it's a bit too heavy on the "numbers go up" for me to want to do more than read a backlog of it every few months right now (although that's part and parcel to being a generic LitRPG project).

To be fair, if he got handed permission to write an official Magic: The Gathering work, that'd have enough of an established and interesting universe that he'd blow people away with his work (both by being good, and by being better than what gets officially printed by miles).

(Actually I realised something, if the dude wants to write, but is much better at writing good words than writing good ideas, so to speak, going for two popular genres filled with an audience that tolerates terrible and uninspired work regularly is a good business idea. Big fish in a small pond type of deal, as well as establishing fans and making money off practicing to become a better writer)
