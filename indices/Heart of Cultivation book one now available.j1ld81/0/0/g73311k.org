I somewhat agree, though I'm considerably more negative considering how much I enjoyed his two previous fanfics.

The main problem for me is that there is no overt sense of conflict or danger about his quest at all, and the stakes are all self-imposed. Jian's pushed into his actions by a feeling of... offended pride? Not love, ambition, vengeance, or any of that good stuff, but because his arranged marriage fiancee was /publicly rude/ to him. That's it? If she'd dumped him in private the story wouldn't happen?

He hasn't talked to his fiancee in a decade! He's not mistreated by his parents or his clan, they do not put any strong pressure on him to push himself at all, and he repeatedly thinks about resolving the main driver of the story by *talking it out* with his father-in-law, who is a decent man with positive feelings towards him and his family. Even with the sect, which would make good antagonists, we are repeatedly told they wouldn't try anything overt with him for fear of damaging their reputation! Its so very odd how the author continually deflates any sense of urgency or pathos.

The conflicts then become... what, exactly? His family stopping his experimental self-treatment for his own good? The wild animals killing him while he's foraging in the wild? Dying due to botched experimental surgery? Even when the sect guy attacks him, what is the guy's motivation? NOT WAITING 2 YEARS!?!? Arent these guys extremely long lived? Basically it comes out of left field and has zero emotional resonance. And that's the climax to a book?

At end of the day, because Jian isn't fighting for anything he truly wants, the only risk to his life are those who imposes on himself, because at any moment this guy can swallow his pride and go home. Not a good foundation for a story, imo.
