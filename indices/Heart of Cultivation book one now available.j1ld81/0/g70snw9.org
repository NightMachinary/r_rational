So I've been reading this from the start on Royal Road, and my short answer is that this is a solidly written, good book and I pretty much recommend it. It got called "slow" at times on Royal Road, but that's the same thing as Delve (which also gets posted here) where its a book from a currently popular genre, released on a set schedule, that has more than three chapters in a row that aren't a flashy action sequence, numbers-go-up moment, or M. Night Shyamalan-esque twist.

​

All that said though, my detailed and long answer is more complex. I've read and enjoyed a lot of works over the years. Some of the works I've enjoyed a lot are things like Worm, Homestuck, Chilli and the Chocolate Factory, Wuthering Heights, and Nozomanu Fushi No Boukensha (mostly the first book in that series). None of these works are perfect, they all have flaws to them, but they have some aspect of passion/intensity/insanity/depth/detail/etc that resonated really hard with me and carried the work. Sort of like finding a diamond in a pile of shit, you can just focus on the diamond and leave the shit behind. Now the ratio of diamond to shit in the works I listed (and I lot of things I've read in general) is much more diamond than shit, hence why I saw fit to list them in a comment about recommendations that are good, but the main reason I bring them up is to contrast with Heart of Cultivation. There is no diamond, nor any shit, in Heart of Cultivation. To keep the valuable item metaphor going, Heart of Cultivation is more like gold. It is solid and most folks are happy to have it, but if you spend all your time looking for and enjoying diamonds, its not something you're going to care about. Overall, Heart of Cultivation is just what I said in my first sentence of this comment, both solid and good, but some people are only looking for works that are absolutely unique because either that's what they value, that's what they're looking for, or that's what they can fit into their schedule. I doubt anyone who reads it is going to schedule a reread of it every year or get a tattoo of it or try recommending it to "that one friend of yours who doesn't read fiction but they really should give this one book a try please just come on it is amazing."

Oh and one more thing, it's a good Xianxia work, so if you've been curious about the genre but haven't found a work that wasn't lacking in quality, translation, or quality translation, then give this a shot.
