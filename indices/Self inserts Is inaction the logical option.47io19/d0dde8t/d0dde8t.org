Just thought I'd mention that one of your insights is the main plot hook of John Scalzi's novel [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0079XPUOW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1][Redshirts]].

(The following is not much of a spoiler -- most of it can be found on the book's blurb)

The protagonist has just obtained the post of an ensign on the UUCS Intrepid. Along with other ensigns, he quickly figures out that they are living in the universe of a sci-fi show (which we, the readers, recognize to be Star Trek with a few letters changed to avoid copyright issues) and the way to survive in this universe is /never to go on an away mission/ -- only the senior staff of the ship seem to come back from those in one piece...

Its a fun novel though I think the author didn't have a good idea of where to go with this premise.
