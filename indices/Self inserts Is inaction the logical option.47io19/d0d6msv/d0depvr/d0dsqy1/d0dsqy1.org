I mean, unless you're in a world that runs on [[http://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Narrativium][narrativium]] and not normal physics.

Fate, especially in magic worlds, isn't just random chance splitting Everett branches. It's an actual cosmic force, sometimes even a reified or personified and intelligently guided one.

The mere fact that you are there is an event bordering on magic, there is basically no way that could have happened by chance, so someone or something conscious must have chosen to put you there, for one reason or another.
