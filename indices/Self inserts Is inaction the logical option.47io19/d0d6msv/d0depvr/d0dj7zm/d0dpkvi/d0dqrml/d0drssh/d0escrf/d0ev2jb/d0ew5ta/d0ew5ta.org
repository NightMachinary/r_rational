The multiverse is a concept of mathematical platonism. All possible things exist in all possible ways. There is no way to engineer it, you are working from the inside. Anything you 'do' is counterbalanced by all of the worlds in which you did not exist and act in the exact same way. It is impossible to exist in a region defined by a lack of your presence, and by definition this region is not zero.

More strictly speaking, your actions do not do anything to influence the set of all worlds, you only add to or subtract from the subset of worlds that you have in consideration, and your ineradicable presence in the endless branching on the Everett tree means that even these subsets exist in endless configurations dependent on the physics in which you live.

"Manipulating" the multiverse, and indeed, the very idea of a mutable multiverse, is only equivalent to shifting around your own place in a greater and static multiverse. There is no such thing as transcension, you are only moving laterally in the confines of an infinite box that is the same size it has always been.

Grokking the Ensemble, is, as always, very enlightening and mathematically trippy. Thank you for the meditation. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/47io19/self_inserts_is_inaction_the_logical_option/d0es37n][As always, however, this is not important in the slightest.]]
