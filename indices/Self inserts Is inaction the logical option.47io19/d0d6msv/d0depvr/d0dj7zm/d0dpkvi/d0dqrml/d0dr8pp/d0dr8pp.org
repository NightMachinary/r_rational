It's not that the people are unimportant, so much as the scale of change you're actually able to create being so much smaller - if every possible branch is equally real then every possible turn of events has already going to have happened (yes the tenses get a bit confusing)

You can't disrupt the multiverse - the branch where you "change the course of events" is just one thread among many and those changes already/always existed on that branch.
