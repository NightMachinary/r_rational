..If insert into.. the vast majority of fictional or historical settings, I would be dead within the year. Because however much "Be a fucking tourist and keep a low profile" is the surviving strategy, I'd loose my cool and start trying to fix the world. Mostly, by reproducing books from memory as best I can, because, well, frankly, inserting new ideas into a world is the most disruptive move possible, and it should keep working after I get murdered.
