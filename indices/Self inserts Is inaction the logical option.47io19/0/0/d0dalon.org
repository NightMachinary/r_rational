Geneva in Switzerland seems to be the best bet. While some Swiss cities were bombed by both sides, Geneva apparently wasn't (according to a quick search), although it was something of a hotbed of spies and diplomatic wrangling.

I'd also recommend traveling to / staying in the US pre-1941, but that only really gives you two years before you have to move elsewhere. Although if you had an excuse (medical or otherwise) to avoid the draft, you could probably remain on the mainland for the duration.
