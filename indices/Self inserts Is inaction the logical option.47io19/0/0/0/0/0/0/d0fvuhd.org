Why do you act like the food back then was poisonous? Any food from farms that you can visit to make sure they aren't using tonnes of pesticides should be just as good as that of today, maybe even better.

Vaccination was probably more limited then than now and only few vaccinatable diseases have actually been completely eradicated. The rest should be available by asking a local doctor of any repute.

If you manage to succeed with some scam (probably by first establishing yourself for a year or so and then contacting actual criminals, which aren't that hard to find in any age if you actually go out looking for them) you'll just have to follow the age-old wisdom of scam artists and not stay in whatever region your former victims live. Just hitchhike if you don't have your own vehicle.
