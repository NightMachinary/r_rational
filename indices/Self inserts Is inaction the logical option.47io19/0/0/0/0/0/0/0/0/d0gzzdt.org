  Processing techniques and quality controls are not the same nowadays for processed foods. You (probably) won't die, but I suspect that the first few months will get very uncomfortable, and you might get a few 'visitors' to entertain. So to speak.

I assume you're someone who has lived in a city their whole life and only eats supermarket products? Because I can assure you that if you ask any small scale farmer they will tell you that what they themselves eat is essentially the same, give or take a bit of selective breeding. No one does rigorous technical quality controlling on the meat the local butcher gets from the local farmer. Everyone simply checks for themselves if the meat is good and trusts that no one is trying to poison them, for sake of reputation if nothing else. And the sheep still eat the same grass they did then, minus maybe all the pollution that we've put into the earth mostly in the last ~50 years.

  For vaccinations, I actually don't know the type and probable stocks of vaccines available by a random doctor at that time, nor how easy it would be to convince him to give them to me. Do you?

For free? Probably not all that easy. But if you have any way whatsoever to make money (as in, any skill not dependent on electronics) then you'll do it like anyone else would and pay for it.

  I don't believe I'd be able to enter a crime mob the way I enter a supermarket; and I don't believe I'd be able to quit a crime mob the way I do a supermarket.
#+end_quote

Again, it's mostly a question of money. If you pay then criminal services work a lot like non-criminal ones, except that there is a lot more secrecy involved. I'm not talking about you becoming a gang member here.

  I don't see myself easily adapting to a low-tech and low-services time period.

All these things are things that normal humans do on a daily basis all the time though. All it requires for someone to have this experience is to travel to a third world country for a duration longer than your typical two weeks holiday and not stay at an all inclusive resort. Sure, the lack of internet, sanitation, transportation and education is sorely felt after a while, but if you're not completely neurotic and panicky you just deal with it, like anyone else would. The way you describe it it sounds like you'd be someone who'd be horrified by something like a full day power outage.

  I don't see myself easily adapting to a society whose social mores and politics are, to say the least, not mine AT ALL.
#+end_quote

This makes me think that you haven't ever experienced culture shock /at all/. Because I can tell you from experience that even traveling to another western nation will have you face relatively different social mores, politics and customs. Hell, even just traveling within the US (from major city to small inland town) will have you experience political opinions that seem to directly oppose yours on purpose.

If people can hitchhike through Africa without screaming at everyone who seems to have more than one wife and thinks that cows were created specifically for their tribe only then re-experiencing Jim Crow laws as a time-traveling white male shouldn't be all that impossible.

  I depend on structures (moral, social, societal, technological, and more) that simply do not exist prior to the 60's.
#+end_quote

I'd like you to actually list the structures you think you need for basic survival. Barring medical dependencies I am sure that if you decided to go on a prolonged trip (or even just camping) you'd notice that it turns out they are less important than you think.

Bottom line, every moment many immigrants and backpackers all over the world face social upheaval much greater than that you'd face from switching between a 2000s western country and a 1920s western country that even speaks the same language. If an analphabet Pakistani can travel alone to a Greek island and make a life for himself than an educated (American?) can do it too.

P.S.: I assume you're a white male because despite your boundless pessimism you never once mentioned the hardships you would face due to suddenly being a second class citizen due to gender or race.
