I don't mean poisonous, of course. Carrots are carrots basically anywhen (as long as you don't get too far back in time, of course). When you get to meat, eggs and milks, things can get more, shall we say, runny. Processing techniques and quality controls are /not/ the same nowadays for processed foods. You (probably) won't die, but I suspect that the first few months will get /very/ uncomfortable, and you might get a few 'visitors' to entertain. So to speak.

(Disclaimer: I am not a biologist. Actual effects during your time travel may vary.)

For vaccinations, I actually don't know the type and probable stocks of vaccines available by a random doctor at that time, nor how easy it would be to convince him to give them to me. Do you?

I don't believe I'd be able to enter a crime mob the way I enter a supermarket; and I don't believe I'd be able to /quit/ a crime mob the way I do a supermarket.

I'm not being clear in my reasoning, I think. I took the premise, which I understand as: "One day, I get transported in the 1920's or 1930's. I have no local resources. I am myself with my present knowledge, which does not include any specifics about my new environment. What happens?". From that premise, I imagine how I would react.

I am not actually plotting a time-travel self-insert, where I wouldn't have to worry about my internal plumbing and not much more about sheltering; and concentrating about what's really interesting in a story (how to get money and construct an empire from my knowledge of the future).

I was actually trying to be realistic, and when I get realistic, I don't see myself becoming a scam artist as easily as I can build a VM to add to my RDS farm. I don't see myself easily adapting to a low-tech and low-services time period. I don't see myself easily adapting to a society whose social mores and politics are, to say the least, /not mine AT ALL/.

I'm a product of the 21th century. I depend on structures (moral, social, societal, technological, and more) that simply /do not exist/ prior to the 60's. Suddenly living in the beginning of the 20th century would /not/ be a challenge fit for a epic story, it would be a bloody nightmare which I would not survive intact, if at all.

It goes without saying that any period prior to the 20th would mean death in a week, I think.
