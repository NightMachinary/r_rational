Okay, so this isn't really smart of me, but I'm getting tired.

This is where I work: [[http://www.ch-peronne.fr/]].

You may have heard of the city, PÃ©ronne. Its WWI memorial is kind of known, and we're smack in the middle of the centennial ceremonies of WWI, so it's kind of a theme here right now and for the next two years. Plenty of documentation about the period. Which I've not really perused, because 1) it's really not my preferred genre, and 2) despite my "pessimism" I'm not naturally attracted to unhappy themes. I have however absorbed enough by osmosis during the years (in high school, then at work) to know that, while fine for survivalists, that period /is not palatable/.
