Nope. Butterfly effect means the second you insert, the canon outcome is completely /dead/. Everything that happens relies on everything else. If something new happens, then information from that event will propagate outwards at the speed of causality. The only rational option if you care about the outcome at all is to attempt to help as your abilities permit. It's fine to do nothing if you're indifferent, though.

Remember that our choices are ultimately the products of physical law, not our will. Changing anything physical will influence those choices, and over time, such effects snowball.
