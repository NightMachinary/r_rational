  One problem is the butterfly effect. If taking the last seat on a bus you delay the cousin of someone the main character talks on the phone with a year later, you can fuck up the timeline.

I agree, unless you're pretty far from the action and pretty close time-wise to the climax, you're going to mess up the story anyway. Since you're going to change things anyway, the best way to do it is to be "deep throat" and feed critical info to the protagonist.

  If you are committed to making no changes, it's best to kill yourself early...

Unless you're basically a homeless friendless bum, that's likely to trigger the butterfly effect worse than if you just try and continue your body's life.
