One problem is the butterfly effect. If taking the last seat on a bus you delay the cousin of someone the main character talks on the phone with a year later, you can fuck up the timeline.

Another is that since you are there, something/someone is changing things in ways you can't predict. Assuming that they won't drop anyone else in, or make other changes is risky.

If you are committed to making no changes, it's best to kill yourself early, taking care that no one ever knows about it. That is a huge risk if things do leave the rails.

Perhaps you could leave some insurance, eg. leave a plot-spoiler somewhere they wouldn't find it in the normal plot, so if they do find it the timeline is already fucked.
