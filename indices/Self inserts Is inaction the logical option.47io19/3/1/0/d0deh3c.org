forget nonlocal effects. The very air you displaced is likely to eventually cause enough of a difference that somewhere, someone's schedule is off by a millisecond. Human plans may keep things on track for a while in spite of that, but if a person is off by a millisecond, they'll have different children. Human reproduction is very vulnerable to the butterfly effect. And then those children are all carriers of your contagious butterflies, and they sure as hell aren't going to bother killing themselves. Long story short, the absolute maximum time you can delay the butterfly effect is one generation.

Nothing less that a destiny based universe could really stop it.
