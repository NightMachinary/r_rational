I think you're underestimating the strength of the butterfly effect yourself. It doesn't take an external cause. The period simply playing back again is enough to change absolutely everything, because quantum physics changes everything on its own. It's already random, you don't need any extra instigation besides the physics happening as they did. The Everett tree is vast and many-limbed, and you will never find the branch you were looking for.

Narratively, though, that's total crap, because people rarely write about worlds with real physics.
