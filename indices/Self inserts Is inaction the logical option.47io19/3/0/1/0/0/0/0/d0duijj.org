I understand the way you're looking at it, I just think it's silly. It's a belief that does not pay rent. The scale of events on the planet is not smaller, everything else is bigger. In order to be more likely to be in a branch in the future where things went well, I have to be the kind of person who would change the course of events now.

Quick check, Everret branches are probability-based in aggregate, right?
