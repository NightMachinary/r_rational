What do I care about the probability density of the whole when no particular version of me can meaningfully interact with anything outside his tiny compartmentalized prison? I don't think the notion of probability even has any meaningfulness in the context of entirely separate experiences. Redundant experiences which are perfectly identical should not be double-counted, in my opinion. I mean, if you wanna talk about beliefs that don't pay rent...

I agree that this is a discouraging worldview. This is why I desperately hope that the interpretations of quantum physics that say the multiverse is unrestricted are wrong, or perhaps incomplete. If they are not incomplete, then my last and most desperate hope is that perhaps someday one of me can make it so, by figuring out how to alter QM or the layers of physics that go even deeper than QM in order to destroy or prevent from coming into existence all the versions of the multiverse that I find terrifying or repulsive. That kind of omnicidal selection process and literal playing God sounds gristly, and honestly it is and I'm reluctant to do so even just when playing with speculative possibilities so unlikely they're near meaningless as I am now, but I think that embracing this gristliness beats total nihilism and despair by an infinitely large landslide.
