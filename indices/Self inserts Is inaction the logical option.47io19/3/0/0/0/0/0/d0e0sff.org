Poor Neji.

In the case of my own SI for example, Hinata has a younger brother instead of a sister. Konohamaru is... similar, but not identical. Therefore fate is not absolute, although it could theoretically be a weaker force that cares only about a few specific events (it isn't in my story, but the SI can't know that for certain).
