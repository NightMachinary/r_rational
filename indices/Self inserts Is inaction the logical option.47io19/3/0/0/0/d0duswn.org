Well if you're in one of those worlds, and you know the plot, then:

1: It should be fairly easy to check, just find out if plot-relevant characters born after your arrival showed up with the same gender, hair and eye colour.

2: Keep an eye out for a plot that's welded to the rails. If it stays on course despite changes, then that's a solid sign.

3: Might as well learn to bend reality into a pretzel while you're in a magic world in the mean time, as backup. Just in case things turn out not to be narrative-based and the world actually is doomed without your intervention. Hey, if you're wrong then you only wasted some time and gained superpowers. Not too shabby, unless you're in one of those worlds where having magic is just terrible for your lifespan.

4: Hope that when you arrived the narrative didn't change into a cautionary tale about thinking you know better than fate, being wrong, and dying because of it.
