Personally, I'm of the opinion that people really, really love hyping up the butterfly effect, especially considering there's no meaningful way to test or check their predictions that "one exhaled breath will completely change everything forever." Convenient.

From my perspective, there's already so much random events and arbitrary noise in reality that anything which actually happened was probably pretty likely to happen. As such, small changes are likely to just get lost in the noise of randomness when compared to the much larger forces pushing events forward.

But, as other people have pointed out, if you /actually/ find yourself inserted into a fictional universe, then everything you thought you knew about physics needs to be seriously reevaluated, if not thrown right out.
