Point. I guess if you were in a good health, you could try and do things like eat well, exercise, avoid chemicals you knew were poisonous, and you'd probably be educated enough to handle bookkeeping or white-collar management.

Not to mention that if you really wanted to raise cash to a level where you could live in 1930s-ish luxury, there are a lot of scams which didn't become specifically illegal until later, or were incredibly difficult to track until the advent of computers. Particularly with communication in some of the more rural areas taking a long time and phone systems only being installed later. And of course you could invest in war bonds or buy stock in companies supplying war materials. ID was probably far more easily forged, too.
