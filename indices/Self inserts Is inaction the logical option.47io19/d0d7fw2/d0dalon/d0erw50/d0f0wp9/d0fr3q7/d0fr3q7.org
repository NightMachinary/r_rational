Indeed. Although how I, as a 38yo 21th-century product, with little to no knowledge of even the basic facts of life-at-that-time, would be able to do any of that without being sent to the loony bin, well that's what's stumping me.

Eating well. Sounds promising. Except that, in that time, I have absolutely no indicators of what "good food" looks like, or even what effect certified "good food" can have on my modern guts.

Exercise. Well okay, that's a pretty much atemporal thing.

Scams. I have, literally, no idea which scams are known at that time, or of the punishment if I'm caught. By either lawful or lawless powers, might I add. The state of long-range communication networks mean nothing when the scammed can track you down with a little neighbourly inquiry and twenty buddies. (That's if by some miracle I manage to convince myself to try it, /and/ I manage to actually /succeed/. I don't have any particular delinquent tendencies, and frankly I don't know any scam tricks).

Investing. Right. A nobody with no contacts, no referents, no funds and no knowledge of current financial principles. Easy.

ID forging? Again, you'd need intimate local (time and space) knowledge to forge something passable for anything worthy of the time and materials (that you'd have to procure) you'd have to spend for those.

In other words, the only realistic way for any 21thC person to adapt comfortably in the 20's or 30's is, well, to be a native to that period.

Or have magic. A spell to not let people be aware of any suspicious lack of local knowledge. Another to turn local food ready for consumption. Yet another for any of the then-common illnesses we're no longer vaccinated against because they've been eradicated for decades. Etc.

Or have a support network of in-the-know locals. That would be a big help.
