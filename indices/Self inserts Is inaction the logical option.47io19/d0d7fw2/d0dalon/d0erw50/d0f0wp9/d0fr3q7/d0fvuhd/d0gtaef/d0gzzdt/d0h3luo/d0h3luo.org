  I assume you're someone who has lived in a city their whole life and only eats supermarket products?
#+end_quote

Actually I've been living in a small village (pop. ~600) all my life. We're literally surrounded by fields. I may indeed (like most of the population) eat from supermarket foods of varying quality, but I do know the difference between raw and processed foods.

#+begin_quote
  Because I can assure you that if you ask any small scale farmer they will tell you that what they themselves eat is essentially the same, give or take a bit of selective breeding. No one does rigorous technical quality controlling on the meat the local butcher gets from the local farmer.
#+end_quote

...What.

#+begin_quote
  Everyone simply checks for themselves if the meat is good and trusts that no one is trying to poison them, for sake of reputation if nothing else. And the sheep still eat the same grass they did then, minus maybe all the pollution that we've put into the earth mostly in the last ~50 years.
#+end_quote

...Right. Well, maybe our respective localities don't have the same standards regarding food production and distribution. I know for a fact that the vast majority of the population of my country (France, as a point of fact) does have to adhere to strict laws and procedures regarding food. Among other things. But yeah, if, for example, my workplace (an hospital) kitchen's chef decided one day to prepare meat received "on faith" from a local farmer YOLO-mode, there'd be Hell to pay, along with some impressive fines.

#+begin_quote
  For free?
#+end_quote

Of course not for free. We didn't have national-wide social security until '45.

#+begin_quote
  Probably not all that easy. But if you have any way whatsoever to make money (as in, any skill not dependent on electronics) then you'll do it like anyone else would and pay for it.
#+end_quote

The problem being actually earning that money quickly enough. I'm a sysadmin.

#+begin_quote
  This makes me think that you haven't ever experienced culture shock at all. Because I can tell you from experience that even traveling to another western nation will have you face relatively different social mores, politics and customs. Hell, even just travelling within the US (from major city to small inland town) will have you experience political opinions that seem to directly oppose yours on purpose.
#+end_quote

I haven't. I've travelled to Germany, Italy, Portugal, the UK and Japan for vacations, but I never /lived/ in a country with no modern child labor laws, no vote for women (nor right for them to hold a job or a bank account), no decent (to my standards) healthcare, and where customs seems to hold more sway than law.

(As for travelling within the US... Again, I'm French. To me, your politics are bewildering whether I look at your federal or state levels. All your states. )

#+begin_quote
  If people can hitchhike through Africa without screaming at everyone who seems to have more than one wife and thinks that cows were created specifically for their tribe only then re-experiencing Jim Crow laws as a time-traveling white male shouldn't be all that impossible.
#+end_quote

Yeah, well those people who hitchhike through Africa probably already prepared themselves to do it, and probably don't expect to never see civilisation again. I'm not even prepared to hitchhike through my own country, and as a white male myself I don't even have to worry about random rape, just random muggings.

#+begin_quote
  I'd like you to actually list the structures you think you need for basic survival. Barring medical dependencies I am sure that if you decided to go on a prolonged trip (or even just camping) you'd notice that it turns out they are less important than you think.
#+end_quote

I work in a hospital. It's middle-sized (we only have about 200 beds and 600 agents), but we're pretty multi-purpose. We have a psychiatric ward, different levels of retirement homes (is that the term?), social services, an ER floor of course, etc. I can see, every day, the kind of problems normal people who /have/ access to our services can have. I'm sure I can survive a little while (a few months? Maybe?) without this kind of services. I'd look like Robinson Crusoe, I wouldn't call that /living/.

#+begin_quote
  Bottom line, every moment many immigrants and backpackers all over the world face social upheaval much greater than that you'd face from switching between a 2000s western country and a 1920s western country that even speaks the same language.
#+end_quote

[EDIT: Rereading this part, I'm not even sure 1920's and 2000's French are quite "the same language"...]

#+begin_quote
  If an analphabet Pakistani can travel alone to a Greek island and make a life for himself than an educated (American?) can do it too.
#+end_quote

Actually, as a French, I see those immigrants you talk about. I don't know if your news networks talk about the Calais camp ("The Jungle")? It's about 160km from my home. 1h30 by car, more or less. They needed modern support networks to get there, and to survive there. Those who didn't, died on the way. Well they also died from treachery, sea, cold, hunger, fatigue and other things not necessarily directly related to a lack of modern necessities, but... Yeah. They died. Lots and lots of them. Mostly because the West (we) consider that it's not really their problem, and they should be thanked that they're already 'helping' as much as they do, but that's another debate entirely.

#+begin_quote
  P.S.: I assume you're a white male because despite your boundless pessimism you never once mentioned the hardships you would face due to suddenly being a second class citizen due to gender or race.
#+end_quote

I'm a white male, yes. I'm pessimistic because I know what I can and can't do. This time-travel scenario is well beyond where I evaluate my personal abilities.

Not being Black, I can only know of their hardships by listening to my uncle. Not being a woman, or any other "minority" (because women are only a "minority" when talking about the power they're allowed to have), I can only know of theirs by listening to my mother, and the other women of my family, and another uncle I only understood in my teens why he wasn't married to his friend (he is, now!), and of course the occasional encounters with social workers and medical staff at work.

Yeah, "second-class citizen" is kind of a thing for me. Sorry.

I don't know how anyone else, of any sex, gender, nationality or ethnicity, would react to being transported with no preparation nor knowledge to the 20's, in France or anywhere else. The scenario was "how would you", not "how would a random citizen". I know /I/ would freak out and probably wouldn't manage in the long term.
