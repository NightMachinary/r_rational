Actually I wasn't talking about political or military threats to my health. At all. Those wouldn't even be on my radar. I was talking about basic healthcare, and social reactions to a displaced 21th century resident (whether or not they would declare themselves to be such). Basic day-to-day-life stuff.

Pre-WW2 wasn't /quite/ the Middle-Age, but c'mon, let's be honest here. No-one born post-40's, to say nothing of post-70's, is equipped to live pre-40's, and the war has nothing to do with that.
