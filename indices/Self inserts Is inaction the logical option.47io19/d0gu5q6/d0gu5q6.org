Something similar was jokingly suggested on Russian military history forum for some of the Stalin's illogical decisions in WWII. That is that Stalin had access to the complete history of WW2 and was afraid to disrupt path to victory (hi Worm). To make one wonder some of the Stalin's decisions were highly competent. The realistic explanation is of cause that Stalin was affected by psychotic bouts and while he was very good in logistics he had poor grasp military tactics, at least at the beginning of the war. However it's not inconceivable, that if not for Stalin's self-destructive decisions/policies like failure to detect (or refusal to see) preparations for Nazi offense, purging officer corps, disarming western border, disastrous performance in the Winter War (with Finland), untimely army reform and more, Hitler may have taken Soviet Union seriously, put German industry on war footing in 1941 (and not in 1943 like in real history) and would prepare for the long campaign, not blitzkrieg. With disastrous consequences for the Soviet Union.
