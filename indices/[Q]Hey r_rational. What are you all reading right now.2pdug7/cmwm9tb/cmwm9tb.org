I'm reading four works on a regular basis at the moment.

Pact. A web serial about a magical boy whose entire world is built to torture and twist him into a malevolent being of evil. Awesome to read, really dramatic, I have recommended it to lots of people and the author [[/u/wildbow]] is a redditor so in touch with the people.

A cloudy path. A worm/ supreme crossover fanfic. Excellently written, everyone seeks to accomplish their goals well, lots of pain and agony. Lackscreativity isn't on reddit as far as I know, but is accessible elsewhere.

With this Ring, another fanfiction involving the orange ring and all sorts of varied shenanigans, shows what you can really do and what you can't with a magical ring of super powers, the value of teamwork.

RWBY the gamer, another fanfiction about a person who gains the power to use the power of video games in his life and seeks to use it to save everyone against an endless run of unstoppable monsters.

Two year emperor, about an emperor taking on DnD and abusing the rules to defeat gods. Sadly less regular, merely once a week.

Mother of Learning too. Once a month.

I do read a lot of non fanfiction stuff, but most of the low hanging fruit, really good stuff, I've read, or tried and not liked. There are the cosmere books by [[/u/mistborn]] for example, but even he can only write two or three books a year. A lot of other authors I like such as GRRMartin or Patrick Rothfuss take a long time to do new books. So I really appreciate regular good stuff.

For Pact, I get a lot of enjoyment out of it so I pay wildbow via patreon. If you do enjoy a web serial author or author like that you should definitely do so too. If you want more of this good stuff on a regular basis paying for it helps a lot. I've bought all of Brandon Sanderson's books.

Plus, paying top tier authors like wildbow means more material for fanfiction. I like having some little pleasure to wake up to in the morning before work. Pact definitely hits the spot, and so do a lot of the derivative works.

Both of them talked about making video games in their universes which would be great if that ever finished too. Rational games are fun too.
