Anything under [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][Rational Fiction on TV Tropes]].

These six great novels called [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bk1r-nxx-wxfvTH5o72Sq-dbshF8iqiOaZ3vGb_X1YU/edit][SI]] by DataPacRat that's about a post-Singularity apocalypse.

Anything by [[http://yudkowsky.net/other/fiction/][Eliezer Yudkowsky]].

[[https://farmerbob1.wordpress.com/][Symbiote]] by farmerbob1 about what would you do with control over biology. I haven't read his other story yet, [[http://rejecthero.wordpress.com/][Reject Hero]], but I heard it's good.

[[http://makefoil.com/][Hamlet and the Philosopher's Stone]], where Hamlet acts rationally, but you have to buy it for $4. It's not free and it's less than 100 pages long, but please don't try to find a free copy online to cheat this wonderful author.

If you liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9669819/1/The-Two-Year-Emperor][Two Year Emperor]], then you'll like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural Twenty]].

There's a couple more stories I know of (I made an extensive list), but these are the ones that are either finished, or updating regularly.

EDIT: If you want to read more by the same author of [[http://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]], he also wrote [[http://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]]. But people have been commenting that liking Worm doesn't mean you'll like Pact.
