In Friendship is Optimal, pony is the imported quality, not rationality. That is, it's not set in the MLPFiM-verse, it's just about a GAI created by people on Earth, who is styled after Princess Celestia and whose overall goal is "satisfy values through friendship and ponies". The storyline of MLPFiM doesn't really have anything to do with it.
