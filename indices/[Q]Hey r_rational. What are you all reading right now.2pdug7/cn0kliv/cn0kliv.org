With the Christmas break, I've finally gotten around to reading A Song of Ice and Fire (also called the Game of Thrones). At college I never seem to find time to get a lot of reading done at once, so I mostly just kept up with web serials and fanfiction that I liked. So now that I have the break, I'm binge reading all at once. I finished the first book yesterday and am on the second book now. The characters definitely are not rational, but they do have consistent motivations and are competent at what they do. I've heard enough about the series and the author to expect any character to die at any time, and I think that has enhanced my enjoyment greatly.

For webserials and fanfiction, mostly what you would see recommended on this subreddit. The two I most look forward to updates for:

- Following the Phoenix, I would consider it equal to canon!HPMOR in some ways, perhaps better if you felt the HPMOR focused on Harry too much and you felt HPMOR was anti-feminist. The author switches viewpoint characters enough so that it feels like every character has agency (especially Hermione). There are some complaints that the plot feels railroaded... but I think that is just a side effect of Quirrel going all out with his manipulations.

- Pact. I don't like it quite as much as Worm... but I absolutely loved Worm so I still come out liking Pact a lot. There is arc fatigue in a few places where the story gets drawn out. Some of the fight scenes can be really confusing because of magic altering the viewpoint perspective. Also, there is in-universe reasons for the main character getting constantly screwed and his perspective being off... but it can still be annoying at times.
