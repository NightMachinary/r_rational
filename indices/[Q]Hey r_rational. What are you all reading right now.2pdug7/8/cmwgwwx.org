Right now: [[http://ymarkov.livejournal.com/280578.html][The Last Ringbearer]].

A Lord of the Rings fanfic, where Aragorn, Gandalf and elves are evil and Mordor is (mostly) good. Tolkien's story is propaganda. The main part of the story is after Mordor falls. It reads more like a fantasy spy thriller.

It is more rational than Lord of the Rings as it tries to make the economics, politics, technology, etc more consistent.
