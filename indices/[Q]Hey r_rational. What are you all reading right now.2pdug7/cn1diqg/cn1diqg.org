Online fiction:

[[http://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/bonds-1-1/][Pact]]: I'm enjoying Pact. Not as much overall as Worm, but there are some moments that are pretty awesome like [[#s][6.11]]

[[http://unillustrated.wordpress.com/monster/][Citadel]]: It's exactly what would happen if you cross Super Powereds' setting with characters from Worm. Not enough story yet to get a really good feel for how it's going to turn out, and the chapter length leaves something to be desired, although the update rate makes up for it. So far, I'm willing to keep reading it, which is more than I can say for most serials I start.

I second [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset][Hard Reset]], and its sequels. Entertaining time loop shenanigans, and the characterization is pretty good ([[#s][Pinkie Pie]]). It's worth mentioning that I've never watched the show, or had any interest in watching the show, but I still found it fairly entertaining.

While we're on the subject of ponyfic, [[http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/04/story-fallout-equestria.html][Fallout Equestria]] is one of my favorite pieces of fiction. Dark MLP!Fallout, not much else to say.

[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][The Optimalverse]], as mentioned elsewhere in this thread, is also pretty good. Satisfying values through ponies and friendship has never been more gratifying. Or terrifying, depending on your viewpoint and whether or not CelestAI's actions creep you the hell out.

[[http://leftoversoup.com/first.php][Leftover Soup]] is a webcomic that I enjoy almost as much as the author's comments. There were quite a few times while reading it and thought "Huh, you know, that's a good point. I never thought of it that way."

[[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?116836-The-SilverClawShift-Campaign-Archives][The SilverClawShift Campaign Archives]]: What everybody wishes their DnD group was like. Fairly epic campaign.

[[http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Old_Man_Henderson][Old Man Henderson]]: what every GM is terrified their group will be like.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate][Inviolate]]: A DC universe spanning conspiracy. Probably better if you have previous understanding of the universe, but I found it entertaining with just a layman's knowledge base.

Good ol' paperbacks:

Finished up [[http://www.amazon.ca/Blood-Song-Ravens-Shadow-Novel-ebook/dp/B00ABKGG0C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1419178029&sr=8-1&keywords=blood+song][Blood Song]] and its sequel [[http://www.amazon.ca/Tower-Lord-Ravens-Shadow-Novel-ebook/dp/B00G3L6ML6/ref=pd_sim_kinc_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=0SRXJXAKWQQ2P0QAKMZK][Tower Lord]] not too long ago. Really enjoyed Blood Song, had a few issues with Tower Lord, but overall two very good books.

[[http://www.amazon.ca/Red-Knight-Traitor-Son-Cycle-ebook/dp/B007ZFPUL2/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1419178346&sr=1-1&keywords=the+red+knight][The Red Knight]] was pretty good as well, although it did have a tendency to get caught up in medieval armor jargon. I have no idea what most of those word were, but understanding is not necessary to enjoy the story.

[[http://www.amazon.ca/Dragons-Path-Dagger-Coin-ebook/dp/B0047Y16LC/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1419179208&sr=1-1&keywords=the+dragon%27s+path][The Dragon's Path]] is the first novel in the Dagger and the Coin series, and it looks pretty promising. Some entertaining political/economic maneuvering.

For fans of the Dresden Files, Benedict Jacka's [[http://www.amazon.ca/Fated-Alex-Verus-Benedict-Jacka-ebook/dp/B005GSYZAM/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1419179019&sr=1-1&keywords=fated][Fated]] and it's sequels have much the same vibe. So far, it's only about as good as the early to mid Dresden Files, but the author has been improving steadily.
