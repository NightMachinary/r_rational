Here's some recommendations for intelligent non-rational fiction:

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7568728/1][Saruman of Many Devices]]: In /The Lord of the Rings/, remember how Saruman started an industrial revolution, and how awesome that was? And remember how he threw it all away by siding with the local dictator warlord instead of ushering in the Renaissance and bringing the entire world out of the Middle Ages, and how much of a letdown that was? (I suppose Tolkien did call it /Middle/-Earth for a reason). Well, user Saphroneth decided that it was a letdown too, and wrote this fic. Basically, Saruman sides with the free nations, and designs and mass-produces guns and outfits his army with them. Awesomeness ensues.

  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6375554/1][Semper Victoria]]: Similar to the above. An Enlightenment-pov interpretation of the aftermath of the movie /Avatar/. Humanity needs unobtainium to survive, so we return to Pandora. Takes a more nuanced look at the ensuing massive culture clash than the movie's "trees good technology bad".

  Pandora's Star (and its five sequels (yup, a new book just got finished!!)), by Peter F Hamilton: long-future space opera science fiction. Everyone's immortal via technology and transhuman civilization is a network of habitable planets spanning intersteller space connected by wormholes. Then we encounter the Prime, truly /alien/ aliens the way [[#s][/Madoka Magica/ spoilers]], aliens with vastly different utility functions. Awesomeness ensues. And did I mention the conspiracy-theory-that-may-or-may-not-be-true about [[#s][spoilers book one]]?
