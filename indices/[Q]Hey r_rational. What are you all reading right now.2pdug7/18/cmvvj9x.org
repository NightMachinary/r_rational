Currently reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The Problem with Purity]], which falls under the category of romance, mainly. It has only one Level 1 Intelligent Character, specifically Hermione, and she's appreciably overpowered. But it's a bit of fresh air for me, since most of the Harry Potter fanfiction I've encountered has only Harry as a L1IC, often overpowered, and with a harem to boot; and on top of that, Harry's excessive power allows him to smash through his primary conflicts.

I feel like the degree to which people defer to Hermione in this story is greater than typical for people to defer to Harry in Harry-centric stories, but I don't particularly trust my judgment not to be skewed here. I am aware of unconscious bias and know that it generally favors men and hurts women in our society.

This story is not what I would most recommend, but it is what I'm reading at the moment. It's decent but a bit long for what it is.
