[[https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-01/][Set in Stone]] is a recently begun serial by Farmerbob1 about a technolithic society with some rational social engineering built in. He's finished two unrelated serials before so it's far more polished than you would expect from a new serial.

Also, *Contact With Chaos* by Michael Z Williamson. It's a first contact scenario where humans are the technologically advanced species and the aliens are technically stone aged, though societally much more mature. A bit of libertarian-esque propaganda thrown it but not so heavy as to distract from the story. However, it is book three in a series. I think it stands alone but it's better in context and the other two are well worth it if you like military SF. The Weapon and Freehold.
