In progress, i.e. I'm reading updates as they come out/every so often:

- HPMOR (I also read EY's other stories)
- Pact
- The Two-Year Emperor
- [[http://stefangagne.com/floatingpoint][Floating Point]]

Done:

- Worm
- Blindsight
- [[http://qntm.org/structure][Fine Structure]]
- [[http://qntm.org/ra][Ra]]
- Most of the other stuff by [[http://qntm.org][qntm]]
- City of Angles and twoflower's other stories too
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5398503/][Embers]], which is a rational ATLAfanfic. Currently rereading while on the train.
- Harry Potter and the Natural 20 (only Book 1)

I gave [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/][Hogwarts Battle School]] a try; imagine Quirrell's battles are part of the standard curriculum and the school is built around that. The lack of editing makes it a bit hard to read though.
