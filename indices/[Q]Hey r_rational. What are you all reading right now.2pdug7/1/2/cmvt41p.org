I almost forgot about this one, but I think I need to put it into it's own post. If you liked [[http://hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]], then you'll like "Something Very Special" which is about two adult wizards using their knowledge of magic and computer science (among other sciences), to explore the universe, time-travel, and face off an even /more/ rational antagonist. It's at nine chapters, but I don't know where you can download it off the Internet. I recommend e-mailing the author for updates and a free current copy.
