Pact is not a sequel to Worm. Worm is superhero fiction, Pact is urban fantasy. The fact that Wildbow pulled such a large readerbase from one genre to the other should indicate that he's a good writer.

Granted, some people just don't like urban fantasy. Fair enough, but if you do like urban fantasy, or think you might, I'd give Pact a try
