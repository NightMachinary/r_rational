I don't think that's a fair assessment of Wildbow's work, though it would be a fair assessment of a cross-genre failure. The reason I say that is because Wildbow is certainly not failing.

Trying to sell Pact to a rational fiction crowd would be like trying to pitch celery to a carnivore (In any universe but the Honorverse) but his understanding of characters, world building, plot arcs, scenes, sequels, Easter Eggs, foreshadowing, and other parts of writing is extremely solid.

Pact is NOT rational fiction. If you try to look at it from a rational fiction point of view there are so many holes that it can't be enjoyed. Looked at as a non-rational story, I find it to be a fun read, and frequently thought provoking.
