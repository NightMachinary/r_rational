Giving anything by Brandon Sanderson a giant thumbs up here. He's amazing at building magic systems that are colorful and fantastic, yet interact logically with the real world. As alex mentioned, you can figure out bits of the magic system ahead of the story if you pay attention and think carefully. I recommend him to everyone, usually starting with the Mistborn trilogy. He's brilliant at playing on classic fantasy tropes, twisting them without mocking or breaking them- instead he just moves the pieces on the board around a little and says, "huh. Wonder what happens now? Guess we'll find out!"
