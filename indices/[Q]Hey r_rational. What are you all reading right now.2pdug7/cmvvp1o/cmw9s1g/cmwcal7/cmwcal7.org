Gonna add to this guy that if you want to give your heart to Brandon Sanderson, as I (We?) have, you'll want to work through his main meta-series (The Cosmere saga, which has many stories taking place on different worlds in the same universe, with some interconnectivity) in the following order: Mistborn, Elantris or Warbreaker, the other of Elantris or Warbreaker, THEN read The Stormlight Archives. Not only is Stormlight Archives a huge investment of time, the series contains many allusions to events that happened in earlier books, as well as some cameos from other series which promise to become important later.
