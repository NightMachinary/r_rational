The problem is that (at least for me) Brandon sanderson writes one dimensional characters and really stodgy plots. It is like he puts all of his effort into the convoluted magic systems (overly convoluted for my taste, like, yeah, they are consistent, but they still reek of "woah, what if people did magic by constructing block puzzles?") and then gives up on the actual stories.

I actually think he is a good writer, he finished Wheel of Time admirably. Maybe he should do more fanfiction?
