To any list lauding /The time-traveler's wife/ and /Jumper/ for their incredibly detailed and well-thought-out explorations of all the benefits, drawbacks, and consequences of their premises, I would add H.F. Saint's */Memoirs of an invisible man/*, which does for invisibility what the former two do for time travel and teleportation. The book is hands-down the most intricate, well-developed, sensible treatment of invisibility I've ever come across, while also being a nail-bitingly suspenseful man-on-the-run thriller.

[The one caveat I have is that it begins---within the first 10 pages---with a somewhat lengthily described sex scene, which can give rather the wrong first impression as to what sort a book it's going to be.]
