My regular reading of the moment consists of

- [[http://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/bonds-1-1/][Pact]] (Wildbow 2: Wildbowier, modern fantasy with a familiar brutal difficulty ramp for the protagonist)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636246/1/Following-the-Phoenix][Following the Phoenix]] (HPMoR spinoff fic, "What if Hermione was sent to Azkaban?")

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][Pokemon: The Origin of Species]] ("What if Pok√©mon made sense?")

- [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]] ("Mage in training gets caught in month-long 'Groundhog Day' time loop")

- [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/weaver-nine-worm-fanfic-au-thread-2.304177/][Weaver Nine]] (Worm spinoff fic, "What if Jack Slash and Taylor were born in each others' places?")

I'd recommend any of 'em.
