One of the first rational fanfics that followed Yudkowsky's example to my knowledge is [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/story.shtml][Luminosity]].

It is a Twilight fanfic with rational!Bella.

I also enjoy the ongoing but extensive fanfic [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.272850/][With this ring]]. It is a Self Insert where the main character (the author) wakes up orbiting Earth the DC Young Justice universe and finds himself wearing an Orange Lantern Ring. Lots of rational problem solving and logical consequences, though the main character is a tad powerful.

And of course you can look at all the [[http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=1096][awesome stuff]] recorded in the [[http://www.hpmorpodcast.com][www.hpmorpodcast.com]] while there were no hpmor chapters to be read.
