Somehow missed this message. You can. I knew pretty much nothing about Green Lantern and only little about the DC universe in general. I also hadn't seen even a single episode of Young Justice. On the other hand I'm the type of guy who opens up the relevant wikis and meticulously reads up at least a bit with each new name that gets thrown around. Did the same with Luminosity and even HPMOR for all the spells and stuff, though I had read the Harry Potter books as a kid.
