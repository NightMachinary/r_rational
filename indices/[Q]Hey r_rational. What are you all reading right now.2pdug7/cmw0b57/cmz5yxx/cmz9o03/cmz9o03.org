Only Metropolitan Man by [[/u/alexanderwales]]. But I don't know much about the space battles webside and from the little I have seen they do have a lot of fanfictions, SI and forum input based stories. Especially the latter often have at least partially rational main characters just by the virtue of their decision making being by committee.

Have you seen [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/prt-department-sixty-four-worm-quest.283888/][Wildbow's own PRT Quest]]? At the moment it is in hiatus because of his large workload and personal life issues but there already is a lot of material (and 3 whole threads) and he said he plans on picking it up again.
