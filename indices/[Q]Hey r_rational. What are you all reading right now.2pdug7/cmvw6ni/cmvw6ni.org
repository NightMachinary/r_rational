I'll mention it, simply because it's one of my favorites. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2g6ffg/to_the_stars_puella_magica_ad_astra_hsf_magical/][To the Stars]]. It's webfiction (a fanfic to be precise, though I don't think one needs to know anything about Puella Magi Madoka Magica). (It also has the only double meta [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9107321/1/Reaching-for-Eternity][fanfic]] that I know of).

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1s0hr1/friendship_is_optimal_mlp_earthfic/][My little Pony: Friendship is Optimal]] has not been mentioned yet.

As for books, I'll give a vote for Anathem by Neal Stephenson. It's a book about math-monks. I think I've seen it compared to Yudkowsky's [[http://lesswrong.com/tag/conspiracy_world/][beisutsukai "stories"]] for being set in a somewhat similarly flavored world world.
