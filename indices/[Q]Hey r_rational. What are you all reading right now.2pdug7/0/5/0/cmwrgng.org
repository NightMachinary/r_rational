It was at one point available from the Baen Free Library, but it appears they took it down. However, the Internet Archive Wayback Machine perserves a copy, which you can [[http://web.archive.org/web/20040603022057/http://www.baen.com/library/0671878468/0671878468.htm][find here]]. It's not the ideal way to read a book, but I believe it's a complete copy of the first book in the series. It reminds me of /The Two Year Emperor/, in a lot of ways.
