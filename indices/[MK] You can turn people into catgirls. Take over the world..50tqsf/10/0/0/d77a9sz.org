Well, you said I need power comparable to that of a USA style president of the world. I can neutralize practically any political leader I dislike whose support is primarily from people too sexist to follow a girl.

If I turn, say, all the leaders of ISIL into a catgirls, I think I've fulfilled the criteria of shifting the world towards my values much more than a person who must be re-elected by the global population every four years, with many checks and balances on their power, who could be dethroned at any time with a change of political fortune ever could.
