I wonder if the rules around "touching" can be egregiously abused a bit. Can a detatched part of yourself transmit touch? How recently detatched? How small?

I'm considering the possibility of extracting and freezing a large quantity of my blood here, and then using it as a sort of catgirl-inducing "chemical weapon" of sorts. You could aerosolize it from drones over large gatherings and make thousands of catgirls in one shot, for example. Could be a powerful toolkit.
