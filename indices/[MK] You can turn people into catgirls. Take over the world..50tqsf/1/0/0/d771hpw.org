Ah, certainly there's a comparative genetic advantage to being male. But if most males maintain the intellectual and nurture-based elements of their sexual orientation, then upon catgirlification the majority of them will be lesbians, which actually increases the practical benefits of becoming female. And the genetic benefits of maleness and desire to be a genetic father can be maintained by using a sperm bank.

Also a fat ugly snagletoothed catgirl is still strictly cuter that a fat ugly snagletoothed not-catgirl. So I stick to at least a looser version of my original claim.
