Most of those are already female though. Ah I see your point. More men converted into catgirls means less competition for the original set of straight females, this is true.

That said, if men becoming catgirls is to the benefit of powerful men that want to stay men, then they still have all the more reason to support my system. And I only really need them to convert religiously, or at least give lipservice to having converted religiously. My political power is the end goal here, their beliefs don't necessarily matter too much. And It isn't a big deal if they don't convert physically.

What might become an issue is backlash from firmly straight women that dislike the idea of their prospects shrinking.

But on second thought this all assumes I'm significantly altering the world's M/F balance in the first place.

My core plan doesn't really require that. In fact identity politics might work better as long as we remain a minority group.

As a side note, now that I think about it. At it's most efficient, I could probably only convert at around 2/second, 12 hours a dayish, so what, 30 million a year? Probably way less if I want any security, and any time to recover. So even after 10 years I wouldn't have really changed things by more than 4%.

Unless of course I could munchkin the definition of "Touch" with skin grafts or something.
