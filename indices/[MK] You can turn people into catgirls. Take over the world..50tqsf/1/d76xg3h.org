If I touch myself can I become a cat girl?

Well, at the very least, I have undeniable miraculous powers, and can turn anyone female and adorable. Money wouldn't be an issue since I can charge obscene amounts of cash to help trans people.

But does that let me rule the world? I think this plan needs a phase 2, my best bets are to hire a PR team to leverage Identity politics relating to the newfound catgirl race, while also formulating a cultural religion writing me as the holy meowsiah. I have an edge here over all other social justice movements and religions, since I can legitimately convert people that want perspective on being a catgirl, and /obviously/ actually have holy powers ordained by God.

My goal is to create mounting social pressure until even the world leaders convert. They let me have my own vaticanlike nationstate, and standing army, and they treat my word with religious significance. Pope Style.
