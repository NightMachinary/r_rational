The first question here is how one might try to take over the world. There's the obvious 'legions of soldiers overthrowing the government and spreading across the world like a plague' actual /conquering/, but just as valid is diplomatically bringing all of the governments under my influence.

The first thing I would want to do, I think, is form a devoted core of catgirls most loyal to me. People with severe gender identity issues or other people who have nothing to lose whose problems I can fix by turning them into catgirls. Since this is a rather small group, I'd take each one and explain my goals, at least my short term ones, before getting them to agree to help me.

Thus I become king of the catgirls. The small core group I build affirm my authority to rule the species, and I seek to make headlines and spark discussion on the topic, maneuvering to an end result of accepting my sovereignty. If I'm lucky, I might get a reserve or something given to me and the catgirls, but I'd be willing to accept having no clay of my own if the wold at large still recognizes me as king of the catgirls.

During this whole episode, there will likely be an amount of people seeking to turn into catgirls, meaning my ranks will grow swiftly. I'll want to set up some girls in specific roles to ensure the functioning of my country. Depending on my country's level of autonomy I might need to figure out imports and exports and police and the like, so I'd need to recruit the help of economists, lawyers, politicians, and other specialists. If I'm in such a situation, I'd also likely be in a position to collect taxes to support all of that. If I don't have that kind of autonomy, I'd thankfully need much fewer things set up, but still things like passports or identification.

So how do I go from 'subject state' (effectively what I would be no matter the autonomy) to 'world leader'? Definitely war is out. I'm not a strong country, I don't have nukes, and I live by the mercy of the actual government. So I need to gain influence.

I'm thinking what I would do is look at a country with few diplomatic ties who is struggling (something like Venezuela comes to mind, but I'd need to do more research), and start focusing operations there. All voluntary, I freely offer to turn people of the target country into catgirls (and thus also citizens of my country) in exchange for loyalty. Next up, I try to get into power. Again, varies greatly by country, but if I can get the loyalty of a politician there I could orchestrate the country into having a catgirl in charge. From there, I think I could manage accumulating influence over the country's government as king of the catgirls until such point where I can assume direct control without too much fuss. If my governmental policies are better for the country's people, they might even thank me.

Once I have an entire country under by control, and not just some reserve somewhere (if that), it's time to bunker down and gain influence in other poor countries. I'd want to devise a system to maximize catgirl conversion rate while also keeping myself safe from risk of assassination, and with legions of catgirl followers I could worm my way into power of many third world countries. If I'm lucky, I could even get people to see it as humanitarian, bringing western values and economy to these struggling countries. It would not be easy by any means, especially with the rampant corruption I'd have to handle, but with dedicated experts on my side I think I can keep things together, especially if I have direct authority as king of the catgirls.

Once I've established a strong global empire across places like South America and Africa, I'd turn to the wealthier countries. Wash, rinse, repeat, and I have precedent for this method so as long as I make sure to avoid outright condemnation by the more powerful countries. With luck, I could bring the entire world under my influence within my lifetime.
