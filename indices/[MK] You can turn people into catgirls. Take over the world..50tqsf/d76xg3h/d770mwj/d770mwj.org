  If I touch myself can I become a cat girl?

  and can turn anyone female and adorable
#+end_quote

Not necessarily. It's a cat girl version of the original; if they were fat before, they're still fat. If they were ugly before they're still ugly. If the had a snaggletooth... etc.

  My goal is to create mounting social pressure until even the world leaders convert. They let me have my own vaticanlike nationstate, and standing army, and they treat my word with religious significance. Pope Style.

But the more catgirls there are, the greater the comparative advantage in being male. That means the rich and powerful elite are strongly incentivized to not become catgirls, being predominantly male.
