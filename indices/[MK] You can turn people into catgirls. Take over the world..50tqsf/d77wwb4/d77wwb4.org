Start by auctioning your talent through hospitals and medical clinics. People who are dying of something incurable now have another option to live. Not everyone will take it, but some will. Rich old people who don't care about society's response will take it just for being able to wipe away a lifetime's accumulation of disease and damage. Being an old /yet perfectly healthy/ catgirl may well have an appeal.

Given that you are the only source of this lifesaving ability, you can charge pretty much someone's entire fortune to save/extend their life. For those who are or were politically connected, you can charge favors. You now have money and a degree of influence.

Make the changes to the rich and powerful while they don't know you're there or how you did it. Have them stand a long way in front of a laser scanner or something, then stay at a clinic for 24 hours. Initiate direct contact while they sleep, or via a handshake while pretending to be a receptionist or assistant. They go away not knowing how you did it, and not associating any complex procedure with the conversion. Let them talk about it with other people. Let the intelligence community believe that the process can be initiated without the person's consent and ideally at a distance.

Find people in positions of power who have built up cults of personality or connected their career to their looks. Televangelists, politicians, businesspeople, Hollywood actors. Have someone contact them, claiming to have stolen your catgirl technology, and threaten to turn them into catgirls if they don't do what you say. Again, more money and influence.

I would note here that quite possibly a large proportion of current politicians on all sides would not want to be suddenly turned into a catgirl at the worst possible moment. Even better, it's quite possible that various people in their retinue, family, or circles /would/ but haven't told them for fear of retribution, so having those people suddenly become catgirls would induce fear and anger in the primary target. If the people who got transformed (and wanted to be) start expressing joy at the change, you can further threaten the primary target by mentioning that the change affects people's minds, too.

Against a threat to personal power which apparently can't be defended against in any way, and with a lot of old, rich, connected people having voluntarily undergone transformation and thus not putting up with any attempt to demonize the process or result (and simultaneously culturally connecting the process with being rich and somewhat selfish), quite a lot of politicians might be able to be coerced, giving you extensive behind-the-scenes power.
