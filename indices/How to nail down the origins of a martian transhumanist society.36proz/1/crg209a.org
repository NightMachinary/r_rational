Probably the best thing you can do is to start writing. It is said that every writer has about a million bad words worth of writing to go through before they can produce anything halfway decent. Best to get through those as fast as possible and learn all you can from that.

That said, don't worry about getting it perfect. The story you want to tell isn't about what happened to Earth. You are basically at a point where you will accept any plausible idea to explain away that annoying detail so you can move on. So don't sweat it! Just let that be a free variable; have it be something so horrible and emotionally charged that it just isn't mentioned in polite company, or something along those lines.

Do some brainstorming about the setting. Start somewhere in the middle with characters that interest you. Write about their stories and exploits, and try to imagine what life is like for them in this world. Like a grain of sand that is the catalyst for a pearl, let your story coalesce around these ideas. The other details will fall into place.
