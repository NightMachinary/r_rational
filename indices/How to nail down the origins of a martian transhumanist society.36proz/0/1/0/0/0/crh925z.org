  You, conversely, were claiming that *any* story that includes *a strong AI* cannot include humans undertaking interesting and worthwhile activities, at least nothing worth writing stories about.

You are factually incorrect in that statement.

I initially wrote:

    Sci-fi with *unfettered* strong AI isn't really about people anymore.

    [...]

    ...don't go down the full-blown, *strong-AI-to-hard-takeoff apocalypse* route unless you want the story to be about that.

As for my reaction to your messages, you were suggesting very specific, very *optimistic* constraints for strong AI that would allow for interesting human stories.

In your initial message, you wrote on this in a way that hinted you thought any other result was unlikely or possibly broke your suspension of disbelief if used in fiction. That stance would be a very *optimistic* one. It is not clear to me if you hold this belief or not.

Strong, safe, singular (though not leading directly into a Singularity) AI *can* make a good secondary story element or background feature. That's not what I was talking about. Though I think that Friendly AI is very unlikely to be done right IRL, it is /possible/ and is certainly useable in fiction.

Please read what I wrote more carefully. I will attempt to do the same with your posts.
