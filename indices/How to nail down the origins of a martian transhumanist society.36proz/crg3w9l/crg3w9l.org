Have you considered grey goo? It's basically rogue AI on a budget.

It presumably doesn't know or care about space travel, but it's either poisonous or corrosive or it's just outcompeted every living thing on Earth. People don't visit Earth because they don't want to risk carrying spores away.

And maybe it can only grow properly in Earth-like atmospheres; so space stations and pressurised colonies are at risk, but it can't colonise outdoor areas on Mars or Venus.
