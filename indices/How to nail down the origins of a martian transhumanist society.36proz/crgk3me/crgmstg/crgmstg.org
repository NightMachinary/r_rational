Nah, run it the other way. Earth fully networked and hit post-scarcity at about the same time as the off-world colonies reached a decent size. Then technological and cultural advancement started to happen at really frightening velocities on earth due to well over ten billion minds all being in low latency contact and not engaged in the work of survival. Due to the light-speed delays in communication everyplace much beyond low earth orbit decoupled from the accelerating earth culture, and shortly after that, it became common sense to avoid even contact with it like the plague because the informational firewalls and memetic immune system of a typical belt ship or martian colony would just melt like a snowflake in the core of the sun if hooked up to The Internet. The belter joke goes that they blew up the com link with earth after their latest anti-virus software update offered to remove the known infohazards of "religion, neo-classical economics and pre-tizzard psychological theory" Occasionally earth launches aid packages that.. while obviously designed to be as harmless as at all possible.. are still extremely scary.

Auto-doc Medical kits with the ability to preform full shape changes into any biologically plausible form.

Self-help books that actually work.

Ect.

Then there are the things that go up that are not aid packages, which tend to just be incomprehensible. And The Event that happened to the moon, which decent people do not speak of.
