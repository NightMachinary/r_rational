But it doesn't /have/ to make all planets uninhabitable, depending on what its utility function is. A bad utility function could produce all sorts of plot-convenient behaviors, like killing everyone on Earth but nowhere else. By definition, a utility function can be practically anything, and given that it's making the Earth uninhabitable we already know that the AI is exhibiting unintended behaviors.

(The question isn't whether the depicted world is one that you would expect given someone saying "AI killed everyone", it's whether it's plausible as a background detail.)
