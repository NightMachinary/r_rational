Earth is still there, has a population of 49 billion (4 pure ai per originally-human mind), and the rest of the solar system shuns it as the great whore of babylon on the grounds that anyone foolish enough to visit either never comes back, or comes back... changed. Heck, just talking too much to earthlings has been known to result in being persuaded to let your radio eat your brain. (Moravec upload) Done, dusted. This isn't because earth is horrid - it's just undergone a heck of a lot faster cultural change than the much lower populations elsewhere. Also, there is the unpleasant fact that earth-side minorities that care about off-world people tend to be... radical.
