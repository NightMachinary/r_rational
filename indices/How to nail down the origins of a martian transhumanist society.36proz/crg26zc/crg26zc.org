Sci-fi with unfettered strong AI isn't really about people anymore. It's about the AI. The Singularity is very real for sci-fi, as that is a point at which all rules of relatable characters (uploaded, flesh, or AI) and plot tension go out the window. Make it about transhumans if you want, but don't go down the full-blown, strong-AI-to-hard-takeoff apocalypse route unless you want the story to be about that.

For story telling reasons, I'd cap processing capability of all general computer intelligences (AI or uploaded) to within no more than about 30-50% of an unaugmented human's processing ability for the same resource cost--just declaring super-intelligences as impossible because of combinatorial complexity issues for storing and working with information in a neural network. This is also a hard cap for size. No Jupiter brains.

There is no strong science yet /disproving/ this (though there are good theories), so that will at least maintain some suspension of disbelief. Big, "dumb" expert systems will still be better for grinding through huge amounts of information given specific tasks, but that lower, more human level will be the limit for complex general intelligences able to work at real time.

Blind optimizers also shouldn't work (even slow ones) because nanotech is both difficult to make and easy to disrupt (otherwise, grey goo ho!)

--------------

As for Earth not being available, the sci-fi trope standards apply.

First, informational separation. Assume there are still visible "alive" looking cities, but no one seems to want to risk making high-energy ground station transmissions from Earth for some reason. At least few to none that the outer system can make out.

There are then the physical barriers:

- A cloud of high orbital junk that no one has cleaned up, from the last anti-sat war, makes getting to the Earth too dangerous.
- Quarantined surface because of moderately bad grey goo scenario. Intrastellar radiation is bad enough to prevent high-atmospheric or space transmissions (remember, no super AI or invincible nanotech). The colonies enforce a blockade and shoot down anyone trying to take off.
- Xenophobic Earth world government won't allow any contact right now (think 1600s Japan).
- Automated weapons platforms, either in orbit or on the surface, simply shoot at anyone who tries to get too near the Earth (works with other reasons).
- Mars just doesn't have a good industrial base or a space program yet. Getting out of Earth's gravity well is hard compared to Mars', even if you can get there in one piece. Too hard to make it worth while considering other challenges.
- Ignore the "silent Earth" scenario. There was complete planetary destruction. Core crackers turned it into a newly developing asteroid field, or it just got knocked out of orbit and into deep space.
