Of course not colder then mars. If the single criterium you have is "which is going to be more habitable" then earth is going to win out in almost any scenario. Even giant dropped asteroids leave you with pressurized atmosphere, probably oxygen (though not necessarily) and heaps of surface water.

Thus if you want your Civ to choose mars you either have to choose a disaster that makes Earth absolutely unaccessible (goo, AI gone wrong) or impose political or other motivations on your colonists (new frontier, fear from mutated human cannibals, solar modules not working under heavy cloud cover) etc.
