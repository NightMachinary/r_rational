Several specific ideas here have incorporated this, but I feel the general concept could use expressing.

You don't have to make Earth completely worthless, you just have to make it less worthwhile than other planets in the system. Given how ludicrously uninhabitable some parts of the solar system are, the easiest way would be to severely damage the viability of Earth to human populations. [[/u/alexanderwales]]'s asteroid, [[/u/SvalbardCaretaker]]'s nuclear exchange and biological warfare, or a big dumb grey goo (as opposed to a full-blown AI) are all viable ways to serve this purpose without the need for an intelligence actively keeping humans away. This has the benefit/detriment (depending on your story) of potentially having a fixed end date for its inhospitability that those off of Earth could calculate.
