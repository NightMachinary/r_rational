Yes. The problem with grey goo is, if you have grey goo its immensely valuable to make other planets hospitable. Obviously not the failed goo, but all the other related nanotech. You either incorporate them (and can easily create a power creep you did not want in the first place) or you get some inconsistencies in your setting.
