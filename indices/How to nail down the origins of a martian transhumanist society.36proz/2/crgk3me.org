Earth is densely populated, well-organized, and completely inflexible. Doing /anything/ outside of the List of Ordinary Things requires a license. Taking up a single unusual hobby is a few weeks' work with the bureaucrats, but technological innovation is completely impractical. This is enforced by every electronic device on the planet, all of which have law-enforcement circuitry.

Several outer colonies could invade, but then they'd be stuck dealing with a trillion people who don't know any other way of living. And the knowledge of how to feed and clothe that population is embedded in the policies: starting from scratch would mean widespread starvation.

There exist charities that take the most valuable technological advances of the outer solar system and try to shepherd them through Earth's bureaucracy. It's frustrating work, but high impact.
