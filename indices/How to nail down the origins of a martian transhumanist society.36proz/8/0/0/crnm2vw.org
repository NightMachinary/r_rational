Most utility functions lead to the AI converting its future light cone to usually computronium. Even an AI programmer who has heard of that anecdote (but thinks the problem nonhard enough that he can solve it personally) is usually going to get the universe converted. On the other hand, if they were also educated in the (today nonexistent) theory of writing utility functions that don't convert the universe, I would be hard-pressed to find a mistake for them to make that would doom Earth and only Earth. You'd basically have to deliberately specify Earth as a playground and set the rest of the universe off-limits with your hard theory.
