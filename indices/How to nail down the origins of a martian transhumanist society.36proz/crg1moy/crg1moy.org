1. Religious extremists with both technical expertise (possibly stolen) and a death wish have destroyed the Earth. If you need an answer to "how?", the easiest way to destroy Earth given near-future technologies involves gaining control of an asteroid mining operation and ramming a sufficiently large one into the planet at maximum speed. Slingshot it around a few planets, skim by the Sun to avoid detection on the final approach, and then kill almost everyone on Earth.

2. The Earth was destroyed by scientists trying to do something stupid, like messing with cosmic strings, or strangelets, or an Einstein-Rosen bridge, or something that humans a hundred years from now might be able to manipulate but not quite understand. The less you explain this, the better, unless your story is about the destruction of Earth.

3. You don't actually have to say, since it could happen quickly. The opening line of Neal Stephenson's new book is, "The Moon blew up without warning, and for no apparent reason", which I think is a perfectly fine thing to do.
