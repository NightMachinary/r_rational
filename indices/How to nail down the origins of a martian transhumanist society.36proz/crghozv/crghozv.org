Some Earth scientists were experimenting with teleportation. They found out how to create wormholes with one end in their own reference frame (attached to the surface of the Earth, essentially) and the other in a different reference frame. They tried to test this by putting the other end along Earth's orbit but got the numbers wrong.

Right now, there's a moderately large wormhole on Earth's surface that connects to the outer stretches of the sun's corona. It's slowly boring a hole through the Earth, venting superheated gases, etc. It's about as inviting as Venus, except it's eventually going to destroy enough of the Earth to smash it into pieces.

Besides, the only great thing about Earth is the ready supply of volatiles.
