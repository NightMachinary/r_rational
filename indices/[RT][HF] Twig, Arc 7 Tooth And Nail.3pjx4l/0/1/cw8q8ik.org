I'm pretty sure that the escalating threat isn't the problem, considering Worm had far more of that. If anything, Pact screwed up by starting too high (birdman everywhere!) and ending up with nowhere to go.

With that said, Twig has a much more gradual pace of escalating threat, and starts much lower. The protagonist is part of an established team, they're competent and dealing with almost routine tasks as troubleshooters for, and within, and backed by, an established power structure.

Imagine if Taylor had joined the Wards and been given training instead of running off to join the Undersiders like a twit, and also there's no Endbringers or Entities. Echidna, maybe, and definitely Cauldron, but no Endbringers.
