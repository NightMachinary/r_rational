Disclaimer: I enjoyed Pact. Vague Wildbow spoilers follow.

I'd say Twig is definitely worth a read. Still a crapsack universe, because Wildbow, but a much sharper focus on character development and more developed relationships among the core cast. It has "breathing room" Pact didn't, because this time Wildbow has kept characters who matter deeply to each other front and center.

After Worm, I think Wildbow itched for a more flawed and complex protagonist. (Flawed meaning "possessing personality traits directly opposed to success," not "angsty badass.") Taylor was great, but her flaws were things like "strained relationships" that didn't impact her too badly in terms of combat effectiveness.

So Pact came along and the protagonist got /nerfed./ He made the most of what he was given, but he was dealt a /really/ shitty hand.

Even so, the disturbing thing wasn't how rough the protagonist had it, it was how alone he was. He had literally no one to trust, and the universe itself was against him.

So in Twig Wildbow put together a tight-knit cast of characters who spend more time together than not. They're dealt a shit hand in a shit universe, but they cooperate, trust one another, and play to each other's strengths. There's banter and occasional friction in the group-- conflict is their native tongue after all-- but they work together effectively (echoing Taylor's resourcefulness and strategies) and they're there for each other when they need it (contrasted to Blake in Pact, for whom every lifeline is a thorny vine.)

Say what you will about Wildbow, he recognizes his mistakes and weaknesses and improves upon them.
