I'd say Twig has more breathing room than Pact, but still less than Worm. Both Pact and Twig would be much improved by having more interludes, say 1 interlude after every 5 regular chapters. Otherwise the supporting characters turn into mere obstacles for the main cast, while in Worm it felt like literally everyone has their own story. It was especially tantalizing in Pact, where some supporting characters were super interesting (Ur, the Faerie) but their stories were just left hanging.
