I feel that, but Worm had 10 years of stop-start development before we got the final product. I don't think that's something that can be emulated on the fly, given the already-phenomenal amount of work that Wildbow puts into his writing. The reason it felt like everyone has their own story in Worm is because pretty much everyone had their own story that then got abandoned, before being adjusted to fit into Worm proper.

Can we really fault the author for not having 10 years of experimentation to put into a story written in 1-2 years?
