So how's this story doing? Not read one word of it myself. Not sure I have time to start right now, but it would be nice to have a QA breakdown from someone.

Anyone have any strong feelings one way or another? Still suffering from the bipolar-Dickens authorial issues of endless reams of hurry-up-and-get-worse-forever the last one had?

I had strong feelings about that one, if it isn't clear.
