  Or you're the advanced one and they're the ones with only semi-advanced tech.

That sort of timing would be /really/ suspicious. I'd start calling intelligently directed Drake-equation shenanigans (given life-bearing planets being rare at all).

Extremes are much more statistically likely, given the age of our galaxy and stars like ours, and how long it took us to go from zero to hero (or at least this far). And given the lack of evidence for seriously high-level civilizations, even in the 'Trek 'verse with their Dyson's spheres and all, everyone else being somewhere between advanced rock-banging and one-celled life would be the logical expectation.

But once you've met the same-levels, like the Vulcans, Klingons, etc, /and then/ the Q, things start coming together. 'Trek 'verse is clearly full of seeded races, all done at the same time by a FTL species.

And if we meet aliens that care at all about us, technologically speaking, we should assume the same in absence of lots of other evidence.
