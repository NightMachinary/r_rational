In defense of Star Trek TNG...

Charlie Stross seems to be saying that TNG wasn't a science fiction, just an interpersonal drama set in space.

He can't have watched much of it.

TNG did have its problems, technobabble, deus ex data, last minute narrative ass-pulls, and a number of questionable episode plots.

And, it wasn't hard sci fi by any stretch. We're dumped into a universe where somehow humanity has just stumbled its way into a post-scarcity, post-economics world, and questions about how that happened and what problems it caused are left as an exercise for the viewer.

But, to say that "you could strip out the 25th century tech in Star Trek and replace it with 18th century tech" is utterly untrue. Many of the episode plots are based around concepts that are pureblood scifi.

What if the transporter malfunctions and created two copies of you? [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chances_%28Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation%29][Second Chances]] raises all the issues of what it means to have an identity and what we lose when we're no longer unique which you'd expect to come up when dealing with duplicating teleporter. This is a plot where technological teleportation is integral, not an afterthought or part of the background.

What if there were a computer game that was so addictive it stopped you functioning properly? In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_%28Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation%29][The Game]] such a video game arrives on the Enterprise. It's very addictive and encourages people to share it with others, sometimes by force. It eventually turns out that the main intention of the game is to be used as a form of mind control. Here we have an episode of a tv show where concepts relating to technological superstimulus and memetic hazards are the driving force in the plot, this isn't an example of a space opera.

What if a trickster god appears and forces you to re-live the events of Robin Hood? Okay.. lets skip this one. Let's just skip all Q episodes.

What if you have the technology to wipe out an irredeemable enemy? In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Borg][I, Borg]] the crew debate the ethics vs the necessity of wiping out the Borg by sending a captured drone back carrying a highly destructive memetic hazard.

Sure there are episodes such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Measure_of_a_Man_%28Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation%29][The Measure of a Man]] which deals merely with the issues of whether or not a sentient robot can be considered property, a topic which could have been dealt with as easily, if not as effectively in a slave-trade era setting.

And there are episodes such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_of_Both_Worlds_%28Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation%29][The Best of Both Worlds]] which only deals with the loss of your individual consciousness, and the concept of humans-as-wetware. You could do that in an 18th century setting, right?

TLDR

Had its writing problems, casting problems, production problems, many kinds of problems. Had moments of genius, prescience and was often thought provoking, and must certainly be counted as sci fi.
