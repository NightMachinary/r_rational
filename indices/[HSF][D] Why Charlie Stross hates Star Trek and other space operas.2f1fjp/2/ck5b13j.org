Star Trek, especially TNG, was not hard science fiction about technology.

This makes Charlie Stross mad. He seems to know why, so that's good.

But I think a point was missed about what Trek /was/. It wasn't about the characters' interpersonal dramas (at least, outside of late-TNG and Voyager), such that it could just as easily have been a sailing ship in space. It was about people interacting with new situations /in relation to/ technology and new and different cultures.

Yes, with the technology abstracted into technobabble with vague rules, and sometimes the cultures oddly impractically designed. But Stross WAY oversteps by trying to analyze something he doesn't like or want to know more about. He admits as much, but still goes ahead and takes a swing at defining something of which he is intentionally ignorant. This is the worst sort of dismissive elitism from someone who should know better.

Most of Star Trek was about applied sociology. How people related to the developing dramatic situations, with lots of metaphor and quite frankly artificially constructed props. But it wasn't about realistic representation, though that got a nod, but about saying "what if?" in a series of cultural and social contexts, with the addition of technology that worked in ways that were compelling to regular viewers as well as thought provoking.

Gene Roddenberry's original vision was having stories about a future society and technology without using the classic tropes of chasing money and limited resources or inter-crew cultural infighting. And instead of being about battling aliens like in a pulp serial, what if the first move was to find out stuff about them? What if people /like us in most ways/ had to deal with something that worked like transporters, or warp drive, or energy weapons, or micromachine plagues, or genetic super-soldiers?

That those ideas weren't chased down and given the detailed treatment hard sci-fi fans would have wanted isn't a reason to dismiss it as entertainment, even if you are personally a hard sci-fi fan. The world presented /was/ significantly different than the one any pointy-haired boss might see at the time. This was done with a deft hand to make people think about the issues. It wasn't about future-shocking people as hard as possible. If you scratch the surface of /society/ instead of zeroing in on characters in a story that wasn't /about/ the characters (a stupid assumption on his part), you start to see the reason it was so groundbreaking.

There was a black woman on the bridge of a future naval vessel in the '60s! And a quirky Russian, and an alien who didn't ever turn traitor, and a gay Japanese man, and a guy from the South with a medical degree (I kid!). And it didn't matter to the plot. When Kirk kissed a black woman on camera. That fact never. Mattered. To the plot. Which was /groundbreaking/, and a cause of much discussion at the time.

TNG and later series were slipping into the written-by-soap-opera problem that all later sci-fi would face, but it still had interesting social situations involving technology. A blind man was different from other people, but he was simply differently abled because of advances in technology; a robot wanted to be more like us, and wasn't simply yet another mindless killing machine; and a women could serve in a combat role on a starship, and in ground combat with lasers, and even die in the line of duty to strange aliens without everyone involved instantly exploding somehow. And the A plots still weren't about those things.

But because no one decided that they should use alien medical tech to do better implants and replacement limbs after the Federation meeting the Borg, it is for stupid idiots who are dumb. Holodecks might have changed the way people looked at VR across the entire world, but they don't make scientific sense so they don't matter I guess. No one is a max-level futurist (and I am one!) or an alien beyond human keen, so it doesn't matter. Sigh.

He also needs to step off on Babylon Five, because he doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about there either. Is it truly the hardest of /hard/ sci-fi? No. Is it space opera? Uh, /no/.

But the Battlestar Galactica remake? Yeah, Hornblower in space. Fuck that piece of shit pretending to be sci-fi. Most disappointing bait-and-switch ever after that mini-series showed such promise. And I've been having to hear about it from my "loves Big Bag Theory, too" level fake-nerd friends for a solid *decade*. GRRRRAH.
