  But once you've met the same-levels, like the Vulcans, Klingons, etc, and then the Q, things start coming together. 'Trek 'verse is clearly full of seeded races, all done at the same time by a FTL species.

Yes, that's the canon explanation, as a matter of fact. Of course, the Precursors have nothing to do with the Q Continuum, so between the Q Continuum and /everyone else/, your thesis actually holds.

Fortunately, most Q have laws, so instead of the entire galaxy spending its entire evolutionary history being constantly trolled by energy beings, they just evolved normally.
