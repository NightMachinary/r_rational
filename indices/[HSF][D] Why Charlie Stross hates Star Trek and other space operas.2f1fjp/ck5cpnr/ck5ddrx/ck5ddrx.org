  What if a trickster god appears and forces you to re-live the events of Robin Hood? Okay.. lets skip this one. Let's just skip all Q episodes.

A shame, because in real hard sci-fi, that would be closest to what encountering an alien species would be like. Without some woo-woo excuse, what are the chances you'll be nearly /exactly/ the same technology level, such that you can interact as peers?

Either they are just figuring out banging rocks together, or they are totally, unbeatably better than you to the point where any interactions at all are just for their own amusement.
