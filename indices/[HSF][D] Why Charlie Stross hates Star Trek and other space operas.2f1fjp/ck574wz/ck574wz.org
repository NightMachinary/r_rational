Ehh... with all due respect to CS (and I do like his books more than I like Star Trek), Trek and what he writes are vastly different genres aimed at different audiences.

Stross writes sharp, witty, smart-assed, self-aware stories with deep SF roots. Trek is weekly action-drama [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledINSPACE][IN SPACE]] aimed at a much more general audience, and its everything-wrapped-up-by-the-end-of-the-hour formula is written to the same tune as a thousand other TV programs which have to pump out 26 to 52 stories a year.

Really, there's no reason for Stross to hate on Trek - it's so far removed from hard SF that any attempt to take a swing at it would need a parsec-length baseball bat. It's like hating on Spaceman Spiff or crummy space-alien comic books from the middle of the last century.
