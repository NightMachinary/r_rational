This is a good critique of Star Trek, and indeed hits straight to the heart of what I dislike about it. But with that said, I do think that Star Trek is more science fictional than Stross gives it credit for, even if it only delves into actual science fiction a few times per season. You wouldn't have a story about finding a teleporter clone in a high seas adventure, for example.

Unfortunately, Star Trek doesn't have a particularly well thought out world, and most of the time the tech is just window-dressing that has no impact on the plot, which sucks. So yes, I agree, though I imagine that I've watched a lot more Star Trek than Stross has, and they do occasionally take an episode break out of the space opera.
