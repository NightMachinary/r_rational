Nah, you got that right. Leaving the girl to die was rational given that he didn't want to be snatched up by Uncle Sam. What I also tried to show though was that he didn't /care/ that the girl would die. He considered the father an 'easy mark' to bleed dry, and at the end he thinks to himself that /he/ doesn't care, and is just annoyed he loses out on the money and word of mouth.
