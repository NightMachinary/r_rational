<nods> I'm put in mind of how, in practice, doctors and nurses tend to develop empathy exhaustion--enough suffering and dying people seen that they become unable to care about suffering and death any more, but keep at it lessening suffering and death where they can because they know in their heads it's the right things to do (or just for money, depending on the person). Still better than someone who increases suffering and death while feeling guilty about it!
