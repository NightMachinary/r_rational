[[http://pastebin.com/0mczqtQr][Nuclear Rapture]], 1800 words, a rational new age chiliasm/reincarnation fic about what might happen if Edgar Cayce's channelings on where souls and consciousness came from were true. (And, I guess, looking over the encyclopedia, if the Platonic doctrine of recollection were true. Didn't realize Cayce had been borrowing from such an august source.)
