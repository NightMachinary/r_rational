#+begin_quote
  When can you know that someone is trying to play the long, manipulative game, even if every action they've taken so far seems fairly innocous? Is it possible at all?

This depends how thoroughly the Someone is playing the game.

But of course, if everything they've done so far appears fairly innocuous, they might think they're being innocuous.
