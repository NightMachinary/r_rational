Whoops! My bad. But then again ... maybe you were setting me up to make this mistake. Maybe you've been watching me for years.

Maybe I bumped your elbow on the subway once while you were trying to read reddit on your phone, so you took a sneaky photo of me and later got your friend at the NSA to identify my face. You trawled through every public and private conversation I've ever had online, looking for patterns, biases, weaknesses.

It took years, but eventually you had the knowledge it takes to post the perfect comment to the right thread in my favourite subreddit at a time when I'm probably sleep deprived.

Maybe. Or maybe I'm just being paranoid?
