I'd take it on a case-by-case basis, and [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalist_taboo][play taboo]] with the word “paranoid”.

If you're specifically wondering about deception (e.g. your mum pretending she didn't find a condom, your boss pretending he's not planning to fire you), you could read about what behaviours / facial expressions / tones of voice people tend to demonstrate when they're lying, or you could look at their past history when it comes to telling the truth / being direct in their questioning / resolving conflicts straightforwardly.

Alternatively, you could get a job with flexible work hours (and a trustworthy boss) and which pays well enough for you to not have to live with your mum =p
