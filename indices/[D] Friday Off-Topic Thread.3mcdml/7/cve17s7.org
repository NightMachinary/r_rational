Paranoia. When are you being paranoid, and when are they really out to get you?

Ok, so we've all seen movies and read books with both people who are too paranoid, not paranoid enough or just paranoid enough. What I ask is, in real life, which follows no overarching narrative (although, of course, there can be a variety of narrative-like structures IN life itself) when can you actually be certain there IS some bigger plot, as opposed to you just misinterpreting things and being "too paranoid"? When can you be sure that your mom asking about your new girlfriend isn't her way of subtly probing you because she found the condom you thought you'd lost last week? When do you know if your boss casually asking you to train someone isn't the preparatory steps towards you being fired, because he noticed you're tardy often but chooses to not address it and let it fester, so your firing is justified?

When can you know that someone is trying to play the long, manipulative game, even if every action they've taken so far seems fairly innocous? Is it possible at all?

Note the answer to the above questions, along with any times you were too paranoid, just paranoid enough or NOT paranoid enough, if you feel so inclined. :)
