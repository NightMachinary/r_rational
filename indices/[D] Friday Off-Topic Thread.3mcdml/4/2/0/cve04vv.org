  If this is actually true, then I suspect that you normally over-plan and doubt yourself whenever you do math and alcohol is just stopping you from second-guessing yourself.

That's my guess, too. I mean, really it shouldn't be hard to come up with the proof technique of treating real numbers as lazily-generated infinite streams of digits, and then creating bijections between uncountable sets (sets of infinite streams) by showing how to parse-and-compile one set into the other.

But I tend to be inhibited by trying to do everything the Right Way instead of some clever way when I'm sober.

And I suck at calculations, whenever.
