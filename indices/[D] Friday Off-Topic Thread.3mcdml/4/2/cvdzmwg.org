Sorry if this sounds obvious or insulting, but did you go back and double-check your calculations when you were sober? You might have just thought you were writing something brilliant down, but later it'll have turned out that you wrote chicken scratches down.

If this is actually true, then I suspect that you normally over-plan and doubt yourself whenever you do math and alcohol is just stopping you from second-guessing yourself.
