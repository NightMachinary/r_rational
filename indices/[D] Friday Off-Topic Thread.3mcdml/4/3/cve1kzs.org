I definitely think there's /some/ merit to being inebriated while trying to be productive. It's just about the kind of productive you're going for, and also how you personally react to said inebriation. Like, for example, if you're a writer and you get high, you may make creative breakthroughs that you wouldn't make sober, daring, risky creative leaps that you wouldn't come to while sober. Now, of course, what you produce is probably going to need some sober fine tuning, but inebriation can breed creative ideas pretty well. But maintaining them in coherency to your work is usually a problem.
