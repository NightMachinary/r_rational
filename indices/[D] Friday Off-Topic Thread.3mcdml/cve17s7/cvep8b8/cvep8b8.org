Where possible, acquire additional evidence. Learn to read body language and tone, then begin.

Make a joke about a similar subject and see if your mum reacts naturally.

Are there other people who have been late often who are still around? Do co-workers who have been around a long time remember anyone similar? What happened to them? Has your boss done something similar in the past?

Find people who know the manipulative person from before, ask about his character and actions.

There was a time when I was not paranoid enough. I thought it would be a good idea to get the rent out of my house mate before he graduated, but with one thing and another it didn't happen. He was very conciliatory and offered to go down to the bank right that moment before he left, but I didn't take him up on it. Soon as he left he cut off all contact. Dick still owes me Â£240, in theory. In practice I have accepted I will never see that money.

In retrospect I ignored that nagging voice in my head in this matter.
