I don't think this is true. The vast majority of evil systems aren't designed by evil people, they're designed by good people to work with like ten guys. Then, as they grow, the system is constantly kludged and modified in little ways by people who don't have the full picture. Those people don't even realize they're making moral decisions, they're just trying to keep the system working at all under new conditions.

After a few generations of that, you get a Frankenstein monster made of duct tape and twine that doesn't reflect the will of any of its creators. It exists for its own sake, with its own perverse incentives accidentally built-in and fed into positive feedback loops.

The evil people swoop in afterwards, once there are subtle broken pieces they can use for profit. They might contribute to making the system even more amoral, but the initial cracks usually aren't anyone's fault. That's just what happens when you build a thing without specifically taking the effort to be good.

For example, originally the cable company had technicians work directly on everything. Then when they bolted a call center onto their operation, coordinating everything was a mess. The complication was costing them sales, so someone streamlined the ordering process. Training the call center on anything is a complicated hassle, but it's not really needed. They can just have a simple front-end that handles things for them. Presto, sales go up, lost customers go down, and everything is perfect for everyone.
