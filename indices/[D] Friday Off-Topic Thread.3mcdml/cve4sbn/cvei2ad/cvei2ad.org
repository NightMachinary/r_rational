Pro tip: Take standardized tests as soon as possible, and then every year. I took the SAT and ACT beginning as a freshman in high school, and went from a 1480 to 1600 on the SAT (old scale max) and 31, 34, 35 (out of 36) on the ACT. I didn't do any preparation other than filling out their free example booklets. Taking them early allows you to get used to the test environment and the pattern of the questions. Taking them senior year only is for chumps.
