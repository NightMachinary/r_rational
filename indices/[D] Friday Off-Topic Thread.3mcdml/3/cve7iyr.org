OK, so here's an idea I've been toying around with, and it formed the part of my last chapter of DMPOR and provoked a rather ugly debate on [[/r/hpmor][r/hpmor]].

"Systemic Assholes" or "Systemic Amorality"

The idea that a system can be specifically designed to act in a counter-productive or immoral way while allowing all parties to be (in their mind) moral.

My example was a low level bureaucrat following orders. He doesn't really have enough information to judge that his action is immoral, because "it's always been done that way" and his action isn't obviously immoral. (Visitors are not allowed here).

He's also deliberately (by the people who designed the system) unable to acquire the information that would allow him to determine that his actions are immoral and counterproductive.

It seems to me quite plausable that the primary purpose of some (exact number open for debate) organizations is to allow systemic immorality.

Consider a relatively annoying example: the call center for a cable company. The people in it are good, but they lack the ability to help you. You get charged for equipment you can't return because the person on the call doesn't have the information on that. Signing up is one mouse click, but cancelling is a convoluted phone mess.

That didn't just happen, but none of the people who you'd encounter in trying to cancel cable are trying to thwart you. But they can't lower your rates (etc) unless you say magic words and if they prompt you they may get fired.

Now, suppose that the original designers of this phone tree get fired for some reason. (Karma, poetic justice, or whatever). By the Peter Principle, the current people running the company are incompetent. And now you have a /systemic asshole/ and who exactly is to blame?

You can apply this to many organizations. I don't really have any answers, its just a phenomenon I've noticed with increasing frequency over the last few years. THere's a tension of scale. Network effects want larger organizations, but then you have a diffusion of knowledge and a mismatch between authority and contact with end users, and another S.A. is born.

Obviously this is just a gambit of the original inventors to get to Plausible deniability, but it can outlive the inventors and become societal.
