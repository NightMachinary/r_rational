  Consider a relatively annoying example: the call center for a cable company.

That's a really good example.

  Obviously this is just a gambit of the original inventors to get to Plausible deniability, but it can outlive the inventors and become societal.

I think this is wrong - it's a gambit of the original inventors to get /other people to work for them/, because they can't accomplish their goals alone. It's much like a non-evil organization, except worse, because this one is designed to get people to go along with something they might otherwise object to.

That said, think of the organizations you're a part of; could you really do much if they turned evil, due to circumstances or evil management?
