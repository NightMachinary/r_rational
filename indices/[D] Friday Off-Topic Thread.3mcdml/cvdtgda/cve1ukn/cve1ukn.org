  I just haven't been able to figure out why this formula sometimes works well and other times doesn't.

Do you mean why some shows work and other don't, or why some episodes of a show work, while other episodes of the same show don't?

If the later, I'd ask, what is the quality spread on a good episode of, say, Law and Order, and a bad one? Personally, I don't think that there is much of a spread. To me, virtually all episodes fall under "decent enough to watch to kill boredom, but not something that I'd particularly miss."

The former is a much more interesting question, but I won't even hazard a guess other than "how charismatic the actors are."
