I've been trying to formalize what makes a good mystery for a few days now, mostly because there's a good chance that whatever I'm writing when I'm done with /Shadows of the Limelight/ is going to be one of those.

I watch a lot of (police) procedurals, partly because they're easy to watch while doing other things, and they seem to have creating an episode of television down to a science. Start with a dead body. Find some connection, like a likely suspect, or a piece of unique evidence, which drives toward the next scene. Some minor mystery is revealed which shows that they're on the wrong track, but leads them to the right track. Keep doing that until you've run out the clock, then in the last ten minutes get the /right/ suspect along with sufficiently incriminating evidence that the audience will just assume that a conviction will follow (or kill the suspect in self-defense, or extract a confession).

I just haven't been able to figure out why this formula sometimes works well and other times doesn't.
