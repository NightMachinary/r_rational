I'm reading David Brin's /Existence/, and I think it's heavily based on our bunch. It's got:

- Neo-reactionary aristocrats saying this whole Enlightenment thing is finally over and jolly good.

- A whole dialogue that sounds like Robin Hanson and then gets credited to "Robin Hanson, emulation".

- Speculations about the fear of AI and AI Singletons.

- A seeming reference to Roko's Basilisk.

- Passage-length quotations from a book on existential risks.

- Speculation on the values of aliens.

And I'm not even halfway through the book yet.
