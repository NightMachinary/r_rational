There is some crazy interesting things happening all over the US right now. The Chinese head of state is visiting the west coast tech centers while the Pope is neck-deep in politics on the east. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3mc0hy/boehner_will_resign_from_congress/][The Republican Party is about to burst into flames]], and we're still *months* away from the first primaries!

I wonder what went through some of those CEO's heads when Xi asked them to stop giving the NSA access to the information of Chinese citizens. Which world power do you obey?

I wonder what the right thinks when the Pope is more liberal than they are.

I wonder if Clinton can survive her past, and if Sanders' will be enough of an asset.

And, worst (best?) of all, this is the first presidential election that millennials can vote in.

Things are gonna get strange.

Fortunately, /Twig/ is still at the top of its game.
