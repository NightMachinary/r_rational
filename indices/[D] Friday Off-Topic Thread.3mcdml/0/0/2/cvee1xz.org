  It's easy enough for the right to turn on the Pope. The dominant Christian religious tradition among the right is Protestant, not Catholic, and Catholics don't reliably vote for any particular party.[1] The only alignments of interest are abortion, gay marriage, and contraception, and that's only alignment of Catholicism and the Republican platform, not Catholics and the Republican platform (because most Catholics don't actually follow the Catholic church).

While this is all true, it's worth noting that the Catholic Church's social and moral opinions form a decent benchmark of what counts as the mainstream, respectable, /conservative/ (as opposed to reactionary, fascist, or neoliberal) Right. If your party is trying to tack, "We're Rightyer than the Pope" into its platform, you may actually have made a bad move.
