It's easy enough for the right to turn on the Pope. The dominant Christian religious tradition among the right is Protestant, not Catholic, and [[http://www.npr.org/2012/09/29/162001011/what-winning-the-catholic-vote-means-today][Catholics don't reliably vote for any particular party.]] The only alignments of interest are abortion, gay marriage, and contraception, and that's only alignment of Catholicism and the Republican platform, not /Catholics/ and the Republican platform (because most Catholics don't actually follow the Catholic church).

Denouncing the Pope seems like good strategy, if you're a Republican candidate, especially since there's some perceived resistance among the conservative American bishops to the Pope (some of which you can read into [[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/24/us/pope-francis-speech-to-the-bishops-of-the-united-states-of-america.html][his speech to those bishops yesterday]]).

The Clinton/Sanders thing ... I don't really think that Hillary's campaign has kicked into high gear yet. They're saving themselves for closer to the actual primaries, which is one of the advantages of being the assumed nominee. Every prediction market I've looked at has had her as the favorite, and I trust the prediction markets a lot more than I trust most other things. Because the prediction markets are also 60/40 on a Democratic win, I think Hillary is the most likely winner in 2016. But I'll wait on more data to come in before I place my own bets.
