In addition to making it harder to think, the neurotoxicity of alcohol also makes it harder to /overthink/. Many writers enjoy drinking before writing because it takes the edge off of their internal editor and just lets the consciousness stream.

I find I'm less likely to spin my wheels on useless distractions when I'm a bit buzzed... but I'm also less likely to spin my wheels in productive directions that just happen to take a bit of extra work. Be aware of the disadvantages, and drink responsibly.
