Tinder is turning me into a bad person, and I'm not sure if that's a bad thing. (And yes, I do mean "Tinder" as in the dating/hookup app.)

Ok so it's not turning me into a bad person exactly, but it's definitely causing me to be much more judgmental. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, the only reason I'm on Tinder is for casual encounters. I even make sure to say exactly that in my profile description. It's worked rather well thus far. Match with girl on Tinder, message for a little bit, get her phone number, text for a little bit, go on date, hopefully go back to one of our respective homes, rinse and repeat. As a whole I consider it a net positive for both parties because we both end up with what we want out of the interaction.

But the problem is that I've done it more than a few times now and I've become unsettlelingly efficient with my method. I've started treating the women I'm interacting with more as pieces of data with a possible solution (sex), than I treat them as actual human beings. Basically Tinder is slowly draining away my humanity.

I really don't want to stop though. I have little interest in a girlfriend at this point in my life, it's the easiest/most efficient method I've found for instigating casual encounters, and like I said earlier both parties (thus far) have always walked away happy.

I suppose I'm just having a bit of an ethical dilemma with the whole thing.
