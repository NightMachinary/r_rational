I spent some time as a younger man working as a college admissions counselor. Wealthy families would hire me to help their children prepare for tests like the SAT and write their college applications. Here's what you need to know, generally:

*0. Take classes that qualify you for admission to college*

Most colleges will require a minimum number of years in mathematics, social sciences, natural sciences, and language arts/literature for admission. Some will also require a specific level be reached in mathematics-- say, pre-calculus. Ideally, you take 4 years in each of those 4 subjects.

*1. Get good grades*

You need good grades to get into college. How good depends on the school. If you want to apply to an engineering school, you'll particularly want good grades in math and science courses. Ideally, you get mostly As, though Bs are fine. I got into the UCLA engineering school with 50% Bs, 50% As in my math/science courses, while taking honor roll courses 7 years ago.

*2. Do well on standardized tests*

Most schools require you either take the SAT or ACT to get in, and your scores matter a lot, almost as much as your grades. You may also be required to take subject-matter tests. Taking tests isn't a test of knowledge or expertise, it is a test of your ability to take tests. Test-taking is a skill that can be trained, and learning how to perform well on standardized tests is something that children in wealthy communities learn in school starting from 2nd or 3rd grade.

If your test scores are low, you should lay out some cash and enroll in cram school. My initial score on the SAT was an average of 700 on each section. I spent a couple of months going to the Princeton Review cram school in the evenings and at the end got an average of 770 on each section. At the time, there were 3 sections on the SAT worth 800 points each, so I went from 2100 to 2310.

This cram school was very expensive-- I think in total it cost about 2 grand with materials, tuition, etc-- but it was worth it. I have the kind of mind and set of study habits that reacted well to cram school. All the lectures and homework and flashcards worked well, and because I wasn't stressed out by existing schoolwork, the extra work didn't overload me. Bear in mind that if you end up crushing yourself under extra work this could be counterproductive.

Either way, though, buy a book and study for your standardized tests. The system is meant to be gamed, to be beaten by studying for these things. They're designed to be difficult to study for, but it can be done.

*3. Apply to at least one school you are sure you will get into, and like*

So, the most important school you apply to is the one you're absolutely sure you'll get into. This school WILL be an option for you, so pick it wisely. People call it a “safety” school because applying to it gives you a “safe” option. Many people end up attending their safety school, so pick it wisely! If your safety school is a place you don't actually want to go, you're putting yourself in a bad situation.

*4. Do all of the above, and more, if you're applying to a prestigious private school*

All the stuff above will get you into a great school. Get good grades, do well on your tests, and apply to a school you're sure you'll get into. If you want to go to an impacted school with tons of applicants, like Pomona College in California, or any of the Ivy League schools on the East Coast, or other similarly hard-to-get-into schools, you need to do more than just excel. These schools probably have 2-3x the number of fully qualified applicants they need. They will look at other things.

A friend of mine got into Pomona just based on his grades and SAT scores, but he had perfect grades in all honor roll classes, was fluent in three languages and didn't miss a single point in all of AP Physics. Most people trying to get in, though, are just very smart, not prodigies in every subject *shakes fist at Julien* so they'll need something else to distinguish themselves. Take part in extracurricular activities that push your boundaries. Sports are good--- the people I keep in touch with today from high school aren't the people I met through class, but the ones I met through athletics. You make new friends and have new experiences. But generally, just find something fun that lets you do something cool. It'll give you something to write an essay about, I guess.

I got into a few prestigious private schools, but nothing like Yale or Harvard. My clients typically weren't the sort who were aiming for this kind of thing, so I can just tell you what I saw success with. Ultimately, with this kind of thing, something that makes you stand out is good. They MUST throw away qualified applicants, so you're trying to beat people who are just as smart, or smarter than you. You gotta play the game; you gotta sell it.

*The Interviews and Essays*

I am good at interviews so I can't offer much knowledge. Whereas my companions trained themselves to talk to adults in positions of power, interviewing came naturally to me. I don't know what holes you'll have in this. “Be yourself” is shit advice unless “yourself” is someone who is comfortable with these things. In any case, these interviews, when conducted by alumni, are pretty low key and not about weeding people out. It's a conversation about the school and about yourself. Bring some stories or some anecdotes. Think about the stories your parents tell when they have new friends over for dinner, the kind of stories they tell to create closeness and companionship. Fashion your own versions of these stories, drawn from your own life experiences. If you can make it so your interviewer had fun and likes you as a person at the end, it doesn't matter.

Essays: You can go anywhere with this. I wrote an essay that was a poem, I wrote an essay that was a short science fiction piece about a city dying (trains would come empty, and leave with people--- the air is red in the sunset, beautiful and cancerous. The protagonist smokes, and why not? It's not like the air is clean anyways). I wrote an essay about how I fixed a DDR stomp pad when applying to an engineering school. I wrote an essay about how I always wanted to attend Brown University and accidentally sent it to University of Maryland. They let me in anyways, and into the honor school at that. Hah. I wrote an essay about love lost, even though I hadn't had my first breakup. I wrote an essay about a friend who died in a car accident, though he was more an acquaintance than a friend.

The essay should itself be beautiful, should be interesting to read. It should be anecdotal, and broad in scope only in what is revealed. Start as close to the end as possible, as my boy Kurt V would say. Want to talk about your obsession with viola? Don't write about your freshman year, then your sophomore year, etc. No, write about your Junior year, when you audition for your state band--- the previous years will be implied. Don't talk about how you got the scars, just talk about pouring isopropyl alcohol over your calloused hands after a long practice in preparation for the audition. Don't say you are afraid, say your heart is hammering in your chest. And don't tell this is a culmination of your ideals and work, proof you can succeed: show it. Don't tell them you bleed, bleed. Don't tell them you suffer: suffer. And at the end, they will understand.

The essay should be, on the surface, about a singular event. Anyone reading it should get the understanding of who you have been for the past years, and who you will be.
