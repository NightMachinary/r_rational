Maybe you could make an effort to separate people into minds and bodies when you think about them? Obviously, if you're looking only for intercourse, then you're currently thinking of them only as bodies--but it isn't as if you're totally forgetting that they're still humans with worthwhile minds. Even if you're seeking only to exploit their bodies in this /particular/ endeavor, you can still switch gears to appreciate their minds, if you decide to get back into the romance-seeking business.

(I speak from an utter lack of experience, though, in both romance and intercourse.)
