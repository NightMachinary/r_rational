Objectifying Tinder acquaintances is a risk of the process of having successive casual encounters.

If you find yourself stepping out of the "hook-up" role with someone, PAY ATTENTION. Consider bringing up your thoughts with your partner if you think they may be receptive to it. Who knows, maybe you'll find yourself being more satisfied in disclosing genuine feelings even if you're not ready for a longer-term relationship.
