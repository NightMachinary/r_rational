  A good device for large-scale first person narratives, is to give the character herself a reason to tell the story to somebody (ideally somebody as ignorant about the world as we readers are) well after the story itself has happened.

Yeah that's the idea I was originally going with, but I'm finding its taking a lot more time and plot then I wanted getting her out of her hometown. What I wrote as the entire first book takes place in and around her hometown, and covers the events that lead her to actually set out.

Maybe though, I could compress those parts down significantly and also add in 'current' events, IE, what's happening to her while she's writing the journal. So the journal starts in her present, and each chapter talks about the present, backtracks a certain distance to cover past events, then comes back forward to return to the present?

  Plus you can play blatant foreshadowing games and take non-chronological detours... which first person narrators are normally hesitant to do.

That's true, if I write it in present tense with her talking about her current situation, then I can backtrack to describe all the incidents that make up her past as they apply to the present?

That's an interesting idea. I would essentially be taking the plot of the second book, and adding the plot of the first book into it as narrated backstory, skipping ahead in time to when things are actually interesting.
