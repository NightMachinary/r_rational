I'd take note that the ending of the MC's story is already "known" in that he Kills a King, causes a Civil War, loses his hypercompetence, and becomes a broken old innkeeper at the start of the novel (no spoilers required.) So, some would argue that the genius of the story stems from the fact that you know his comeuppance will arrive... and most likely at the time that's worst, so he completely breaks... but hopefully the retelling of his narrative is what gives him the strength to recover and repair what he broke in the world and ultimately, himself.
