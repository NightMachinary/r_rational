PS: I do recommend checking out Kingkiller Chronicles. They're a very easy read (+the prose is really, really good+), and while the MC is the usual fantasy hypercompetent red head, the supporting cast is great.

ETA: I rethought the prose comment. I think it's very YMMV, but works well for me. If you need every sentence to be meaningful and precise, Rothfuss is not for you. If you want the prose to evoke feelings, scan well, maintain the right cadence, and generally read easily - Kingkiller's Chronicles is just the thing.
