Adding to alexanderwales' idea of using a framing device, I'd also recommend interludes where we jump to the viewpoint of another character to give an alternate perspective on a situation or to show something else that happened at the same time in the background.

To combine this with the framing idea, you could have the interlude be something what the main character found out from a friend at some point in the vague future or have the person that the main character is telling the story to, say that they heard from a friend of a friend this scene also occurred.
