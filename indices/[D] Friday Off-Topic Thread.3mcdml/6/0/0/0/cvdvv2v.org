You can mix first and third, though I generally think that it works better if one is a framing device for the other (for example, /The Kingkiller Chronicles/ is third person in the framing story and first person in the bulk of the text as the main character relates his story).

Generally speaking, I stick to third person, because you can get close enough to someone's head that it's basically the same as first, but then you can also back way out if you need to describe something.

(Charles Stross wrote a pair of novels in second person with switching protagonists. So anything is possible if you want to put in the effort.)
