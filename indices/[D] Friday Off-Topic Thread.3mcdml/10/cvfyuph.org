I'm looking for some physics babble that passes the [[/r/rational]] crowd's smell test. More specifically, I'm looking for numerology that's related to the number 10^{120.}

I'm positing that the Vacuum Catastrophe is because there are roughly 10^{120} parallel universes. There have been around 8e60 Planck times since the Big Bang, which is half of the exponent I'm looking for. There don't seem to be too many other relevant sources for another 10^{60} exponent, and I can't think of a reason to square the number I've got... Any suggestions?
