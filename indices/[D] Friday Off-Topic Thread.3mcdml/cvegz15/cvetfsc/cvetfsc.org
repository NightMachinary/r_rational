I dislike Mercator just for the baggage it now carries and the inaccuracy of geographic intuition it promotes - the projection itself is actually very useful for some purposes. For most of the maps I'm making it's not an issue, or I use equal-area cylindrical over the Australasian region.

My favourite map projection is a digitally-displayed perspective of the geoid, with interactive data layers. If I could just work out how to embed a pointcloud in Google Earth, I would be /so happy/.
