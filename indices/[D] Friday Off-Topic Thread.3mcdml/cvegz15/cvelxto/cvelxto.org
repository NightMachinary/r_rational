For some reason, I was instantly reminded of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/8chan/comments/3fajrv/a_sociopath_visits_r9k/][this incident,]] and I went to your post history to check if you were the one who was doing that. I remain entertained.

The only projection I have an opinion on is the plate carr√©e, or the lat/long equirectangular projection, because that's the projection NASA provides for [[http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_cat.php?categoryID=1484][Earth]] and the [[https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=3895][Deep Star Map]], for simple uv-projection and rendering.

I think I may like the near-side perspective view too, because space.
