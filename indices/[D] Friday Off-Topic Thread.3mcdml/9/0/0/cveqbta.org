If you're implying that I was trolling, I wasn't. (Also, you're supposed to use =http://np.reddit.com= links when linking between parts of this site. Tut, tut!)

On-topic: (makes moue of disappointment) But [[http://www.progonos.com/furuti/MapProj/Normal/ProjCyl/projCyl.html#Rectangular][the equirectangular projection]] is so /boring!/ I mean, really, what could be more plain than a simple faux-compromise projection that uses literally /no/ equations at all and has zero special properties to boot? :-(
