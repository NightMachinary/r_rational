Mysteries aren't so different from other fiction. As Aristotle puts it:

#+begin_quote
  "Of 'simple' plots and actions the worst are those which are 'episodic.' By this I mean a plot in which the episodes do not follow each other /probably/ or /inevitably/. [...] But this is bad work, since tragedy represents not only a complete action but also incidents that cause fear and pity, and this happens most of all when the incidents are /unexpected/ and yet one is a consequence of the other. For in that way the incidents will cause more amazement than if they happened mechanically and accidentally, since the most amazing accidental occurrences are those which seem to have been providential, for instance when the statue of Mitys at Argos killed the man who caused Mitys's death by falling on him at a festival. Such events do not seem to be mere accidents. So such plots as these must necessarily be the best."
#+end_quote

The mystery is just one amidst a whole class of stories with twist endings. If the twist is good - completely obvious and /necessary/ in retrospect - then it won't matter whether the reader figures it out before the reveal. If they do, they'll congratulate themselves on being clever, but either way they'll congratulate /you/. If the ending is arbitrary, insufficiently foreshadowed, overly coincident, or inappropriate to established character traits, readers will be disappointed whether they guess how things are going to go or not.

The bit you mention about nesting small mysteries in large ones is similarly general: Each twist and turn of a great story is, itself, frequently a smaller great story.

I like to keep a miniature [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapWheel][Soap Wheel (warning: TVtropes)]] going, introducing a few of the puzzle pieces of upcoming twists before the old ones unravels. Momentum!
