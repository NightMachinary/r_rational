Police Procedurals on TV are massively hampered (IMO) by the fact that you can only have so many characters. I just started Longmire (which I like) but I can often call the murderer (etc).

In the real world, it's often the obvious person, or when you find out who did it there's no real reason. (Some drunk jerk). Neither of those make for a compelling story.

Typically for TV shows, it's everything else that makes it enjoyable. Columbo's hook (show the murder, see how the Peter Falk figures it out) was a good twist. Other shows (Sherlock) throw twist after twist after twist.
