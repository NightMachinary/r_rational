  (IMDB allows you to sort episodes by user rating ; I agree that variance between episodes is not that high, but it does exist.)

Ok, just did some statistics, the variance is 0.2677 of a point.

If you remove the top 10 and bottom 10 data points, variance falls to a measly 0.0082 of a point.

Even if statistically relevant, (and the non-independent nature of voting makes that unlikely) I doubt that anyone would be able to do pattern matching to determine what makes an episode more highly rated.
