I mean both, to some extent.

Within a single show you're /mostly/ removing the variables of characters and setting, along with other more amorphous things like lighting, setting, direction, etc., so that you're just down to looking at the actual mystery cases themselves. With all other variables remaining constant, you can just look at what's working on the level of the mystery itself. If the variance from episode to episode is small, then close examination should be able to find the source of that variance and hopefully increase overall quality. (IMDB allows you to [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0203259/eprate][sort episodes by user rating]]; I agree that variance between episodes is not that high, but it does exist.)

In other words, I know the basic structure used to make the plot work but haven't figured out all the variables that make it work /well/. And obviously when I'm writing, I'm doing prose instead of television scripts, usually longform instead of short episodes that maintain the status quo.
