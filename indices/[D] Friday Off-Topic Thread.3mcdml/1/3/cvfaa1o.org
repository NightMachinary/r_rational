For me, standard (police) procedurals are boring. Others, like /Veronica Mars/ or /House/ are riveting. I think it has to do with watching experts at work. Veronica is excellent at finding clues, knows whom to ask for observations, and how to extract from them observations useful to her case. House and his team practice lateral thinking, and House is Holmes - you know he'll wow you in the end.

The other factor is believability. Veronica gets so much screen time that the audience can come to see her as a real person, dealing with real issues, fairly quickly. In /House/, the teams are small, but much of the episode's time is devoted to fleshing out the people suffering from the mystery malady. The show did well in including the audience as another member of the team: at first, doctors on the team are colleagues, but still strangers; focus is on the case. As we spend more time on more cases, working with our colleagues, we learn a bit more about who they are. Eventually they become our friends. And we learn our god of a boss is an incredibly flawed human being.

Standard procedurals lack the above in subtle ways I can't describe in detail without watching a few, but as one example, take /Person of Interest/. The first season, the bespectacled guy is the expert. He somehow knows whom to help, and provides magic Batman technology as assistance. However, we come to learn he's actually not the expert, but the expert's creator. He's created his masterpiece, so he's not interesting any more. And this new expert is unknowable; we can't learn how they do what they do, and they aren't personable, so they're not a Holmes, either.

At this point the show should have switched its focus to exploring the new expert, but it stayed a procedural. I lost interest, since the show lost its expert, and the replacement had no storyline or personality driving each episode.
