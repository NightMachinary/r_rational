Brian S. Pratt wrote a novel by first deciding to write all of the interesting parts first, and then he would go back and add the boring parts afterwards. When he finished writing the "fun" parts, he realized that it made up a full novel all by itself. That novel was the first book in the ten story best-selling [Morcyth Saga]([[http://www.amazon.com/The-Unsuspecting-Mage-Book-Morcyth/dp/0984312722]]

Skip the boring parts for now (just leave a few notes to yourself for what you're skipping exactly) and then go back later and check to see if it's actually important.
