A good device for large-scale first person narratives, is to give the character herself a reason to tell the story to somebody (ideally somebody as ignorant about the world as we readers are) well after the story itself has happened.

That way she has reason to have researched other perspectives, and can insert other peoples' stories and opinions in addition to her own, providing backstory, world-building, character development /at the same time/.

Plus you can play blatant foreshadowing games and take non-chronological detours... which first person narrators are normally hesitant to do.
