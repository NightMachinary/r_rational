I thought about that, but I'm worried it will come off as a bit jarring. Maybe it's just me but I've never gotten much enjoyment out of stories with first person perspective that jumps around like that.

One thing I was thinking was, the way I've written the story so far, its set as if its the main character's journal and she's writing about everything that's happened to her. I could break that up, add journal entries and news articles and letters between characters and do the whole thing like its a collection of in-universe source material, but I'm not sure how well received that will actually be, or how much of the larger story I'd be able to cram into such a format. The advantage with 3rd person is it lets you pull back and look at things from an objective outside perspective, describing things in details the characters might not know or understand.

Just as a rough example, say I want to describe a nuclear explosion.

In a first person perspective, I can describe what they see and experience. The blinding flash, the overpressure blast, the fires and dust and wind that's kicked up.

But if want to describe the explosion from a bird's eye view, I can get into much more detail, the aircraft that drops the bomb, how it detonates and such. Things the character doesn't know.

Is it possible to mix first and third and not have it come off as awkward? I'm not sure how I'd manage the transition if so. This would be so much easier in a lot of ways with a visual medium then a written one.
