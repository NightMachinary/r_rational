  (Charles Stross wrote a pair of novels in second person with switching protagonists. So anything is possible if you want to put in the effort.)

And as a result I had to grit my teeth through those whole books, and came away with a rather confused understanding of the plots as a result. Second person is interesting, but frankly, fuck second person.

  You can mix first and third, though I generally think that it works better if one is a framing device for the other (for example, The Kingkiller Chronicles is third person in the framing story and first person in the bulk of the text as the main character relates his story).

This actually seems interesting but I've not read that series, and I'm not sure how what you mean by framing device. It sounds like what I'm going for, with most of the story in first person, just backing out into third enough to get a view of the wider world, but I'm not sure how that would exactly translate into text? Is it broken up by chapter, with some chapters as 1st and some as 3rd? Does it switch within the body of the text somehow?
