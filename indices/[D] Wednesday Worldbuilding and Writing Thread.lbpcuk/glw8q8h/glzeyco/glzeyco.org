I would argue that anyone who is purely rational is throughly insane. For example a complete sociopath who cannot feel empathy yet is very smart, could probably emulate empathy convincingly or perform socially manipulative tactics to execute rational plans, yet they'd still be classified as "insane" if they took an honest psych eval. Also, severe mental illness comes in many flavors and "insanity" is generally regarded as an antiquated/outdated medical diagnosis.
