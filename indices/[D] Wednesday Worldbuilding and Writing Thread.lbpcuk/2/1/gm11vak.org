Most mental illnesses make you irrational, but someone who is entirely sane also cannot be rational; rationality requires you to be insane in just the right direction. Psychopathy helps, very /mild/ depression helps but even slightly more intensity than optimal pluge you right back into irrationality, and there are several kinds of things that aren't recognized mental illnesses but anyone on the street would recognize as utter insanity and be correct that are very much true and a rational person must believe. There are also a number of things that any rational person will realize are true and will /cause/ mental illness in any sane OR rational human, requiring you to be insane in the opposite direction to cancel those ones out in order to remain rational.

Well, more or less, I am kinda simplifying things and being dramatic because I don't feel like spending hours on this random reddit post.
