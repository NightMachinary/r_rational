I've mentioned a thing I'm working on where a guy who goes serial-isekai'ing gets minor boons. He's got fifteen boons. Here's what I've decided on:

Out of the five Primes (Soul, Society, Body, Mind, Works) the MC has Soul (Mana-Sight, which leads to further options for magic and divinity) and Society (Comprehend Languages, leads to further social options).

There's a sort of Path of Exile thing going on with Constellations of boons, but they form between them Skies. Bardic Sky, which the MC has, is composed of...

- The Constellation of Language; four boons plus the Social Prime (hands, eyes, voice, mind as capstone). Write/sign, read/interpret signed language, speak, and finally think natively in all languages.
- The Constellation of the Traveler; five boons. Poison resistance (including food poisoning and ingested toxins), disease resistance (including things like the water borne fecal stuff), seasoning food you're cooking by singing at it with an audience (approximately), weather sense, wayfinding as a capstone.
- The Constellation of the Sojourner; four boons. Appraisal (both knowing how much something you want to buy is worth in the context of the sale, and how much something you want to sell is worth), intuiting social dynamics when you arrive somewhere new, one more non-capstone boon, and one capstone boon.

Finally, the MC has the Capstone of the Bardic Sky, which gives him the soundtrack of his own story playing in his head. He can't use this to guide future decisions - no playing twenty questions using the music as an oracle - but it's still super useful both to understand the context of the scene he's in and because it makes him immune to mind-reading and mind-altering effects. (If someone tries to read his mind, all they get is TMBG songs.)

I ask your help because I am terrible at naming things. Along with the two boons I haven't decided on, what are the dang /names/ for these things? I don't even know what style to go for. Obviously for the Bardic Sky capstone it'll be something flowery like "And Ever Was A Song Upon His Lips", a-la Chanter song names from Pillars of Eternity, but should I do that for the others as well?

Also, I need some help coming up with things he /could/ have gone for that linked out of the Soul Prime, which he didn't. Doesn't have to be super detailed, but hit me with your coolest equivalent ideas!
