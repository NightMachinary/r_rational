I were assuming no FTL, but at the relevant timescales transporting resources all over the place is still easy and a few millennia of travel time unproblematic.

Actually, I'd expect far more rocky planets, since those CAN be made of iron, and there's much less of the mass tied up in hydrogen stars and gas giants.
