Hmmm. Difficult.

The first man may be entirely rational; he may, in fact, have an entirely sane worldview (albeit with some psychopathy). He /proposes/ the Flashlight Plan, but that doesn't mean he thinks it will /work/ - he might be deliberately suggesting something that he knows will fool the second man.

The second man, again, may be entirely rational. He hears the proposal of the first man, hears and recognises the unstated assumption in that proposal that a flashlight beam can be walked on. Perhaps he knows that he is insane; that his assumptions of how the world works are occasionally suspect; and therefore, perhaps he accepts the unstated assumption in the question as true without comment. And then he finds a different flaw in the plan (that he cannot trust the other man to keep the flashlight on), realises that that flaw on its own is sufficient to reject the plan as proposed, and then rejects the plan - based on the flaw he has recognised.
