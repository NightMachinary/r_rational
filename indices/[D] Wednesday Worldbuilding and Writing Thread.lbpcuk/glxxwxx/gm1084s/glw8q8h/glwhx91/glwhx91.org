No, neither men are rational in that story. Both men have a distorted and untruthful conception of how reality works and reason on that basis, which is irrationality. Rationality on the other hand is developing good, accurate reasoning that is widely applicable, and that will lead to being correct more often than not.

To answer your first question(at length), I think yes, it's possible to be mentally ill and make rational decisions, but it gets increasingly difficult the more serious the disease gets. At a certain point mental illness isn't something you can work around with good thinking patterns, you will have big blindspots and vulnerabilities in your worldview and decision-making. One might think I'm referring to schizophrenia or something equally serious, but even boring old depression or ptsd can make it impossible to make rational decisions or have rational thoughts about certain topics.

To use a personal anecdote, I suffer from severe depression and I regularly(every few months) self-medicate with LSD or psilocybin mushrooms. The sheer difference in my thinking patterns before and after I dose is so stark sometimes... It's hard to describe it. It's almost like I get the ability to look at myself from a third person point of view and make truthful evaluations of myself, as myself. Or perhaps I lose that ability when I'm severely depressed. Put it another way, it's like a recalibration of the relationship between my id and my ego, allowing me to ignore certain physical imperatives and focus on mental ones(or vice versa) or to better prioritize one mental imperative over another one. If you feel that doesn't make much sense, welcome to the club. Thankfully it mostly works without my having to understand it.

Anyway, I know for a fact that my ability to make rational decisions at my lowest points are dubious at best, even(sometimes especially) straightforward decisions with no downsides that are completely for my own good. It's aggravating, but a part of life at this point.
