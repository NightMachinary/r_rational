Oh, hey, I remember this guy! Mostly because he managed to hit my comfort power fantasy of gradually acquiring subtle but useful boons, especially mental ones. That aside, I also like naming things, so I'll try my best to help you with this task!

So, it might be nice to have a naming scheme that has capstones /feel/ like a pinnacle, something that was worked towards, while maintaining a coherency between them. Given the bardic theming you're going for, perhaps have them form the lines of a poem-esque thing.. For example, with the Constellation of Language, you might have "With Open Hands", "And Open Eyes", "Let Open Mouth", "Bring Open Minds". Alternatively, for each to sound a little better individually rather than as a group, you might just have open hands, open eyes, open mouth, open mind. Want to remove the repetition of open? I would help but I accidentally got it stuck in my head.

For Traveller, you could have "Stomach of Charcoal", "Blood of Silver", "Voice of Cinnamon", "Skies of Glass", "Feet of Mercury". The last two lose a little of the obvious connections that the first three had, but there's still an obvious theming. Less poetry like, though. If you want something more mundane sounding or game sounding, something like "Strong Stomach", "Pure Blooded", "Song of Spice", "Internal Barometer", and "Guidance" might work.

For the Sojourner I'll just give some mundane sounding ones to peruse. Appraisal is already pretty game-sounding, and then you could have "Social Cartography" for the second.

As for Soul Prime stuff, the mana sight thing made me think that a Constellation of the Farseer might be cool. Five perks just off the top of my head... Vision extended into UV/IR a bit would be a nice opener, mostly makes things look more interesting but also works as heat vision a little? Vision of how 'open' something is (easier to wound, enter, insert into, etc) sort of as an constant overlay/additional pair of eyes inside your own that feels natural. No trying to open locked doors, identifying weak points in objects and creatures, and so on are all consequences. Then vision of metaphorical 'impact'. Another overlay/sense, but this time gives a subjective assessment of how important things in the environment will be. More important things, and those more important in the near future look 'brighter' to this sight. Looking at a screen with an image would only show how important the screen and the image in particular are. They 'dim' if they have finished being important. For a fourth boon, momentum sight. Seeing the future physical paths of objects for a short while in the future, becoming more accurate the faster they move. Then for a capstone... Connections sight, to mesh with his Society Prime? Seeing the connections between people as another overlay, different 'colours' meaning different sorts of relations, and 'brightness' being the intensity of that connection. Of course, in all these cases the colours would be indescribable to someone who hasn't seen them, for fun :D

Hope this all helped, or at least gave you some ideas!
