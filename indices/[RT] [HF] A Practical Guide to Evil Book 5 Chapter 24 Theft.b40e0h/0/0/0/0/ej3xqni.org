That's certainly an interesting way to think about it. I was thinking that Cat would finish what Black started and wipe the high lords and maybe install some non-named but above-average mage, because normal people wouldn't last a day in Praesi courts.

Or, well after abdication of the throne of Callow, she could become the last dread empress, rule for a decade or two (which is around how long black took to change Callow's culture into what it is now) and then either pull a traitorous or die by the hands of a hero, hopefully after changing the face of the entire continent.
