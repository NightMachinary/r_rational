So the Liesse Accords forbids Named as rulers, which is interesting but I don't see how that could work. Unless Cat pulls the biggest miracle of them all, I doubt the Accords with solve war. If that's the case, rulers that are not Named will have a lot of trouble staying alive against Names like Assassin and fighting usurpation from Named like Empress or Tyrant. Imagine a kingdom with Viv at the head and then say the Hierarch decides to go against her. It would be over in minutes.

Also, I hope the Accords are more encompassing than just barring Names. Cat lost her quite a long time ago and yet could go toe to toe against most heroes.
