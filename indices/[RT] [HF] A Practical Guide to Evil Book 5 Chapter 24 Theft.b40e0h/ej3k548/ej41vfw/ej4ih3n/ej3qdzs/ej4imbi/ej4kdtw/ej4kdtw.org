  Vivienne is such *a wet paper towel* of a character.
#+end_quote

Kind of off-topic, but is this actually an idiom? I've heard people use the phrase "wet blanket" for someone who dampens the fun of those around them, but I couldn't find anything to explain the phrase "wet paper towel." In context it seems you're using it to mean she's boring, though if it was an idiom I'd imagine it means something more like "a tool that's already served its purpose and should be thrown away."

... I think I'm really overthinking this.

Incidentally, I think Vivienne is my least favorite of the Woe but I think she is still an important part of it. She served the role of Cat's moral compass while she was Wintery; she served important functions in running the kingdom both before Cat was away and during; and she provides us another avenue of insight to Callowan culture, Name lore, and politics. I do think that you nailed one thing though:

  With very few ripples in the plot.

Viv doesn't affect the plot much - and I think that's been by design. The entire conversation in this chapter was basically talking about why that was; she had a Name that wasn't equipped to make lasting changes to her country, and even though Names have narrative weight, a Thief's role is much more about not being noticed or center stage. Now that she's no longer bound to that role I expect she will become more instrumental in the plot; though if she doesn't get another Name, she'll likely still be less important overall than the rest of the Woe.
