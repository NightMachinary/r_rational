Sure, but I'm not voting for a head of state, I'm reading a web serial. And boring makes for a bad fantasy character.

There are plenty of other characters in the story without Names that bring much more to the story. And have much more presence when given screen time. Like Robber or even Hune. Abigail now, too, is much more interesting to read.

Reading about Vivienne, I can't even remember why she's part the team or why she's still here or what her character arc is.

I felt that way about Abigail at first, because she kept bizarrely getting screen time, but she developed into an interested character to read about. Vivienne has developed into a LESS interesting character. Less than even killian, who had at least some depth but was still written out of the story completely.

I trust the author, and I'm I'm no danger of dropping the story, because he's more than proven he's capable of weaving compelling stories and characters. But every time Vivienne is on screen I'm just confused about why. She had no depth of character even when she had cool powers. Now she doesn't even have cool powers. Slogging through Vivienne centered story parts seems like a chore when everything else is an absolute delight.
