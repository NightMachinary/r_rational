The real question is whether Praes can exist at all under this system. Dread Emperor is a Name you get by becoming the Emperor of Praes, and nothing more seems to be needed. The story of the villain overlord is so strong in the Wasteland that their overlord will always be Named. Chancellor is also a Name, so that eliminates both of the traditional positions of supreme power in the Empire.

Not only will Cat have to kill or cow Malicia to get these Accords, she will also have to so thouroughly destroy the culture of the Wasteland that it's possible for its leader to not immediately become Named.
