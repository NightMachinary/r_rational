Hrrrm. There's room for growth in the character, but I just don't quite buy Vivienne as a ruler. She's more the Relena Peacecraft/Euphemia Li Brittania figurehead who represents the ideals that all the power players around her center on. Maybe I'm just getting that impression because that's roughly the role she's been playing for the last year in-story, but even in this last speech at the end, she's just glomming on to Catherine's vision for the future rather than asserting her own desires, and even before she took up the regency, she mostly just served to remind Catherine of her own moral center.

She could flex out more, e.g. start pushing for either more diplomatic resolutions to their conflicts rather than Catherine's "beat everyone into not-submission-just-unable-to-refuse-to-listen" approach, or to divert more resources to the non-military institutions in Callow, but we'll see.
