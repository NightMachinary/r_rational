Like a wet blanket, but with much less utility.

Anyway, about the ripples in the plot thing. I didn't mean Vivienne made no ripples in the plot. I meant that everything Vivienne is doing for the story could be entirely replaced by Abigail and that would make no very few ripples. Vivienne is a boring character to read about, and what's much worse, she isn't UNIQUE in any way. She brings nothing to the story that someone else, or multiple people, are not already bringing, while all being more interesting to read about.
