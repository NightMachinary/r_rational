Vivienne is such a wet paper towel of a character. Even when she had a name she was forgettable and now she is barely a tertiary character despite being in the Woe. Her entire character arc could be replaced with Abigail's at this point. With very few ripples in the plot.

She's been boring to read about since she was in William's gang.
