I don't know about applying a dichotomy to individuals; I can enjoy different things for different reasons and I'm not a freaky mutant. I don't particularly expect to see all the things I enjoy in the same story, though that's cool when it happens. Some of the big ones:

- Characters with internality - people act like there are people inside of them. They have reasons for being the way they are, they have an internal inertia to how they think and feel about things, the writer could write a monologue of their thoughts whenever they're on screen (even if they never do). I kind of think anything that doesn't have this is sort of... literary junk food? It can still be good, but there's a limit. Wildbow's works are all great at internality.

- Characters with epistemology - people have a specific way of integrating new information, which is different from character to character. Harry Potter And The Natural 20 does the best job of this, as a joke. I'd really like to see more of it.

- Self-consistent world - sort of table stakes for any sort of munchkinry, it can also undermine plot and character development if the world is too unstable. But you can be like PGTE and never give a hard number to anything while still being pretty self-consistent. Part of self-consistency is that the components interact correctly with each other, which means that munchkinry to me is just a way of revealing a form of consistency.

- Constant drip of new ideas - not really high art but it can make for compelling light reading. If all the new stuff interact correctly with the self-consistent world so far then that's really quite nice. Revealing a new interaction is as good as revealing an entirely new element, which again lets munchkin stories do some cool things.

- Believable stakes - the stakes are the bad things that might happen to your characters that I actually believe the author is willing to do to them. Life and death situations are rarely stakes, because I can see how much more book there is. Risk of long-term injuries and mental trauma (hi Wildbow) or failure to achieve personal goals (P:TOS) are much better stakes.

It occurs to me that Pokemon: The Origin Of Species is really doing a great job of all of these.
