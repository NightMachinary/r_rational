Thanks. Huh, wonder why the 4th hasn't been more discounted then.

I don't think we'll choose this one anyhow (it wasn't me that put it on the list). Opinions is that it's /scarily/ high-investment. I've had it on my wishlist for a while as a curiosity for solo play, but price never went down enough to justify it.
