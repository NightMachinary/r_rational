I started writing this as a response to [[/u/alexanderwales]], but I've decided to just post it as its own comment because... well, just because. It's a nice spring day, I may have taken a little bit of some something something to help welcome the sun back into our lives, and instead of going out into nature like I had planned I accidentally started typing. C'est la vie, y'know?

For context, his comment mentioned taking his D&D group online due to social distancing, a term I'm sorry to not feel like I need to define due to it having gone from obscurity to relative ubiquity for unfortunate reasons.

There's VR options that allow you to play D&D (and lots of other social multiplayer experiences where you can trick your brain into feeling like you're interacting socially with the other humans in the same physical space), things like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj6nLdbbRE][AltspaceVR]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eddmp3JybCM][VRChat]] and [[https://www.pcgamer.com/we-played-dd-in-tabletop-simulator-and-it-worked-surprisingly-well/][Tabletop Simulator]].

There's also a dedicated app called [[https://taverntalesgame.com/?i=1][Tavern Tales]] that looks like it's probably finished development and just waiting on approval from Oculus to get into the app store. Tavern Tales looks to be by far the most polished.

I have absolutely zero confidence in predicting what sort of timeframe the social distancing stuff will be going on (probably negative confidence, actually, like I'm confident that if I made any prediction one way or the other it'd be as wrong as physically possible) but maybe now's as good a time as any to start looking into VR.

The Oculus Quest is probably the best headset to buy in the immediate future because within 36 months (I would've said 18 months before the coronavirus but a lot of the manufacturing pipeline for bigger things like Apple products and the PS5 and the Xbox 7 (that's a joke because their namiNg schema since the Xbox 360 has revolved around not looking like they're one generation behind PlayStation) is being affected so the next generation of VR hardware is probably going to be postponed as well)... anyways, [[https://youtu.be/7YIGT13bdXw?t=559][unimaginably more impressive headsets will be released]] probably within the next 36 to 48 months, and marginally more impressive headsets will probably still be released within 18 months.

That's too soon to bother investing in a PC headset when there's better stuff in the relatively nearish future, especially if you don't already have a gaming PC.

However (and this is the main reason why I turned this reply into its own comment), you can actually finance a really good PC for a really low monthly payment, especially if your credit's decent, like [[https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/desktops-and-all-in-ones/legion-desktops/legion-c-series-cubes/Lenovo-Legion-C730-Cube/p/99LE9700309][this Lenovo PC can be had right now for only like thirty bucks a month]] and it's already better than (or at the very least just as good as) the next gen PlayStation and Xbox that are still more than a year away from being released (though the payment is only that low if you're making the minimum payment - if you want to pay it off within a year and not pay any interest you've gotta pay like $130 per month, and your personal credit score might mean your personal minimum payment is higher than thirty bucks a month).

The Quest is $400 and self-contained, and if you /do/ have access to a gaming PC (or plan to get one in the future) you can plug the Quest in via USB-C (so it's basically like buying a standalone mobile headset and getting a second PC headset for free (or for the cost of a USB-C cable)). The "Oculus Link" experience is said to be comparable to or slightly better than the first gen Rift and Vive. The new headsets like the Rift S and Valve Index and Vive Cosmos, they all use LCD displays with an RGB stripe arrangement with 3 subpixels per pixel as opposed to an OLED display with a pentile arrangement and only 2 subpixels per pixel. Basically, using LCD reduces the "screen door effect" because there's technically more subpixels /and/ less space between them which both add up to noticeable reduction of the SDE, but the colors on LCD panels are more washed out and the blacks all look grey, where the OLED displays have crisp/sharp blacks and brighter more vibrant color. There's tradeoffs either way, but the Quest uses two 1600x1440 OLED displays, so it's not going to be noticeably inferior to the Rift S which is the same price but can't be used wirelessly.

So that was my little rant evangelizing on behalf of VR. "Blah blah blah, VR, whatever, call me when the headsets get smaller than a one-pound brick strapped to the front of your face." That's fine, fair enough, but what /you/ can get out of this comment if you're not interested in VR is that you can get yourself a very capable PC that can handle Triple-A games for less money per month than I used to spend on cigarettes biweekly, and which I'm sure at least some of you spend on your morning coffee per week.

If you're quarantined or just taking the "social distancing" thing extra seriously as a precaution, or maybe you anticipate that the worst is yet to come and think we all might be a little more isolated than we'd like for longer than might be comfortable, you have the option of getting a PC for a relatively low monthly price, and might be able to convince your peergroup to do the same and just set up a Minecraft server so instead of hanging out IRL you could all hang out together in Minecraft all working together to perform simple tasks like building a house or farming potatoes while you talk about stuff since you can't get together to talk about stuff IRL.

Hell, I've never thought about it before but there's really no reason that [[/r/rational][r/rational]] couldn't have a Minecraft server where people log-on on Fridays and just hang out as a way to have more organic conversations than you can have through text.

Anyways, I'm sure that at least some people here are already subscribed to Kurzgesagt on YouTube, and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtN-goy9VOY][their very recent coronavirus video]] was / still is on Trending, but instead of just generically telling you to wash your hands, they had a great - thing, no do words good, it's not an analogy or a metaphor - what they said is "wash your hands as if you've literally just now finished cutting some jalapenos and now you need to put in your contact lenses."

Like, don't just "wash" your hands, /wash/ your hands.

Maybe instead of a top level comment I'll post this as a reply to [[/u/somerando11]] since that seems to be where the discussion of things to do in isolation is... isolated.

I'm going for a walk :)
