I'm working from home, so a lot of my off time has been spent rehabilitating my place into a state where it's not a horrible idea to be spending 24 hours a day here.

To be honest, it was never really /that/ bad, but there's a bunch of cleaning that I no longer have a plausible excuse to be putting off.
