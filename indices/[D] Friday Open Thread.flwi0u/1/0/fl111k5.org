I've got a four-year-old, so:

- Writing six page books with him
- Putting together all our Lego sets
- Reading to him
- Making up stories with him
- Playing cars
- Trying to educate him

I was a stay-at-home dad anyway, so not much has changed except that we can't go to all the fun places that we used to go to, and preschool is cancelled for what I assume is going to be the rest of the school year.

I've been cooking and cleaning, both things that I normally do.

Our D&D group is going to (try to) go digital, so we'll see how that works. IME it's not as fun and there are always technical issues, but I'm dusting off an old campaign and giving it a shot, which will be my first time DMing in about two years.
