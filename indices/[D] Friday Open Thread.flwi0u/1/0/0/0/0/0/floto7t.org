Scheduling is definitely easier. I think for the most part it's fine, though the rules assume more people, which means some on-the-fly adjustments, and to get all the expected roles covered means either using a DMPC, running multiple characters, or having a powerful +entad+ magic item that can cover some functionality. It's mostly been good, it keeps time between turns down in combat (which can be rough with a larger group) and helps to focus the campaign a bit more.

I think my ideal size is three players, but I don't want to bring someone in just for the sake of having a third.
