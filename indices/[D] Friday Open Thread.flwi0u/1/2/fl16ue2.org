I'd love to go on a hike or nature walk, but our local park is very explicitly Closed (prompting my 10 year old to complain in a most stereotypical manner than the civilization-threatening global pandemic was "/ruining/ my /life/").

Aside from that we've been doing schoolwork, which takes about an hour a day. Some puzzles, some legos, "gym class" in the back yard, reading and playing video games. One of my stockpile items was microwave popcorn, so nights have frequently been a movie and popcorn.
