I've been spending some time recently thinking about the different sub-groups in our little rational community, and I think there are at least two distinct groups with similar, but tangibly different preferences. I think of them as the MinMaxers and the Story Purists.

MinMaxers are the people for whom the point of the story is all about the world-building and system of the work of fiction. These are the people who enjoy, say, quests or LitRPGs because all the abilities are very well quantified, and the judge a work of fiction by the coherence of it's systems and the munchkinery of the characters living in that system. They also are the ones who most appreciate Fair-play whodunnit, or other stories in which it is possible to reason your way into figuring out a character's actions before they occur.

Story Purists are the people for whom the story is the point, and the rational trappings are just means to a better story. They focus on rational aspects like the examination of goals and motives and intellectual pay-off, because they are inherently more narratively satisfying than a deus ex machina ending. They don't necessarily want stories that are categorically different from works outside the rational community (the way MinMaxers might), they just want fewer characters holding the idiot ball.

I would place myself firmly in the Story Purist camp. I've long since given up keeping track of things like Juniper's ability interactions (or even his base ability categories) in Worth the Candle, but I keep reading it because the characters interact intelligently and the story is engaging. By the same token, I really enjoy the abilities in Practical Guide to Evil, because they are well defined enough that I feel like i have a sense of what can and can't happen, but I don't have to worry about little details like how much mass Cat can lift with her shadow powers or small details things like that.

Where do you feel like you fall? Or would you say you're somewhere in the middle? Or does the dichotomy not ring true at all?
