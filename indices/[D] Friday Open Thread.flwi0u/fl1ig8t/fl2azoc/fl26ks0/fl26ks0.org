This reminds me of an exchange I had with someone here a while back. They said they preferred the protagonists in stories they read to have as few morals as possible, simply because it let them do more "cool things" with the magic/sci-fi of the setting.

As a Story Purist myself, it felt like I was talking to an alien. I found this eye opening, and it's my go-to reference for just how subjective art can be.
