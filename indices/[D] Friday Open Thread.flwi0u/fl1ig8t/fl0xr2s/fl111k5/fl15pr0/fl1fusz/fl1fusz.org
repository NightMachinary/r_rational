Current group is just two guys, but they're both up-to-date on it, so far as I know. We're actually doing the Critter Islands campaign briefly mentioned in ch 105 ("Notes"), since that's a familiar setting for me ([[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZEEMqsW05SEGhp42JLmHOTVy_elHOXIXGJfpKbvqH-U/edit?usp=sharing][worldbuilding doc here, if you're into that kind of thing]]). I think my biggest challenge will be not unintentionally cannibalizing stuff from WtC, which has a bunch of ideas splattered across its many pages. (I have some good stuff planned though.)
