  Our D&D group is going to (try to) go digital, so we'll see how that works. IME it's not as fun and there are always technical issues, but I'm dusting off an old campaign and giving it a shot, which will be my first time DMing in about two years.

Our group had our first online session this afternoon, using roll20. It was a pretty smooth experience, no technical issues at all. In fact, having tools like a ruler and color coded drawings was a great help.

People zoning out during other's turns was never a problem, though it is indeed much easier to have that happen when you're effectively sitting there on your own.
