  Our D&D group is going to (try to) go digital, so we'll see how that works. IME it's not as fun and there are always technical issues, but I'm dusting off an old campaign and giving it a shot, which will be my first time DMing in about two years.

Even when we didn't have technical issues, we had issues with people zoning out during other players' turns.
