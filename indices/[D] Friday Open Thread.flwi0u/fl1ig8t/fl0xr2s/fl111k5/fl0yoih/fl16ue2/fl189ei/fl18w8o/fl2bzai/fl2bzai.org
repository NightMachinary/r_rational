I already work from home so it's less of an adjustment for me. The two biggest things for me are maintaining a consistent work/exercise/sleep schedule, and making an effort to stay in touch with people on a regular basis.

For exercise I converted notes I got from the gym coach at my old job into an app. [[http://noisyowl.com/robologan/][I've uploaded that]] for general use due to the quarantine, if you need it. I'm pretty strict about my schedule, especially sleep schedule. I use melatonin during the winter to manage that, but that might last later in the year if I spend so much time inside.

I also made myself an app for keeping track of how long it's been since I've seen everyone, but it'll take longer to convert that from what's usable by me personally to something that I can share with the world^{*}. It grew out of a spreadsheet of names, how often you want to talk to them (days between), and last time contacted, which you can make for yourself quickly enough if you want one.

^{*} Turns out that manually adding JSON to the source code is easier than writing and using a form UI. That doesn't work for other people.
