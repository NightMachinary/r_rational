Because I'm a stereotypical aspie, I made a [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OgyskrfPLl0_c8eNuHbiczNPCFo0EpVn3Q_Gw_5_BDk/edit?usp=sharing][detailed list]]. But so far we haven't managed to get more than two people together at the same time, which cuts down on options.

+We have a Blood Bowl 2 league. It's a decent (if a bit dated, in how punishing the RNG can be) 2 player tactics game, each match takes ~45 min and your team's scores and progress is tracked within the league.+ You know, I've played it again tonight and decided I don't like it after all. 45min is an optimistic length, it can easily go twice that, so what fun it has to offer is stretched too thin.

There's been a couple of Tabletop Simulator games organised (War of Whispers). I'm not a huge fan of boardgaming on PC, especially on games without automatic rules enforcement it's the worst of both worlds, but obviously coming from a boardgame group it's an easier sell.

I've played Overcooked yesterday with Steam's Remote Play Together (sharing my keyboard). It's an excellent co-op party game. I'm looking forward to the absolute chaos that 4-player should be, though we may have to use Overcooked 2 instead as Remote Play with four requires at least two people to use controllers.
