Does the sword-art-online setting count as Isekai? It's another world of a sort, but I suppose the entire population is made up of transported humans.

I'd recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8679666/1/Fairy-Dance-of-Death][Fairy Dance of Death]]. It sets the death game of Sword art online in the more pvp centric world of Alfheim Online, where players are less incentivized to work together, and adds a layer of politics.
