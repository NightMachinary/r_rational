... one idea free for stealing. Modern person gets ported into a medieval world, and after about a week, redlines completely with rage at the infinite injustices, and starts working to fix things like an obsessive demon on a cocktail of adderal and modafinil. This person is /not/ our protag.

That person may, or may not be dead.

Certainly "their" capture, trial and gruesome execution has happened no less than 9 separate times. Getting the right person being somewhat of a challenge since they do their work under pseudonym, and via very creative cutouts.

Our protag is a teenage native who has picked up the insanely illegal habit of collecting all the pamphlets published by Hiero Protagonia. Because there is so much useful stuff in them. Also terrifyingly persuasive arguments why you should burn down all the castles, and shoot priests on sight, but eh, best manuals in all of existence for practical chemistry!
