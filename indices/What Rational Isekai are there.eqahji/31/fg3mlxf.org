I know the webcomic title is so ch webnovel-ish, I was going into it like that the first 10 chapter even doesn't rly changed my mind, oh my but plot.

Plot just straight up being shown in your face, and I was like "ah shit, I see wut u doin here"

the webcomic, have inspiration from onepunch opness with darker rational, what happen if bunch of otherworldy ppl got thrown into a fantasy world, I recomend reading till the latest chapter before u judged if its rational for u or not.

it got slow start but when that plot hit u, oh my delicious darker rational!

If u read it tell me! and honestly I rly like these part of the story:\\
I though it was just gonna be another shitty isekai opness, but no2.

the tales of that adventure that saves his party and then got backstabbed by his leader, and the insquitor warning to protag, the dragon trying to be better person man it feels like witcher plot point but with different story too.
