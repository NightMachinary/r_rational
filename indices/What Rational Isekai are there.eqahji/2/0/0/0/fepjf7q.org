I think it's just spot on. They're both more painful versions. Arc 17 of Worm is like an isekai but without the wish fulfillment. You get the powers in another world and you fight over the girl, but the girl is dying, you're pursued by people who outclass and outnumber you, and you're losing your mind.

Same thing with the teen romances in Worm and Ward. Take Krouse and Noelle from Arc 17 alone. You've got a cute story about a girl gamer and the boy she wants to join her MOBA team, but before they can become competitive, they get teleported to another planet, she gets impaled, and she gets turned into a monster. Oh, and she's got an eating disorder, and as much as Krouse dedicates the rest of his sentient life to protecting and trying to fix her, I'm pretty sure they never even shared a kiss. Sure, he's as dedicated to her as any teenage boy would ever be to his girlfriend - to the point that he's willing to toss away the lives of the other members of their MOBA team for her well being, even after she's become a killer.

Don't even get me started on how Krouse and Noelle are a microcosmic reflection of the male and female lead of Worm, either.
