Yes, I know that. The sentence I'm referring to is "...Krouse and Noelle are a microcosmic reflection of the male and female lead of Worm..." I'm going to assume that in order for them to be a /microcosmic reflection/ of the male and female lead of Worm, he was talking about two people /other/ than Krouse and Noelle.
