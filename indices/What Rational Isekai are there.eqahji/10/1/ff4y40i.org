  Simply having advanced knowledge (even comprehensive knowledge, like being a super-engineer in a medieval world) isn't necessarily going to get you anywhere in one lifetime.

Medical knowledge could do the trick.

It's easy to put to immediate valuable use (once you've solved the initial language etc. issues). In any random village there's going to be ailments that the local herb-person doesn't know how to cure, whose victims might be desperate enough to accept a stranger's advice.

Advice works and you graduate to actual help. Your lack of modern antibiotics and surgical equipment (plus ignorance of local herbs) is crippling but plausibility not /as/ crippling as the average steam-engine nerd. Do a few more successful cures and you acquire a reputation and some wealth. Work at it long enough, and desperate nobles might give you a chance.

From then you can propose simple, cheap hygiene reforms that will massively decrease the amount of deadly diseases in large cities and army camps. The later is a Big Deal in the middle ages, when so so much of warfare is about besieging impregnable fortifications and waiting for one side or the other to be too disease-ridden to hold. With a rich patron, the right nerdy knowledge, and years of hard work, it's also just barely possible to reinvent penicillin or some vaccines.

I have seen this done once with the Naruto fanfic [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12431866/1/Sanitize][Sanitize]], which I guess I've now spoiled for you but it's still a pretty good read. The protagonist isn't granted any superpowers (in a setting where those exist, even!) or contrived coincidences, and in fact labours under the serious handicap of being female in a sexist society, so it's a lifetime of work for fairly modest achievements.
