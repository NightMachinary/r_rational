There is Release that Witch, fan translation from Chinese with the accompanied problems; I find it meh (as I do with most stories with chinese tropes) but somewhat readable.\\
I love the take A Hero's War from jseah takes, although objectively it has problems (too fast progression of changes he triggers) and writing is far from perfect. And lately releases are very slow.\\
For both of these to enjoy, I guess you need to be a person who enjoys somewhat slice of lify stories with minimal romantic subplots.
