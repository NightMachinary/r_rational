I did like the book, and its TV adaptation too, but it was not very insightful overall. I was thinking more along the lines of openly subverting how most Isekais have the Self-Insert or Wish-Fulfillment protagonist basically invent feminism (and recruit a harem as well, because /reasons/), develop democracy (or conquer power if the author's into fascism) and single-handedly launch an industrial+informational revolution.

e.g. what if the protagonist is from an alternate mankind timeline where the development stage they reached resembles nothing like what we think of as existing (as loosely tribal, tool-centric politically-inclined individual beings each with our separate agency, values and preferences in a world of scarcity) ? what if they're man-ascended-as-Cthuluh ? Or they're from a distant anarchist or post-metaphysics or transhumanist pan-galactic future and the very concept of "nation-state" (or "individuality", or existing materially, etc.) is highly abhorrent to them ?
