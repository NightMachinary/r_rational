Misgendering people is a lot worse than some bad terminology, and is absolutely equivalent to using the N-word. This is not petty semantics, it is a core thing. It's a Big Fucking Deal. I agree with you to some extent that we sometimes get too restrictive with terminology in cases when it's a simple mistake, but this? This ain't that.
