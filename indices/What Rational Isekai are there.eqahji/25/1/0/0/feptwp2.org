It is definitely transphobic, but personally I'm a bit uncomfortable with how easy it is to be labeled "transphobic garbage" based on it. If you support trans rights and see nothing wrong with being trans, being called a transphobe because you have some really stupid views on semantics seems...wrong. Labelling is such an important part of the trans movement that it bothers me how cavalier some people are to throw around labels when discussing it.

This is really hard to put into words so I apologise if I word something poorly. While my personal views are very progressive I spend quite a bit of time on the internet and I feel like it's important to self-reflect on different viewpoints and labels to avoid becoming part of the "twitter rabble" that isn't very well connected to the real world. People have very different views, deciding that someone is a transphobe because their views and vocabulary doesn't line up completely with the woke crowd online just serves to make the club feel more exclusive rather than help anyone or change any minds. This isn't like someone saying the N-word or saying that trans people are mostly perverts trying to get into bathrooms, this is someone arguing over semantics over something that hasn't been in the public consciousness for very long. Arguing over that while not denying the feelings or reality of trans people is, in my opinion, problematic without actually being intolerant.

I do remember that he made an apology over sharing helicopter memes. It's been a while but as I remember it he said he was pissed about people suspending him and calling him a transphobe over this and it was only later that he found out how awful those are. Again though, the absolute majority of people who don't spend time in very progressive forums/circles probably don't consider helicopter memes as being particularly bad either.
