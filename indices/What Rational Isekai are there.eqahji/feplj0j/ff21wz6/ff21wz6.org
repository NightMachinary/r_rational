For a translated from Chinese work the translation is okay. For people used to native English works they may find the word choice a bit weird. For example, "lampoon" has become somewhat of a silly meme amongst fans.

Even still it's worth reading simply for Klein (the MC)'s step-by-step logical inferences/deduction, his moral character, and his desperate struggles to find his way out of one huge evil cult conspiracy only to stumble right into the next one while pretending it was his intent all along.
