The anime / Light novel Log Horizon is not really rational, per se. But a lot of people are isekaid, and first is about learing how to exist individually in a world very different from them and at its core trying to build a functional society and understand the intricacies of the world and how it is slowly changing since the isekai day. Caveat emptor, its still an anime and has things people could consider annoying, and the three first episodes are quite boring but a necessary explanation of the game's rules; but when its focus is on the world its a blast. Lots of cool ideas well executed. Havent read the LN but im sure the good things are still there.
