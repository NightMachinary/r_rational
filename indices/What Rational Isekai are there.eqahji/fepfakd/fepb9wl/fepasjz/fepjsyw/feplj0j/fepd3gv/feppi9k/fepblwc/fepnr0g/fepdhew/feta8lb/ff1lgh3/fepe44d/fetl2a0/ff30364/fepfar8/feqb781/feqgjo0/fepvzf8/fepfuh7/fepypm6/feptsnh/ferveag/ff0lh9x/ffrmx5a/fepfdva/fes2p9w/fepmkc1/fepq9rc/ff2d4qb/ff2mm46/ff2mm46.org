Well that discussion seems to have happened and finished already. With that said, it's the comment I responded to that shouldn't have brought it up in that case. If someone says that a (semi) rational fix is worth discounting due to the authors political views, a response should not be withheld just to avoid a political discussion, especially when it's highly debatable if the author even holds those views.

The rules cannot be that anyone can claim that any author brought up in this sub is “garbage” and then forbid anyone from disputing that claim out of fear that the conversation will turn political, nor can the rules state that discussing authorial intent isn't relevant to the work itself. If this results in the occasional debate then so be it. I doubt that it will become common enough to be a problem.
