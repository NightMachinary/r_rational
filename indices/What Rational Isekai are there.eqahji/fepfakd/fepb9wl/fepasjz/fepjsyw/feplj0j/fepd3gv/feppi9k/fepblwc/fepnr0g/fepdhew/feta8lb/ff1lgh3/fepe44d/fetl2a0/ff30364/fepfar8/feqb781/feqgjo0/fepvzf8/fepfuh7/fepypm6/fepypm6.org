Would Dungeon Defense be rational? Every character is very smart and thorough with their plans, even the more boneheaded of them like Barbatos. There's some pretty clever ideas like undermining humanity's union through their class disparities, but perhaps the fact that every character is also pretty much insane would disqualify the series. At least, it's a lot more rational than a lot of other isekai out there, for what that's worth.
