I guess one of the problems is that even with ratfic isekai you tend to need the protagonist to be given some enormous advantage in the new world for them to be effective - give me but a lever long enough and a place to stand, kind of thing. Simply having advanced knowledge (even comprehensive knowledge, like being a super-engineer in a medieval world) isn't necessarily going to get you anywhere in one lifetime.

It's possible to have a super-rationalist protagonist who latches onto some superpower or equivalent in the new world and makes it their bitch, but then there's the trap of falling into the fic merely being a rant about how all of the original superpower users (assuming it's a pre-existing fictional world with its own canon stories) were complete dumbasses who never once sat down and really /thought/ about how they could use their superpower to best effect. Which can come across as kind of missing the point about the original setting; mainly, that it was not about that kind of story.

And then, of course, there's /realistic/ isekai, which might not be rational but which has the problem that the protagonist gets dumped into a new world and rapidly plowed under by the setting, plot, weirdnesses, language barriers, and other things. It's difficult to write in an engaging manner (although I have seen it done), particularly in settings which aren't terribly kind to random foreigners with few applicable skills.
