A dissenting opinion:

The pace of the plot has gradually slowed down as the author devoted more screentime to worldbuilding and the inner-lives of characters, but to me that wasn't a negative. I've still found the story fascinating and engaging, full of suspense, intrigue and creative munchkinry all the way through book 4

Regarding art: The art style has gone through iterations as the comic switched penciler/inker/colorist, but it has never deviated far from the original, and the quality has always been consistently high compared to most amateur webcomics - or even professional published comics - that I've seen over the years. In my opinion the art never detracted from the story.

However, I would caution potential new readers that the words-to-pictures ratio eventually transitions from 'paneled comic with word-bubbles' into 'novel with illustrations' Ã  la Neil Gaiman's /Stardust/.
