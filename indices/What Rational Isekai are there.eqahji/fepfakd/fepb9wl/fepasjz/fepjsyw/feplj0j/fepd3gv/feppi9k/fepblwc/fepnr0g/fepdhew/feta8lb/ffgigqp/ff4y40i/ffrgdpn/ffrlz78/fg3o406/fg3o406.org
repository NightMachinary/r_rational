theres a drama for it too,

it's rly good.

or

Survival Story of a Sword King in a Fantasy World

yes it got all the checklist of thing u says u dont agree there but I feel like its on the middle sometimes it goes into onepunch opness but then it goes rational what if rly happen, it scratch my itch atleast.

but the how the author play the story, if this thing happen is rly good in rational way I guess?
