Hear the Silence by EmptySurface

It's a Naruto Isekai set before the events in the anime. It's not an uplift type story but instead addresses the emotional and social ramifications of child soldiers and constant warfare. I've enjoyed it very much so far, the writing is good; it does start somewhat slowly though, and there's lots of introspection and downtime between "action sequences."
