Oof. I was going to say "Erfworld," but when I went there to link to it I discovered that it was apparently taken down due to some major tragedy in that author's life. That sucks.

If you can find a backup somewhere, it's basically an online webcomic that's rationalish, high on munchkinery. I only read the first "season" but it was pretty good.
