Lord of the Mysteries (Boxnovel is a good place to read it) is one of my favorites stories. The characters all feel like they have their own interests, and they work towards them. The main character doesn't feel like the only motive force in the world, and he makes use of a lot of deduction to figure things out. It's set in a sort of not!London as the industrial era is going into swing, but there's also a magic system that takes inspiration from occult and hermetic ideas, with a good dash of Xianxia progression. The english translation is in the higher tier of translations of this kind, so it's not perfect, and there are a few idiosyncrasies that may be a little off putting until you get used to them.
