[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_(manga][Jin]]) (the manga) counts, I think. In it, a modern Japanese surgeon is transported back in time to the Meiji Restoration period. There is a lot of attention to detail, and he has to improvise and reconstruct his tools and drugs; and a lot of attention is paid to the economics and politics of healthcare, how to organise people to contain disease outbreaks, etc..
