If you found RTW unrealistic, Id recommend Destiny's Cruicible by Olan Thorensen. Both works run on the premise of a guy introducing massive technology uplift, with Destinys Crucible being the more realistic work, probably inherent since its native English and was published in a novel format.

Both works draw parallels in how they kept the readers engaged. RTW kept it interesting by keeping the modernization ball rolling using witches as its bottleneck breaker, while Destinys Crucible focuses on the social/political climate that changes due to advanced modernisation with a relevant setting eerily similar to ours a few hundreds of years ago.
