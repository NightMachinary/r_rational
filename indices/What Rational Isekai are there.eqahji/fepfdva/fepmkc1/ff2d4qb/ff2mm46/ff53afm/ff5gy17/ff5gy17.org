But the political discussion could actually be relevant to the work though. If this author actually was transphobic and inserted those views into the work, you should tell people about that when bringing up the work as a recommendation. If that's not the case, an entire work of fiction was just written off by a lot of people due to what's essentially libel and nobody is allowed to respond.
