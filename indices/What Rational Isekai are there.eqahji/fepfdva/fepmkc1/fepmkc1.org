For the record, the whole transphobic thing turned out to be way overblown. Basically he had very strong views on semantics and didn't understand that the helicopter joke was actually offensive.

There was definitively some wanton ignorance involved there and transphobic elements were definitely part of it, but then after he moved forums, and during the time he was still pissed at the whole situation, the arc continued and this was a subject throughout most of it and it was definitively not transphobic.
