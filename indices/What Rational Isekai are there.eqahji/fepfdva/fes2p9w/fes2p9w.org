Leaving aside the transphobia, I disrecommend WTR purely due to the writing. On the small scale, the author feels a need to use weird idiosyncratic rules like 'names of species are always capitalized' ("I walked past the Ivy-covered wall to where my pet Tiger waited"), randomly invents new punctuation, makes heavy use of colored text to show emotional content instead of just...you know, /showing/ the emotional content. Etc.

Still, those are relatively small issues. Beyond that is the standard problem of rational fixfic that gets our community slammed all the time: Only the protagonist is rational, ever. When he arrives, the rest of the setting is exactly as ridiculous as the comics are, but okay, that's the point. From then on, however, people remain their comic-book selves instead of becoming proactive and forethoughtful to match him.

Then there's the main character. It's labeled as an SI but I really hope that the author is taking the piss out of himself, because Paul (the protagonist) is so oblivious that it feels like a comedy. He literally walks into a room full of guys with guns and drugs and fails to realize that it's a drug deal. Half the female characters in the story practically throw themselves at him and he doesn't even notice. Likewise, he engages in activities that are consensual and not explicitly sexual, but still very uncomfortable to read when you consider that he's a mid-20s (30s?) man who de-aged himself enough that he's passing for 18 on a team with a bunch of younger-than-18 kids. (Although it depends on how you count in she cases.) Suggesting to a 16-year-old girl that she should take her top off in order to distract him into dropping his shield. Offering massages and hair-brushing to distraught young women who clearly find him attractive... None of it is over the line, but it's still cringy.

Not only is Paul oblivious and slightly squicky, his actions don't align well with his stated goals. He claims his goal is "make the world better in an effective way instead of just doing the same righteous face punching that the other heroes are doing." To help with that, he's got a power ring that can do almost literally anything as long as he wants it strongly enough. The ring has an AI in it to help him. It doesn't have a full database of galactic tech, but Paul doesn't even think to say "hey, go on arXiv and post a full dump of all the basic math you know" or "hey, without breaking any laws or doing anything that would compromise my other activities, find all the evidence you can against everyone in the FBI Most Wanted list and forward it to the relevant agents. Do that as a background task from now on. Oh, and do the same for Interpol and as many other criminals as you can, in priority order based on minimum sentence requirements."

Next, there's the Renegade storyline. Ugh. Paul is a nice guy, very prosocial, works within the system to cause change. Still, that's not as fun as straight power fantasy, so the author periodically steps away from the main storyline to write a little bit of AU "hey, what if I was a selfish jackass who cared only about maximizing his own power? And what if I always succeeded on the first try and there were never any consequences of any kind?" (The Renegade storyline does eventually improve somewhat, but it takes a loooong time.)

I could go on, but this is enough. The first N chapters of WTR are a lot of fun in a comedy/action/adventure-movie sort of way, but I find it sours after that. Different people will have different values for N, and some people may even have an N > max-chapter-number.
