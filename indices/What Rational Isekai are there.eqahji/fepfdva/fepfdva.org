It's not rational per-se, but I'd consider With This Ring to be rational-adjacent at times. It's a DC (Young Justice in particular, but he takes stuff from the DC setting as a whole along with interpreting a lot of stuff in his own way and making it better) self-insert story, and I guess I'd consider it an Isekai since he's transported to this world (and has fairly extensive knowledge of it). The author shares the rational community's distaste with stupidity in fiction, and writes accordingly, but I definitely wouldn't go so far as to call it rational. I haven't been reading it for a while though, since it turns out the author is transphobic garbage, so I can't comment on the newest stuff.

If you can seperate the art from the artist though, most of the story is decent and it has some cool plotlines that make it very good even if you know little to nothing about DC. It takes a little time to get going though, and it has some weird quirks that take getting used to (for example the parallel Paragon and Renegade timelines, which start out with only minor differences but eventually butterfly out into becoming completely different stories. The Renegade timeline starts out edgy and kinda bad, but his story gets really good after the stories diverge more).
