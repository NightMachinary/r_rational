The flashbacks seem to indicate that she had severe body-image issues and was recovering at the time when Kraus first asked her out. Also, somewhere in her POV sequence she had a train of thought regarding the cruel irony of the way her monstrous body works (intense hunger, eating, increasing in mass, then vomiting). Based on those clues I assume she had been recovering from bulimia before they were all pulled through the portal.
