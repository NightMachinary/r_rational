Wild speculation, starts off reasonable:

In the context of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6vy8h8/rt_worth_the_candle_chapter_2425/dm4cs5o/?context=3][my last speculative comment on the addictiveness of level ups]], Arthur's refusal of the call of the hero and eventual succumbing becomes much more sinister. Ultimately, I think he might have wireheaded himself in divinity like Unsong's Neil Armstrong, or reached a place of torment where he can't level anymore. Or he's hibernating somehow in response to the torment? Although if that were the case I would expect he might have tried to intentionally cultivate a higher population so he could harvest levels from people - though this strategy might not work if you become unable to gain XP off mobs a certain number of levels below you. Supposing that he did reach such a place of helplessness, a natural target would be other sufficiently powerful dreamskewered individuals. In other words, Arthur could be a potential Big Bad Evil Guy, if the main character becomes strong enough to tempt him.

This guess is mostly motivated by tropes and rule of cool, not in-story evidence.
