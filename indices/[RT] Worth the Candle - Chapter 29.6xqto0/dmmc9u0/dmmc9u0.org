(comment that I should have given a few chapters ago, but I just started reading Worth The Candle)

I really think that Juniper is making a bad decision with focusing on Blades. The big advantage he has over typical in-world characters is learning skills and spells quickly.

Mages have an extremely diverse set of spells available to them with world-breaking potential, but the average citizen lacks the time and ability to learn all of them in one lifetime -- Juniper might be able to learn everything in a /year/! Likewise, doing anything other than taking advantage of the 3-for-2 bonuses seems foolhardy.

Of course, it's not too late to save himself. Juniper would definitely want a bit of PHY anyways, so if he just changes his focus he can still take advantage of his unique traits...
