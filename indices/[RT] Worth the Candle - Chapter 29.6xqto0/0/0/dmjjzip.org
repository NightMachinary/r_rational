My guess is that, since the call of the gold never fades, homeostasis is impossible. Eventually, every gold mage has to either overreach in an attempt to satisfy the call, or deny it, losing their power. Even without new gold mages trying to rise up, every gold mage inevitably self-destructs once their hoard gets big enough.
