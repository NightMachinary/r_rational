If we read between the lines /and/ assume Arthur-as-Uther, it's likely that Arthur was dream-skewered into Aerb sometime during those 4 years. Poor Isiah in that case. Makes you think about what it's like to live a life just to be replaced by your doppelganger. Also it would be interesting if Joon's current body had a life prior to his "hijack" and somehow did something that got him on that plane. Then Joon meets someone who used to know his predecessor...

Did dwarves not feel the call of the gold? Is it a dwarven genotype thing or just dependent on your mentality towards gold (sacred vs means to an end)? Following that line of thought, can dwarves be gold mages? Or do they feel some inverse effect, like a purge of the gold?

I wonder how many gold mages there are. It seems likely to be a scarce vocation where there'd be a few Smaug-tier titans but no God of Gold. Per the Pareto distribution, most of the gold gets concentrated into a few mages who'd eventually reach an unsustainable rate of growth and suffer whatever degenerative symptoms occur due to the call of gold. How would homeostasis occur? It couldn't just be a bunch of upstarts usurping the tycoons, could it?
