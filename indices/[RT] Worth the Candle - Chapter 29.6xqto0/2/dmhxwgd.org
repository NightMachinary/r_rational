Juniper, genre-savvy you are not. That makes two times /The Prince and the Handmaid/ has been referenced by name in the story, and I imagine the third time will be Juniper realizing that he should have at least skimmed it. The fact that someone gave him something that doesn't /sound/ plot relevant should have been his first clue. Also, I'm not sure what he's hoping to get out of the biography of Uther Penndraig - if Uther /had/ mentioned his imaginary friend Juniper, I'd imagine that would be within the scope of the history Amaryllis has studied. (not that we can exactly rely on her for information at the moment)

From the last chapter:

  “Quite eclectic,” said Yasin. “No fiction in there, save for Penndraig's works?” He clucked his tongue. “I can understand the need to study, but surely some escape from the real world would be welcome, so long as you're in my shop?”

  I laughed at that. “I have to imagine that this is already a bigger sale than you normally get,” I said.

  “True, true,” smiled Yasin. “But it's not just about the sale, it's for your own fulfillment.” He reached over to his stool and picked the paperback up off it, adding it to my pile. “Free, for you.”

If that isn't mysterious foreshadowing, I'll eat my hat. To be fair, he doesn't get the fourth-wall introduction we get, where it's the only book not on his improvised book list. But when Fenn later brought it up specifically, out of all of the books he bought, that should have been another clue.

  Supposedly there was a time when dwarves carved their next of kin out of stone, but a grand racial curse was bestowed upon them that forced them to become a biologically reproducing race, which they could either do with each other, or by themselves.

No matter how flexible your sexuality, the picture of gay bearded dwarf reproduction is probably not your idea of attractive. Thanks for that, [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]].

  “The curve can't be that extreme,” I said. “Aumann has been a gold mage for twelve years now, if the requirements were doubling every month that would be ... um, more pounds of gold than there are grains of sand in Aerb. Which is probably not the case. The exponent has to be a little more gentle than that.”

I'm wondering if the name of the character Aumann is a coincidence with the name of the mathematician Aumann, or if it's coordinated on the part of the author. Can I hold out hope for a sudden and surprising diplomatic victory after a long thoughtful talk about personal motivations? Given that nobody's actually made a really solid plan for how to go in and retrieve Amaryllis, or a plan for how to fight a gold mage.
