Well it depends. There's a fetish for everything, but you're looking at the intersection between two small groups - people who like yaoi between two unambiguously masculine men, and people who like dwarves. A lot of yaoi suits a female audience because at least one of the characters adheres to feminine gender roles, and girls in general seem to be more attracted to effeminate men. (My sources may be out of date) It also depends on what type of dwarves we're talking about - Hobbit style mini people, or dwarves that are super compressed and stocky. I know some people personally who might enjoy it if it was done with well-established characters, but not anyone who would actively seek it out. I probably wouldn't be to averse to writing dwarf yaoi myself, but what comes out might not exactly resemble their Tolkien roots.

Then again, even with my refined explanation, the original comment is still hyperbole.
