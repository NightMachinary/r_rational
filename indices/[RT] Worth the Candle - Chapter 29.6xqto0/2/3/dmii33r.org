  Can I hold out hope for a sudden and surprising diplomatic victory after a long thoughtful talk about personal motivations? Given that nobody's actually made a really solid plan for how to go in and retrieve Amaryllis, or a plan for how to fight a gold mage.

Calling it now: Aumann getting [[https://mathnawiofrumi.wordpress.com/story-i-the-prince-and-the-handmaid/][poisoned]] by an apostle of the God of Romeo and Juliet.

Diplomacy was already tried, so that's out. But it probably will be a sudden and surprising victory (if at all) since I don't see it coming to a dogfight.
