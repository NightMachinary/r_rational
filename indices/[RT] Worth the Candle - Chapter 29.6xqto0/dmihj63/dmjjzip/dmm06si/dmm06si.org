If power scales subexponentially with amount of gold accrued to one individual, a rotating team of gold mages, summarily killed when their demands become too strong, would have the potential to be an excellent resource for powerful rulers. Just put a skin magic collar on each of them, and you've got the beginnings of a great setup.

They might even volunteer, if the Call is comparable to addiction. This would be an easy source of gold for them: for the short to medium term.
