I am getting to dislike how every time Rain opens his mouth we have the told how weird he is in the alt-POV. Its shows deep misunderstanding on how people react in society especially when entirely cut off from their own. Even a few months should be enough to cut SOME of it down. But I guess his mental stats are making him hold onto the memory of it more? Shouldn't that just have him remember the references more and his increased learning ability make him acclimate to the new social norms faster? He'll still laugh when they say something odd but be less likely to initiate with odd sayings unless its deliberate or in an aspect he hasn't come across. Like using "40 below" is unique but seeing, with his increased perception if nothing else, that no one understands him, he'd be less likely to do so in the future.
