The "burn" is over ~2 seconds so you can get up to ~500k total. It's going to go up too as you include the Malleable Ring stats, the max total equipment stats he can use should be 250 (10 X Level) so you put that all in Focus. (Focus increases damage and the mana pool....both increase the total damage burn) At Level 25, this is about 800k.

This is just the "burst" damage though over ~2 seconds. Rain's build strength is damage over time.
