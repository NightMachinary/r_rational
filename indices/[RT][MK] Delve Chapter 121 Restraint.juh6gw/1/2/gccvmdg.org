I guess half the time the other perspectives are kind of like the extra chapters in practical guide. Good for worldbuilding and characterisation, but doesn't push anything forward.

Though that is also the case with published fantasy novels, you get those perspectives in there. And yeah it's often a bit annoying to be interrupted with them in things like the Wheel of Time or...idk Discworld? But often in the long-run you'll look back and not be too bothered and realise hey I know that context better now.

Edit: that said, I expect this chapter is crucial in setting up Samson as a future lieutenant of Ascension.
