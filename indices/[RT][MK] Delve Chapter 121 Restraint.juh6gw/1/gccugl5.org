So I've thought about it for a while, and my conclusion is this:

I don't think Delve benefits much from writing from different viewpoints like other web serials do. I'm not sure why this is exactly. The writing from other perspectives isn't worse or even uninteresting, but for some reason, I don't feel like it adds much to the presentation of the story.

Anyone else have any thoughts on this?
