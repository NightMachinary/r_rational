I bet this has been mentioned before, but has anyone else realized just how ridiculously overpowered Velocity is for a support? It has so many implications.

Here it just completely neutered the hounds, it's like Rain applied Stun, Root, Flinch, completely immobilizing the hounds and making them unable to pose any serious threat.

And then it's also revealed that monsters are pretty stupid and follow set routines, and don't seem to learn from experiences. That means that monsters, regardless of if they're level 1 or 200, should supposedly be susceptible to Velocity completely gutting them. Even if they do acclimate, Rain can just tweak the modifiers and they're instantly vulnerable again, which makes it seem incredibly powerful.

We've seen just how hard it is to adapt to a specific and not significant speed boost for intelligent humans after a lot of attempts, with much higher numbers, sporadically changing them, and against stupid monsters, this seems game-changing.

Hell, even against intelligent Awakened, this is still super dangerous. In a lot of novels, you always see how even a fraction of a second of distraction, mistake, or vulnerability can spell doom, and messing up an opponents movement at a certain moment or even constantly and randomly changing their speed is huge.

And apart from pure combat, increasing mobility of allies is a big part of war. He could increase Velocity to the max and any army marching with him could march at least 3 times faster than the enemy, and implemented on a large scale like in the Empire(forgot the name), it'd be so game-changing. Enemies can't react or maneuver in time to match army movements, and there'd be huge changes in the effectiveness of retreats and hit-and-run ambushes.

That's just my ruminations on Velocity(albeit late) after seeing how effective it was on the Hounds, what do others think?

Anyways, can't wait to see how Rain's group handles the Blue, and what awaits at the end of the lair.
