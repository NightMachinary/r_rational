Yeah, have to remember this is level 18 AOE specialist Rain casting a CC on level 5 mobs. If he had an aura with no mageburn he could have just killed them all in seconds. Velocity is an awesome skill and Rain should probably use it offensively more often than he does (even against enemies who can mostly resist it, he can make a script that changes its output every second, so anyone not fully immune is gonna struggle), but its not super OP.
