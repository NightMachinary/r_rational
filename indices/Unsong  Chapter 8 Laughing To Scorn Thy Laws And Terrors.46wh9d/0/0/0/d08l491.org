Dylan isn't the BBEG, he's the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredecessorVillain][Predecessor Villain]]. Dylan has a whole team of people (a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits][Ragtag Bunch of Misfits]], no doubt) who are presumably ready to take up his mantle and become the BBEG.

Alternately, he's not the villain at all, just a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist][Well-Intentioned Extremist]], which would leave the American Board of Ritual Magic as the villains and set up Mark McCarthy as the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor][Evil Mentor]] with a betrayal at the end of either the first or second act.
