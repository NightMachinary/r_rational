It was my understanding that "ragtag" refers to the makeup of the group, not the characteristics of the individuals within the group. Almost all D&D parties consist of a ragtag bunch of misfits and most contain someone of lawful good alignment.

A billionaire inventor, a psychic gorilla, a street thug with a cold gun, and an alien artificial intelligence are ragtag because they're so lacking in uniformity. And the Legion of Doom has a lot more people in it that are even less similar to each other in terms of traits and personality (Bizarro, Solomon Grundy, Scarecrow, Toyman, etc.).
