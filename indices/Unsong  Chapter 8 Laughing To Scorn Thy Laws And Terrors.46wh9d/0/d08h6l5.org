  Can you imagine a story where a man lies in wait to assassinate the five masters of the American Board of Ritual Magic even as they are plotting to kill him, confounds their ritual, bursts out of the trap-door to their wine cellar at the most theatrical possible moment, raises his staff made of a rare and exotic wood that grows only his far-off homeland -- and then dies ignominiously, shot by a security guard before he even can even get a word in edgewise? No? You can't imagine the story ending that way? Neither can Reality. That was Dylan Alvarez's secret. He always tried to be the protagonist of whatever story he was in, and the protagonist never dies.

For the record, I can /absolutely/ imagine a story like that, because from the security guard's point of view it's an archetypal Call to Adventure where the Naive Newcomer is thrust into a World He Does Not Understand.

Can you imagine a story where a security guard is sitting around on a sleepy night with a vague sense of foreboding about the strange people in grey cloaks, then hears some shots fired and goes to investigate? Him shooting a man who leads a terrorist organization sounds exactly like it's the start of a traditional monomyth adventure (to me, anyway).
