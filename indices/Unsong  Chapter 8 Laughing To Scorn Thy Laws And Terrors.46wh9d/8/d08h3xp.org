I'm not sure if this is the intended reading, but it said: "one invoking the demon Amdusias, the other the demon Crhvano. Both produced the same couple centimeters of rainfall, even though Amdusias was a Great King of Hell who had been known to occultism for hundreds of years." Does this mean that they are right, or does it mean that there are so many demons in hell it doesn't matter what name you say? Because if its the second one, they really, really didn't check hard enough.
