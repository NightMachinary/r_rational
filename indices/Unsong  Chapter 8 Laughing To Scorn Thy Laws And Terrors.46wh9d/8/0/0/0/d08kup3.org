Did you just unironically use the phrase "through sheer coincidence" in reference to this story?

If we're positing alternative explanations as to why the two invocations produced the same effect, then --- given the Agloe anecdote with which the chapter began --- far more likely is that the invocation of 'Crhvano' in some sense caused the existence of a real demon Crhvano. Though now that I write it out, I'm not actually sure that qualifies as an /alternative/ explanation.
