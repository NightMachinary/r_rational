  Both produced the same couple centimeters of rainfall, even though Amdusias was a Great King of Hell who had been known to occultism for hundreds of years, */and Crhvano was a set of seven letters pulled out at random from a bag of Scrabble tiles./*

The point is that whether you say the name of a powerful demon or a totally made-up word, you get the same amount of rainfall.

Which makes it seem as though the theatricality of the invocation matters more than whether the name you invoke actually refers to anything.
