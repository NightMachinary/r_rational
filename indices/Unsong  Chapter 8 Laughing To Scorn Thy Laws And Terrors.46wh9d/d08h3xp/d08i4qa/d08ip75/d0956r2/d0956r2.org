Reminds me of Bell's Inequality Experiment.

(quote from the "Simplest proof of Bell's inequality" by Lorenzo Maccone)

#+begin_quote
  If we want to be extremely pedantic in enumerating the hypothesis at the basis of Bell's theorem, we must also request

  1. that our choice of which experiment to perform is independent of the properties of the object to be measured (technically, “freedom of choice” or “no super-determinism”): e.g., if we decided to measure the color of red objects only, we would falsely conclude that all objects are red;

  2. that future outcomes of the experiment do not influence which apparatus settings were previously chosen (whereas clearly the apparatus settings will influence the outcomes): a trivial causality requirement (technically, “measurement independence”).

  These two hypothesis are usually left implicit because science would be impossible without them.

This line of reasoning makes me doubt that the science is possible in the world of Unsong.
