A powerless man's idea of a powerful man. We're seeing this right now with Trump supporters. The best way to acquire the most power is to convince those who think they disagree with you that their interests are better served with you. Instead, Trump and his supporters insult the majority of Americans who disagree with them, rather than trying to bring in the moderates.
