Are you familiar with Rothfuss's /[[https://www.amazon.com/Kingkiller-Chronicle-Patrick-Rothfuss-2008-06-12/dp/B017PNSQS2/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1506386863&sr=8-4&keywords=name+of+the+wind][Kvothe]]/? Here we have an intelligent, clever, charismatic, and competent hero, with a very different set of character flaws. The plot is often driven by his many mistakes, which he makes not because he carried the idiot ball, but because of a very specific set of flaws.
