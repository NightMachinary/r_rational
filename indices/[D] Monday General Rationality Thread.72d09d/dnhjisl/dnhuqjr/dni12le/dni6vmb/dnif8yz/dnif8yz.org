I'm not a fan of the terms "flaw" and "weakness" when used to describe a character's personality. I prefer thinking of their traits in terms of their role in the narrative, like how TV Tropes [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SoYouWantTo/MakeInterestingCharacters][How to Make Interesting Characters]] refers to the dichotomy as "Admirable" and "Accessible". The former makes you wish you were like that character and the latter makes you feel like you are that character.

I think it's also important to think about characters in terms of their qualities that create conflicts vs the ones that resolve conflicts rather than call them strengths and weaknesses. Though I may be biased on this point because I fanatically believe that "realism", as an ideal to reach for in storytelling, is pointlessly restrictive when the rules of a narrative are always subjective to the artist's desires and worldview.
