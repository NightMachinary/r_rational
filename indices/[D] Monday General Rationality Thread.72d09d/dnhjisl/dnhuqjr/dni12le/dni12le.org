I agree, but I frame the situation differently. I personally don't find Rick or characters like him to be interesting, relatable, or "realistic" by any measure. So the explanation I have for why he's written that way is to generate additional conflict. Rick is so powerful that the narrative conforms to his whims, and a way to keep that narrative moving in interesting directions to to have him constantly be at odds with everyone around him.

Rick doesn't like people and they don't like him, even though the plot always forces them together, so it's interesting to see how they interact and react to the situations he gets them into. He's also callous for the sake of dark comedy and meta-commentary on the genres being parodied, but if I'm judging the show just as a soft sci-fi adventure then I think the writers made Rick an asshole so they had a way to keep the plot moving in unexpected directions.
