I didn't really want to rant about the show on the Monday thread, but I'll consider this an excuse >:P

I think the show is more or less self-aware about the "smart = asshole" thing, depending on the episode. The therapist episode addresses it head on, with the therapist telling Rick he's in denial, and doesn't want to admit he's in control of the harm he causes.

Then you have other episodes, and tendencies, which push in the other direction. Simple Rick (and Fake Flashback Rick) is a loving father, and he renounced Science. Dumdum Rick is kind and respectful of Jerry. Healthy Rick is kind of a dumbass. Morty becomes both smarter and more aggressive / manipulative as time goes on.

I do think the ultimate point of the show is as you say, but it's not completely consistent, so it's not just "people miss the real point".
