I have no knowledge of /Rick and Morty/---but, based on other fiction, in the eyes of a stereotypical smart person:\\
1. Stupid people inherently are worth less than smart people, and therefore deserve less consideration.\\
2. People who think at different paces naturally get annoyed at having to slow down or speed up to match each other.\\
3. The contrast is, not only =smart vs. stupid=, but also =knowledgeable vs. ignorant=. To a person who is both smart and knowledgeable, a person who is both stupid and ignorant seems to have wasted what little talent he had. While a lack of intelligence cannot be remedied and may deserve more pity than disdain, the latter person seems to have /willfully/ compounded his inborn disability by not even bothering to educate himself. (A smart and knowledgeable person may even like a stupid but knowledgeable person more than he likes a smart but ignorant person, depending on his personal preferences.)
