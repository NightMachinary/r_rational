What I found really interesting was:

- The "brain"-level disorder and the "body"-level disorders feed back on each-other, so even once you've "treated" the brain-level bipolarity, the autoimmune problems and hormone abnormalities don't necessarily stop aggravating the brain. You can't treat the brain alone, because the body will keep spurring it into episodes.

- On the other hand, you might be able to find a /very/ clear immune marker for the disorder, more accurate and precise than you'd get from an assessment of symptoms a la the DSM. This will help a /lot/, since there are /tons/ of ambiguous diagnoses of bipolar, since it has a long tail of atypical symptomatic profiles.
