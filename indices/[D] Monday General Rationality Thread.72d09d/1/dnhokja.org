  Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric condition associated with elevated frequency of clinical co-morbidities and cognitive impairment. The neurobiology of bipolar disorder is not completely understood. Recent evidence has implicated immune dysfunction in its physiopathology. Here, we review several data supporting the presence of immunological dysfunction in bipolar disorder: (i) increased frequency of autoimmune diseases; (ii) distinct immune cells profile; (iii) altered/ release of cytokines by stimulated mononuclear cells; (iv) elevated levels of circulating immune markers; and (vi) inflammatory changes in the central nervous system. We also discussed the interplay between immunological dysfunction and neuroprogression in bipolar disorder.
