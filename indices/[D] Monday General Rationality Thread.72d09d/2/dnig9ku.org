guys i have a huge problem

using my limitless power as the czar of the nascent book club i chose foucault's pendulum as the book club book for next month, so i downloaded the kindle sample and started trying to read it and i just don't.... get it so far. i've only been reading 5-10 minutes but my book attention span is pretty bad and i just am not into the writing style (it's very flowery?). can someone who has read it give me a kick up the pants? hopefully it'll be what i need to get it done in the next three weeks. or should i bite the bullet and just make a beeminder goal of it already like i did to force myself to read dune? (aka my husband's favourite book and if i didn't read it he'd divorce me)
