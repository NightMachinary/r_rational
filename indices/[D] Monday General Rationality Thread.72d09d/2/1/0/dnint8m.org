Yeah, I was trying to choose a diverse book out of the suggestions that were available - so instead of a short romp about transhumanist ponies, a longer story about conspiracy theories/occult seemed like a great candidate for diversity.

I'm not sure why I'd choose Discipline and Punish though - it looks like it's an actual philosophy book rather than fiction unless I'm missing something?

I think next month I'll definitely choose something lighter! I can't expect to like every book that gets picked but from the summary I thought I was going to like /that/ one! Oh well :)
