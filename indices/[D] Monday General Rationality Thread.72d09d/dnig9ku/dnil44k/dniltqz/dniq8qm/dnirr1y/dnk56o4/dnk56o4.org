  i have quite a large number of people who have at many times been referred to as shoulder angels/devils depending on the content of their advice so unfortunately you are not part of a terribly elite group
#+end_quote

Still a fun group, even if it isn't terribly elite.

  it sounds like the shoulder devil's dilemma is basically AI alignment but dressed up different?
#+end_quote

Yeah, basically. The only difference (and it probably isn't that interesting) is that you're also trying to outwit someone else, who starts out with the same information as you and is standing by while you get additional information (so it's a game of trying to make more and better inferences from the same information, I guess?).
