  (The shoulder devil's dilemma: letting out a certain kind of AI will cause mayhem and/or suffering, but go too far in one direction and you've let out a benevolent AI that effectively undoes all your work and more--a white swan, if you will--while if you go too far in the other direction everything becomes paperclips. How do you tempt someone (henceforth the "patient") in such a way that, peering over your patient's shoulder, you can determine the outcome of releasing the AI before the patient does, so that you can advise accordingly? Assume that, starting out, you know nothing more than the patient does, though you can make inferences and guesses that the patient does not have access to, and any inferences and guesses on the patient's part are known to you.)
