/tl;dr: disregard my previous comment/

Apologies, I misread your message and assumed you were interested in Michel Foucault's bibliography. For some reason I remembered the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclical_theory][Cyclical theory]] to be mentioned in [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/770902.The_Foucault_Reader][/The Foucault Reader/,]] which seems to not be the case.
