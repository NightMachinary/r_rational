Why did you choose that particular book as the entry point? Why not do some googling and go with something like [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80369.Discipline_and_Punish][/Discipline and Punish/]] instead (maybe also accompanied [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10777399-how-to-read-foucault-s-discipline-and-punish][with something like this]]), as an example?

Another possible avenue is looking up MOOCs that feature Foucault's writings in one way or another ([[http://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-300/lecture-23][possible example]]), and including them as well.

Also consider that if you're having problems with that book, other members of your club will likely face similar issues as well, so maybe discuss with them if they want that book even if you start getting a better grasp on it. Taking a slower path is much more preferable to receiving a burnout (which could also drive club members away).
