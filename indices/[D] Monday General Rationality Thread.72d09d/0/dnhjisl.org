Why do people always assume being a jerk is equivalent to be being smart?

I see this a lot when reading comments about Rick and Morty (and in the show itself), where people seem to buy pretty hard in the idea that Rick being selfish and arrogant is directly related to how smart he is.

I... don't get it? Maybe it's because I've been exposed to a lot of smart, charismatic kind people, so the idea of a smart charismatic asshole doesn't appeal to me, but... yeah, this bothers me.
