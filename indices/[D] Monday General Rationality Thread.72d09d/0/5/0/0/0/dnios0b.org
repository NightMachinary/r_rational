I like Jonathan, but we don't really /see/ much of the work he puts into maintaining his mind and body. The story focuses on what he uses his abilities for, and his mental prowess doesn't receive much emphasis compared to his physique and moral compass. I find him likable, but not very complicated or intelligent.

I enjoy watching Jonathan punch Dio and his zombies but compared to the more gonzo action and leaps of logic we see later, I can see why people just see it as a more colorful /Fist of the North Star/. Stardust Crusaders is the arc that brought in most fans and the manga version of Phantom Blood was a lot slower than the anime.
