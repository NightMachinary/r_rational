The show even calls Rick out on this and says that there's no causal link between his intelligence and his assholishness in the therapist episode with the "You use intelligence to justify sickness" speech.

Personally I think Rick's deal, as presented by the show, is that he's smart enough to get a proper look at the bigger picture - where there are infinite universes and we are just tiny insignificant specks that don't really matter in that bigger picture - but he hasn't taken the next step to reconcile that perspective with his humanity. He just kind of shrugs his shoulders and uses it to justify all of his terrible actions as inconsequenital in the grand scheme of things, even though it's clearly fucked up when you zoom in and look at all the individuals involved.
