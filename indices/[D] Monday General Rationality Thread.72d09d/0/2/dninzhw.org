"Rick is an asshole because he's smart" is, I think, the surface level reading that the show puts forward, and that's where most people stop. The deeper level of the character is "Rick justifies being an asshole as being because he's better than other people due to how smart he is", which is what I kind of think that the show is going for.

I /especially/ think that because Dan Harmon is both smart and a self-confessed asshole, and has said on numerous occasions that he uses his virtues as an excuse for his faults, like, "I'm an asshole, but it's only because I'm so talented and artistically pure, only because I actually care about the thing that I'm making". Which he then says he /knows/ is kind of just an excuse for being shitty.

And I know a fair number of smart people who are assholes, and this doesn't seem to be an isolated thing; if you're smart /and/ an asshole, then it's easy to say "well my faults are only because I'm so virtuous" as a way of not taking responsibility for (or making corrections for) those faults. Similarly you hear a fair amount of "being smart is a curse" from people who think that they're smart, for the same reasons. It's not that much different from someone saying, "All my problems are because I'm pretty!"
