Yeah, that works well for why antagonists or side characters are often written as smart and cruel. For protagonists, I also think seeing someone socially dominate others can be particularly cathartic if the "enemy" is considered deserving by the author/audience.

I don't know if Dan Harmon considers smarts an undeserved form of status, but being able to embody his more misanthropic characteristics and puppet Rick around [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOBoKxEcVAA][calling out the "idiocy" of the world around him]] is probably enjoyable to him as well as his audience, even if he does it with self-awareness.

We don't get that catharsis/enjoyment nearly as easily or as often if they're also nice.
