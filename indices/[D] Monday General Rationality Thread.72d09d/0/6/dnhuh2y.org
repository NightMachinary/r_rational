In truth, there probably is a correlation between being a jerk and being smart. After all, to be a jerk, you must believe yourself to be superior to whoever you are being a jerk to. Being smart is one way to be superior.

But the correlation really isn't that strong. Plenty of smart people aren't jerks, and I would say most jerks aren't smart at all.
