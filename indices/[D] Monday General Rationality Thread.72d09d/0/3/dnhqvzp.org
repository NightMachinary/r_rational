I think the cause of this is just plain narcissism. Some people simply believe they are better than others even though no one likes them and deserve power over others, so they idolize characters who are able to act on those same desires.

These people think they can back up that belief with their actual abilities the way characters like Rick and Dr. House do, but people can only get away with that level of abuse in reality when they have some kind of authority to protect them.
