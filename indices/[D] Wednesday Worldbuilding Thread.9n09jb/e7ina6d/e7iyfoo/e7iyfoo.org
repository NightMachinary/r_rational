How exactly do the mental attributes work here? Like drawing a distinction between charisma and intelligence is at least manageable because they are something you can clearly describe. However having Intelligence /and/ Cunning /and/ Wits seems excessive and like you would have a very hard time keeping track of how exactly they differ. Also what exactly does Composure do? Because it could plausibly be several different incompatible things.

Also on a more meta point does everyone start at 1 for every stat? If so then that means genetics has basically no impact on say intelligence (whereas in real life that's ~80% genetic) which will massively alter society. For instance paradoxically having innate differences not exist will almost certainly lead to a permanent aristocracy. As nobody without the resources to afford a great deal of essence can hope to be competent enough to make it in the ruling class even if it's ostensibly meritocratic. Similarly with such impressive mental attributes the aristocracy is likely to be profoundly more competent than ruling classes in the real world which makes it far more stable.

How exactly increasing mental attributes works also needs to be figured out if you want things to be coherent, since so many stories seem to ignore the effects of increasing stats corresponding to intelligence. For instance mental stats are going to need to be logarithmic in their effects (except charisma you could just let that turn into straight up mind control at high level which you can still write just fine) since having great deals of superintelligences running around will make your setting practically impossible to write.
