  Intelligence is memory storage and speed of access, Cunning is puzzle solving, and Wits is mental fortitude (ie: taking an extremely difficult test for several hours and not being exhausted at the end of it). Composure is social fortitude in a similar way.

Ok that works though having your willpower stat be called Wits is kind of confusing because people expect wits to be a type of intelligence (like it should probably just be called willpower). Composure seems a little confusing here though in that it's unclear what "social fortitude" even is.\\
I also just realized Manipulation is probably a social attribute not something related to spellcasting like I first though. So that raises the question of how exactly it's meaningfully distinct from Charisma. Because you definitely need to limit what falls under "Charisma" for it to be meaningfully distinct.

  There are other in setting limits that make it very difficult for large amounts of essence cores to be accumulated by individuals. There are mechanisms in place that make it so that essentially any state larger than a city-state will collapse. However, it might be that I need to make it so that essence cores deteriorate over time but I haven't given that quite enough thought yet.

The essence limits do seem like they might not limit things /that/ much. Since in a world like this the death penalty is probably going to be employed a /lot/ thus creating a large constant stream of essence. Similarly while there may be basically level caps on individuals since you don't have to pick pre-made classes the people with a lot of power are going to specialize in classes which minmax their intelligence or their charisma to the greatest possible degree. Now both ruling groups would of course max out every mental stat since things like HP or combat potential don't much matter to them so they can afford to spend 60% of their essence on stats. However they would probably be specialization based on how one's class affected these things.\\
That creates a whole other thing you need to deal with since these sorts of "NPC" classes which /purely/ impact one's mind need to be figured out since they will massively impact your setting.

Also you haven't mention traditional magic, but if spellcasting is a thing then how that works needs to be worked out.
