  How exactly do the mental attributes work here? Like drawing a distinction between charisma and intelligence is at least manageable because they are something you can clearly describe. However having Intelligence and Cunning and Wits seems excessive and like you would have a very hard time keeping track of how exactly they differ. Also what exactly does Composure do? Because it could plausibly be several different incompatible things.

Intelligence is memory storage and speed of access, Cunning is puzzle solving, and Wits is mental fortitude (ie: taking an extremely difficult test for several hours and not being exhausted at the end of it). Composure is social fortitude in a similar way.

  Also on a more meta point does everyone start at 1 for every stat? If so then that means genetics has basically no impact on say intelligence (whereas in real life that's ~80% genetic) which will massively alter society. For instance paradoxically having innate differences not exist will almost certainly lead to a permanent aristocracy. As nobody without the resources to afford a great deal of essence can hope to be competent enough to make it in the ruling class even if it's ostensibly meritocratic. Similarly with such impressive mental attributes the aristocracy is likely to be profoundly more competent than ruling classes in the real world which makes it far more stable.

Essence is logarithmic and multiplicative on top of whatever you already have. If you had Strength: 100 and let's say some base strength of c, then you would have let's say c*log(100). I think it will probably be the case that aspects under your purview use a different log base but idk for sure about that. States having aristocratic tendencies is working as designed (and isn't especially distinct from how real life works).

  How exactly increasing mental attributes works also needs to be figured out if you want things to be coherent, since so many stories seem to ignore the effects of increasing stats corresponding to intelligence. For instance mental stats are going to need to be logarithmic in their effects (except charisma you could just let that turn into straight up mind control at high level which you can still write just fine) since having great deals of superintelligences running around will make your setting practically impossible to write.

There are other in setting limits that make it very difficult for large amounts of essence cores to be accumulated by individuals. There are mechanisms in place that make it so that essentially any state larger than a city-state will collapse. However, it might be that I need to make it so that essence cores deteriorate over time but I haven't given that quite enough thought yet.
