Corsica in the 1700's was consumed by a patchwork of feuding clans, most of which hated Genoa and really wanted independence. In the wizarding world, where the resources of a state are less important in war, I would think they'd have it. Unless, possibly, the wizards don't feel loyalty to their largely-Muggle clans and are content to retreat to the middle of nowhere or be bought off by some foreign power?
