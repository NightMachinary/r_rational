Tiny nations logically shouldnt have a distinct wizarding culture - All the wizards of the UK amount to less than a large city, all the wizards of a small island are barely a village, and they all have immense capability for transport, so I would expect wizarding society to mostly be made up of entire languages. And possibly more unified than the muggles as far as that goes - One "Scandinavian" magic polity, speaking mostly a fairly distinct amalgation of the nordic languages.
