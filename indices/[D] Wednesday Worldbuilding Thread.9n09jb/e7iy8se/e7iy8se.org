Had a weird dream where a person showed up at my front door, screamed in pain, and had their arm pop off, and a torrent of luminescent water spewed forth from their arm socket.

Separately, I've been kinda working on a story that involves travel to multiple bizarre worlds, inspired by David Friedman's [[http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Course_Pages/legal_systems_very_different_12/LegalSystemsDraft.html][Legal Systems Very Different From Ours]].

So, this makes me want to posit a world where a dark, dry cave is populated with people who, when their limbs are forcibly removed, gush out a huge amount of luminescent water, sufficient for agriculture if taken advantage of properly. I'll have to figure out the specific math, but removing an entire arm should be enough to feed ~10 people for life if none is wasted. To match my dream, it should come out at about a rate of 1000 gallons per minute, and come out for at least ten minutes, but it never ends in the dream so it could be virtually for life.

What kind of culture might you expect to come out of this?
