One could also have it work in a manner /not/ in line with the witch hunters beliefs - just other deities, practices, etc. that aren't christian. I've seen claims that, historically, branding other religions, etc. not as wrong, but as worshipping Satan, was one of the things churches sometimes did, because 'non-christian spiritual practices can't be good'.

How to work this out in a fictional afterlife, I'm not clear on.

In Supernatural,someone sells their soul in exchange for one of their friends being brought back from the dead. You could also have someone sell their soul for some form of 'almost immortality' - they won't age, but they can still be killed by fire, or something.
