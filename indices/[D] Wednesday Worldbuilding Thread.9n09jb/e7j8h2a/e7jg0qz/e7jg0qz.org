For demons, satanic pacts are a form of force multiplication. They have /some/ power on Earth, but they have more power if they have a supplicant to channel that power through or do their workings, and even more than that if they have multiple supplicants working together in concert. Usually the demon is working with their supplicant(s) toward some kind of escalation; it /starts/ with cutting the head off a dead sparrow to bring humiliation onto a girl in class, but by a gradual process of desensitization, it ends with human sacrifice. Some of the things that the demon requests will be to increase its power on Earth, but some will simply be to activate human cognitive biases (especially sunk cost fallacy) in order to increase the hold over the supplicant and/or expand the cult.

How it goes from there depends on what kind of rules you set up for your demons and witches. Are rituals static things with repeatable effects, similar to programmatic function calls? Or are they unbreakable contracts for service by agreement of both parties (with or without fine print or interpretation)? What, precisely, can demons do, and is it mathematically defined, utility defined, memetically defined, et cetera?
