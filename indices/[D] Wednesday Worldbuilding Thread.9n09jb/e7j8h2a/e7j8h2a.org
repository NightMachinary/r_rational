I'm curious what y'all think rational satanic witchcraft would look like. I've seen so many different takes on magic but I don't think I've ever read anything that presented magic as something bad/evil or similar to what inspired witch hunts. Moreover, I'm having trouble thinking of how this would work, so let's say these witches have to make some sort of deal/s with the devil or demons. What would they (Satan/demons) want, why would they want it, why would they need to make a deal with a human to get it, and what is it they can offer in exchange for the deal/s?

The problem I'm seeing is that if demons can transmit anything other than information from their world/dimension to the human world then they wouldn't need to grant humans magic. They could just cull anyone with both a low probability of reproducing and a high probability of going to hell in the event of their death to ensure a steady flow of incoming souls. But I guess this all depends on how you design hell. Like maybe the souls of bad people go to some location of hell to be snatched by the first demon that happens upon them, but if the person sells their soul to a specific demon then that persons soul will be delivered directly to said demon once they die, which would give demons an incentive to bargain for souls. Conversely, if a person wants magic but doesn't want to sell their soul they could do favors for demons, like killing someone (that's likely to end up in hell) at a specific location so the demon can make an educated guess as to were their soul will arrive in hell. But if you're doing favors for demons, you're probably going to hell so that doesn't really make sense (unless you can literally just repent at any time and earn yourself a one way ticket to not-hell).
