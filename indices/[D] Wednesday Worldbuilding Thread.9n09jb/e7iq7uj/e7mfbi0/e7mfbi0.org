What is the exact geography? Because if your archipelago has a narrow strait dividing the islands into upper and lower (or eastern and western) halves, then whoever controls the strait controls the entire archipelago. Also, it will divide the culture into eastern (or northern) and western (or southern) traditions.

Next stop thinking in terms of centralized Empires. They won't be. The method of control would be vassalage.

So, every island (depending upon how big it is), will have an Emir (equivalent) ruler who will rule the island and collect taxes and goods to be traded. During the non summer months this will happen. Before the onset of summer months, all the non-perishable trade goods will be collected and stored in the port market. Which will be busiest (and most happening) place on the island. This place WILL decide the culture, politics and destiny of the island.

Start of the summer months also coincides with the sowing season, thus making most of the men of fighting age unavailable. So most of the campaigning will be done in the later half of summer. Also, since no one will be able to field large armies to conquer and control all the islands, the method of control would be vassalage.

So, faction A, wanting to control island group A (consisting of islands A1, A2, A3, A4) will show up with its fleet, and the ruler of each island (A1R, A2R, A3R ...) will present tributes. (This would be the equivalent of tax collection).

So now suppose faction B wants to contest A's hold over these islands, it needs to collect tax BEFORE A does, but it can't start sending off a fleet at the start of summer (sowing season), so it has to wait. Which leads to a limit on how far its fleet can effectively collect tributes from (as it has to collect tributes which might take over a week per island, and it is time limited by end of summer on how far it can sail, because it has to come home BEFORE end of summer). This might mean that no ONE faction can control ALL of archipelago.

Which means a strong local tradition of independence. Foreign rule would not be tolerated; though local dictators would be the norm).

Also, if there is a Big Island with a small island next to it; you can be sure that at some point of time in history, a ruling party on the big island had been overthrown by the current rulers, and those previous rulers have fled to the smaller island. Which would mean that both islands now view each other with suspicion.

Finally, make sure your protagonist is a trader; because in this world, a trader is not just a trader, he is also the soldier, sailor, diplomat, spy.
