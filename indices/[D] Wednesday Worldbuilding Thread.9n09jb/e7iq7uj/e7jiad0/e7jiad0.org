Just as an aside, summer is the rainy season in lower latitudes, winters are dry.

So it should be the opposite of what you have there.

​

I guess it would depend on the distance between the islands. Age of sails is very vague, is gunpowder invented? printing presses? manufacturers? steam engines? steel? telescopes? Is science already a thing? or do people just invent things and have silly theories as explanations? Is tradition important to your people? because that can lead to technological stagnation.

​

Have you researched archipelagos and how some islands have metals, others don't, some have forests others are barren rocks. Your societies would work and have it's dominance defined by the resources their islands had available.

​

New Zealand for instance is a continental island, it's large, has metal, forests, rivers etc. So it could develop large populations, metallurgy, shipbuilding and become the super power in it's area.

​

Other islands had so little fertile land that they basically farmed fish, i.e they raised fish in artificial lakes for food. Some fished, some developed highly efficient pig / chicken farms etc.

​

Check chapter 2 of the book guns, germs and steel. It has a lot of useful information for this topic.

​

Try to stay away from the generic stuff, and don't assume you know how things work, double check your facts. Else you'll ruin your story for anybody with a bit more knowledge than you.

​

PS. it's unlikely for a rainy season to stop ships altogether, unless you go full stormlight archive, if their ships are so bad that this is the case the rewards for the first person that invents more resistant ships are immense. It's also an obvious problem with an obvious solution, so you can bet that it would have happened quickly.
