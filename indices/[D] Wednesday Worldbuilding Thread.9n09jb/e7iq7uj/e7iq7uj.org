I'm working on a setting that's an archipelago. Tech level is roughly age-of-sail. People can travel between islands for a few months during the summer. The rest of the year has harsh and unpredictable storms that make open-water sailing extremely dangerous.

What sorts of cultural consequences would flow from this?

I have the details of the trade and government set up, but I'd like to add more touches about how every-day life would change due to the relative isolation.
