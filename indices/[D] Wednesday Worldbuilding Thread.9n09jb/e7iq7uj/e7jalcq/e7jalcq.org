I spent too long making a new Wizarding Europe for the Harry Potter stuff I've been writing. What I've got right now is a work in progress buuuuuuuuuut if anyone's interested in a starting place to jump off from for their own fics, [[https://i.imgur.com/eu07frE.png][here you go]].

This is meant to represent Europe as it stands in the 1990s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union (some Russian wizards saw what Grindelwald was doing with Hitler and had the bright idea to try it with Stalin, only they thought too highly of themselves and too little of the muggles, and came out of it rather the worse for wear).

The Statute of Secrecy was signed in 1689, so I started with the assumption that wizarding countries in Europe were more or less identical to their muggle counterparts at that point (indeed, there arguably wasn't any such thing as a "wizarding country", with few exceptions) but then began to diverge.

The major powers of Europe are the Kingdom of France, still ruled by a cadet branch of the Bourbons; the Wizarding Roman Republic, which was built from the administrative structure meant to oversee the Holy Roman Emperor's magical subjects; and Iberia-Sicily, which has not been ruled by the Hapsburgs for a very long time but has remained intact to be a counterweight against France and the W.R.R. when necessary. "Divided we fall" and all that.

Checkered areas in the W.R.R. represent "free states" (placeholder name) which have considerably more autonomy. Many of them are centered on particular cities but, given the low population of the magical community and their penchant for teleporting around, are larger in territory than a muggle version might be.
