Really random aside: Andorra is a tiny country between Spain and France, and it has the strangest head of state ever. Wikipedia calls it a "Unitary parliamentary semi-elective diarchy".

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-Princes_of_Andorra][Andorra has co-princes]], namely the Bishop of Urgell and the President of France are the co-heads of state. Since 1278. (Originally it was the French king but after the whole revolution thing happened, power transferred to the French president).

And IIRC, I read somewhere that Macron threatened to abdicate the throne if Andorra didn't increase banking regulations so it'd be less of a tax haven, so those princes sure throw their power around, maybe?

Anyway, I know you're an amazing human slash genius, so I'm sure you could do something cool with that background information.

Also, why is Corsica French? I believe it was Italian in 1689. (Double checked: it was part of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Genoa][Republic of Genoa]], which is part of Italy /now/). The Corsican people have a whole bunch of detailed history of uprisings and being taken over by various nation states (I think Spain had their finger in the pie at one point), so... yeah.

Then again, if you get complicated about the detailed histories of every tiny European country you'll probably be there all day. I don't know why but my instinct is that magic would make small nations more common, perhaps with United Magical States of X popping up.
