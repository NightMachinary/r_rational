This is the core element for how magic works in a story that I'm working on. I'd really appreciate it if people could offer some critiques or ideas regarding it.

ESSENCE

Essence is the way that magic expresses itself in the world. It is the force that enables warriors to lift a ton of steel in one hand and it is the force that enables a mage to throw lightning at his foes. Essence exists in faint concentrations in the air but is mostly concentrated within individuals. Whenever something dies, it's essence is released. Most of that essence will disperse back into the world, but some of it will remain in some form. Usually the remains will be in the form of a spirit core of some type, but occasionally a different echo of the creature might form. The essence inside of this spirit core can then be absorbed by another individual in order to improve their abilities or develop new abilities. Essence is never absorbed as a generic increase in all of something's abilities. It can make you stronger, faster, smarter, it can improve the strength of some magical technique that you have, but a single spirit core can never do all of that. Whenever you absorb a spirit core, you focus on whatever you want to improve or develop and when you have finished absorbing the core, you will have obtained some amount of the improvement or developed some amount of that technique. For most people, this is done via a status screen. There are hard limits to the amount of essence that a person can have; these are known as circles. Additionally, there are hard limits to the amount of essence that any given attribute, skill, or technique can have within a circle. Generally that limit is 10% of the total essence limit for the circle in question. In order to advance from one circle to the next, you need to have some limiting conception of yourself. For example, to move from the first circle to the second circle, a person might have a conception of themself as a warrior. If they broke through like that, then they would find it easier to accumulate essence for fighting aspects and harder to accumulate essence for crafting or social aspects. Then, in order to advance from the second circle to the third circle, that person might have a conception of themself as a swordsman, and this would have a similar limiting factor. A person's conception of themself is called their class and aspects which are easy for them to improve are known as their purview. The following is the most basic status screen that exists:

BASIC Name: N/A Class: N/A Circle: 1 Essence: 0/1000
