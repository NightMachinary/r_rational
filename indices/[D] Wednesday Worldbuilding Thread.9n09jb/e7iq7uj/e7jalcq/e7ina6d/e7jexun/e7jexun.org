This seems like experience points, D&D classes, and gamer-style status screens. D&D came up with these elements to approximate the real-world dynamic where people specialize, and then get better at their day-job with practice. It's already true that playing a bunch of tennis will make me better at tennis.

So, I'd suggest making the magic system less realistic and focusing on the things that seemed really epic about the original idea. Right now, it seems like the big consequences are:

1. You get stronger by killing things
2. People specialize in professions
3. People can see status screens

If you push hard on #1, you get a world where the guy at the beef slaughterhouse is terrifyingly strong. And adventurer might kill a monster every couple days. But slaughterhouse guy kills a cow every 90 seconds for 8 hours / day.

Push hard on #2, and you get a world where my skills depend on my /self-conception/ rather than any kind of real-world practice. I'd pay story-tellers to invent useful-archetypes for my kids. Therapy, to shift my self-conception, would be super-useful. And people who are skilled at self-delusion would be incredibly versatile.

Push on option #3 and you get interesting consequences, too. I can imagine a story where the ROB gives a free gift of 2000 essence to some protagonist. His friends and family notice the sudden jump and draw the reasonable conclusion that he must have murdered a /lot/ of people in the last 24 hours.

And Free-Will gets weird in a world where there's a Charisma stat. Does everyone agree that Charisma-10 Bob is a better guy than Charisma-9 Dave? Like, not just that Bob is a better salesman or public speaker, but that literally everyone would rather be Bob's friend than Dave's?

If so, you'd get a fascinating social dynamics by making 1 character an "anti-gamer" who's just indifferent to mental stats.
