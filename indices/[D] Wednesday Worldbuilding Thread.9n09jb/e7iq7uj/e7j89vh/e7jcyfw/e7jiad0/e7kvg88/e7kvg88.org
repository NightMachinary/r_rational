Depending on the storms' extents, harbours might be far from settlements. If the islands are regularly pelted by storm winds, the circumferential coastlines will be ravaged by waves, to the detriment of prospective harbours. I'd expect to see more inland/upstream harbours, protected storm gales in other words.

Islands with reefs as natural wave breaks could keep deep water harbours directly at the coastline.

Where there isn't natural protection against these waves you'd still find both shallow and deep water harbours, but they'd all be relatively young (decades rather than centuries). Their existence would hinge on beating the odds of any particular storm season, and that would be a loosing game in the long run. If one managed long enough, or were luckily hit by a mild storm, expect to see efforts in the direction of artificial protection, such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(architecture][moles]]). In that case storm season work could be in a quarry, if available.

Also, farming might be considered women's work. When the men go sailing during the calm season and the woman remain at home, if calm=planting season I could see culture developing in that direction.
