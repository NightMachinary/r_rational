Right so Wits would be purely mental fatigue from overusing your brain and Composure is social fatigue from things like bullying or other types of social stressors. The whole set up is designed so that between Physical, Social, and Mental, you have symmetry for your resilience, force, and nimbleness. The formatting was messed up when I posted without my realizing which might explain why that's unclear. Charisma is raw force of personality while Manipulation is saying the right thing to send the right signal to someone. Once again, the divisions are essentially just Force, Precision, and Resilience, and then those concepts are applied to like Physicality, or Mentality, or what have you. If you developed additional attributes, then they would be similarly divided up.

I think the Essence limits do have a pretty good effect for stopping people from going all in on something. If we say that the base Essence improvement rate is log(Essence) and essence limits go up by powers of 10, then you can only ever get up to your circle + 1 as a multiple for your attribute. Additionally the way that classes limit you isn't really that they form level caps, it's more that they will progressively limit how much you can invest into any given attribute. You might be able to go no physical attributes for the first few circles, but eventually you have to specialize in mental or social and then further specialize within that and so on and so forth.

I think what prevents a ruling class from going all in on social/mental is that if you were to go all in, some random high circle combatant could just blow your everything up. This then causes social pressure to have some degree of personal fighting prowess. It's also hard to convince people to follow you if those people are in a different league of personal power compared to you. It's possible, but much easier to just have some actual combat prowess.

Specific applications of Essence is the only way that spellcasting manifests. This can be weird magical Kung fu, throwing bolts of lightning, magically efficient bureaucracy, or anything along those lines. If you're doing some kind of magic that has a specific purpose rather than just generically making you better at something, then that's a Technique/Art. Generally, it's called an Art if it has multiple different moves that it does (like how a martial art will have multiple maneuvers) and a Technique if you're doing just one very specific thing. An Art counts as one aspect when you're investing Essence in it; obviously a Technique does as well.
