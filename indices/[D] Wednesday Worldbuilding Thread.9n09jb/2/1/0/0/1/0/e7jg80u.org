  Right so Wits would be purely mental fatigue from overusing your brain and Composure is social fatigue from things like bullying or other types of social stressors.

Honestly having these be different stats is kind of bizarre, because it seems like there's only actually one willpower trait which governs how much people can endure unpleasantness whether it's social or not. Like trying to create symmetries here seems like it comes at the cost of coming up with a model of human psychology which doesn't really work.\\
Also the way you described wits would make it seem like it is a weird hodgepodge that includes how quickly you get mentally tired but also one's general ability to endure /any/ unpleasant things which aren't social. Either that or it doesn't include willpower generally which then creates an issue in that a lot of willpower stuff wouldn't be connected to any stat.

  Charisma is raw force of personality while Manipulation is saying the right thing to send the right signal to someone.

This creates something of an issue in that "raw force of personality" isn't some distinct thing from social skills generally. Good actors who are generally soft spoken (who would be considered to have low charisma) can nonetheless act indistinguishable from someone who's "really" charismatic. Charisma is a learnable skill not somehow different from other areas of social persuasion. So my criticism above applies here to that you're forcing human psychology into a weird mold that doesn't carving nature at its joints.

  I think what prevents a ruling class from going all in on social/mental is that if you were to go all in, some random high circle combatant could just blow your everything up. This then causes social pressure to have some degree of personal fighting prowess. It's also hard to convince people to follow you if those people are in a different league of personal power compared to you. It's possible, but much easier to just have some actual combat prowess.

You could apply this same logic to real life to conclude that clearly all nobles must have been master swordmen. The reason some high combatants can't just blow everything up is that /the ruling class doesn't do their own fighting and virtually never has in any large society/. The logic that people won't follow masters vastly weaker in combat than them is similarly absurd given you can apply it to history and see how wrong it is.
