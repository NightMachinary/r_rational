  And Free-Will gets weird in a world where there's a Charisma stat. Does everyone agree that Charisma-10 Bob is a better guy than Charisma-9 Dave? Like, not just that Bob is a better salesman or public speaker, but that literally everyone would rather be Bob's friend than Dave's?

  If so, you'd get a fascinating social dynamics by making 1 character an "anti-gamer" who's just indifferent to mental stats.
