So if I understand correctly, a large group of first circle people could accomplish literally anything... directing their essence to whatever purpose they agreed or were ordered to? The advantages of rising up in circles seem to limit the potential of teamwork unless one groups high circle individuals with complementary foci. Even then they're going to have a degree of fragility outside their spec that will make them vulnerable to large groups of cooperating low-circle folk.
