Andorra's part of Iberia-Sicily, in the semi-autonomous whatever of Catalonia.

Corsica's been bouncing back and forth between France, Iberia-Sicily, and the WRR this whole time, and will probably bounce around a bunch more when I go back in to do 2.0.

The U.S. has been broken up into lots of countries, actually. It started out with ten or so and has kept shattering to the point that I'm not sure I'll do a map of it, because the darn thing would just be a gross kaleidoscope.
