The storm latitudes are a brutal place in a variety of ways. Jungle conditions dominate, with high biodiversity and (as conditions outside the body tend to resemble those inside) lots of bacterial and parasitic diseases. Expect almost constant precipitation outside of the summer months, themselves still so hot and humid as to be nearly fatal. The universal mid-day nap is a common cultural standard, and night it the time for social engagement.
