Once the stormy season comes, trade is cut off, so people are always eager to get as much of whatever perishables they can before their supply is gone the rest of the year (assuming some amount of comparative advantage on that front). Most of the perishables get preserved (pickled, salted, sugared, honeyed, dried, etc), and even those probably need to be rationed out for the rest of the year. This might be the case for some goods even without strong comparative advantages, if there are economies of scale that only function when you have trade access to all the islands.

You need sailors to do the trading, but what do those sailors do when the storms come and they can't go out on the seas? That's probably going to define a fair amount of your culture. Do they become shallow-water fisherman? Do they have culturally-standard off-season jobs that play on their skills at sailing? The calm season overlaps with summer, which is prime farming time, so that's a definite stressor on the labor supply, which in turn probably has some cultural artifacts.

I think I would look for some quiet, labor-intensive activity for people to do as a social activity, which will probably be one of the things that defines the isolation period. Quilting groups, Bible study, things like that, likely related to textiles (since those aren't perishable and are usually labor intensive) or pottery (same reason) or something else, depending on tech levels, some of which is in service of getting goods ready for the next trade period.

So on an average night in the "winter", you have a group of people sitting in a circle chattering away as they weave the fibers left over from the summer's harvest, eating candied fruits that come in from the next island over and are in dwindling supply. People are cooped up and irritable, but trying to take their minds off of it, listening to the same story being told a fourth time.
