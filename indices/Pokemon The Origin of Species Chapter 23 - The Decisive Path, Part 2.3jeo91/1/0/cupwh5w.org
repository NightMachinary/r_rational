Thanks, glad you enjoyed it! I find the idea of good stand alone chapters interesting as well: I tried to write the Interlude with Brock and Janine as types of "short story" chapters that would be easy to read for those that haven't been following it yet. Curious to know what your friends end up thinking of this one!
