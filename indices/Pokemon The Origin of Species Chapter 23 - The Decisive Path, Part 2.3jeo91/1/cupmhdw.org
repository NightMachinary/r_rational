Excellent stuff. I loved the characterization of the battlefield, really helped paint a specific picture versus the generic "room with dirt" setup. I also observed that this chapter stand very well on its own; an outside reader wouldn't need to know anything else about this fanfic in particular to follow and enjoy the events. I shared this particular chapter with some friends, trying to get them hooked; I felt it could do the job really well without making them feel lost. The only bump in that road would be Aeosus, but a quick explanation of what it was fixed that easily.

Keep it up!
