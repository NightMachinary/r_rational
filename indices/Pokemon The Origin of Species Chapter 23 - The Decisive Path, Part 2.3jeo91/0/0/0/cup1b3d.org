It's great - most of the best Pokemon stories go with what you might call the ubermensch theme: if you are determined enough and morally deserve it, you can gain powers beyond any other. It's common in japanese stories; there are some legendary characters who stand out because they're /just better/ (eg Itachi from Naruto, Red, etc.).

I think your story is deeper for leaving that behind, and I like it.
