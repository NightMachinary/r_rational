I wonder if gym leaders hand out the same TM to any level of challenger. Is Rock Tomb really as useful to some-one who just earned their 7th badge, or would they get something more rare/valuable/powerful. This assumes that their isn't some kind of "copyright" held by Brock for Rock Tomb, but I can't imagine that as something a near-to-post scarcity world could really enforce.
