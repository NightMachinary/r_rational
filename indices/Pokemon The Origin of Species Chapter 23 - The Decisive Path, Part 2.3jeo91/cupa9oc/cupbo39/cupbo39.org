Fixed, thanks!

In my view, species names are non-capitalized when not referring to a specific pokemon the same way animals in our world are non-capitalized. There's no reason to consider pokemon names proper nouns other than the convention set in the games.

As for titles like gym leader, they're capitalized when they come before or after the name, again like in our world, but not otherwise. Or that's the theory anyway: I might have been inconsistent somewhere, and if so that's a typo :)

Glad someone caught the TM change reference too!
