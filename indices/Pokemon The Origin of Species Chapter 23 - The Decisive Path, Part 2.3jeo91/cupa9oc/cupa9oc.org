just one told here.

Was a good chapter. I liked seeing Blue react to Brock's tactics, how the leader taught as he battled, the references to pokemon biology and how moves are used you sprinkled into the story as it progressed. Think you even references the different game generations at the end with how Brock once taught Bide but now hands out Rock Tomb TM.

Any reason you've gone for lowercase for species names and game titles, such as gym leader?
