  This explains a lot about the in-game nature of trainers getting harder and explains why Blue thinks it's possible to get a Badge so soon: They scale in difficulty.

Yeah, it's something I think bothered a lot of people about the games, but was fairly easy to rationalize.

  I liked this chapter. I'm glad that Blue lost; I feel that if he had won it would have sent a message more of the challenge being trivial more than of Blue's skill being exceptional. Mainly because he wasn't at all exceptional with how he prepared for that fight.

Yep. I felt a bit reluctant to include that Blue already fought Brock in the chapter with Red, since it kind of killed the suspense with the previous chapter where he's fighting through the underlings, but I hope some people picked up on the "fought" rather than "beat" in what he told Red and realized that he's not assured victory: as someone commented on FF, I'm not a huge fan of stories where protagonists win on pure willpower, and even being an above average novice, Blue was being far too reckless.
