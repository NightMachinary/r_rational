As always I'm super happy to see a new chapter. Keep up the good work!

Some other typos I noticed:

#+begin_quote
  they all make it clear that something fantastic was happening, something that would help forge legends and shape fates.
#+end_quote

I think "was" should be "is", and then maybe "would" should be "will".

#+begin_quote
  From the other side of a screen, the battles might as well have been happening in some big warehouse.
#+end_quote

"Have been" should maybe be "be". I'm not sure about this note and the above though. The tenses are kind of weird for this whole paragraph.

#+begin_quote
  This is a place destiny is decided.
#+end_quote

Maybe add a "where".

#+begin_quote
  usual orange and dark khaki shirt
#+end_quote

should be dark-khaki (adv.-adj.)

#+begin_quote
  he has shown the will and skill to attempt a place among us as equals
#+end_quote

Should be "a place as an equal" imo.

#+begin_quote
  Each is more difficult than the last, and dictates what pokemon and techniques Brock would use.
#+end_quote

"Would" should maybe be "will".

#+begin_quote
  It grabs a rock from the ground and grinds the pieces against it, then tosses the stone toward Gon before repeating the process.
#+end_quote

Kind of unclear from a grammatical standpoint which rocks it throws.

#+begin_quote
  pokeeball
#+end_quote

pokeball

#+begin_quote
  The onix bobs its head to the side she sticks her head out and spurts water at its face.
#+end_quote

Maybe add an "as" between "side" and "she".

#+begin_quote
  the spectator's applause
#+end_quote

spectators'

For the following it looks like there's a formatting error where a line break is missing:

#+begin_quote
  Grinning like a madman might give a bad impression. "Leader Brock, of Pewter City, 138th Indigo League Champion, Trainer of Aeosus, The Mountain's Might!" This time the applause are much louder. Brock is hard to make out in the distance, but the screens show him walking toward his platform in his usual orange and dark khaki shirt and cargo pants. Like his gym, Brock often clothes himself in the functional rather than flashy. It makes the Gym Leader look far less imposing than the reinforced leather he wore in the forest, which he needed to safely ride Aeosus. As Brock gets close enough to mount his platform, Blue can just recognize him with the naked eye. Brock attaches an earpiece and mic to his ear, and Blue takes out the one he was given and does the same. After a moment the earpiece comes to life, and he hears Brock's voice in it. "Hello again, Mr. Oak. Left toggle is to talk to me, right is to use the stadium speakers. Test your mic by responding to me, then announce your challenge after I address you, and then we'll begin."
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  "Well done, challenger! You have once again demonstrated the trait our gym most prizes." "Thank you, Leader. I learned the value of decisive action while fighting the Viridian Forest fire, and from our meeting there I knew I had more to learn. Your members proved apt teachers throughout the day."
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  Leader Brock comes in looking annoyingly stoic as ever, and Blue gets to his feet with a mostly contained sigh. "No, please, stay seated. I know you've had a long day. How are you holding up?"
#+end_quote

They look a bit different here from how they look in the chapter, but you'll notice that something's up.
