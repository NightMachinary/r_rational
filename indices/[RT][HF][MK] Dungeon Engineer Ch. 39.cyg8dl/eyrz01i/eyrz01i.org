Some thoughts on trap design:

The main character has learned that mana-cost scales with force. And they've just gotten an ability to massively multi task.

I'd advise them to check out the [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-ring_release_system][three ring release]] used in parachutes. The rings produce a huge amount of mechanical advantage that lets you hold up a ton of weight with just a tiny bit of pressure on the top ring.

MC can abuse this to create some nice anti-anti-magic traps.

He would stick the release just behind a wall, about 40' down a 60' corridor. Then, devote a tiny trickle of attention/magic to hold the small ring closed.

This way, if anyone comes down the corridor with an anti-magic field active, the MCs telekinesis stops holding the small ring. And then the entire ceiling falls.

At this point, I'd also start thinking in terms of "fence post security" and "unknown unknowns".

Pits will help you with anyone who needs to walk. More pits will come down harder on walkers. But they won't do too much to anyone who can fly, teleport or turn ethereal.

My solution to flight might be looking for a way to simultaneously drop a spread of small rocks. Wings tend to be fragile. And we haven't seen any wizards wearing safety helmets.

My solution to teleportation would be to create some areas that look like invitingly stable ground, but are actually dangerous.

Depending on the materials, this might be a layer of the most crumbly fungal wood I can find, topped with a paper-thin layer of fused stone.

If someone teleports onto the stone, they drop a foot or two into the crumbly wood, and get into attack range of whatever venomous critters are handy.
