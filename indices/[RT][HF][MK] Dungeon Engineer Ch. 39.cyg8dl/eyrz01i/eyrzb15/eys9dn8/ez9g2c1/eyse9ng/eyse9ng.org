At first glance, this looks not good. It begins with the cliche "waking up" opening and contains bolded /and/ italicized /and/ capitalized words with an excessive amount of punctuation after. And despite having shown the ability to use all this emphasis, the story still insists on *starring* some words.

Anyone want to offer up an assurance that it gets better?
