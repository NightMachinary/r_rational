From my completely biased perspective, the formatting gets a lot better in just a couple of chapters but the story stays fairly consistent.

Therefore if the story turned you off, I wouldn't reccomend continuing.

If I remember correctly, I only used * in the first two chapters and used bold or caps in the first three or fourish.

I'll push those corrections ASAP.
