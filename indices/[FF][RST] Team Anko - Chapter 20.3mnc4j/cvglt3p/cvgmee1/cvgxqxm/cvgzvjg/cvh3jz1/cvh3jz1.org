Perhaps I should expound a bit- Vetinari served as the ultimate necessity in discworld- he was ruthless, firm, cunningly peerless, and unquestionably the most powerful man in Ahnk-Morpolk, and yet no one wanted him taken down because it was obvious that he was running things better than anyone else could. I feel like you have set Orochimaru up in much the same way- he is a bit more blatant about his disregard for morality, but only when it actually serves a purpose for advancing his manipulations. His is obviously a capable leader, working to further the better of his people, and graced with the lack of qualms that such betterment calls for. Both are men of exceptional skill and intellect, both attempting to run a society and doing it better than their peers, and both playing a very, very long game. As such, they are very wonderful for propelling the plot- if they ask someone to do something, they always have the upper hand to ensure that it is done, and eventually the person usually discovers that what they were asked to do actually forwards their own goals as well- just because you use your tools, that doesn't mean you mistreat them, a well maintained tool will last ever so much longer.
