/Awesome/ chapter. Orochimaru continues to wreck all of the good guy's plans, and I'm loving him for it.

Despite Anko's secret pleasure at Hinata's emigration, there's no way that this isn't a crushing blow to their plans. Orochimaru continues to play one level higher than her, and their remaining options just dropped way down. His utter competence is great.

Honestly, I would be totally fine if they ended up joining Sound, or at least the genin, and work with Orochimaru to expand it and save the Elemental Nations from destruction (presumably the Republic, but the Akatsuki and other related things are huge threats as well). I just want to see more of this guy and the nation he's made.
