Interesting ploy from Orochimaru. I'd never have thought of a strategy like that: cut someone's ties with the village in the most blatant way possible.

A few questions:

-How did Hiashi ever get ambushed?

-The whole deed seems like overkill. Maybe Orochimaru lied about the whole affair. An outrageous lie they cannot verify without compromising themselves...

-There is a solution to the situation though. Kill Orochimaru and bring his body to Konoha. Difficult, but would irrevocably put to rest any doubts.

-Orochimaru was known to work on humans before being sent away from Konoha. Would the village find the clone theory so hard the believe?

-I feel Orochimaru is falling into the bad villain's habit of exposing all of his plans at every turn. Too much tell, too little show.

-If Naruto and Hinata make it back to Konoha, what's the worst that could really happen to them? They wouldn't die...
