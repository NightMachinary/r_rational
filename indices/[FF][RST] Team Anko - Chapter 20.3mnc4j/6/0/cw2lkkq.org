  -How did Hiashi ever get ambushed?
#+end_quote

Assuming it actually happened (since, as you point out, they have no evidence), it wouldn't have been hard. A claymore mine is an OCP for ninja; Hiashi would have had no way of knowing what he was seeing and therefore wouldn't have known to react before it went off. The fact that he managed to Kaiten between the moment of detonation and the moment that the buckshot splattered him into chunky salsa -- and was thereby able to avoid being turned into chunky salsa -- is a testament to what an amazing ninja he is. (Again, assuming it happened.)

Also, congrats on being the only person who has mentioned noticing that the whole thing could be a bluff.

  There is a solution to the situation though. Kill Orochimaru and bring his body to Konoha. Difficult, but would irrevocably put to rest any doubts.

Good luck with that.

  -I feel Orochimaru is falling into the bad villain's habit of exposing all of his plans at every turn. Too much tell, too little show.
#+end_quote

I suppose I could have cut away and shown the attack on Hiashi, but that would have removed any question about whether it happened.

Aside from the attack on Hiashi, what plans do you feel Orochimaru has exposed, and why do you feel that it's all of them?

  -If Naruto and Hinata make it back to Konoha, what's the worst that could really happen to them? They wouldn't die...

Hinata could be hospitalized, killed, or demoted to the branch house and given the Caged Bird Seal as punishment for embarrassing the clan.
