Thank you! I'm glad he's coming off so well.

It's actually a bit of a problem; of all the characters in the story, Orochimaru is the most fun to write and, I suspect, the most fun to read. I'm actually considering writing a sequel to this with him as the main character, but I don't think it would work -- he's just too powerful on every axis.
