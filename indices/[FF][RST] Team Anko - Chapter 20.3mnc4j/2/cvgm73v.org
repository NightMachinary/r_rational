My, I didn't expect Orochimaru to do what he did when it came to recruiting Hinata. He has quite the plans laid out, I see, and comes off as a lot more intelligent and overall likable than his canon counterpart in my eyes. Why'd he take Naruto with him to repair the gas lines or stop the fires, though? The clones the boy can make being used as firemen?
