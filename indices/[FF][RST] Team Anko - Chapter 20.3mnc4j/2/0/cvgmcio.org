  My, I didn't expect Orochimaru to do what he did when it came to recruiting Hinata. He has quite the plans laid out, I see, and comes off as a lot more intelligent and overall likable than his canon counterpart in my eyes.

Thanks. He's still psychotic, of course. He just killed a lot of Konoha nin and his own agents for the sole purpose of adding verisimilitude to Hinata's dead clone.

  Why'd he take Naruto with him to repair the gas lines or stop the fires, though? The clones the boy can make being used as firemen?

Nope. In fact, he's going to tell Naruto not to make any clones.
