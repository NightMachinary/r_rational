OCP = Outside Context Problem. It specifically means when one civilization encounters one that is more technologically advanced, but it gets used informally to mean "something utterly beyond the mental framework." The asteroid was an OCP for the dinosaurs, for example.

  I was more concerned by the fact that Hiashi would find something he can't recognize as a danger, instead of the usual trick of disguising a dangerous object as safe or mundane one. But he's human. He can't keep track of EVERYTHING.

No one in Konoha has ever seen chemical explosives, much less a claymore mine. Hiashi would have seen it, but would have had no way to understand what he was seeing.

  I was going along with the canon 'Princess' Hinata information, where she was a highly valued member of the clan and her ascension to clan head would be inevitable.

In Team Anko (and, I had thought, in canon, but apparently not explicitly stated) Hinata is being abused by her father. He's not doing the beatings himself, he's having Neji, Hanabi, and other clan members administer them as "training". Neji is older and a prodigy, so when he spars with Hinata she looks bad. Hanabi is six years younger but Hinata refuses to hit her, so again Hinata looks bad. It gives the impression that she /is/ bad, and her lack of self-confidence is not acceptable in a clan head. It hasn't been stated, but I imagine that Hiashi spent years trying to make her be more like what he wants, but he did it through harshness instead of nurturing, which only made the problem worse. He got more and more frustrated as time went on, which made him harsher, which was a vicious cycle. Add to that the fact that every time he looks at her h is reminded of how his brother died because of her. If she came back from time in a traitor's village and embarrassed the clan, I can easily imagine him beating her into the hospital or the grave.

  Maybe Hiashi really is plain evil.

No, I don't think so. I imagine he does love her in his own way, but he is naturally cold, sharp-tongued, and has so many negative emotions tied up with her that it leads to bad results.
