Thanks for the answers.

OCP... I assume an unidentifiable object. I was more concerned by the fact that Hiashi would find something he can't recognize as a danger, instead of the usual trick of disguising a dangerous object as safe or mundane one. But he's human. He can't keep track of EVERYTHING.

About the exposition, I guess it's the fault of dialogue-heavy chapters. You can't exactly cut away to something happening just for the sake of showing it, when telling it through conversation has more natural flow.

With regards to Hinata's fate, I was going along with the canon 'Princess' Hinata information, where she was a highly valued member of the clan and her ascension to clan head would be inevitable. In canon, she is hampered only by her lack of confidence, in turn making her skills look lackluster, thereby forcing Hiashi to make the difficult decision of appointing her younger sister as head of clan instead of the natural choice.

In your fic, Hinata is much better skilled. It all comes down to how Hinata would be disciplined. Is destroying the value she possesses by killing or placing the Caged Bird Seal on her worth it?

Maybe Hiashi really is plain evil.
