I liked this chapter a lot. Orochimaru again shines through in an awesomely sociopathic manner. His dismissal of Naruto's usual attitude was also fairly priceless. I would've laughed super hard if I didn't think Naruto was about to get beaten brutally for disrespect, mostly due to how Anko reacted.
