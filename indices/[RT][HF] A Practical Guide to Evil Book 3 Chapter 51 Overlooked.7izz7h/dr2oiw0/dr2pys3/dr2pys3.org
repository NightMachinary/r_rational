The thing is with or without Catherine, people would still be dying, just at different times for different reasons. The rebellion was still going to happen, Heiress/Diabolist was still going to be Heiress/Diabolist, and the war with Procer is still going to happen. The only thing that might have been different would be the Fae invasion.
