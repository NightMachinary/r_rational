Hune's point of view is quite reasonable. Her people get shafted by the current regime and Cat promises all sorts of changes but Hune's right to be sceptical. Cat's already shown that she can base her decisions on personal feelings so who's to say she won't back down on those promises later?

The way to solve this is to implement some sort of overarching plan. Kind of how the Legions were created as a way to give other races a way to move up, Cat needs to meet up with Malicia and negotiate some sort of social restructuring.

For all the talk of making things better Cat's done a remarkable job of breaking down the current system and not setting up anything new.
