It doesn't really matter what system or plan Cat sets up, the distrust is generational. Short of in universe blood pacts (which I feel would have been either commonly used, or commonly magic'd into breaking) there's no way for Cat to demonstrably signal commitment to ogreish fair treatment, until she's already given them what they want, post war. She needs the payment in blood and trust up front but her coin is no good.
