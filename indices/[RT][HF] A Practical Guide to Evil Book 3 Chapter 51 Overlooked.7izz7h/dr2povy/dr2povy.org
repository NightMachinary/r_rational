As much as Cat may not feel like it, I think that was actually a very good and productive conversation with Hune. She was able to discover that the source of the issue is Hune's worldview as an ogre. Sure it wasn't a flowers and gumdrops ending to the first round, but you can't fix anything without knowing the problem. And expecting a thaw to long frozen relations after the first 5 minutes of honesty is kind of silly.
