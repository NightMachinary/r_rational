I get that Cat is hurting from her own failure and stresses, but she really needs to woman up, here.

The way her world operates, when a new Villain comes into existence with the blessing of Below, then Above gets its turn to grant power onto a mortal who becomes a new Hero.

Up until now, this process has been going on for awhile, and almost invariably results in one killing the other or the two 'paired' hero/villain being set up as potent rivals for a duration. Over time, those balanced out.

Cat was the first one to take what is essentially a zero sum game and make it into a net positive benefit against the Dead King. Instead of just one useful hero or villain out of every 'spawning', now she gets *two* to add to her cause.

All she has to do is protect them and train them well until they can have a group to work with or at least take care of themselves, then set them on her Enemy.

Yeah, she screwed up, and it hurts, but she really doesn't have to change much. She has the ability to win, as she will invariably unbalance the 'game' in her favor. She just has to be smart and *extremely* proactive about recovering the new Hero and Villain ASAP. If she can't do it herself because she's just one woman, then she needs to assign an 'Adventurer Team' (composed of at least one Hero and one Villain) to the specific task of finding, acquiring, and safely evacuating these Hero/Villain pairs as quickly and efficiently as possible. Get them lots of practice and experience, so they get very good at their jobs, and if they aren't enough, they can train the 2nd and later generations of these 'Adventurer Teams' until she has enough supply to meet the demand.
