Does her anger at the Heavens really make sense though? In this situation we see that the Heavens used their influence over creation to help the Stalwart Apostle while the Hells either did nothing or actively made things worse for the Scorched Apostle.

Shouldn't her Hatred thus be directed at the Hells for their poor treatment of their Champions? The decision of the Heavens to protect their champions and bend things in their favor in such a manner as to ensure that they can avoid excessive suffering seems like it is something that should be admired rather than disdained.
