Now that she's working with heroes, I'm sure she's (generally) grateful for the bits of providence that swing her sides way. But I think I'm more sympathetic to Cat's view than most commenters I'm seeing. I'm willing to take Cat at her word that the vast majority of the time, putting one's trust in the heavens doesn't actually work---at least for people who aren't already Heroes/Chosen. My reading of the chapter is that neither the Scorched Apostate or the Stalwart Apostle were actually Named until they made their various choices in how to address the seeded plague problem (I was confused at first by Apostle but I think 1. she was a mage who used magic to detect the plague seeds 2. she responded by praying to above, and was given special Light powers and made the Stalwart Apostle 3. she was attacked by Revenant/zombies, and Grey Pilgrim stepped in.)

So we have two people faced with a horrible situation to be revolved, with very high stakes. One person decided they needed to step up and do whatever they could to resolve it---and as a "reward" he was branded a villain by the system in place, rejected by the heavens and embraced by below, no helping hand of providence for him. The other decides not to step up with her magic and try to solve the problem, and instead sits back and hopes that the Gods Above will solve things for her---and although this usually DOES NOT WORK, this time she happens to get embraced by the Heavens and given the benefits of providence. I don't think it's nutty for Cat to be enraged at a system that works like this, when in her view it is the Scorched Apostate who actually made what she considers the "right" choice.

Anyway, that's my take on it. It's not about whether it's good that the heavens step in and help some people---it's about the system of deciding who is worthy of that sort of protection.
