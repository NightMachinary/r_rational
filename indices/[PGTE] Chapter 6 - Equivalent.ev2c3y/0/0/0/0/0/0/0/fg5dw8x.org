I think that, at almost any point in the settings history, you'd rather live in Callow or Procer than Praes. Praes is a /terrible/ place to live, and that remains true under the Calamities.

And calling Praes a meritocracy is certainly misleading, what with the nobilities extreme inherited wealth and power and eugenics and such.
