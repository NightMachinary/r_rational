Indeed. It is easy to forget that in Calernia it is Praes that is the meritocracy. Obviously the results haven't been what one hopes for (Black is not wrong when he says that Praes is a mould that must be broken) but, at least theoretically speaking, that meritocracy is just as good if not extremely preferable to say:

 

the Holy Roman Empire styled mess of Procer

the eternal dictatorships of Keter, the Golden Bloom and the Empire Ever Dark

the plutocracy of Mercantis

the hereditary oligarchy of Levant

the hereditary monarchy of Callow

the messier monarchies (or monarchies in all but name) of Helike, Penthes, and Nicae

the literal slavery of Stygia

the bureaucratically-enforced castes of Ashur and Delos

the theocracy of Atalante

the Orwellian nightmare mixed with true mob rule that is Bellerophon
