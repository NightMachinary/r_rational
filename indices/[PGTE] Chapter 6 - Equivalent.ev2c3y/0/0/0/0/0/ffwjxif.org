It's less that Good doesn't give to everyone and more that Evil is the ones who give to the deserving. Evil is meritocratic, it gives to those that want power and are willing to work and sacrifice for it. Good meanwhile gives power to the virtuous who will use that power for good. In Cat's mind simply wanting to do good is useless. For twenty years her people were ruled by corrupt Praesi and while everyone agreed that they should be stopped no one stepped up and did it. Catherine is insulted by the thought that those people who /would/ do something, if only they had the power, would simply be given it when people like her who actually have the drive must earn every scrap.
