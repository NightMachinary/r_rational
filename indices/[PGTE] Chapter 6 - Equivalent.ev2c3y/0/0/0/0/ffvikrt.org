Do the Heavens have the power to protect everyone ? I understand that this appears to be what Catherine is assuming but I don't believe that this is accurate.

My understanding of the setting is that Creation was established as a something of a game between the forces of Heaven and Hell where they can compete to prove some kind of abstract point on the nature of Good and Evil. The status of Creation as a Contest between two sides would seem to mandate restrictions on the ability of each side to shape Creation. If the Heavens have the ability to "protect everyone" or otherwise ensure that everything always goes there way than the entire point of Creation would be made meaningless.

My perspective is that the existing evidence and logic indicates that the ability of Heaven to interfere in Creation is tightly limited. The absence of Heavenly providence saving the Scorched Apostle or other random individuals suffering all across Creation can be best understood as a need to most effectively use limited resources and work within the confines of the Game of Creation rather than a moral decision to give some humans a higher value than others.
