They do say that the ancient language was created as a sort of coding language and that before it was implemented magic just followed you intent though if you let your mind wander while casting it could change. Saying "burn the door" your intent can change this in tons of different ways but you won't accidentally burn someone else if you happen to look and think of them at the time. It is still possible to wordlessly cast though but it's ill advised.
