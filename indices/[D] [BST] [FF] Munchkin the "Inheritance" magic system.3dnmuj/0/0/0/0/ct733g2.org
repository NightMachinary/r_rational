According to my hazy memories, energy stored in a gem /does/ decay, at a rate that depends on the kind of gem and its cut. This is why you can't just pick up a random rock and start using it as a battery. The jewel in Aren was filled up over /years/, so they can definitely keep their charge for quite a while.
