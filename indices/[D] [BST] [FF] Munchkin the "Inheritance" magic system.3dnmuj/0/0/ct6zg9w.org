Yes, I do mean the Eragon books. The series' proper name is "The Inheritance Cycle", so I used that name.

Regarding how magic is cast, see the spoiler I added to the OP.

I seem to recall Eragon filling up the ruby in his sword's pommel (or possibly the jewels in his belt) every night before bed over some duration.

Also, Brom does just that with the jewel in Aren during his time in Carvahall, as per the [[http://inheritance.wikia.com/wiki/Aren][wiki]]

It should be noted that (IIRC) you can only take energy from organisms that are actually still /alive/. This passage:

#+begin_quote
  /[Saphira:]/ You can draw energy from your surroundings if you have to.

  /[Eragon:]/ I won't, not unless I kill another of Galbatorix's magicians and can take it from the soldiers. Otherwise, I'll just be hurting the rest of the Varden, since there are no plants or animals here I can use to support us.
#+end_quote

suggests that Eragon can in fact steal energy from people, but that doesn't work if they have defenses.
