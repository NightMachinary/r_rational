Like the others, I think Elva was more of an empath with a danger sense... but I think you're on to something in a more general sense because the "blessing" system in Inheritance is ridiculous. Both the magic that Eragon cast to alter Elva and also dragon enhancement. The tricky bit for the latter being that dragons can cast this magic only when they're in the mood, so if you could manipulate their emotions to consistently inspire this type of magic... you win.
