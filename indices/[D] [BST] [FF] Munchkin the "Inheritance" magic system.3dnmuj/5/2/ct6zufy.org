You have some sort of mana pool, which happens to also be your life energy (so running yourself dry does kill you). Spell draw energy form that pool, and the amount is equivalent to how much you'd need to do the task normally.

It's not very clear what is meant by this (the author /was/ 15 when he started writing it), and I don't remember the book going into it in much more detail. The gist of it is that it's easy to lift a pebble, but if you want a nuke-level explosion you need to convert your entire body mass to energy (which is off by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude, but not too inaccurate otherwise).

Also, check the spoiler(s) I added to the OP for just what role the ancient language plays in spellcasting.
