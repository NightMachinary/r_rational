I'm not familiar with the system. What are the basics of it? This [[http://inheritance.wikia.com/wiki/Magic][wiki]] article says that energy used has to come from somewhere, but it can come from surroundings. It also talks about knowledge of a language. It sounds like you form a command in the ancient language and have to have a balanced energy equation to make it happen. Is that it, or is there more to it?
