Set up a ward system over your army which essentially causes all of their physical energy to be bundled together in a single pool for defense. If an arrow is loosed at one of your soldiers, the ward draws power from the target and a few nearby soldiers (spreading out the effects of energy drain and minimizing distance, as distance from the source affects energy usage) to change its path enough that it misses everyone. Lethal sword thrusts get similarly redirected. If a single attack would draw too much energy from its local soldiers to defend, the ward draws all of its energy from the soldier at the epicenter of the strike, likely killing him while leaving the rest unharmed. Arrows and swords become useless against your army, and exploding ballista bolts will kill one soldier each. Your ideal battle strategy becomes "sprint forward while unarmored and carrying heavy maces, crushing everything and everyone in your path while your people are invincible."
