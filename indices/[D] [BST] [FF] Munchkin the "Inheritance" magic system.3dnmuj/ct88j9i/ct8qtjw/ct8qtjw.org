Wards can be coded to do literally anything, bounded by the amount of energy the caster has, whether in their bodies, in the wards, or in a gem. Wards are basically just preset magic spells that activate under certain conditions. Sure, you can cast a spell that superheats all the air around an enemy, but there's no reason they couldn't also have a "keep temperatures bearable" spell that makes sure their environment doesn't get too hot or too cold. Plus, casting any sort of spell without first breaking into an enemy's mind will lead to mutually assured destruction anyways.
