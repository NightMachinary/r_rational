The ancient language is pretty well balanced, all told. All the obvious ways to munchkin would be immediatelly warded against by enemy mages, just look at how often Eragon's cheap, easy instant-death spells are succesful. The "nuclear catastrophe" spell is the biggest deal, and even it seems to require that you cast it only using your own body.
