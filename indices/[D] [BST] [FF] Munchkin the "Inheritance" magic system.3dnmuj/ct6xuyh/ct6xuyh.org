Do you mean the Eragon books? Because if so, I was literally about to post a rationalist discussion of that series. Crazy.

In the event that you were, I think something important to note is that the magic is cast by speaking exactly what you want to happen, and once a command is begun it cannot be cancelled. In this way, it seems that the source of magic is very similar to a computer executing commands, albeit through a natural language interface. Also of note is that it is stated that intent can bend the meaning of a word but cannot overrule it. For example, saying "fire" might produce anything from a fireball to a firebolt to a wave of flame, but saying the word "fire" and meaning "lightning" will produce fire instead of lightning.

Also, it's stated that one can imbue objects with magical energy to be drawn out later, creating a sort of battery. A rational character would not only store as much as he could into a repository like this each night (as magic power regenerates naturally) but could also use other people's energy, such as downed enemies or (as eragon actually did) slaughtered animals.

Edit: Also, a rationalist would probably try to find some use for the fact that the Ancient Language (that is, the language of Magic) is impossible to lie in. However, omissions, implications, and clever wording are permitted by the magic. Also, if memory serves, it was possible to say something like "I love you" to your worst enemy and be thinking of your wife, thus /technically/ telling the "truth" in a twisted sort of way.
