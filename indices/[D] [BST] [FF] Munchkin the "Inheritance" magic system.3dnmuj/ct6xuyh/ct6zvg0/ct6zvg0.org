It's not just that, though - there's an intent component to it as well, though it's secondary to the exact language components. If you accidentally cast a spell that says "set light to his face" when you meant "illuminate his face", it won't instantly crisp his face. It'll probably try to set his eyebrows on fire or something, so that his face is illuminated without being entirely immolated.
