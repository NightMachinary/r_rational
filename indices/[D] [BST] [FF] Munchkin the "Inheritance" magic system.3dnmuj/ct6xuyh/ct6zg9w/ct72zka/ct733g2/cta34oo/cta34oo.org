Responding to this entire comment chain, as I was a big fan of the books as a kid and the information regarding it's cockamanie magic system is still fresh in my mind.

1) There is no "magic" energy. Instead, living organisms produce a sort of "energy of life", which is used in daily living, and is used to fuel magic. This energy is replenished by resting, eating, and drinking. You can kill yourself through energy exhaustion from overcasting magic. The characters in-verse describe the "energy" thing as "it taking as much energy as it would take to do it by hand". Inherently magical creatures and creatures touched by magic in some way (Dragons and Elves for the former, Dragon Riders for the latter) tend to have a much larger "energy" storage capacity, which is reflected in their biology by reduced need to sleep and increase physical strength, speed, and longevity. This energy can be stolen by a powerful mage, but the technique is not taught until the magician's passive telepathic ability has expanded to the level of being able to sense the meager life energy of plants and insects, which tends to allow the development of a powerful empathy with living creatures.

2) "Energy" can be stored in gems. The finer the cut and more precious the gem, the more energy it can store. Gems are ranked in value by how much "energy" they can store by magical races, and non-magical races are basically copying them. No good explanation is given as to HOW the gems store energy. Energy in gems deteriorates at a rate dependent on the quality of cut, magical conductivity of the gem, and amount of "energy" already in the gem. Paradoxically, the more energy there is in a gem, the more slowly it discharges. This may be explainable by "energy" having attractive properties to other "energy", which might explain how a telepathic "energetic" link to something would enable you to steal "energy" from another living thing.

3) There is a LOT of leeway in word association. As insane as it may sound, apparently a mage can say "Water" and create a gemstone, because they see enough connection between water and a gem. Apparently, as long as it's sort of related, it can apparently be handwaved to function. So, yeah, it's actually possible to say "fire" and get lightning (because skyfire, or something, I dunno.)
