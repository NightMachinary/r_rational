Elves are plenty scary, and galbatorix is plenty sane (albiet not quite). The elves are just bound by their own code of ethics, and galbatorix is trying to effectively become a god via enslaving dragons and learning the name of the ancient language, he doesn't have the time to run a country. And he almost succeeded, too. The only reason he didn't is that dragon magic > regular magic, and he had royally pissed off literally hundreds of them enough to make them off him.

And a little bit of insanity is fine on galbatorix's part- his entire character backstory all relates to how losing his dragon really fucked him up.
