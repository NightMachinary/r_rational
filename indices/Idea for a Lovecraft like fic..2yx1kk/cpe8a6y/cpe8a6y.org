I was pondering just writing a rational!Carlos-driven Welcome To Night Vale. Lovecraft's mythos in general is sort of [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/11/the-phatic-and-the-anti-inductive/][anti-inductive]]---the more you try to solve it, the more it tries to kill you. The Night Vale spin on it strikes a nice balance, where the Lovecraftian stuff exists, but there seems to also be forces at work ("angels" et al) trying to protect people from it... by, oddly enough, using the powers of secrecy, privacy, cover-ups, delusions, etc.

It'd be fun to have a character who has to walk the line of trying to learn about the world, but knowing that broaching the masquerade would, /in and of itself/, be the Bad End. I imagine a lot of "I'm going to learn this thing in such a way so that I can do something useful with the information, and yet somehow forget the information I used to derive the conclusion"-like solutions to problems.

  realizing that there were powerful beings beyond human comprehension wouldn't really be that big a mental blow to a mostly rational character, surprising sure but not kill and eat your best friend disturbing like in Lovecraft.

I always figured that the people who do these things in Lovecraft's stories aren't going /insane/, per se, but are effectively seeing this as the rational thing to do in this situation: effectively, the Outer Gods are basilisks, and the more you find out about them, the more you think you need to subjugate your utility function to theirs to protect yourself from them. "Praying to a utility monster", so to speak. It seems like this is a trap that would be /more/ appealing to a rationalist, if they didn't already know specifically about this class of memetic hazards.
