I guess but frankly most of them go insane in a very "eating your friends" or "smashing your face against the wall until you die" kind of way, really that doesn't seem productive.

To me it never seemed anti-inductive because no one ever tries to figure it out once they see the monsters, the only person who ever even tries does a great job. The main character (not danforth) of "at The Mountains of Madness" realizes that the elder things are just aliens, people who are scientists like him.
