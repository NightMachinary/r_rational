Well, the concept of lovecraftian mythos is by its very nature somewhat lacking in conventional rationality. But that certainly doesn't mean that a rationalist character interacting with such a world wouldn't be entertaining. They might be perfectly fine at first when they think that they simply don't understand. Once they investigate further and start to realize that their puny causal 3D human brain CAN'T understand, then you get to play with the lovely thing that is their slow and steady descent into madness.

Or, you know, the cult could just be on LSD the whole time. Plot twist!
