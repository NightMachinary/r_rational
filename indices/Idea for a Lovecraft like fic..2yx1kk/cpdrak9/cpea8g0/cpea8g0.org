I was thinking that people in those stories seem to give up on the problem as soon as black guys show up, by the time monsters get there they are already eating their own poop. Maybe you can't understand them with your normal 3d brain, but there are spells that change that, and frankly I have never believed that any way. It seems like they have pretty obvious motivations if you are willing to take human ego out of the equation. Cthulu is taking a nap, narylotep is working as a messenger and occasionally likes to fuck with humans, it is possible that the other gods think of him the same way we think of people who tourer animals. In the context of the story I was thinking Yogsototh was actually using people as computing substrate and the reason they get smarter and magic is that he is upgrading and reinforcing the parts that he has.
