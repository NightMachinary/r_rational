I'd really love to read a rational Cosmic Horror story, actually, but Cosmic Horror - as a genre - is incredibly hard to do right.

(Although, to be fair, a lot of the best stuff dealing with Superintelligence borders on cosmic horror itself.)

It's not about tentacles that deal 3d6 SAN damage for looking at them, it's about ... black swans, I guess. Big, terrible Outside Context Problems with little possible resolution, and trying to cope with them. It's about when /cosmology itself/ is so bleak you can barely accept it, not just some minor torture-murders coming from an evil ghost or a werewolf.

I really like cosmic horror, is what I'm saying. Maybe I should write some cosmic horror.
