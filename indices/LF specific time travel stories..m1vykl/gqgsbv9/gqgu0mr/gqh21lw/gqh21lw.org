Purple days (game of thrones fanfiction)  Joffrey goes into time loop to stop apocalyptic end of the world.  It's average quality at best.

Time Braid:  excellent naruto fan fiction with some smut, it's highly recommended by people not bothered by the sometimes non consensual adult content.\\

From the Chinese web novels there is reverend insanity for those who don't mind a psychopath main character. This has really clever use of time travel mechanics and hundreds of thousands of words though it will never be finished due to the Chinese government.

And of course there is Mother of Learning one of my favorite fictions in any genre.  But chances are that everyone has read it by now, if they are interested. 

That's about all I've read, do you have any you would recommend?
