It used to be pretty popular subgenre, yes.

In more serious patriotic type of stories, MC helps in WW2, or tries to save USSR, depending on time period.

In more cracky stories, MC just enjoys the life f@cking classmates and being basically adult in a teen body he is very confident and smart.

The common trend here, typically none of MCs see any issue with stealing of intellectual property.

Travelled back to USSR in 60s driving your Toyota? You can reverse engineer A LOT from it.

Travelled to 70s? Write famous pop song hits 5 years before the author.

In 40? You can 'invent' AK 47.

I haven't read a lot of time travel stories of non russian authors, and don't know what trend will be there, if any.
