Doesn't hit most of that criteria, and is a fantasy setting, and the updates started slowing down, and now it hasn't been updated in over a year, but [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][A Hero's War]] is about an engineer MC thrown into a medieval fantasy land where he begins to uplift technology with steel production and standardizing measurements. But then magic is involved and he tries to objectify its rules and implement them into engineering as well. Big Bad is zombies who begin to counter eradication by somehow hive-minding.

A slightly side character with his side story is thrown into a different part of the world and takes the Become the Hero path, attempting to end slavery and other barbarisms. The two become aware of each other being from Earth, and begin communicating through letters.

The writing starts off pretty clunky but the uplift implementation was enjoyable for me, but like I said before, it's been dead for over a year now, right as things were really ramping up. At least as far as I know. I'll look into the author and see if he has another site he uses to discuss his works.
