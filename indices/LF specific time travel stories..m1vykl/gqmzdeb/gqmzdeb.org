It's not what I would call a rational fiction, but I really liked The Time Traveler's Wife. It a romance, in traditional sense, but maybe more impressive was the way it all hung together and the way it unfolded, considering the concept was a single non-branching timeliness that was unchangeable. The main character had a unusual genetic mutation that would randomly send him to points in the past or the future without his control, often to points of significance to him. He was trying as best he could to live as close to a normal life as possible despite that. He met his younger and older self several times, and met his wife in all different parts of her timeline; she met him long before he met her.
