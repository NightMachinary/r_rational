Adjacent to your request:

A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (modern man goes back to Camelot)

How to Invent Everything by Ryan North (how to restart civilization if your time machine breaks down)

Tom series by Stephen Matthews, (modern man wanders back to the Stone Age)

All you zombies, short story by Heinlein... closer to what you're looking for, and... odd, but excellent.

The Cookie Monster by Vernon Vinge is an almost but not quite, and still short enough to recommend.

Start with all you zombies though.

Edit: None of these are really fits though...
