[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset][Hard Reset]] - Twilight Sparkle (My Little Pony) attempts a new spell which doesn't appear to do anything.

She shortly finds out that she has a /save point/ - a moment in space-time that she goes back to every time she dies. Also, there's an army of changelings invading, and she's going to stop them if it kills her.

Which it is going to do.

/Frequently/.

(Has a couple of sequels as well)

For obvious reasons, not exactly real-world-ish.
