This is basically at the core of one recent Shonen Jump manga, "Time Paradox Ghostwriter". Sadly it wasn't very popular and got cut short, which in my opinion was a pity, since I actually liked it. But it still got wrapped up with a conclusive ending, at least. You might want to check it out, it's a short read.
