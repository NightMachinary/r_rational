Although read a lot of Heinlein, somehow missed this story before. Masterpiece of multilayer story with a bunch of inner jokes i've missed.

Sometimes there are layers of perception found in stories. Layer 1, character A did X, character B did Y. Layer 2, character A did X, but it was author's allusion to Z. This kind of layers.

Although the story is real good, I'm currently looking for smth more mundane.
