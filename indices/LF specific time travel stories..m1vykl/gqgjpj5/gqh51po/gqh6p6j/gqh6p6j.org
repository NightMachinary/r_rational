There's always someone learning about it for the first time.

Islands in the Stream of Time is another one similar to 1632, where a town gets sent back, IIRC. Haven't read it yet, but it's on my list. I love the books where modern day humans get sent back in time and bootstrap civilization forwards. Will try to think of some more.

And again, most of those I mentioned are... tangential to your original request. But I'll be interested to see what you think of All You Zombies. They made it into a movie (Predestination) which does a good job of capturing it. Just go in blind though, otherwise it spoils the ending.
