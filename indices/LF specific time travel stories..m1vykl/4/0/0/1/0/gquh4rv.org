it got censored for having themes that the government found questionable. I'm not sure exactly which ones but it is following a main character who despises being part of a group or society and that is a main theme of the novel. so it got to around 2600 chapters and then put on indefinite hiatus until approved by the government. the author has started a new very different novel that looks promising but im waiting until it is further along before diving into it
