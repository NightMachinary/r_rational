First off, let me say I disagree with the previous poster who said that these were not good fight scenes. I rather enjoy them, myself, they are more cerebral than the source material. If you watch the original work, it's a lot of cool, pointless effects for most of the fighting, followed by them pulling some 'trick', the opponent doing a new one, etc, etc, with as many times as is necessary until the final one as required by plot.

More important, I /like/ your Sasuke. This may not mean much to you, as I am but a random name on a message board, but I don't have near enough space to contain my sheer loathing of the original character. The one who created him admitted he was designed to be this "cold, proud genius" type character, but then he goes off and does the most retarded things whilst treating everyone like trash for absolutely no reason whatsoever. At least Sakura eventually realizes she keeps getting rescued and decides to get stronger to better empower the team. My basis for comparison for most terrible, poorly-written anime characters usually comes down to the level of saying "Well, at least he's not Sasuke!"

Yours? Yours I like. When he pisses someone off, it's not because he's being an ass for the sake of being an ass. It's because he's either trying to mess with their head so it throws them off their game in a fight or because he's trying to get them to slip up and reveal something secret. He tries to use the least effort to solve a problem or win a fight, not just because it is more efficient, but because it lets him further infuriate his foes into believing he's not really trying. And yet, should it be necessary or more effective to have a ridiculously ostentatious use of his power, I've no doubt he'd do that too if it was the best way to achieve his goal.

In short, yours is a far more believable and enjoyable character than the original.
