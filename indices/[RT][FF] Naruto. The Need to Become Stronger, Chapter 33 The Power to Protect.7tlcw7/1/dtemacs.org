It's probably my fanboy nature speaking, but I am sad to see Sasuke come across as sort of lame in his recent fights. There are a few things that contribute to this:

- The power levels are of various characters seem relatively balanced. That is, most of the ninja in the exam seem within a relatively narrow band of strength.

- The protagonists seem weaker (relative to their peers) than is typical of naruto fanfiction? (See the second phase of the exam.)

- Not much "cool" stuff. I'm not sure what's going on with this. Certainly it's related to the fact that Sasuke was running away for a bunch of his fight with Temari, and in both of his fights it looked like he was doing relatively simple stuff. It wasn't that visually interesting (in my imagination...) and not that clever seeming. Actually, of what we've seen in this round of the exam, only Sakura's performance struck me as /cool/ in the way I'm craving, and even still it wasn't the focus of the prose. It's hard to say what makes me less excited/impressed by the characters in this story, but part of it may be that few words are devoted to the specifics of the action in the combat scenes, leading the fights to seem pretty simple/straightforward. I imagine some of this is that you are going for realism. (I'll say this a lot in this comment, but all of the fights against Haku were great.) There is a little bit of the "taking turns" dynamic in some of the fights, which is less exciting and slows down the pace.

- Also, minor, but it doesn't really seem like he got too much mileage out of getting info from Hinata, as he was surprised several times by Neji. Maybe talking with Hinata inspired Sasuke to use that darkness jutsu at the end? (Speaking of which, it is not clear to me why he didn't use this much earlier on. Did Neji make some mistake in the darkness that he wouldn't have made if he were less triggered emotionally? Was Sasuke hoping to avoid using that technique, only to end up pulling it out when the match was harder than expected, or when Neji finally got to him?)

- I'm holding out hope that Sasuke is hiding some stuff, and his true strength is a bit higher than what's been demonstrated.

I will say, as much as I was a bit disappointed with the fight, I think you did a great job with Sakura in this chapter, in a way that deepened their relationship and made me much more interested in it. It felt less like a silly crush and more like something truly important to a mature, 3-d human. It's hard to tell from Hinata's behavior in this chapter whether she's gained any confidence through Sasuke's sharingan. She spoke up, but in a relatively timid manner, and, given that different authors have different interpretations of her character, it's hard to tell whether this is supposed to come across as unusual for her.

For some reason I'm not resonating as much with Naruto's motivation here as I was with the philosophical tension between Naruto/Haku and Sasuke/Haku in the Waves arc. I'm not sure what's going on there, but it may just be that the conflict hasn't hit its climax yet. I'd have to do a re-read to see whether I already felt a deep resonance at the comparable point in that arc.

In other news, the tournament bracket is really tripping me up. Since in many ways this story has stayed close to what has happened in canon, and even if that weren't the case, Naruto v Gaara is the natural point of climax for this arc, so I am expecting something big to happen when they fight. (Wondering how much to read into the exact phrasing of "A rationalist /rewrite/ of Naruto" (as seen on the tagline) as opposed to "interpretation" or "fanfic".) Again, fanboy-ing, but it makes me sad to think Sasuke may not have another moment to shine in the tournament.

In any case, I am truly loving this story. It's my favorite fic currently updating, and I feel super lucky that it updates as often as it does.
