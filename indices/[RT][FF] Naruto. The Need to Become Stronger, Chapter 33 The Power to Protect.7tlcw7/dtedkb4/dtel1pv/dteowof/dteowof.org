There's been a dozen references to Tsunade being in town and yet everyone keeps mentioning this, so it's probably a common issue :p

Same for the darkness technique, by the way: I had intended for that to be this big mystery that would keep the audience guessing as to how it worked and what it meant for the identity of the Enemy, and yet every time it shows up people respond like they've never seen it before. It's been used in the Prologue, Sasuke vs Haku, when Zabuza gets resqued, by Itachi vs the Mizukage, and now again by Sasuke - and that's not counting all the other times it was discussed or hinted at!

The lesson I take away from this is that when it comes to writing serials/fanfiction, I should always take the time to remind the audience of what happened by having the characters briefly reflect on it.
