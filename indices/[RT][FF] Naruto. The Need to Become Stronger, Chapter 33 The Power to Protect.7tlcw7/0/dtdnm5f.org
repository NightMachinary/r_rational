I like it. Too many stories try to hammer home the point that quick wits can overcome strength: but they always tend to ignore the fact that it is possible to be overwhelmingly strong. Sometimes the smartest decision is just to become stronger.

I do wish Shino had won his fight though. Rational Aburame seem broken powerful, hindered only by how many bugs they can bring into combat at once. If they ever figured out how to somehow carry bugs in seals they would be ridiculously strong.
