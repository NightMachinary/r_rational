I felt the same way at first, but it really depends on the specifics: How fast are the bugs, exactly? If they're too slow, then the enemy can just outrun them. Sure, you can spread them out over a large area to make them impossible to dodge (as canon showed), but then the enemy can just run through them and only a few will stick. And you might get the windshield effect where they just die on impact, given the insane speed at which ninjas move.

Also, area effect techniques like the ones Temari or Sasuke use would be brutally effective against them - explosive tags work well too. So I really see the Aburame as specialists who are incredibly effective when they are in a support role, but can be negated fairly easily with the right counter.

(Carrying bugs in seals does not work because they have chakra - being able to seal chakra by itself would already be extremely powerful)
