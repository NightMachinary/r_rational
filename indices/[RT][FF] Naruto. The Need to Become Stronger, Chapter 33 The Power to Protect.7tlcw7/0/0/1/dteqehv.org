luls this post just made me realize that a lot of the Aburame weaknesses are countered by them living in the forest. The dense vegetation provides perfect cover for their bugs, the trees means enemies can't simply sprint in straight lines but must slow down (even for an instant) to turn, and the forest acts as natural barriers for any AoE attacks except for fire (and the Aburame just happened to ally themselves with the largest group of fire users in world)...

Perhaps more than any other clan, the Aburame made the smartest decision why they chose to join with Konoha, rather than the other villages. The other clans could have done well pretty much anywhere, but the Aburame managed to settle in the one place where they would do best.
