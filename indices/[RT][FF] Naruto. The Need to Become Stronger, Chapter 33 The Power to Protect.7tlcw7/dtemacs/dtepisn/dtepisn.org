Wow, long comment! Nice!

#+begin_quote
  It's hard to say what makes me less excited/impressed by the characters in this story, but part of it may be that few words are devoted to the specifics of the action in the combat scenes, leading the fights to seem pretty simple/straightforward. I imagine some of this is that you are going for realism.

Ooh, that's not good, since I thought these fight scenes were really good, but thanks for telling me. Yes, I very definitely try to keep things realistic, and this has a huge impact on how these scenes go. I spend ages thinking everything through from the perspective of both sides, writing overviews of their respective abilities and figuring out what I would do in their situation - and for a lot of cool stuff, I just think I would just never actually try that in real life. The simplest solution is usually the best and cleverness will get you killed, as Kakashi keeps explaining to his team. It's one of the big lessons of NTBS that is supposed to contrast with HPMOR.

That said, with the fight in Haku I went to great lengths to put them in a situation where cleverness would be justified by A) making the situation sufficiently desperate, B) making it so that Haku doesn't just teleport away, C) have Naruto/Sasuke be stubborn enough to fight him in the first place. The whole setup took ages to work out, and I can see why most writers don't bother.

This is also why Naruto has to be kind of irrational in this regard: You just don't get epic fight scenes unless you have a main character who keeps getting himself in desperate situations!

  I'm holding out hope that Sasuke is hiding some stuff, and his true strength is a bit higher than what's been demonstrated.

I don't want to spoil my own story, but it should be clear at this point that Sasuke is planning /something/. You already had the scene with Hinata where he learns everything he can about Neji and uses genjutsu on her, then when next you see him he is very deliberately taunting Neji in the stands (the only reason he has that conversation with Naruto is because he knows Neji is reading their lips). Then there are the hints in this chapter:

#+begin_quote
  “Sage's Sacred Tools...” Tenten's hands went to her mouth. “Neji's /destroying/ him.”

  /No,/ thought Sakura. /You're only looking at the facts, but you should look at his eyes. The truth is always in his eyes.../

  Neji came charging forward once again, and this time Sasuke body-flickered away -- only for Neji to body-flicker after him and send him crashing to the ground with another burst of invisible force.

  And yet, somehow, Sasuke still thought he was winning. No, more than that, it was like he was not looking at Neji at all...

  Neji lunged at him with one hand, and Sasuke raised his right arm to block in reflex, but the limb shuddered upon contact and fell lifelessly to Sasuke's side. For one second Sasuke's eyes widened in panic, but then he turned his body and blocked Neji's next attack with his right shoulder instead, which slumped as well.

  On the surface, Sasuke's face was slack. His right arm was numb, his body torn and bloody, but his eyes... his eyes were like she had only seen them once before; right before Sasuke had fought Haku back in the ice and snow, right after he had seen Naruto fall. His left hand was shaking ever so slightly.
#+end_quote

The whole thing is written from Sakura's perspective instead of Sasuke's, which should already be cause for suspicion, but even she is not fooled in the slightest. It's /Neji/ she's worried about, even as he appears to be destroying Sasuke in front of the whole audience. This is also supposed to show that despite the worries she expresses at the start, she /does/ in fact know him pretty well.

#+begin_quote
  I think you did a great job with Sakura in this chapter, in a way that deepened their relationship and made me much more interested in it. It's hard to tell from Hinata's behavior in this chapter whether she's gained any confidence through Sasuke's sharingan.
#+end_quote

Good to know!

#+begin_quote
  For some reason I'm not resonating as much with Naruto's motivation here as I was with the philosophical tension between Naruto/Haku and Sasuke/Haku in the Waves arc. I'm not sure what's going on there, but it may just be that the conflict hasn't hit its climax yet. I'd have to do a re-read to see whether I already felt a deep resonance at the comparable point in that arc.
#+end_quote

I'd be curious to hear it! Either way, I think you should like the next chapter :)

#+begin_quote
  Again, fanboy-ing, but it makes me sad to think Sasuke may not have another moment to shine in the tournament.
#+end_quote

This is mainly because of my re-imagination of him as a rationalist character. Canon!Sasuke has his whole family murdered by the strongest shinobi ever, and his answer is... to go after him by himself, refusing any help whatsoever. NTBS Sasuke is smart, and comes to a very different conclusion - one that lends less to him being an epic warrior, and more to what you're seeing here.
