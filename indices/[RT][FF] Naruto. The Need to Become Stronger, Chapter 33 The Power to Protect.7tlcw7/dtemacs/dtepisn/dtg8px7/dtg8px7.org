In the Chunin exams, ninja should be displaying their skills even if that specific skill is a suboptimal fighting strategy. This is mitigated when the contestants are actually trying to kill each other, but for example Naruto and Sakura could afford to use flashier moves to show off all the jutsu they know because they mutually know that they aren't trying to kill each other. Like, you could dodge, or you could show your mastery of water techniques by slicing that incoming boulder in half.
