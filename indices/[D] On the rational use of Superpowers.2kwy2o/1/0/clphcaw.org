I guess this is probably the big point, and I see now that it might be hard to reconcile when it seems to be a point of view problem. I feel like things such as textiles or cars, the internet are all things that have been a paradigm shift in how humans operate day to day. But all these things are still under our control... supposedly. We all collectively decide to adopt or not adopt new technology. But a godlike entity removes that control and now we are essentially puppets dancing to one persons tune, which doesn't sit right with me.

As to the last thing I'm not looking for sympathy here I really would like for someone to come up with an argument I can accept and I hope I can be open minded enough to do so. I've been thinking on and off about what I would do with powers for a long time and I've never been able to come to any conclusion but the one of inaction to preserve humanity. I guess in some ways maybe I'm just afraid of change? But at the same time I feel like I do have a legitimate point here about a single person having that much say over human development.
