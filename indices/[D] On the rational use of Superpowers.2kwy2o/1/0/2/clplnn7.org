You could, I dunno, /ask/ people if you should feed them or let them starve to death. Same for curing malaria and cancer and ebola and sleeping sickness, and getting rid of debilitating prenatal conditions, and so forth.

There are some problems where it's so important to solve them, we don't care who solves them. When people are dying, I want the problem solved. I don't care whether anyone gets the pleasure of coming up with the answer themselves. I don't care if space aliens or the left ventricle of God provides the fix.

For everything else, I rather agree -- keep powerful non-human beings out of our lives.
