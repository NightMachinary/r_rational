Ehh...

It depends on how much power is meant by 'essentially omnipotent'. In any case, thinking about what to do would be the first point on my list, but I strongly doubt my end conclusion would be 'do essentially nothing'. The world we have now is not perfect.

One of the first things to do if the powers allow it to be done safely is to increase my own intelligence, in order to be better able to gauge what else needs doing. But maybe that's not possible safely, that is, without risking accidentally making myself insane or dead.

But, to take a low-end example from you, 'curing diseases' would seem like a good thing to do. Sure, it has some negative consequences. Health care systems are needed less, people lose jobs and so on. But that's nowhere near the magnitude of millions of people dying to diseases. Or you could just cure all diseases that current medicine cannot cure. I hardly expect the losses to medical research funding are worth all the suffering caused by the status quo. Of course, it's better if 'cure diseases' means 'create a formula for a cure that people can easily manufacture and administer' rather than 'touch sick people and they're suddenly healthy', because the latter is much more reliant on me personally and more difficult to study and replicate.

Then there's 'end world hunger'. How do you achieve this? Invent and implement massively more efficient system for producing and transporting food? Seems like a good thing to me overall.

It is difficult to think of things to do that are unquestionably good and have no negative consequences whatsoever, but it seems to me to be much easier to think of things to do that have positive consequences that outweigh the negative ones.
