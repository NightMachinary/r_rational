I don't want to put any limits on what I mean by "essentially omnipotent", so if you want to alter reality to make it so hunger doesn't even exist feel free, but know that by doing so you've essentially genocided(apparently not a word?) the current human race by doing so, that sort of thing.

As far as the 'create a formula for a cure that people can easily manufacture and administer' that's the sort of short term stuff that I feel people don't think through. Sure now they can reproduce it, and probably even understand why it works. But say that you keep providing these cures for every new disease that pops up. Pretty soon people will stop bothering to do research and they will rely on you to prevent them from all dying from the next super plague that pops up.

I don't think this would happen immediately or anything, I'm talking on the scale of thousands/millions/billions of years here. I mean eventually even a god would get bored of looking over one planet and suddenly humanity is left completely vulnerable to the next diseases that rolls along.

I guess my problem is exactly why you don't have one... I'm thinking any negative impacts would just snowball as time progressed and eventually without your influence we would fall apart. And at the point that we rely so much on a single person are we really able to call ourselves humanity or are we just a single persons vision of humanity that he has shaped? And what have we lost in that process, I feel like doing things like stopping world hunger are far less valuable than allowing humanity to naturally develop and mitigate those problems on their own... I think I'm just arguing for the Prime Directive at this point only for a superhuman instead of a Star Fleet.
