Yes, it's true that our actions have long-term consequences that we can't foresee. We're living in a time of extremely rapid change, world-changing inventions are appearing literally every year. It is already impossible for me to say what the world will be like in fifty years. I cannot attempt to make decisions based only on the long-term consequences, because things will have changed so much by the time the long-term arrives that my motivations will be obsolete.

You wish to keep the world as it is, to avoid decisions that will have unplanned long-term consequences. Now, maintaining the status quo is a valid philosophy. The way we're doing things at the moment has its problems, but we haven't actually destroyed the world yet. Any other way of doing things does not have this guarantee, its consequences have not been seen in the real world. Resist all change, avoid all conflict, because that change might eventually result in the extinction of humanity? I have my objections to that, but it would work.

The problem is that "don't change the world" and "don't let the world change" aren't the same. As I said, the world is already changing. In order to keep the world as it is, you need to halt that change. Suppress new technologies and new ideologies, that sort of thing. Because if you did do essentially nothing, if you let human history take its course... how do you know that "history's course" doesn't end in 2017 with a nuclear war?

Everything we do has long-term consequences. Everything everyone else does also has long-term consequences. It's all too much to keep track of, too much to predict. All we can do is do what we think is best right now, and deal with the crises if and when they come.

(... then again, you might not be getting an unbiased view, coming to a subreddit full of transhumanists and singularity-lovers and arguing that humanity is fine as it is.)

Edit: In response to your question, I'd like to terraform a few planets and spread humanity out a bit. More natural resources to go around, and nations that hate their neighbours can just move out.
