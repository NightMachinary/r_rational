  Curing diseases would probably cripple modern health care systems by making it essentially obsolete
#+end_quote

How is this a problem? Use your godlike powers to become immortal and just keep on curing diseases. Or if you worry that you'd get bored, create a race of ethereal, non-sentient (to avoid moral complications) guardian angels that will attach to each human and protect them from disease and trauma.

  I think the world hunger thing is obvious with the majority of the world involved in farming you would cripple countless peoples livelihood.
#+end_quote

If I solve hunger, farmers won't be able to get jobs. They won't starve, either. They might have to sell their farms and find new jobs in order to stay clothed and so forth. I'm sobbing indeed.

Or here's a thought: take over /all/ production. Give everyone a desktop nano-assembler, restricted (with your godlike powers) from creating anything terribly dangerous. Now tons of people are out of jobs. You replace all governments with your godlike powers and restrict capitalism to a safe sandbox. People earn money for living, and they can earn more for serving others and for creative output. Personally, I'd adjust it so that a typical person has to work no more than ten years of 30-hour weeks to retire at a normal standard of living.

If you want a more moderate solution, everyone has access to piles of soylent or some other not-very-flavorful nutrient source. (Again, you create a race of soylent angels to create and distribute it.) Farmed food is a luxury good, as are spices.

  Any action you could take as an individual would never be as helpful as actually developing the systematic methods that regular people could use to sustain those actions over the long term.
#+end_quote

Because you're focused on keeping all the power in yourself rather than spreading it out into self-sustaining systems that will go on independent of your existence.

  Only the impending doom of all of humanity would be a good reason to act decisively in our interests, anything else would just hurt us in the long term.

Scale that down to an individual level. How well does that work? Terribly. I refuse to engage in any charity unless it saves people's lives from their deathbeds. Preventative measures? Pah. Improving standards of living from kill-me-now to I-can-actually-tolerate-this? Weak-minded liberal nonsense. There's a disease going around that makes people's limbs drop off? Not worth bothering me about. A cure for HIV if I just donate my pocket change? Forget about it; HIV doesn't kill you, it just weakens you so much that the sniffles would kill you. Lead paint in the milk? Sure, feed it to the children.

Yeah, no.
