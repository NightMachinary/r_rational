I do think that there are some valid arguments for Superman only using his powers in ways that are very limited - I just think that the arguments on the other side are much, much stronger. It's obviously not ideal for a single man to have the power to utterly destroy humanity, or to otherwise determine its course, but the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. And it's not like Superman would have to make all of his decisions completely alone - he could have a council of advisors and scientists to both help him make use of his powers and ensure that humanity has a say.

(I have, in fact, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][written a novel-length fanfic]] about this very subject.)

  We all collectively decide to adopt or not adopt new technology.

I think this is what I most disagree with, because I don't believe that this is the general pattern of change as it happens. To take the ur-example of the power loom, the decision was made by factory owners, had its most major impact on the textile artisans, and the purchasers of those textiles continued to buy what was cheapest. I wouldn't say that anyone really made the decision to use power looms - they were just cheaper at what they did, and consequently killed an industry, without any one person really having that much say in the matter. And if there were people who said "No, the old ways are best, I'm going to keep my artisans" they were pushed aside by the fact that no one really cared about the artisans - they only cared about costs. The same thing gets repeated over and over, especially in the realm of industry where these decisions are made by relatively few people and affect a relatively large number of workers. If tomorrow McDonalds replaces all of its fast food workers with automated systems, it won't be because of a conscious desire to adopt new technology, it will merely be a result of market forces - something that no one really decided on but ended up happening anyway. People lose their jobs, they rally against the change, but efficiency wins out.
