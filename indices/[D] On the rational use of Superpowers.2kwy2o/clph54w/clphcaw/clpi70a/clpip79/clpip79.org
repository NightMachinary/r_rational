I'm glad you brought up the advisor thing because that's probably the best/only solution to this problem. I feel like you still run into the problem of which collective subset of people could be trusted to make decisions like that... but that's the case in modern day anyway so probably not much can be done to mitigate that.

Also when I saw "we all collectively..." I was actually trying to say exactly what you just did. That "we" decide to adopt things based on their perceived value, and what "we" as humanity value, instead of basing decisions on one person's values. Having a single person make those decisions is bad even if the effects are "good"... I guess I value the sort of unconscious collective direction we have as a whole rather than a guided plan, since once you've planned something you remove the possibilities to grow beyond that plan in a way. The last thing I want is for humanity to seal off potential futures just because someone came from on high and decided we all needed to be space faring robots or what not. Not that I have a problem with it if humanity naturally takes that path, just like I don't have a problem with McDonalds replacing all their workers with robots, because thats a consequence of human development as a whole even if it is kind of shitty for some people.
