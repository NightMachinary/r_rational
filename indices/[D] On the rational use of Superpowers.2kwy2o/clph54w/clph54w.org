I don't think the mere fact that something is disruptive to the current order is a reason not to do it. Power looms put hundreds of textile artisans out of business, but I don't think you're too likely to find anyone that says that the invention and production of the power loom was a bad thing.

So yes, the existence of a godlike entity would fundamentally alter human society - I agree with that - but I don't think that the negatives of this would outweigh the positives if done correctly. And in fact, I feel that humanity is fundamentally altering itself with every passing year, and in most ways is becoming fundamentally better (lower crime rates, less war, happier people). Humanity has been radically changed in the last two or three hundred years, and on the whole these changes have not convinced me to be wary of change for the sake of being wary of change.

(I also don't think that you'll get much sympathy in what is largely a community of transhumanists clamoring for brain uploading, artificial intelligence, and eternal life.)
