  you are now fundamentally changing human culture/nature, or what it means to be human. Is it worth it to save something if by saving it you've essentially destroyed what defines that thing?

My feeble human body does not define me. The fact that scarcity forces me to work for a living does not define me. Improving these things will not "destroy me."

In fact, why are you equating change with destruction? Curing someone of cancer CHANGES THEM IRREVERSIBLY but it doesn't DESTROY THEIR FUNDAMENTAL NATURE. Changes are just that- changes. Which is a different thing from destruction.

As others have already pointed out, 'human nature' is ALREADY a constantly changing thing. The status quo of human society is the same way. Except right now, they're being changed by arbitrary market forces and sociological pressures. I find it very difficult to see an active hand of a sympathetic god to be a step down from that.

So my answer goes more like this: Give all humans complete immunity to injury and illness, deactivate aging past physical prime unless they want to keep aging. Make all sleep and eating completely optional, recreational activities. Create a simple way of signaling for my attention to wish for things- a universal prayer- and a list of prayers I will and won't grant. Automate this process by creating AIs based around my own mind that are built to enjoy the task of granting prayers without ever getting bored or discontented and granting those AIs sufficient shards of my own power.

Then terraform Mars, tell humanity to "fetch the garden world" and go traveling through the galaxy for fun.
