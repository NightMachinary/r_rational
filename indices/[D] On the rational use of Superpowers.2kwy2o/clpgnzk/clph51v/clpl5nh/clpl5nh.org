The Prime Directive is a conclusion. What's the reasoning behind it?

In Star Trek, it seems to have been a response to colonialism. Better to let planetfuls of people die than to force them into our mold, erase their cultural identity, et cetera. And better not to give them the option of taking some of our technological artifacts to improve their lives on their own terms, rather than treating them like adults.

Your reasoning seems to be that some amount of egregious death and suffering is required for human existence to be worthwhile, and you don't want to cross that line. Instead of trying to narrow down where that line might be, carefully trimming away at the worst parts of our lives, you'd rather let everyone suffer and die.

It's better to do nothing than to do something if you have no confidence that that something is a good idea. However, that's the worst non-terrible thing you can do. In this case, it seems like you're doing nothing so you can avoid thinking about the problem, gathering some information, and considering the effects of possible actions.
