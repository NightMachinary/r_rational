  IN FACT: While I was working on Antimemetics Division Tales, author DreamwalkerFae had the idea that there could be a second Antimemetics Division in the Foundation right now, with neither division aware of the other one. DreamwalkerFae's version is called the Counterconceptual Division. SCP-2358 by DreamwalkerFae and SCP-2111 by sirpudding both contain references to the CCD. Where does all of this go next? Well... anywhere... "
