Hi! Constructive feedback is always welcome! I can't always respond, but I do generally read it.

I can address some of these without spoilers. As always, it's up to y'all whether they're satisfactory. The answers may get clearer in later chapters.

1. Clementine is *really* old-school military, from the era before projection was known to the public. She barely viewed Ana as a person, much less a threat.

2. Ana is practicing her Vocation off-screen. While she can blind people and create noises, she can't create the sort of lasting pain and stunning effect of a flashbang.

3. Executed prisoners often get their bodies confiscated by the state. There were logistical reasons Ana couldn't take Kaplen's body, and she has a lot of negative feelings about taking other people's bodies. Creating fabricated bodies and mind-spheres are projection techniques, and as such are blocked from Praxis vocations by Rashi's Third Law.

Thanks for reading!
