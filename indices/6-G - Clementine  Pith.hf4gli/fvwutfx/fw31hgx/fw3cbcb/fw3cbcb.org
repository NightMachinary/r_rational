I'm expecting a bunch of fighting in future chapters, and I know you've probably done a ton of research already, but my conclusions were based off stuff like this from "old school military": [[https://youtu.be/NgWdv081oqQ]]

As an aside, if there are explanations for things that an outside observer would want happening but can't, it would be useful to have the characters deliberate them, even in their own flawed ways. Even if something is impossible, we still spend our mind pining for it, and the more desperate people are, the more they would lend themselves to those flights. I know it might make the pacing different from what you might like, but it really helps sell that these are characters fumbling their way through an unforgiving universe as best they can. The practical guide, for example, is a great reference to look into.

Ultimately, I love the style that's uniquely yours, and I hope my suggestion can help shape the story to bring out more of that uniqueness :)
