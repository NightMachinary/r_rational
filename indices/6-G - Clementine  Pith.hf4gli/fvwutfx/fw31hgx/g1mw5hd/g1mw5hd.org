Correct me if I'm wrong about this, but in addition to what you said, I get the impression that she doesn't blind people because it would immediately alert the target (and, maybe more importantly, their teammates!) to the fact that there's a Whisper vocation projector influencing them, and most trained projectors seem to have ways to deal with that. So her goal is generally to use illusions in such a way that someone doesn't recognize that they're illusions.
