[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/life-ore-death-dc-feruchemy-young-justice.35443/][Life Ore Death]] is a great quasi-self-insert. It handles as a typical self-insert, but avoids all the typical downsides by making the insert an OC.

MC is Renka, a Feruchemist from the Mistborn Triology. It starts after said triology, so it contains a lot of spoilers. Even the beginning may be considered a spoiler, so I'll keep it vague beyond there being in-universe reasons for how it happens. Young Justice side is very similar to With This Ring/Assimilation etc, where she becomes a member of the team and they do missions together.

What I especially like are the character interactions and the reasoning behind how things unfold. The reason for the typical adult insert to team up with the teenagers is often very flimsy, but it is quite nice here. Renka's influence also feels more natural than the typical meta-knowledge influenced hypercompetence or "solving" of plot-hole related issues. She is also not as game-breakingly overpowered as others are, but actually part of the team.
