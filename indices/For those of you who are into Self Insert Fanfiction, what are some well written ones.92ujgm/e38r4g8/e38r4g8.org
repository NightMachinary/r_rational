  The first thing and only thing I will do is survive.

That makes sense, just make sure you don't knock things off the rails and destroy the world or something. I'm not familiar with Naruto, which you seem to prefer, but the two backgrounds I'm most familiar with, Harry Potter and Worm, butterflying the story at all is likely to lead to Bad Things.

So survival doesn't necessarily mean power, in those stories it means getting the heck outta Dodge and avoiding interacting with anyone in the story. If you can move to Australia and get an innocuous job where you don't matter to anyone outside Black Stump Corners, do it.
