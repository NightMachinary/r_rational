I've played/DMed a fair bit of D&D, and also a few other roleplaying games, but never touched 3.x at all. Nevertheless I really enjoyed HPd20 and am currently reading new chapters as they come out, years after I first found it. On the other hand, I wasn't able to read much of 2YE before getting bored and the second attempt I made to read it didn't even get that far. I'd rate 2YE as significantly less good than HPd20.
