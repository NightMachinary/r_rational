In a nutshell, it's about a guy getting summoned to a D&D world to lead the country for two years. It's a rules-as-written world and the protagonist wastes no time optimizing things. It moves fast because the power levels scale fast, and the threats scale at the same time so the protagonist still faces struggle even as he abuses the rules of the world to their breaking point.
