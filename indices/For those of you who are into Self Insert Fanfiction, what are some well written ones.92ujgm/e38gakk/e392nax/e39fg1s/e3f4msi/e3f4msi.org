What bad choices would you say Jake made? I'd like to be able to improve for the next time around.

As to the science, which parts in particular did you think were bad? It's been a while since I wrote it, and the only specifically science-based thing I can think of offhand was the steam cannons. I did a lot of math before writing that section to convince myself that it worked, but it was later pointed out to me that I got it wrong. I patched the idea by saying that Loki had caused a very quiet miracle in order to make them work, as part of his effort to help keep his catspaw (Jake) in power. I even had Loki explicitly call out the mistake in the text, and then he got annoyed with Jake and said he would stop making them work, so Jake replaced the steam cannons with a magical solution based on Shrink Object.

(Oh, wait, there was another math error: I miscalculated how big the explosion would be when Isaac used Polymorph Any Object to create antimatter. I had it as something like 6kg when it should have been 6g. I promptly fixed that with a quick revision.)
