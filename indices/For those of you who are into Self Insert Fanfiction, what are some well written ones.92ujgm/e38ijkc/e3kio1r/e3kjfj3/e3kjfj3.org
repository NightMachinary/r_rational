Skip that whole section. There's nothing of value lost by doing so. It's an April fool's section, and I definitely don't recall it ever being referenced anytime later.

In a way, this is definitely like actual comics where crazy stuff happens that you just need to ignore.

I'm glad you're enjoying it. Btw, MrZoat made a new thread because the old one is too big. Just be aware of that when you catch up.
