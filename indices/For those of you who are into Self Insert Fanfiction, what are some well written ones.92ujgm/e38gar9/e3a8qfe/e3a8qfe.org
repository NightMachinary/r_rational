I actually just came across this in the past few days and caught up.

It doesn't really have much to do with rationality. The SI is rather OP, frequently beating opponents that should by rights trounce her, and this is partially but not fully excused by being a reincarnate and thus more mature than your average child soldier. Also, it follows the stations of canon rather too strongly, to the point of sometimes seeming implausible.

That said, I did enjoy reading it, but not as a rational story; rather, it's more of a worldbuilding exercise, exploring what a character in the Naruto world, with a sprinkling of metaknowledge, could do. Marked as a follow, but not a favorite.
