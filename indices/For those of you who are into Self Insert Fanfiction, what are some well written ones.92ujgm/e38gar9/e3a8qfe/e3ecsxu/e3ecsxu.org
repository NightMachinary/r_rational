I love DoS, but at this point it feels like the characters in it are being deliberately blind to how implausible their luck is. I mean, they've definitely /noticed,/ but they just don't think about it. It's the kind of story where, much like canon, a handful of characters always run into interesting main-plotline situations and come out on top even when they ought to have been completely outclassed. It's a story where, like the sort-of-canon anime fillers, you could run into some wacky group of noodle ninjas who have no reason to exist and are never spoken of again. There is no way in hell that any of this is a coincidence and in a more rational fanfic /that would be a much bigger deal./
