I don't really counts as a failing of the genre (I have opinions :rm: on it as a point in general, but that's not really relevant so I'll be avoiding that). At worst, it's a failing of japanese media in general, and isn't a standard part of the usual garbage isekai. What I'm referring to is:

The reason for transportation. In most isekai, this is either handwaved entirely, or happens as a result of a godlike being that appears out of nowhere and we never see again, usually with no real reason for their actions. Youjo Senki has neither.

The implausible, nonsensical world the protagonist is isekaid into. Take a look at, I dunno death march rhapsody or whatever; the world they enter is unfailingly a giant mess of plot convenience. In Youjo Senki, The author put a lot of effort. If you take a look at his "works cited" and suggested historical info, he put a lot of work into making a time appropriate political scene, and it really shows (So does his status as a victoria 2 fan, but honestly paradox games are pretty good about that whole thing as well).

An interesting setting. Most isekai are very, very bland power fantasies. Even without all the work the author put into their setting, having it in 20th century not!europe is already a huge improvement.

Characters having intelligence that matches their described intelligence. Unlike the standard isekai, Tanya's intelligence is a shown trait rather than just informed, and better yet this "actual intelligence" isn't limited to her either

-Adding on to this, as a character she's not bland black haired mc #1256, which can end my interest in a work so fastfart.
