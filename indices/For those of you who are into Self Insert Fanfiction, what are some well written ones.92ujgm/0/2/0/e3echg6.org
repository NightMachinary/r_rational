Not quite. For example, think about the protagonist of Worth the Candle, which is explicitly [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6n72wq/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_1/]["a self-insert litRPG portal fantasy"]]. Juniper has an unusual personality and an elaborate, plot-relevant backstory. /Not/ a generic protagonist. (I know it's not technically fanfiction, but I think the fanfic/original dimension isn't very relevant here.)

For what it's worth I've always seen "self-insert" used to describe characters who are actually based on the author.
