I found this Dragon Age self-insert to be entertaining. The character enters the video game world from our reality, but has no prior knowledge of the game world when she arrives. IIRC they play it off like a parallel universe with no mention of it being a video game in her home universe.

And Sequel:

Despite knowing nothing of the world she's arrived in, she does get swept up in the game plot. But she spends a humorous amount of time complaining about missing creature comforts like flush toilets and hot showers, and working to 'invent' those things and trying to force her new world to adopt them so they become widespread.
