I think any story with explicit scenes where the main character can be described as "obsessed about sex" would qualify, but I did stop reading there. It's possible that the hyperfocus on sex tapers off later and I just didn't get that far, but I'd have mentioned it purely for those opening chapters if that was the case.

I mean, I don't have anything against explicit stories - I read a few myself - I just think it's worth letting people know what they're in for.
