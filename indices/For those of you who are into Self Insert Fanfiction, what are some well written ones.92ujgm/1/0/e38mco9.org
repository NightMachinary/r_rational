I'd second this one. I knew one of the source series ("Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?"), but not the other ("My youth romantic comedy is wrong, as expected"). I felt like I missed a lot of the protagonist's internal referencesearly on and it took a good while to get used to how he thinks to himself, but I was pleased to find that not only is there a narrative reason for how he behaves, it also shows what happens when he can't deal with his life or issues and breaks. The protagonist is OP, but not invincible, and a lot of his issues stem from his incompatible wishes to both return to the real world, and to stay in the isekai world and keep his new friends safe and successful. The fic is complete, but it doesn't resolve the main plot; it very much ends in a way that leaves space for a follow-up.
