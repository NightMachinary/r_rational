Youjo Senki / A Young Woman's Military Record is a great, well, not quite self insert but still a modern person isekai that avoids almost all of the failings of the genre. It's not rational, but I would definitally consider it rational adjacent? I especially liked how the MC didn't end up beleiving Being X's tripe. It also has one really good fanfic once you've seen the original, which is an SI in the same vein as the Og story: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13002064/1/A-Young-Woman-s-Political-Record]]

All the mechanics are accurate to canon (no bad fanon here), and in addition to being one of the best nasu gurus fallacies is a talented writer. Great if you enjoy any of Nasus work, but seems to be on hiatus for now.

There's also just isekai / Isekai Tensai as a genre, which is sorta what your talking about, but almost all isekai are, well, bad. Aside from Youjo Senki, the only two I can unironically reccomend are Overlord and Konosuba, but even those aren't /great/. Overlord is “What if your standard bad isekai was written by an excellent author,” and Konosuba is “What if we were aware that yes, this kind of isekai is trash, and played it for laughs;” Its not any more rational than standard isekai, but it doesnt try to pretend it is or take itself seriously which makes it much better than normal.

There was also one Attack on Titan SI I liked, but I can't seem to find it, and 2 year emperor, which is linked elsewhere on this page.
