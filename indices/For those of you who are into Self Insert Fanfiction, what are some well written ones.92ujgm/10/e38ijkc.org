I just realized you put this in your own recommendations list. On Reddit, just a straight newline is equivalent to hitting space. You need to add two newlines to make a new paragraph or make it bulleted list the following.

#+begin_example
  * [With This Ring](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/)
  * [Blah](blah.com)
#+end_example

Also, in terms of the other recs, I like WTR the most and find it the most rational. I would totally also like some other rational SI (or even just good SI).
