I loved dreaming of sunshine because it got me into self insert fanfiction and it was going on really strong until the SI tried to play fix-it by warning gaara the akatsuki was after him. Did no one question her, a mere genin, of where did she get that information? Did gaara not tell anyone himself that an s-class threat was after him? In a rational naruto universe this would not fly but that didnt stop me from reading. What stopped me was how most chapters were based off filler naruto episodes. I skipped naruto filler episodes because I personally hate filler and I dont really want to,god forbid, READ about filler rather than watch it.

Other than my whiny nitpicks its pretty good starter self insert if you like naruto fanfiction.
