So, I went and found the specific conversation. The thing is, I don't really see it as a major problem. They weren't around anyone else, and she didn't have any of the problems telling Gaara that she would telling a Leaf ninja - the exact problems you bring up.

Why would she have to justify where she got the knowledge to Gaara? Sure she's just a genin, but he has no idea what she might have picked up elsewhere, and no reason to press her - she's a foreign ninja doing him a huge favour. He has no reason to tell anyone in Suna where he got this information from either - why would he risk trouble for this person he owes a great deal, that he bonds to in the very same scene? From a purely selfish standpoint, why would he risk this informant who's apparently bringing him S-rank information?

I can, however, see why you dropped it for following all the stations of canon religiously including the filler. I would note that the quality of the "filler" arcs isn't any less here - unlike in the anime, it's the same writer for all of this fic, not some lesser writers making stuff up for the filler - but just following the rails is too much for some people. It doesn't bother me nearly so much because I never watched the anime, so it doesn't really come across as filler so much.
