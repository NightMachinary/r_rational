If you're just looking for general recommendations, two ratfics I don't see put forward often enough are [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][Cordyceps]] (rational horror) and [[https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/about/][Set In Stone]] (society reduced to pre-iron age).

I have some issues with the structure of the former and the characters of the latter, but they remain wholehearted recommendations to anyone who hasn't picked them up yet.
