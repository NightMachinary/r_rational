  I don't understand why The Two-Year Emperor is so highly recommended here.

I think it's because a lot of readers here probably have played D&D and enjoy seeing how a rules-based world can be broken by a munchkin. It's the same reason people like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]]. It's not strictly rational, but it's entertaining.
