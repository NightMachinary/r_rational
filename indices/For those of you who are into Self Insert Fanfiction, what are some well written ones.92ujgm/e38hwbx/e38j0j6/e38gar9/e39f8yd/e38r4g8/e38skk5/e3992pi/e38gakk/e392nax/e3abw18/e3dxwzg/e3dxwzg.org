On the flip side, I've never played D&D and don't know anything about it beyond the basic concept; I wasn't able to get into the Two-Year Emperor at all and dropped after the first few chapters. It's less fun seeing rules I'm not familiar with munchkin'd while I watch jokes and references I don't understand fly over my head.
