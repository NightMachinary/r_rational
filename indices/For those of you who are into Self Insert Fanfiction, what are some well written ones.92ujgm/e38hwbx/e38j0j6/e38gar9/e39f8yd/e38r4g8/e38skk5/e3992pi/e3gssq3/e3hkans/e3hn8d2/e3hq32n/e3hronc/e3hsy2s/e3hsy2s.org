Well, spoilers, she sleeps around a bit but eventually settles into a sort of open relationship with Zevran. She also ends up using seduction of one of the major characters (not Zevran) as a method of yanking the plot in a non-cannon direction, so it's somewhat relevant that she's a bit sex obsessed. She's no monogamist, but there's romance between her and Zevran despite that.

I found her cheerful lasciviousness to be really similar to his in the game, that to them sex was a fun thing but didn't have any real meaning in and of itself, that the meaningfulness of their relationship came from the trust they had in each other. I liked her willingness to use any tools at her disposal, including her body, to stop the blight so she can go off to invent toilets and showers and enjoy using them. I also really liked that when she does sleep with others, even the man she seduced, it's not 100% coldly calculating/using them, she comes to care for everyone she's with even if it's not love.

Anyway, all that said, I can totally understand how that might not be someone's cup of tea, so fair enough on the warning :)
