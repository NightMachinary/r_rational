I don't understand why The Two-Year Emperor is so highly recommended here. I didn't think it was well written, nor did it strike me as particularly rational. More munchkin than anything else.

Worth the Candle, on the other hand, is amazing. Not fanfiction, but it has the survival aspect that OP is looking for.
