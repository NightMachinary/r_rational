Which of the naruto SI's you wrote there would you:

1. Recommend most

2. Has the easiest time.(I like stories where the MC is always 'in control'. Cos i tend to put myself in their shoes and if they are in stresfull situations, i get stressed. if they make stupid mistakes, i get pissed at them. If they survive just though pure luck, i also get pissed at them. OP MC's in rational fiction is my fav because it's relaxing. So which of them would you recommend to me most?
