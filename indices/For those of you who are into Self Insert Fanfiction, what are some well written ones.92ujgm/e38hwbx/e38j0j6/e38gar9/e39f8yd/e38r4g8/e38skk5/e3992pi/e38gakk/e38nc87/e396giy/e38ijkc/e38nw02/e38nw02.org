I've been writing a series of rational scifi novelettes where the protagonist of part 1 is a self insert.

Note: to write self-inserts well, you must:

1. have a realistic understanding of your own flaws
2. give the self-insert character challenges that are actually hard for them. (aka, the rule still applies that if you give Frodo a lightsaber you must give Sauron the deathstar.)
3. Your self insert MUST diverge from you over the course of the story because they are gaining life experiences that you are not, and vice versa.
