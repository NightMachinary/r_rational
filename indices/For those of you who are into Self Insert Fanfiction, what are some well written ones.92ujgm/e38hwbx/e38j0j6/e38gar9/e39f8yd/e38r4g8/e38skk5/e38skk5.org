*[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/wearing-roberts-crown-asoiaf-si.382035/][Wearing Robert's Crown]]* is a well-written self-insert fic in the ASoIaF setting. And it uses one of the better approaches to self-inserts that I've come across - telling the story from the viewpoint of the other characters.

Self-insert fiction has a tendency to get bogged down in what the insert is /thinking/ rather than what they're /doing/, when the latter is generally the more interesting part of the story. Third-party perspective goes a long way to fixing that.
