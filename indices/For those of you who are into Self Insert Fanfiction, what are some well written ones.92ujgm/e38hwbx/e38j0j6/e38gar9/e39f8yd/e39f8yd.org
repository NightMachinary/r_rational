[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-world-waits-on-evil-hivers-eoa-ww-a-finished-story.274791/][The World Waits on Evil]]: A guy from earth is bodyswapped with a Lich king (not from WOW) in an OC world. He then has to maintain his rule while hiding the fact that he's not actually the original lich from his followers. Features magical science, an industrial/magical revolution (undead make good factory workers), a replacement of most sayings and certain words with local ones (Fuck = love like striking, etc), and a non-base-ten number system, which is hard to read, but interesting.

The whole thing was very unique, especially the lack of idioms and slang we're familiar with.

Status: complete.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/easy-mode-gamer-multicross-si.491065/page-25#post-40850662][Easy Mode]]: a well written gamer multicross, which is a rarity. It focuses less on stats than most most Gamer fics, and makes it feel like the protagonist is actually learning magic rather than getting it handed to him. The Skyrim and Shadowrun portions are especially good.

Status: Mostly done, but it's been on indefinate hiatus for a year or two.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/factory-isolation-si-multicross.404479/][Factory Isolation]]: Another well written multicross, with the protagonist establishing a hub world on a factorio based world.

Status: Complete.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Fimbulwinter-Daniel-Black-Book-1-ebook/dp/B00KZ41LHM][Daniel Black trilogy]]: While it features a harem, which I hate, but the rest of the book makes up for that. The protagonist spends a great deal of time using his magic in creative ways to build magic items, buildings, and more. He's pretty powerful, but has to survive Ragnorok, so he kind of needs to be. The beginning is a bit rough, but it gets better. It's made by the same author who wrote Time Braid and Perilous Waif. Status: Three books are out, but the series isn't complete yet. Another will likely be released in the fall.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/of-orcs-and-men-a-vaguely-d-d-si.291389/][Of Orcs and Men]]: The work that inspired "In my time of Troubles", and has far better writing. I do like IMToT, but it has a lot of spelling mistakes.

Status: long dead.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/blood-and-chaos-the-story-of-a-btvs-si-turned-vampire.354777/][Blood and Chaos]]: A Buffy the Vampire SI. He's immediately killed and turned into a vampire. Features lots of science/testing done on vampires and magic in general, and is hilarious.

Status: On hiatus, but has a lot of content.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/wishful-thinking-40k-si.359714/][Wishful Thinking]]: A 40k SI that Gains power from killing enemies/achieving objectives. Sort of a Gamer/CYOA blend, but actually well written.

Status: over 150k words, but long dead.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-displaced-hero-heroes-of-might-and-magic-iii-dragon-age-crossover-sort-of-si-story.650691/page-2][A Displaced Hero]]: A heroes III conflux fire elemental turned SI gets sent to the world of Dragon age. Features a lot time spent learning magic, and while the protagonist is powerful, he isn't overpowered.

Status: updating fairly quickly.

Hiver at Spacebattles has a lot of SI fics that a pretty decent. Some do contain harems, but do to the content rules there, most of the objectionable problems that normally go hand-in-hand with them aren't there. In my time of troubles also features a harem, by the way.
