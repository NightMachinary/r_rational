This use of the term 'self insert' is interesting to me, as a anime and manga consumer I have heard the phrase used very differently. In that community a 'self-insert character' is a character that is a blank slate, one that has little to no personality so that the consumer can project on to them, or is given a specific personality to appeal to a certain demographic. In this community it seems that the term means an author inserting themselves into the story as a character, or just inserting a character from our world into a fictional one (Worth the Candle and metaworld chronicles seem to be 'self insert' fiction), whereas in the anime community this genre is better known as 'Isekai' a Japanese term that means 'different world' or 'another world', it is interesting to see this difference in two forms of culture that likely mix often (through fanfiction sites and Reddit among other social media).
