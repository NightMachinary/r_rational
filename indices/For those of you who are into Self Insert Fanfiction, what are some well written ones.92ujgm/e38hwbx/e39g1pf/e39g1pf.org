  This use of the term 'self insert' is interesting to me, as a anime and manga consumer I have heard the phrase used very differently. In that community a 'self-insert character' is a character that is a blank slate, one that has little to no personality so that the consumer can project on to them, or is given a specific personality to appeal to a certain demographic.

As another anime and manga consumer, I find this baffling in its entirety. The term has been widely used as OP has used it among the anime fanfiction community, without clarification, for at least the last seventeen years. (Longer than that, I'm pretty sure, but I've only found documented use as far back as [[http://jusenkyo.wikia.com/wiki/Insertion_(D%27anna)][early 2001]].)

What you describe as your referent for that term, I --- and I think I would go so far as to say /we/ --- know as an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyman][everyman protagonist]].

  In this community it seems that the term means an author inserting themselves into the story as a character, or just inserting a character from our world into a fictional one

I think, even here^{1}, it only properly means the former. /Worth the Candle/ qualifies as an SI if the author has admitted to Juniper Smith being a thinly veiled expy of himself --- which he may or may not have done; the matter escapes me as irrelevant --- but it's SI*-adjacent* regardless; people who enjoy well-written self-insertions are likely to enjoy it.

  whereas in the anime community this genre is better known as 'Isekai' a Japanese term that means 'different world' or 'another world'

This, conversely, only means the latter. Contrast the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Thomas_Covenant][/Chronicles of Thomas Covenant/]], which are a published /isekai/ series whose inserted character is decidedly /not/ an author-insert of any stripe; it is not, to my knowledge, called a "self-insertion" by anyone. Contrast also an old fad in Ranma ½ fanfiction wherein a self-insert character (thus called!) would come to Nerima as an "exchange student"; these predated common use of the term "/isekai/", but would not be called that even retrospectively.
