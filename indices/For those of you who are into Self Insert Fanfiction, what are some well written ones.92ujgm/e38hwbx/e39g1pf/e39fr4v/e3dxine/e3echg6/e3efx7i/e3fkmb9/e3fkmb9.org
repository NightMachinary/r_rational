It's associated with (and I would guess correlated with) some bad writing practices, in particular, laziness in terms of characterization, wish fulfillment, and a writing style that leans toward meaningless realism rather than an actual plot or narrative structure.

If /those/ are the things that you care about, you can just point them out explicitly, but that requires actually reading the work, and if there's a sea of works out there that you're trying to comb through, it does make some sense to immediately dismiss works that are self-inserts simply out of a desire to separate the wheat from the chaff. (Given that, most authors will shy away from it in the interests of having their stories read by a wider audience.)
