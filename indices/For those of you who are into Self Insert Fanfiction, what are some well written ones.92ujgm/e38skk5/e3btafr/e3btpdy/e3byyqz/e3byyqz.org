I haven't read any of the ones in the OP, so I didn't realize it. And "unfinished" doesn't bother me so much as the prospect that it may never /be/ finished. I'm enjoying several serialized fics, but most of them are updating.

And yes, I certainly enjoyed it, thank you for bringing it to my attention. I'd hardly be upset otherwise; I have no compunction against walking away from a fic I'm not enjoying.
