It seems excessively focused on it. The whole scene built around the somewhat raunchy joke that she thinks it's a sex dream? Sure. The whole story continuously coming back to sex in some way for the first, what 8 or so chapters before I stopped reading? No thanks. Like I said, it doesn't add anything unless you're looking for lewd stuff - it just gets in the way.

Like, we have the first chapter being an extended joke about a sex dream, then mages are apparently all wear robes so they can have sex quickly, there's a lot of discussion about how Earth sexual norms are different from this setting's, then she's having sex with one of the mages, then she's fending off advances from the king... and it looks like it's going to keep going. If you're looking for a sex-focused story I'm sure it's great, but I'm really not.
