I suppose we do not know for sure that they couldn't do the same, but given the flamekeepers abject surprise when it happens I don't imagine that it is an ability that they are aware of. If any indwelt human had control over indwelt weapons, I feel that it would be obvious to them what occurred.

For that matter, the black scarves would certainly have sussed that out if it were even uncommon knowledge. It's far too useful an ability.
