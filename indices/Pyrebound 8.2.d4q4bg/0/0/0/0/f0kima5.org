Huh. That's ... actually not an inference I expected or intended anybody to make. The one ability Ram has shown, which we can be reasonably sure handmaidens do not possess, is detecting other haranuu. Karagene handmaidens evidently couldn't spot him during his escape, and the Misishin handmaidens noticed nothing odd about him. As for subverting flamekeepers' authority over their weapons, how do you know Mana or Shennai couldn't do the same?
