Honestly, it was fairly obvious that something along those lines was happening as soon as he started being able to boss indwelt objects around.

Which means what the Ensi did is the equivalent to taking a random street urchin and putting him on the throne a'la Prince and the Pauper. Not that our protagonist is really "random" given his sister and (possibly) his parents, but it's that kind of a move. Interesting to see what the fallout is from that and what reactions the Ensi is trying to provoke.
