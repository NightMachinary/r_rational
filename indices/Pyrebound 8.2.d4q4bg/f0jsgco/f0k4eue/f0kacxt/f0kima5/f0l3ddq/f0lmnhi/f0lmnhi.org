See, I don't think of it as an active ability--"subvert allegiance"--so much as how the haranuu think. Flamekeeper tries to take a swipe at Ram. Spirit senses that he's being aimed at a fellow spirit, says "oh heeeelll no" and refuses. Ram then picks up sword; spirit is momentarily confused, but trusts indwelt human more than non-indwelt human and complies with orders. Not something that gets used a lot, either way, since nobody is stupid or impious enough to draw on a handmaiden, the handmaiden wouldn't need a sword to make him hurt if he tried, and as far as anyone knows men don't get indwelt.

Kamenrag's last mistake is a different matter I don't want to get into right now. Anyway, it's good to know how it looks from the other side. Thanks!
