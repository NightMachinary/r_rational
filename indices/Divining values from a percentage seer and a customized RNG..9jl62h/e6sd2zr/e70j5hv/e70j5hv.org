The probability that a number is the killers number is not the same as the probability that the killer answers your call.

The killer could have their phone off or on silent, (in which case the probability is near zero regardless of the number shown) or the phone might randomly malfunction in some universes and not in others (in which case the probability is lower than the one matching their phone number).
