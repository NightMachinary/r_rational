Strictly speaking, inifnity doesn't exist. It's a placeholder for "I don't care to count that high" and a few similar statements that make the math work out the way some smart mathematics experts expect it to work out. Once you switch back to observable phenomena rather than pure theory, it goes back to being a finite number you just don't know. (In this case, the finite number is <(count of all possible variables that could affect the question's outcome)!>)
