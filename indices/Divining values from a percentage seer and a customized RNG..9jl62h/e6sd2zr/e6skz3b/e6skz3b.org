How will you observe that it's the killer answering and not someone else? You must visualize the future in a way that allows for distinguishing it from other futures (and I assume it must be pretty short visualization, otherways you can just visualize phoning, telling the police to go arrest that guy, waiting for 2 weeks for any evidence, and then seeing the charges being pressed).
