It's not infinite, because there's a small chance of an Unexpected Random Event (such as a lightning bolt striking the computer) preventing the RNG from producing any results at all; your bandwidth is limited to the number of digits that are significantly more probable than such a outcome.

Though yes, you could use the RNG to get more bits per vision in such a manner, but it's unlikely to be enough to produce a meaningful map of another galaxy in less than a few years' constant work.
