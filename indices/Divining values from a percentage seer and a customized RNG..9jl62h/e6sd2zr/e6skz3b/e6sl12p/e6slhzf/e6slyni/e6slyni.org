The seer does not need to be present; however, I don't recall her using her ability (in /Worm/) for any predictions outside of the city she was in, so there may still be a maximum range.

Even without a maximum range, mapping distant galaxies is going to be a slow business. Remember, that question is going to be plain 'yes' or 'no' - one bit of information - and you get ten questions a day. No matter how clever you are with your questions, ten bits a day is going to map the distant galaxy /very very slowly/.
