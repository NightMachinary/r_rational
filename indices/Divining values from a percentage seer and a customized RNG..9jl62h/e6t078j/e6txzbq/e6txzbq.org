An additional question can ask for the probability that any number appears on the screen, so we can divide the probability of the specific number by that of any number.

This does not deal with confounders that depend on which number is shown, or which might influence which number is shown, such as a roaming hacker randomly generating an IP to investigate, finding this machine, grasping the implications of this program, and making it show other numbers, in order to shift the distribution.
