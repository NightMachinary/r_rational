Let us assume that the RNG is indeed random.

Major issue: there is no such thing as a perfect unbiased RNG. And even a /tiny/ amount of error in the RNG, or in the display, or in the stack, etc, makes your results wrong.

Let's take your example:

Phone displays all 10-digit numbers - 0000000000 through 9999999999. Or 10^{10} total. To assign each unique probabilities adding up to 100% as far away from each other as possible, you assign the first 1/N, the second 2/N, ... 10^{10}/N. N here is 1+2+...+10^{10}, or ~5*10^{19}. (Not quite true, but close enough.)

So we need to be exact within 2 parts in 10^{20}. For comparison, this is like measuring the diameter of the moon's orbit down to the size of a hydrogen atom.

We don't have RNGs this good. Even if we did, there's enough random noise that you won't be able to measure it accurately enough.

(Consider for instance if the chance of a cosmic ray causing a bitflip was different turning a 1->0 then a 0->1...)

  What is the chance that this computer will show the number I will eventually know is the killer's phone number?

Is the chances of you knowing - falsely or truly - that a certain phone number was the correct one dependent on the phone number?

You can certainly squeeze out a fair number of bits of entropy from it. But not to this level.
