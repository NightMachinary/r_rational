My personal understanding of the power (might be incorrect) was that they had to personally observe the outcome they are predicting. (Or at least observe someone telling them the outcome occurred, if the question was worded that way.) It was based upon their own self's future observances (whether first or second-hand, although second-hand becomes much messier and open to errors/spoofing.)
