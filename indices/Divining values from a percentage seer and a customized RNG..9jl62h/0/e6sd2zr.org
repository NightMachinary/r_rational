  Of course, this is contingent on either accepting that the seer can ask questions about the chance of something occurring which matches a variable they don't yet know, or that we accept that the seer will later on find out in an after-action report that the killer's phone number was that, and therefor satisfy their question

It's easy to get around that. "When I look at the number that this machine shows, I will dial it. What are the odds that the killer will answer?"

After looking at the current number, dial it. (Odds are you'll get a wrong number, but do so anyway). /Then/ check the odds in the machine and dial the number that matches the odds given.

--------------

The killer can easily fool such a power, if he knows that this trick is being used. He merely needs to have two phones. If the number for Phone A has a 0.003% chance of turning up in your RNG, and the number for Phone B has a 0.001% chance of turning up, then the odds of a successful number turning up are 0.004% - but the single number that turns up at 0.004% probability is the wrong number. (Note that, if your machine returns every possible telephone number, then any individual one will have very low odds).
