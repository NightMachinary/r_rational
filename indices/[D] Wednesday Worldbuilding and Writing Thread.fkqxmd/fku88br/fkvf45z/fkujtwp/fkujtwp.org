Hi! I'm working on a fantasy setting that includes a civilization of Dragon Riders.

I'd like to try to build the most rational-seeming dragons possible that still fulfill the role of “massive deadly fire-breathing flying mounts.” They should conform to many traditional dragon tropes, but I'd like to find justifications for these behaviors.

Here are my notes on Dragon biology and behavior so far.

/Dragon Biology:/

Dragons are feathered, with four limbs: two powerful rear legs, and two wings with hooked claws at the joints. I want to avoid the strange 6-limb anatomy, and as we've learned that more and more dinosaurs were feathered, this seems appropriate for a flying creature.

They breathe fire using internal gas sacs and sparking glands in the throat. Their feathers are slick and flame resistant, coated in a fireproof oil that gives them a rainbow sheen in sunlight.

The gas sacs also serve to provide some buoyancy for lighter than air flight despite their massive size. The gas is created by a chemical reaction in their stomach between the acid and something like Limestone.

Dragons typically live in craggy, mountainous regions, clinging with their forelimbs to cliff faces, and using super-hot fire and powerful rear legs to burrow into soft parts of the rock and make Creche caves.

Their tunnels will follow weaknesses in the rock, and they have a knack for finding veins of metal which they can melt with their flame to create soft spots and gaps in which to dig. Their burrows will often trace these veins to a mother-lode of softer precious metals, which they will melt down to form smooth, round dens in which to lay their eggs.

Behaviorally, they are pack hunters with a strict social hierarchy (essential for any tameable species.) Social clusters are led by a Brood Mother, an alpha female that rules over a group of breeding males. As dragons are long-lived, the dominant female is typically ancient and large, and capable of producing several eggs when she goes into heat. Each of these will be laid with a different male for fertilization and safekeeping, with mates selected based on their hierarchical position and quality of their Creche burrows. These eggs can take years to gestate, requiring constant attention and warming from their paternal caretakers.

Males, for their part, are divided into a hierarchy of Breeders and Hunters, based mostly on age and fighting prowess. Males compete for position through ceremonial dominance contests, with the strongest taking possession of the most desirable burrows, typically those situated in rich Gold veins. Usually these coveted positions are held by old, large male dragons, lifelong mates of the Alpha Brood Mother.

Younger males form hunting parties, roving in packs to take down both small prey and megafauna, and carry the meat back to feed their elders. Those who perform well in the hunt earn favor within the pack, and can earn the rights to challenge others for low-tier breeding positions.

The oldest males will eventually become sluggish and through pestering from younger upstarts be unseated from their breeding burrows. These lifelong partners of the Brood Mother are allowed to join her in the heart of the mountain in retirement, warming her nest and defending it from intruders until they finally pass.

Occasionally, inter-pack conflict will break out, usually in the form of a younger female challenging and ousting her elder. Females are born with much less frequency, and are often killed or run out by their mother at maturity. But occasionally one survives and grows, sometimes by taking on other roving young and low-status males without breeding rights. These rogue packs will roam until they either find a suitable new breeding ground, or manage to unseat an existing matriarch.

While it is rare, there have been recorded instances of an older male taking a paternal interest in his female offspring, and defending it from his partner brood mother. The resulting conflict usually results in the death or ouster of the male from his breeding position, but can make survival of the young female more likely.

The Dragon Rider society has shaped itself over the generations after the practices of their Dragon symbiotes. They maintain a strict social hierarchy and have ritualized the hatching and bonding process for new dragons to maintain the monopoly of the elite warrior caste over them. Bonding to a dragon is a symbol of power and prosperity, and bonded dragons are often passed down through noble families to maintain that status.

I'm interested in any thoughts, brainstorming, or critiques to help rationalize Dragons and the setting!
