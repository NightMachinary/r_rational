  Dragons are feathered ... and as we've learned that more and more dinosaurs were feathered, this seems appropriate for a flying creature.

The feathers seem like an unnecessary deviation from typical dragon tropes. While it would make sense if they're genetic cousins of birds, that would make the fire breathing very hard to explain. Fire breathing is the most unusual part of dragons from an evolutionary perspective so I would start with explaining that before moving on. Instead of being related to birds, I suspect they would be most closely related to several species of small fire-breathing lizards, around the same size as geckos or iguanas, which use fire as a defense against large furry predators like bears, apes, and big cats.

  They breathe fire using internal gas sacs and sparking glands in the throat. The gas sacs also serve to provide some buoyancy for lighter than air flight despite their massive size. The gas is created by a chemical reaction in their stomach between the acid and something like Limestone.

This biologically-produced lifting gas you're talking about would be methane. It won't lift as much as you think, and it would make for a very poor weapon which would likely hurt the dragon more than its target. It would also be hard to explain any gradual evolution of some ignition mechanism since it would initially be so deadly to the dragon itself, even before it's learned to use the methane as a weapon. Instead of gas, I would suggest a liquid jet, much like the emission from a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_beetle][bombardier beetle]]. This could evolve in an animal which starts off by spitting at predators, like a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitting_cobra][spitting cobra]], and then, with enough random mutation and natural selection, gradually evolves into an increasingly noxious and deadly cocktail until it's actually a hypergolic flammable mixture, like a mixture of hydrazine, hydrogen peroxide, and very oily sebum. This would be immensely effective against their furry predators, and allow the tiny lizards to quickly become a fairly dominant species.

Most of these fire-lizard species would probably live in dense, tropical bamboo forests. I imagine these lizards would have to climb to hunt for their prey, but would live in fire-resistant burrows at ground level. Occasionally, their own fires would force them to jump down to reach their burrows, so natural selection would favor the ones that can survive falling from great heights. They'd start to become flatter and develop webbing between their forelimbs and bodies, much like the various [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draco_(genus)][draco lizards]]. As a a side note, the occasional fires they create would create a symbiotic relationship with the bamboo, since the fires would wipe out all competing plant species and the bamboo would grow faster than any other plants can keep up with.

During climactic warm periods, these lizards and their bamboo forests would spread poleward fairly easily. However, once global temperatures drop again, the lizards living furthest from the equator would start to have selective pressure for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigantothermy][gigantothermy]], where the bigger lizards have less surface area for their body mass and thus tend to remain warmer and more functional in cool weather. This is when you'd start to see pterodactyl-sized fire-lizards becoming the predominant species.

These larger fire-lizards would start to have trouble living in dense forests, so the ones which can fly would probably start inhabiting temperate plains. Indeed, they might even use their fire-breathing ability as a hunting tactic, setting a forest fire and then catching the creatures that go running away from it. This fire-setting behavior would tend to eliminate forests and replace them with plains where the hunting would be easier anyway.

As the temperatures get colder still during the course of an ice age, the fire-lizards would face selective pressure to grow even bigger. By this point, these mammoth-sized flying fire-breathing lizards that live in burrows or cliff faces might be properly called dragons.

  Dragons typically live in craggy, mountainous regions, clinging with their forelimbs to cliff faces, and using super-hot fire and powerful rear legs to burrow into soft parts of the rock and make Creche caves. Their tunnels will follow weaknesses in the rock, and they have a knack for finding veins of metal which they can melt with their flame to create soft spots and gaps in which to dig.

Remember, any fire these dragons are making needs to be propelled out of their own bodies. If at all possible, it'd be better to have a low-temperature fire which is just hot enough to ignite fur and wood. Anything hot enough to melt rock is going to melt them too. Similarly, digging and burrowing into dirt or soft sandstone certainly seems reasonable, but hard rock and ore veins seems unlikely.
