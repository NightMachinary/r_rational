[Still kinda new to this whole reddit thing, so apologies if this is supposed to go somewhere else.]

How likely is it for a person to complete a tour in the military and still be a racist by the time they finish? How likely is it for a person who made the military their career? In particular, I'm thinking of someone who started out as a KKK member / neo-nazi or the son of one, and joined the US armed forces.

I rather suspect that this sort of thinking would be beaten out of you, since (from what I understand) they kinda force you to depend on each other in a unit. If a member of your unit is of a race you think is inferior in some way, /sooner or later/ you're going to have to depend on them to perform some critical action and be shocked when they perform just as well as everyone else.

/Perhaps/ confirmation bias will be enough to keep the person from seeing the successes and only focus on the failures, but I wanted to check before I go and make a character who's too unbelievable.

For background, I'm writing a HPMoR-inspired fic. Got about 198000 words so far. (Among many other changes from cannon and HPMoR) I wanted to give Lucius a competent lieutenant. (As part of the whole "upgrade the villains, too" idea.) I was considering making the character racist in the classic sense (non-white = bad), just so that the /only/ issue isn't about muggleborns. He won't be /pro/-muggleborn, of course, but perhaps he's just ambivalent, it's just a job for him, and Lucius is paying him enough to get him to pay lip-service to the hating muggleborns spiel. The character I'm imagining would have a military background and so would be actually good at planning attacks and organizing people. Lucius is a great politician, but he's no drill sergeant. Mainly I want him so that the Death Eaters could be plausibly organized and a credible threat, even without Voldemort to hold them together.

If the whole concept of "racist with military background" doesn't make sense, that's fine, but I figured I'd ask to see how plausible the idea was, since I don't /actually/ know what the military is like. I'm sure racial /slurs/ get thrown around a lot, as part of that whole "swearing like a sailor" thing, but I'm looking for actual prejudiced beliefs, not just something shouted to try to get a rise from someone.

Has anyone actually known some horrible racists while in the service or met racist vets? Keep in mind that racism towards "the enemy" doesn't exactly count (such as WWII soldiers hating the Japanese). I'm thinking of, for example, a solider who wouldn't accept aid from a fellow soldier due to the color of their skin. That sort of nonsense.

No need to cite specific examples, since it's unnecessary and I don't know if that would even be appropriate. I'm just trying to confirm if "ex-military" and "racist" are /plausibly/ compatible backgrounds. "I'd believe it" or "I'd have trouble believing it" would both be constructive comments in my book.
