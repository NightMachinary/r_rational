This isn't a problem, but I'd still like to hear what [[/r/rational]] makes of it.

In my world there are some things that work differently than in reality. Magic is real, and there are a lot of cases where even simple real world physics and biology are completely set aside in favour of magical explanations. There is still internally consistent logic, though it's not always obvious. And I wonder what you guys make of this:

In my world, heterochromia (Having eyes of different colour) is severely stigmatized, and often seen as deeply sinister. Old legends and religious texts often portray villains as having 'witch's eyes', and even the few good characters with such eyes are always morally gray tricksters or reformed villains. Odysseus level sneaky bastards who help out their friends but screw over everyone else is about the best you can hope for. If you were putting on a play where it's obvious from the start who the baddie is, the baddie probably has heterochromia.

Babies born with such eyes are sometimes killed, and usually their birth is enough to make their families social outcasts overnight, or at least get the rumor mill going. The 'scholarly' explanation is that, being born EVIL, there is something in their soul that is disharmonious and causes birthmarks, witch's eyes etc.

The /actual/ explanation is a little less sinister, but still unfair to the child. Reproduction in my world is a union of bodies, but it is also a union of souls. And if there is deception between the parents, that does affect the soul of the child. Such deceptions can vary - if one of the parents seduces the other to get ahead in life but doesn't have any romantic feelings themselves, you may get a child with witch's eyes. If it's a political marriage or drunken one night stand and both parents understand it, no deception and no witch's eyes. But if one parent's view of the other clashes significantly with reality or one is keeping an important secret, the child suffers. Even something as innocent as "I was a nobleman in the capital, but I hated serving the evil king so I disappeared and started a new life as an innkeeper and never told my wife" could be enough.

Now, there's still an element of self fulfilling prophecy there. On the one hand, a child treated cruelly and with suspicion by everyone they meet /is/ going to be a lot more likely to grow up to be maladjusted, learn to manipulate people, make an effort to seem nice and harmless regardless of their actual feelings etc. And on the other hand, they also have parents who are not having a healthy relationship - and their birth provides evidence of that which will likely cause a lot of tension and drama even if nothing was visible on the surface before. And if the deception is something like one of the parents being a sociopath or narcissist pretending to be normal, again that doesn't bode well for the mental health of the child, because one of their parents sucks.

While I have the details worked out in my head, I don't think it will be explicitly explained in my actual story. The readers should be able to fill in the blanks and get it mostly right, and even if they don't it's just an unimportant detail about the world. One of the main characters has witch's eyes, but she's conveniently chaotic evil anyway.
