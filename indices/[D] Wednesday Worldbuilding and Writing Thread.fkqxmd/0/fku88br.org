I like the ideas of seas being different, each possessed of their own unique magic. There's magic in water, and if you get enough of that water in one place, it's going to take on a character of its own, one shaped by the conditions around it.

The Benumbed Sea grows colder the deeper you go, and glaciers break off from the Gelid Depths sometimes, breaking through the surface of the water like enormous, frigid whales, one of the primary hazards for ships that make their way across the waters that are beat down on by a baking-hot sun. They say that the bottom of the Benumbed Sea is coated with ice a mile thick, and that whole civilizations live down there, unaware that there's anything above the ice and water.

The land beneath the Morphic Sea rarely settles for long, undulating and occasionally rising above the surface, sometimes revealing ruins or treasures, other times underwater communities that grumble about their brief periods of island living before being pulled down into the depths once more. Charting the Morphic is a hazard, and ships always pack extra food, for fear that they'll be lifted up and stranded for a week or two, a not-uncommon occurrence.

Everything moves faster in the wide Breaker Sea, and when a ship catches a good wind, it will soon find itself going incredible speeds, so fast that an ill-prepared ship will be torn apart by the slap of the waves against the hull. The biggest problem for ships isn't getting from one place to another as fast as possible, but slowing down enough that they aren't broken into pieces by their speed, and being able to stop once they're near their destination. A cutter on the Breaker Sea spends half its time speeding up and half its time slowing down.

The Vivium Sea is teeming with life, all of it unfortunately bony and inedible. What's said to be most striking about sailing it is the sound of the fish and eels constantly slapping up against the hull, and the way the sailing goes slower from the friction of all that life hitting the ship. There are enormous monsters in the Vivium, to be sure but they're rare, and far out-numbered by the smaller ones. It's said that a long dip in the Vivium will remove a man's need to eat for a full day, but only the desperate would try it, given what lives there. (I do like the idea of the fauna being used for other purposes, more in the sense of byproducts, their inedibility a quirk rather than a real limiting factor for exploitation.)

By contrast, the Sea of Glass is perfectly still, unmoved by winds or tides, and as near as anyone can tell, completely lifeless. It's the only of the Seventeen Seas that's completely lifeless, and it's the most difficult of them to sail, which can only be done with a special craft that skids along the surface, as any boat with a hull will find itself deprived of its speed.
