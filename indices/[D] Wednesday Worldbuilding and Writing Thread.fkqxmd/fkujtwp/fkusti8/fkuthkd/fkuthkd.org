good point, alchemists reproducing gas production from extracted dragon acid and the stone could be a thing. of course that requires that someone had studied the mechanism of dragon flight and done biopsy, as it's probably not immediately obvious. The culture of the riders themselves might not support this but I could see it occurring in some tangential societies.
