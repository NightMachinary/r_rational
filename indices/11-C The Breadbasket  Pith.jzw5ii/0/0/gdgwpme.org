Yeah, they even stopped nudging Humdrums into performing terrorist attacks because they decided it did more harm than good, so it was /very/ clear that they wouldn't starve out the country. Granted, Paragon didn't have the benefit of a Tunnel Vision interlude to see the reasoning behind why they stopped with the nudged terrorist attacks, but it still should have been clear that this is something that goes entirely against the ideology of Commonplace. Especially since, as they make clear in this chapter, that's a tactic that disproportionately harms the poor.

Also, if they think Maxine Clive is just a puppet, why the hell do they think mindreading her is going to yield reliable intel? They've been outplayed before because their "reliable intel" turned out to be a trap, and with a projector of Grace's caliber it's child's play to seed a Humdrum's mind with false plans and misinformation. They really should have realized that the "plan" they pulled from Maxine's mind makes no sense given what they know of Commonplace and is more likely to be yet another instance of misinformation, given that they've already proven to be so very fond of that tactic.

Honestly, Paragon deserves to lose here. They've bought into their own propaganda and can no longer tell it apart from reality.
