Paragon just refuses to take Maxine Clive and Commonplace seriously as more than a front for a Shenti-led genocide and they keep getting outmaneuvered as a result.

Clive and Tunnel Vision are idealists. They wouldn't burn down their own country's food supply, and any hints that they would has to be considered as part of a larger maneuver.

But because it's convenient for the Guardian to imagine their enemies as bloodthirsty monsters, they immediately assume the worst and get themselves baited again.
