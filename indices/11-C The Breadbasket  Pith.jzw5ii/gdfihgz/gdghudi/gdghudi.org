  “The winds will be high,” said my mother. “Firefighters and planes with retardant can be taken out. With well-placed firebombs and palefire, Commonplace and the Shenti can create a firestorm. I made many such attacks during the Shenti War.”

  Jun got a heavy look in his eyes when she mentioned that. They're using our tricks against us. The enemy had a cruel sense of irony.

  “Then, Commonplace gets their revolution. Or the Shenti finish us off. Without food, the Principality will die. The manner of death is just a formality. Maybe Tunnel Vision doesn't even care about the details, past that point.”

They've fallen into Grace's trap so easily because they're projecting themselves onto her. Because if they were in her place, that's what they'd do. If they were part of Commonplace, there's no way they'd take orders from a Humdrum, so she must not either.

Deep down, even if Grace is their enemy, at the end of the day she's a projector like them, and in Paragon projectors don't care about the people under them.

  I stitched that General Benthey person while we were talking strategy. Remember Helmfirth? That city that got blown by the Voidsteel missiles?” He gritted his teeth. “Turns out, they have more of those.

So, confirmation that the attack on Helmfirth was carried out by Paragon. Someone really needs to take a peak into that book and see what's really going on.
