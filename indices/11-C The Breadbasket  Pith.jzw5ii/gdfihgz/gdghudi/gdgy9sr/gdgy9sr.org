  As it turned out, mass arrests of Green Hands didn't pacify the public, but the exact opposite. The riots had exploded across Elmidde with new ferocity, and law enforcement had responded by flooding the streets with cops.

  According to the radio news, someone had tried to assassinate a pro-Paragon member of Parliament, too. Enoch Trembath, some old ex-Guardian with a bushy mustache. His son had sat next to me in Physics 110, and had helped explain some of the more thorny concepts when I zoned out.

  A sweet boy. He didn't deserve this.

  Loyalists on the street had replied with fervor, and in the ensuing chaos, Parliament had been taken to Paragon for security. A few hours later, someone set fire to the House of Ministers. The blaze had been extinguished, but it had confirmed everyone's fears.

  /Was this part of Commonplace's plan?/ Had this all been some elaborate ruse to escalate the conflict? I couldn't keep track of this cat and mouse nonsense anymore.

  But one way or another, chaos ruled the streets.

Well, I saw this one coming from a mile away. Paragon was already losing the public opinion battle, and then they decided to go for a wave of police brutality. Worse, they were baited into an even more severe and brutal crackdown thanks to false intel Commonplace fed them. So yeah, Wes, this is part of Commonplace's plan.

Right now, it's looking like their plan is to whip up public support and plunge the country into chaos while luring Paragon away, thus denying them the opportunity to reassert control. I'm guessing the next step is for Commonplace to swoop in and take control of the Principality basically unopposed and riding a wave of populist support while also sabotaging those Paragon forces that were lured away. Maybe there's a trap at the agricultural islands, maybe the Shenti fleet is real even if the plan to burn things down isn't, something along those lines. Regardless, I'm guessing they seize the country now, with further plans to defend against Paragon's inevitable attempt to reconquer it once they realize they've been had. The revolution appears to be entering its final stages.
