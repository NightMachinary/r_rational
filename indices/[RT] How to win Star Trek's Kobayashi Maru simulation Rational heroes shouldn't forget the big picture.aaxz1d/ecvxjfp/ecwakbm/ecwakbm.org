  In a real scenario, you will never know you are in a no-win situation until you die. You will not know that the Klingons will catch you, and you will not know that the KM's engines are crippled or that its crew are even still alive for you to rescue. You are not afforded the privilege of perfect knowledge.

I strongly agree with this part. One of the reasons moral dilemmas in TV series are often unrealistic is that the story has to contrive to give the audience at least a general understanding of the benefits and costs of either choice, which is a luxury people making military or political decisions usually don't have.

But that's even more reason to be conservative. Taking stupid risks gets you killed, and then you can't help people anymore because you're dead.
