Sulu does the math in the book. He flat out refuses to risk potentially millions of lives for the 300 or so crew of a single vessel, especially when it's possible said vessel is not real. He orders that they send all possible information to Starfleet and let it be a diplomatic matter instead of a military one.

It's something I always wondered when watching the movie. Do most Starfleet captains just ignore treaties whenever they feel like it? Or does the K.M. attempt to break them of this silliness?
