In the case of the Kobayashi Maru test, I think the "big picture" perspective would be to recognize that you're not actually a captain whose goal is to rescue people in the neutral zone; you're a cadet who is participating in a simulation as part of a Star Fleet examination and your goal is to showcase your potential as a commander.

I once participated in a scavenger hunt where one of the location hints had an answer that was a fairly obvious bit of trivia about the town, and one answer that was "technically correct" and an obscure bit of knowledge that only a tiny number of people possessed. I knew that the person who was running the scavenger hunt, and knew that they wouldn't design the scavenger hunt to have "trick answers" that required obscure bits of domain-specific knowledge that would only be known to a tiny handful of people, so I went with the "obvious" answer, correctly identified the location of the next clue, and our group went on our merry way. In this case, I could have opted to be "technically correct," but the real test was not "identify the 'correct' answer to this trivia question," but "identify the location of the next clue." Being "correct" doesn't always equate to "winning." Context is important: Had I known the creator of the scavenger hunt to be the kind of person who /would/ try to insert tricky answers intended to mislead participants, I would have adjusted my strategy and probably checked the "technically correct" location instead.

The Kobayashi Maru is not a scenario so much as it is an examination of your abilities, and cheating the test is only a winning move if you think that cheating the test will impress the people who are administering the test. In the case of the Kobayashi Maru, the point of the test is to see how people will respond in an "impossible" situation, and cheating the test might be a way to demonstrate the kind of outside-the-box thinking that the test proctors are looking for.

Scotty's decision to cheat the test by exploiting the limitations of the simulation ends with the academy staff removing Scotty from command school and reassigning him to the engineering program. This is what Scotty wanted all along, so he "wins," even though it might look like a failure to be removed from the command program.
