There's nothing /in/ the neutral zone to attract tourists. Those "people" "sending" the distress call have no reason to be there or even want to be there. Given that a policy of having your patrols disturb their schedules to respond to distress calls would be incredibly easy to discover and exploit by an enemy who patrols the same border, the rational conclusion is that the Klingon set a trap.
