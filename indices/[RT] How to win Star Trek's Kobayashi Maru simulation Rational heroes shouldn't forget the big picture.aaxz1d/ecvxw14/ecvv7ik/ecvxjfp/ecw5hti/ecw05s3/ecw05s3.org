  In a real scenario, you will never /know/ you are in a no-win situation until you die. You will not know that the Klingons will catch you, and you will not know that the KM's engines are crippled or that its crew are even still alive for you to rescue. You are not afforded the privilege of perfect knowledge.

However, in a real scenario, you /do/ know (or, at the very least, /it's extremely reasonable to assume/, given what your superiors have assigned you to do /literally at this very moment/) that the Klingons are patrolling the other side of the Neutral Zone and that the chance of being caught if you enter it is not negligible.

  In a na[Ã¯]ve scenario rescuing the Kobayashi Maru is the right move, both as an individual choice and an iterated choice.

I don't know much about /Star Trek/---but, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demilitarized_zone][if I replace "Klingon Empire" with "North Korea", "Northern Cyprus", or "Israel"]], trespassing in an demilitarized zone to rescue another trespasser, with a non-negligible risk of being discovered by the country that's known to be (1) actively patrolling the other side of that zone just as I'm patrolling my own side and (2) very militarily aggressive and hostile toward my own country (Southern Cyprus, South Korea, or Lebanon), does not seem like a very smart decision. If going into the DMZ is assumed to be a coin flip between "save both people" and "lose both people (to prison, torture, and/or death) /and/ damage the diplomatic standing of my country by being caught in the DMZ" (and that assumption definitely can be made /before/ you enter the DMZ), refraining from going into the DMZ seems unarguably the best decision to me. If everybody went rescuing trespassers willy-nilly, these diplomatic incidents would regularly be escalated from few-person to many-person affairs.
