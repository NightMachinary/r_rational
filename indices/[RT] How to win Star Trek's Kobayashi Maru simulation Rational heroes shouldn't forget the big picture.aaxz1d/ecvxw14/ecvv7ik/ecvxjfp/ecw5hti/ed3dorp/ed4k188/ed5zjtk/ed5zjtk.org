Doesn't actually matter. It'd be equally useful for illustrating the point it it were a stick-figure cartoon.

​

As a followup, the reasons it'd be useful as education material are:

​

1. It is memorable. A lesson people forget is less useful than one they remember even if it's a made up story rather than a real account.
2. It clearly shows the important point of the lesson. Unlike the example of a cop dying due to an unseen danger, which can be interpreted as "be prepared to die when rescuing people" the crane example clearly shows that attempting to save somone and failing puts other people (not just you) in grater danger as anyone responding after you now has to rescue you as well as the original victim. This can get them kileld trying to save you, and it can compromise their ability to save the original victim trying to save you as well. Which is the point of the lesson. And in a rational reconstruction would probably be the point of the Kobiashi Maru scenario.
3. It's not violent, or sexy so there is little risk of moral guardians deeming it unsuitable for any audience you may find yourself needed to educate about emergency preparedness.
