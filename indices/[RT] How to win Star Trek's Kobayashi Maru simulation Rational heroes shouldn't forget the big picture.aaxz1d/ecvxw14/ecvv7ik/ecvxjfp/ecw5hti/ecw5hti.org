You're very clearly not an emergency responder, because what you're saying is complete bullshit. It's not your fault, because it's very prevalent, popularly believed bullshit that's instilled in everyone by Hollywood, but:

#+begin_quote
  Self-sacrificing behavior is preferable to self-serving behavior overall, because the former is often required to reach a good solution in emergency situations
#+end_quote

The former is /emphatically forbidden/ in emergency situations by all of our training and procedures.

#+begin_quote
  should place yourself in danger as an emergency responder because that is the nature of the duty you have taken on, to risk yourself for others.
#+end_quote

As an emergency responder, the nature of the duty you have taken on is to /go the fuck home to your family/ after the incident is over.

It is not a firefighter's duty to risk being caught in a structural collapse for the sake of rescuing people any more than it is, for example, a postal worker's duty to risk dying in a mail truck accident for the sake of delivering your packages. Every activity in the world has risks; we do everything we can to mitigate those risks with safety equipment, safe work practices, etc; and every once in a while it isn't enough and some unavoidable freak accident occurs (but much more often, someone badly fucked up the safety practices). There is absolutely nothing romantic or heroic about this and it is absolutely not anyone's "duty" to get killed.
