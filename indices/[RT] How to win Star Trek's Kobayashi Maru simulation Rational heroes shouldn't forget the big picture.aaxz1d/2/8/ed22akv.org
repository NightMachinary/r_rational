  /In a real scenario, you will never know you are in a no-win situation until you die. You will not know that the Klingons will catch you, and you will not know that the KM's engines are crippled or that its crew are even still alive for you to rescue. You are not afforded the privilege of perfect knowledge./

Well, sure. But your statement that emergency responders should place themselves in danger to save others is false. They are generally trained to save themselves and anyone they can WITHOUT likely adding themselves to the casualty list.

You're trained to make a mess smaller, not make yourself part of the mess for others to clean up. Your emphasis on "sacrifice" is no good.
