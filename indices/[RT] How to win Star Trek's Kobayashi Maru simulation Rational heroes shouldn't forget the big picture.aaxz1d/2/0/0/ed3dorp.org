The way this was taught to me was: "Don't make another victim."

â€‹

I think if I were teaching it, i'd use a video i saw a while back where a car had fallen off a peer so a big crane was being used to lift the car out of the water. The crane tipped off the peer under the weight. So a larger crane was brought in. It lifted the car but when it went to recover the otehr crane it tipped off the peer under the load, and a third even bigger crane had to be used to lift the two cranes out of the water. If the cranes were people we'd call the first crane an "idiot" not a "hero".
