  Given that a policy of having your patrols disturb their schedules to respond to distress calls would be incredibly easy to discover and exploit by an enemy who patrols the same border, the rational conclusion is that the Klingon set a trap.

If a military patrol isn't supposed to respond to distress calls, then who is? Surely the whole point of a military patrol is that you have access to the training, resources and communication channels to actually help a distressed vessel, unlike a civilian crew which may lack one or all of those things. Otherwise, what the hell are you even patrolling for?
