  If a military patrol isn't supposed to respond to distress calls, then who is?

Distress calls from Federation space? Yes. Distress calls from trespassers in a demilitarized zone with a semi-hostile foreign country? I doubt it.

  Otherwise, what the hell are you even patrolling for?

Klingon and Federation ships that look like they're /about/ to trespass get a warning and a note in the log. Ships that are /already/ trespassing get a stronger warning and a report to Starfleet.
