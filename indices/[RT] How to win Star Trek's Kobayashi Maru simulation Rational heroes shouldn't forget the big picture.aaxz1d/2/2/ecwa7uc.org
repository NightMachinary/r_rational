Except it's not metagaming. He doesn't know the details going in, none of them do. If you read the book, he is rather surprised /just how quickly/ his simulation ends after he refuses to go in, because he /expected/ that it would make him lose one way or another no matter what he chose. He even specifically stated during the scenario that it was either a fake lure used by the Klingons or a real situation to be solved by diplomats, not military action.

It's goal isn't to 'enforce humility'. It's goal is to test the composure, will, leadership, and decision-making skills of the captain. If you go by the book, it becomes progressively more difficult the more you fight against it--Scotty never 'won', he just broke each encounter until the program had to spawn in 20+ ships that all fired simultaneously to kill his ship before he could react (and he was already coming up with plans how to handle that as well).

The naive approach is to just up and sacrifice yourself for no reason, rather than weighing the pros and cons to come up with a solution that does the most good overall.
