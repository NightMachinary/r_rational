  Sulu's choice is metagaming. He acts in that manner only because he is aware of what the Kobayashi Maru test is.

You could say the same of Chekov self-destructing, since he won't /actually/ die, not to mention the other two who outright cheat. As for the Klingon warships... yeah, IRL they would just be a possibility, not a certainty, depending on how tight you think they patrol the neutral zone. But you know they're warlike, bloodthirsty, and keen on starting trouble, so that possibility is very high anyway.
