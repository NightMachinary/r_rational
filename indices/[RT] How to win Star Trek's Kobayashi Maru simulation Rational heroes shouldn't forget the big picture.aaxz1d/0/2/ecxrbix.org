Agreed, though if you do /not/ have a clever way to cheat the test that also shows your outside the box thinking, then the best way to pass it is probably to just stay out of the thing entirely, like Sulu did. Which may not be amazingly creative or stand out, but at least shows you know your damn rulebook.
