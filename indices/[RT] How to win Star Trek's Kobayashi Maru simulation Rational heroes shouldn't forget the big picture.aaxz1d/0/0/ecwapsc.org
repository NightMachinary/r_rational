As an additional detail, Scotty's is the only one where we get to 'see' them talking to him after the event.

He admits freely that he 'cheated' by taking advantage of the fact that it was a simulation based on math and not reality. He used an attack which hit the enemy ships where their shield bubbles overlap--in math terms, it should cause a catastrophic overload that destroys them all (what happens in the situation when he does it). But it turns out, he knows an engineer actually /tested/ this effect in reality and proved nothing happened.

It's then they find out /HE/ was the engineer that tested it, and then they straight up ask him if Engineering is a hobby and he wants to be a captain, or if he's being forced into Command school when he wants to be an Engineer. Turns out, it's the latter, his family was pushing him for the prestigious spot, but he just wants to work with machines. So they 'flunk' him for 'cheating', and as a consolation prize he gets to go to Engineering school. He thanks the admiral, shakes his hand, and goes on his merry way to become the Scotty we know and love.

Your version is correct, but its good to include this detail. It was a very "rational" approach when he talks to them, admits to what he wants, and they come to a mutual understanding that benefits all parties... rather than just have one side 'trick' the other.
