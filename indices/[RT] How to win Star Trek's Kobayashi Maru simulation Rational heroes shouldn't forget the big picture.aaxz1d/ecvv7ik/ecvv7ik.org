    >Sulu is the only one who chooses correctly

    >Not depicted on film are the possible consequences of rejecting the rescue appeal. These are discussed at length in novels and video games and include mutiny of the crew over being asked to abandon civilians to die; violations of Starfleet policy regarding rendering of aid to distressed vessels; Klingon incursion into Federation territory responding to "provocation" by the Kobayashi Maru; or the weight on the cadet's conscience caused by refusing to render aid.

    Well no, Sulu is the only one who chooses incorrectly, he saves himself but the ship mutinies and would be discharged from service once he returned to base.

  So the best possible outcome. One ship and crew and one man's career weighed against two ships at least and crews and the start of another war that could cost billions of lives on both sides.
