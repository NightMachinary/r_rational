I'd say Gero himself is similar, but he's pre-destruction of the Red Ribbon, which means he's still a pretty different person, less extreme. The desire for revenge is what pushed him completely off the edge. The Red Ribbon is less Neutral Evil, more True Neutral. Overall, they're not as villainous as in canon, they just don't care about anything other than their bottom line; they do however have some more or less principled members within their ranks. Though no one would be a beacon of morality, at the very least they're people who grew up in pretty violent environments and ended up becoming soldiers of fortune, so they will have a pretty hard outlook on life. Loyalty to their superiors and comrades trumps loyalty to any specific state or legal system any time.

In addition, I'm changing a bit how the very principles upon which androids function work. I'm making the critical quantity not the sheer amount of energy available but the energy output that the body can channel (this is somehow consistent with canon: #17 and #18 are said to possess "infinite energy" reactors, but still, their strength is not infinite). #17 and #18 were seemingly not ki-based in canon, as their energy could not be sensed. This is not possible in OWP, as in, there is no non-spiritual technology that can possibly produce those levels of power in such a small frame as a human body is without destroying itself. Ki is the only way to reinforce things to that degree, and virtually infinitely. Therefore, if androids were not detectable by scouter in OWP, it would be just because they're optimised to not leak out any spiritual energy or otherwise shielded, /not/ because they literally operate on purely biomechanical principles.

So I'm inclined to say that building an android as powerful as Frieza would require time and room to study someone as powerful as Frieza, at the very least. This doesn't even necessarily disagree with canon: it could very well be that #17 and #18 were at least partially the result of Gero acquiring data from Frieza and Cold when they landed on Earth. We know for sure Cell was only that strong thanks to Frieza's cells, as well as the Saiyans'. In general, Gero's skill to build androids will be limited by the data he can get his hands on, which nerfs him to the point of being simply reactive, as it'd be almost impossible to pre-emptively build androids stronger than whatever threat will appear next (not to mention, at high power levels, any mistakes with handling the energies involved could literally cause the entire Earth to go kaboom).
