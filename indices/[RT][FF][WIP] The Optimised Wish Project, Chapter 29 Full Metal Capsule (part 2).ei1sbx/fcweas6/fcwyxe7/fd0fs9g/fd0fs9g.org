I'm not sure, I haven't finished it, it's very long though. It's a sort of deconstruction/reconstruction of the Wuxia genre with more of a cyberpunk theming rather than feudal china. There is a lot of the classic obsessive training and fight scenes but there's a lot more of worldbuilding, a bit of applied philosophy and a bunch of less classic contests like a small arc with the villain trying to scam the protagonist out of a patent on a niche support item (that's suspiciously like a scouter). A bit that I particularly liked is when the MC tags along with a preeminent Soul Search Squad as they look for any spirits left behind after a disaster and it goes over how they search for traces, what makes people more or less likely to remain as a spirit, how they build a body for a dead spirit and so on. In this case the spirit was very weak and faded so they needed to build a smaller temporary body for the spirit until it regains strength. Lots of stuff like that.
