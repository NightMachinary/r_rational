I can already imagine how the artificial cybouningendroids could be legitimately concerning 10-15 years later, not that I have a clue how likely that outcome is in this story.

Going by the "give Sauron the Death-Star" principal, I'm wondering how the wider galaxy is going to deal with kitech, given how big a deal the differences to Earth were in canon. Bulma basically invented the foundations of Freeza / Tuffle battlefield equipment with just a year of RnD. Looking forward to 2024, when either this fic or the Apollo reboot might plausibly make it to space. :)

While I consider it rather low in probability, it occurs to me that an ambush implicates a spy, and there were multiple references to Dr. Gero trying to spy on everything Bulma did. I don't think I'd go over 30% on Gero being either a spy, or unwitting cover for some other spy, though.
