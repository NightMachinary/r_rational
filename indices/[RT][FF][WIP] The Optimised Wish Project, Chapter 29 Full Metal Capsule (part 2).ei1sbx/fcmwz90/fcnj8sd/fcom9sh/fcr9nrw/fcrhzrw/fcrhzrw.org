I'll say that Gero's androids in canon gave me quite a lot of trouble, because if he could develop those even faster, he'd basically solve the entire plot before it started. Frieza in particular would not stand a chance. I'm not too keen on that happening, and I think that technological power-ups should be more gradual than that. These easy gains were just the low-hanging fruit. I have a plan on how to lay this out but the only thing I can say is, I don't think even in its entirety this story is going to span more than 10 years (in-universe). Just like it happened in HPMOR, I plan on speeding up the time frame of the events, though not as drastically.

I can also tell you that future threats will all undergo some kind of level up, yes. Some will be stronger, and some will be smarter. 'nuff said.
