Well. Didn't you know? Fiction is just the human race expressing it's psychic potential to tune in to other worlds, limited by the authors psychic skill. Most fiction sticks pretty close to spectrum close to our world as it's easier to home in on.

Good quality rat fic? Well, they've just seriously honed their ability to hit worlds very similar to ours in their targeted requirements.

And of course inter dimensional psychics are only interested in seeing the entertaining bits!
